But even during the biggest economic crisis in living memory, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/us-election-2020-date-when-how-work-what-key-swing-states/\">Americans back his captaining of the US economy</url>.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump's economy approval rating remains in positive territory at +8, according to YouGov. More concerning still for Camp Biden is that just 34pc of Americans believe the economy would get better under his presidency. A total of 39pc fear it would get worse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If \"the economy, stupid\" mantra still holds strong, November's election could be tighter than <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/us-election-2020-date-when-how-work-what-key-swing-states/\">Biden's current nine-point lead</url> suggests. Can the former vice president get voters to back Bidenomics?</p><p>Despite his reputation as a moderate who can reach across the aisle, Biden's platform is seen by experts as the most extreme proposed by a Democratic presidential challenger in decades. The candidate has been forced to respnod as his whole party shifted leftwards.</p><p>\"If we compare to previous Democratic plans or Trump's plan, it is a pretty radical change,\" says Stephen Gallagher, US economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.</p><p>\"But if we compare to the offering of the other Democratic candidates, it is more moderate compared to Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren or even <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/us-election-2020-date-when-how-work-what-key-swing-states/\">Kamala Harris</url>.\"</p><p>There was a fairly serious risk that the shift would have been even more crashing had the man Trump derides as \"Sleepy Joe\" not come out on top in the primaries, Gallagher says.</p><p>Four years of Trump have pushed the Democratic Party further left as the country becomes increasingly polarized. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/us-election-2020-date-when-how-work-what-key-swing-states/\">Biden has followed his party</url>, being forced into a number of key pledges to curry favour with left-wing Democrats who have grown in stature.</p><p>The field of candidates in this year's Democratic primaries have responded to the popularity of the party's leftists, such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/us-election-2020-date-when-how-work-what-key-swing-states/\">firebrand socialist Bernie Sanders</url> and liberal policy wonk Elizabeth Warren. Ultimately Democratic voters opted for a candidate who they believe is best-placed to defeat Trump-electability was a top concern, polling suggests-but the race has left its mark on Biden's platform.</p><p>Perhaps most important for the economy has been the former vice president's promise to do \"whatever it takes\" to tackle Covid-19.</p><p>\"I would shut it down. I would listen to the scientists,\" he said last month. \"In order to keep the country running and moving, and the economy growing, and people employed, you have to fix the virus.\"</p><p>States rather than the president ultimately have the power to shut down and reopen their economies, as Trump has found to his frustration. But a new Oval Office stance on the virus could still be significant for the economy.</p><p>Beyond Covid, Biden has a number of leftist policies he claims will help America \"build back better\".</p><p>He wants to almost double the federal minimum wage to $15 (\u00a311.27) an hour, up from $7.25. Many states already have a higher minimum wage but Biden is seeking to bring the US closer to pay floors seen elsewhere. The US has one of the lowest minimum wages compared to median and average pay among developed countries, lagging behind the UK, Australia, France, Germany, Spain and Japan.</p><p>\"It's going to hurt more rural populations where the minimum wage is not nearly that high and it would be an abrupt change,\" says Gallagher.</p><p>\"For New York City, Los Angeles or Chicago it's probably not as radical.\"</p><p>Workers will also be bolstered by his plans to make it easier to organise unions and collectively bargain, although some voters are likely to fear this will hit the country's famously dynamic labour market. He wants universal paid sick days and 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, while social security payments will be $200 higher per month.</p><p>Biden has promised to create 5m new jobs in manufacturing and innovation and has vowed to spend $2 trillion over four years on clean energy infrastructure, aiming for a carbon-zero power industry by 2035. He has promised no new taxes on those earning less than $400,000, while Trump's corporate tax cuts will be partially reversed. The corporate tax rate will rise from 21pc to 28pc.</p><p>\"Basically it's going to be the wealthy that are going to be paying the tax rises and you get more income for the poorer people,\" says James Knightley, ING chief international economist.</p><p>\"That could be reminiscent of the late Nineties, when it actually generated a pretty good economy, because you get the big investment projects coming through like green energy and you get lower income households feeling more of the benefit.\"</p><p>Trade policy is likely to become less combative while experts say the tech titans could face a clampdown amid rising competition worries.</p><p>Biden has not made tech regulation a key plank of his campaign as rivals such as Warren did, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/us-election-2020-date-when-how-work-what-key-swing-states/\">but the Democratic party has decisively shifted towards stricter rules on Silicon Valley behemoths</url>.</p><p>Sam McGowan of Beacon Policy Advisors, a research firm focused on Washington, says a Biden administration is likely to reflect a growing scepticism of Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"Going after tech companies is a major priority for the progressives,\" he says.</p><p>\"If Biden wins, there's going to be a lot of influences out there that are going to shape the kinds of the policy that they're gonna put in place. And I really think the national conversation is gonna shift towards more stringent enforcement.\"</p><p>McGowan says that even if a Biden administration does not aim to break up Big Tech, it will certainly make predatory acquisitions harder and enforce competition. This could be good for the economy by helping start-ups to thrive.</p><p>However, Biden's left-leaning agenda faces key hurdles. The 77-year old needs to win big against Trump to push through the most radical parts of his agenda.</p><p>The Democrats currently hold the House of Representatives but the other half of Congress, the Senate, is controlled by the Republicans. Many of Biden's economic plans would be scuppered unless the Democrats win the three or more seats needed to take the Senate.</p><p>\"One question is whether he might be limited by Congressional opposition. The battle for Senate control looks tight,\" says Philip Shaw, Investec economist.</p><p>Knightley says: \"If Biden gets a clean sweep and the Democrats win the House and Senate, we are going to see a very significant shift in policy. Much more taxation, more spending and importantly more regulation of energy, financial services and big tech.\"</p><p>His ambitions could also be limited by the state of public finances he inherits. Trump was running high deficits at close to 5pc even before Covid struck and sent public debt soaring across the world.</p><p>\"When we get in, the pantry is going to be bare,\" warned Ted Kaufman, a leading figure in Biden's transition team.</p><p>\"When you see what Trump's done to the deficit... forget about Covid-19, all the deficits that he built with the incredible tax cuts. So we're going to be limited.\"</p><p>Economists also argue that his platform could be harmful for the economy in the longer term.</p><p>Gallagher says Biden's policies would slow the economy or limit its potential, despite rising in popularity among voters.</p><p>\"It's not until the economy slows that these voters will abandon their support for all these changes,\" he says, highlighting Biden's healthcare and energy plans.</p><p>Shaw adds that Biden's tax pledges could have a significant impact on investor confidence, while the roaring recovery on the US stock market could be derailed by a big antitrust crackdown.</p><p>Biden has framed the 2020 election as a \"battle for the soul of the nation\". His plans would be transformative for the world's largest economy-but polling suggests Americans may be reluctant to give up on Trump's vision just yet. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-65600014</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60R4-4FH1-F021-64DR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1300\"/><timeReceived>1:03 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 31, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The petition will be sent to millions of supporters on its email and text message lists and through social media, including Facebook, imploring them to sign the letter. The campaign will also release a video this week to be shared across social media to explain the issue.</p><p>\u201cReal changes to Facebook\u2019s policies for their platform and how they enforce them are necessary to protect against a repeat of the role that disinformation played in the 2016 election and that continues to threaten our democracy today,\u201d said Bill Russo, a spokesman for the Biden campaign.</p><p>The move puts the Biden camp in the center of a raging debate about the role and responsibility of tech platforms. Civil rights leaders, Democratic lawmakers and many of Facebook\u2019s own employees say that big tech companies have a responsibility to prevent false and hateful information from being shared widely.</p><p>But conservatives, including Mr. Trump, accuse social media companies that have tightened their speech policies, like Twitter and Snap, of political bias. Two weeks ago, after Twitter<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/technology/twitter-trump-mail-in-ballots.html\">attached fact-checking notices</url> to two of the president\u2019s tweets that made false claims about voter fraud, Mr. Trump signed an executive order that would make it easier for federal regulators to argue that the companies are suppressing free speech.</p><p>The Biden team\u2019s offensive also intensifies pressure on Facebook, which faced a public backlash last week after it did nothing about inflammatory posts by Mr. Trump. Employees resigned, hundreds participated in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/technology/twitter-trump-mail-in-ballots.html\">virtual walkout</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/technology/twitter-trump-mail-in-ballots.html\">advertisers</url> canceled their accounts, and nonprofits in Washington <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/technology/twitter-trump-mail-in-ballots.html\">ceased sponsorships</url> from the company.</p><p>The criticism poses one of most serious challenges to the leadership of Mr. Zuckerberg since he helped start the company 15 years ago. But faced with opposition in the past, the 36-year-old\u2019s instinct has been to<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/technology/twitter-trump-mail-in-ballots.html\">dig in his heels</url>. Mr. Zuckerberg feels strongly that his platform should be neutral and believes the debate on speech is about preserving a diversity of ideas, even if those ideas are false or harmful.</p><p>\u201cWe live in a democracy, where the elected officials decide the rules around campaigns,\u201d Andy Stone, a spokesman for Facebook, said on Thursday. \u201cTwo weeks ago the president of the United States issued an executive order directing federal agencies to prevent social media sites from engaging in activities like fact-checking political statements.</p><p>\u201cThis week, the Democratic candidate for president started a petition calling on us to do the exact opposite. Just as they have done with broadcast networks \u2014 where the U.S. government prohibits rejecting politicians\u2019 campaign ads \u2014 the people\u2019s elected representatives should set the rules, and we will follow them. There is an election coming in November and we will protect political speech, even when we strongly disagree with it.\u201d</p><p>Tim Murtaugh, the director of communications for Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign, said, \u201cThe American people can think for themselves. They don\u2019t want big tech companies telling them how to think.\u201d</p><p>Joe Biden has been buoyed in recent weeks by new financial and online support. His campaign has had a surge in fund-raising, and it has collected 1.2 million more email signatures in the past seven days. Numerous political polls have shown him gaining ground on Mr. Trump.</p><p>Even though he plans to attack Facebook, Mr. Biden is increasingly turning to the site to reach voters with ads. In recent days, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/technology/twitter-trump-mail-in-ballots.html\">he spent $5 million in advertising on Facebook</url>, surging past political ad spending by Mr. Trump, who has dominated Facebook throughout the campaign season.</p><p>\u201cBiden is doing the right thing by pushing the platform to be more ethical and by not walking away from it, which is not realistic,\u201d said Erik Smith, a former Democratic strategist and co-founder of Seven Letter, a crisis communications firm. \u201cBut he\u2019s running a race against an opponent who has a 10-mile head start on Facebook.\u201d</p><p>The open letter being sent on Thursday will say that \u201cTrump and his allies have used Facebook to spread fear and misleading information about voting, attempting to compromise the means of holding power to account: our voices and our ballot boxes.\u201d</p><p>It calls on the company to take several steps to limit misinformation and hateful language on the site, including making clear rules \u201cthat prohibit threatening behavior and lies about how to participate in the election.\u201d</p><p>The video criticizing Facebook will be narrated by Mr. Biden\u2019s deputy campaign director, Kate Bedingfield. It will warn that Facebook\u2019s inaction toward Mr. Trump threatens the election and puts Americans in harm\u2019s way. The goal is to publicly pressure Facebook\u2019s leadership to restrict misinformation by politicians and to fact-check political ads ahead of the November election.</p><p>The tensions between the Biden campaign and Facebook began last October, in the heat of Mr. Trump\u2019s impeachment battle. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/technology/twitter-trump-mail-in-ballots.html\">The Trump campaign released ads on Facebook</url>that falsely claimed that Mr. Biden offered to bribe Ukrainian officials to drop an investigation into his son. The claims in the video ads were not substantiated, and television networks, including CNN, declined to run the ads.</p><p>The campaign complained to Facebook and demanded that the videos, which were viewed and shared millions of times, be removed. But the company said the videos didn\u2019t clearly violate its policies against misinformation and that comments by politicians and their campaigns, even if false, were newsworthy and important for public discourse.</p><p>Mr. Zuckerberg later that month defended that decision in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/technology/twitter-trump-mail-in-ballots.html\">a speech at Georgetown University</url>, arguing that he believed political speech did not need to be fact-checked or moderated by the company because comments by political figures were deeply scrutinized by the public.</p><p>In January, in an interview with The New York Times\u2019s editorial board, Mr. Biden criticized Mr. Zuckerberg personally.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019ve never been a big Zuckerberg fan,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cI think he\u2019s a real problem.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Biden also called for the end of the legal shield Mr. Trump targeted recently in his executive order. The vice president said Facebook\u2019s inaction demonstrated the need to revoke the law, known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields them from most liability for the content they host.</p><p>Behind the scenes, the campaign had continued to negotiate with top Facebook executives and lobbyists, according to letters obtained by The Times. In April, senior campaign officials wrote Brian Rice, the top Democratic lobbyist for Facebook, with proposals to improve fact-checking ahead of the election. The campaign called for Facebook to fact check new political ads two weeks ahead of the Nov. 3 election, and to restrict campaigns and candidates from sharing content already deemed false by third-party fact checkers.</p><p>On May 26, the campaign manager, Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon, wrote a letter to Mr. Zuckerberg to again push for changes to political speech policies and noted that often content by super PACs is checked only days after it has been posted and gone viral, even though it contains misinformation. Mr. Zuckerberg didn\u2019t respond, though Facebook did.</p><p>The campaign decided to take its fight public after Mr. Trump\u2019s posts in recent days. He falsely claimed that mail-in ballots would lead to voter fraud. And his warning that \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d startled people on the campaign.</p><p>\u201cYou seem to carve out an exception for Donald Trump that permits him to abuse your platform because he is the president,\u201d Ms. Dillon wrote in a separate letter on June 5 to Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global policy and communications. \u201cBut it is surely clear that precisely because Donald Trump is the president, these abuses take on major significance.\u201d</p><p>PHOTO: Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief, has said he will take a handsoff approach toward misleading or harmful political posts.

The S&amp;P 500 declined 2.8% yesterday after the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points in an attempt to underpin the economy during the fallout from the new coronavirus. The decline left the U.S. stock index more than 11% down since Feb. 19.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The FTSE 100 and Euro Stoxx 600 gained 1.4% and 2%, respectively, as the Fed move added pressure on the Bank of England and European Central Bank for an emergency rate cut. The ECB reportedly had a conference call yesterday to talk about the coronavirus, but monetary policy was not discussed.</p><p>Italy's death toll and its number of confirmed coronavirus cases surpassed that of Iran, making the European nation the worst-affected country outside Asia.

I'm Ana Cabrera in New York and you are live in the \"CNN Newsroom.\" Let me take you to the south on this Sunday for the second straight day the center of the Democratic universe is in Austin, Texas, where the size and diversity of the party's presidential field is on full display at the South by Southwest Festival.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CNN political senior analyst, Mark Preston, is in Austin, where three of those hopefuls will soon take part in CNN's town halls tonight. And here in New York with me is Patrick Healy, politics editor for \"The New York Times.\" Mark, you have heard from a number of the 2020 candidates there this weekend. Who's generating the most buzz?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARK PRESTON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAIL ANALYST: Well, I think the most news is no news that has come out of South by Southwest so far this weekend, Ana, and that is Beto O'Rourke. Beto O'Rourke, who appeared at a screening of a documentary that chronicled his run for the U.S. Senate showed up, appeared on stage.</p><p>A lot of people thought that they would hear him say that I've decided to run for president. He did not say that. He was very coy about it but at the same time that he was on stage, his campaign was sending out an e-mail, a list-building e-mail. So, that is where we are as we come into this evening.</p><p>As you said there are three candidates that we're going to hear from tonight, Tulsi Gabbard, John Delaney and Peter Buttigieg. These are three young candidates, these are three folks who are all trying to cut a path right now in this battle for the Democratic nomination.</p><p>They all bring something a little bit different and they are all unique in their own ways. Tulsi Gabbard served overseas in a war zone, as did Pete Buttigieg. You also have John Delaney. He was once one of the wealthiest members of Congress. More of a modern (ph), a very successful businessman. So we'll hear from them tonight starting at 7:00 eastern. It will be an interesting conversation.</p><p>CABRERA: And take a look at the brand new poll we have this weekend out of Iowa. Only a couple of candidates right now in the double digits there, Biden and Senator Sanders followed by Warren, Harris, O'Rourke, Booker, and Klobuchar. Patrick, based on what we are seeing in this poll and some of the underlying numbers that came out, who should be the most excited and who should be the most concerned?</p><p>PATRICK HEALY, POLITICS EDITOR, NEW YORK TIMES: Yes. It's very interesting for Bernie Sanders particularly because Bernie sanders is the one second in that poll, very close to Joe Biden, but he also lines up in terms of the issues that people in Iowa say they want to vote on, Medicare for all, green new deal, sort of an aggressive approach to raising taxes on wealthy Americans.</p><p>Those are the issues that are kind of aligned with what Bernie Sanders is talking the most about right now. Joe Biden as we know is thinking about the race as \"The Times\" has reported he's pretty committed to getting in --</p><p>CABRERA: 95 percent there, that is what you guys are reporting.</p><p>HEALY: Ninety-five percent to getting in, but as we know, Joe Biden would be occupying more of the moderate lane here being sort of the voice that comes in and says, you know, we need to work within our means financially and that raising taxes, for instance, on the wealthy, you know, could be a hard sell with the Republican-controlled Senate.</p><p>So, I think you're seeing some good news in that poll certainly for Bernie Sanders. Elizabeth Warren has crept up a little bit. Beto O'Rourke has come down a bit, but you're seeing a lot of -- certainly a lot of openness and opportunity there.</p><p>CABRERA: One thing that stood out to me, not as much of a political expert as you, Patrick or Mark, but it is, you know, we're dealing with the most diverse presidential field in modern political history, plus the increasing diversity among Democratic voters, which we've continued to say over and over again, but yet in Iowa that poll shows Joe Biden followed by Bernie Sanders, two older white men. Mark, is there a disconnect?</p><p>PRESTON: I don't think it's necessarily disconnect, but I do think that that Iowa poll really does give us a snapshot of this battle within the Democratic Party. We haven't seen it play out that much until we saw Alexandria Oscasio-Cortez, who when she ran, really put the whole idea of socialism on the table.</p><p>And that's an argument right now in the Democratic Party as Patrick was talking about raising taxes on the wealthy, about Medicare for all, that is where the liberal energy is right now. That is where Bernie Sanders is right now.</p><p>On the other side, you know, as Patrick was noting as well, you have Joe Biden, more of a pragmatist, more of somebody who likes to walk down the middle, who will cut a deal, certainly is liberal but somebody again, who is more pragmatic about things as opposed to aspirational. And that's going to be the big divide for Democrats when they're deciding who to nominate to challenge President Trump in 2020. CABRERA: Patrick, this past week could have been dubbed the weak presidential candidates announced they weren't running. You have at least four -- five if you include Hillary Clinton who told a local affiliate that she wasn't planning to run. We also heard from Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, who is the latest to say I'm not running just this weekend giving a message to those who are running. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP))</p><p>[17:04:59] SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D), OHIO: Our goal is to inform the narrative in the Democratic Party so that Democrats begin to talk more to workers and talk about the dignity of work. A number of candidates have already done that, have been talking about the dignity of work. I predict that the Democratic nominee is the one that talks to workers the best.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: As Brown noted, several of the other candidates, Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar among them have echoed his message. But I'm wondering who do you think so far is best channeling the average worker who may be struggling right now?</p><p>HEALY: That's a good question, Ana. I mean, the sort of the Sherrod Brown announcement was a surprise to a lot of Democrats because the thought was is that he, coming from Ohio, having dealt with sort of the economic depressions in parts of that state, the layoffs that now we are seeing at GM and sort of in the Youngstown area, that he would be able to sort of give voice to that in a way not a lot of other Democrats are.</p><p>I mean, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren with her big-tech policy, sort of talking about Amazon as a monopoly and sort of squeezing out, you know, more independent, smaller businesses. Amy Klobuchar certainly sort of talking about -- sort of the micro economies in the Midwest. They're talking about those issues but no one has broken through at least on the level that Sherrod Brown did.</p><p>CABRERA: That people feel they will only understand.</p><p>HEALY: No, exactly. And I think part of Brown's appeal was that he could go in and sort of credibly talk about issues like manufacturing and even trade, where he's a little bit closer to, frankly, President Trump than he is to some of the Democrats in a way that might resonate with people.</p><p>But you saw a lot of big names getting out of the race this week saying they aren't going to run, which sort of suggests, OK, there is again really opportunity for some people to lay claim to some of those messages.</p><p>CABRERA: All right, guys, stay with me. The president today, launching a fresh fight with Congress over his border wall, demanding billions of additional dollars to pay for it in his 2020 budget proposal. A White House official tells CNN, President Trump will ask lawmakers on Monday for at least $8.6 billion in new wall funds in that proposal.</p><p>And I want to remind you, that is roughly $3 billion more than Trump asked Congress for just a few months ago and lawmakers said no. The standoff led to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history before the president eventually declared a national emergency to try to get the funds.</p><p>Let's bring in CNN's White House correspondent, Boris Sanchez. Boris, where exactly does the president plan to get this money? Where are the funds coming from? Is he having to rob Peter to pay Paul?</p><p>BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well Ana, some critics certainly feel that way. This budget calls for a 5 percent reduction in spending from all federal agencies except those tied to defense. The president actually wants a $35 billion increase in defense spending from last year and he specifically is asking for $8.6 billion in funding for his long-promised border wall.</p><p>It's actually the first time the Trump administration is asking for border wall funding for more than one source. He's asking for $5 billion from Customs and Border Protection and another $3.6 billion from military construction funds over at the Pentagon and asking for an additional $3.6 billion basically to reimburse money that he is spending through his national emergency declaration.</p><p>The president is essentially trying to ask Congress to approve of money that he went around them to spend. Democrats are not very happy about this. Leadership in Congress, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Minority Leader Chuck Schumer put out a joint statement.</p><p>They write this, \"President Trump hurt millions of Americans and caused widespread chaos when he recklessly shut down the government to try to get his expensive and ineffective wall, which he promised would be paid for by Mexico. Congress refused to fund his wall and he was forced to admit defeat and reopen the government. The same thing will repeat itself if he tries this again. We hope he learned his lesson.\"</p><p>So, both sides are gearing up for what will be a nasty fight, one that could potentially lead to a third government shutdown within the Trump presidency, Ana.</p><p>CABRERA: And Boris, the president this weekend also lashing out on a conservative, Republican commentator who recently criticized President Trump's lack of progress on the border wall.</p><p>SANCHEZ: Yes, that's right. Ann Coulter, somebody who was one of President Trump's earliest supporters. Here's what the president tweeted. He writes, \"Wacky nut job Ann Coulter, who still hasn't figured out that despite all odds and an entire Democrat of far left radicals against me, not to mention certain Republicans who are sadly unwilling to fight, I am winning on the border.</p><p>Major sections of wall are being built and renovated with much more to follow shortly. Tens of thousands of illegals are being apprehended, captured at the border and not allowed into our country.\" He's sort of responding to things we have heard from Ann Coulter since the government shutdown when she called President Trump the biggest wimp to ever serve as president of the United States.</p><p>[17:10:03] She was critical of his state of the union address as well. Clearly she feels that he's not doing enough to get the border wall built, something that he promised when he first went down that escalator in June of 2015 and declared that he was running for president, Ana.</p><p>CABRERA: All right, Boris Sanchez in Palm Beach, Florida, thanks. Patrick and Mark are back with us. Now Patrick, is the president's 2020 budget proposal dead on arrival? What is the political strategy behind this move?</p><p>HEALY: It's really going to be tough, Ana. I mean, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi showed the Democrats in both the House the and Senate could remain very unified on no funding for the wall. And there's really no reason, no pressure to believe that they will move off of that. They came away from the shutdown experience. They're like the poll numbers were on their side and that they boxed the president ineffectively.</p><p>Now, the president is going to be ramming up his re-election campaign. He knows that the wall is probably the single biggest promise from 2016 that he has to show that he's either delivering on or going to continue to fight for. So, that is huge for him. I mean, he needs that to be front and center, even if he's tilting at windmills constantly.</p><p>CABRERA: And this number is huge, Mark, $8.6 billion in border wall money. Is this Ann Coulter getting under the president's skin here or could this have been what Senator Lamar Alexander, for example, had in mind when he said he and other Republicans were trying to guide the president or convince him to get the wall money some other way then the emergency declaration?</p><p>PRESTON: Well, given the options, Republicans would rather have the president offer a budget as we expect him to do as it's been leaked out where he asks for the money as opposed to basically going in and demanding the money and taking the money away under emergency declaration.</p><p>This is a political problem for some Republicans especially when they're running in 2020. The president has taken money using this emergency declaration in a very questionable way. Now, he's not going to get the money that he's asked for in this budget. Democrats control the House. They have enough votes in the Senate to try to stop stuff from going through.</p><p>The president is going to make this a campaign issue and really, the irony in all of this is that the president could either win re- election or he can lose re-election perhaps on the one issue of that being the wall. It has so generated so much anger, so much buzz on both sides, it has inflamed those who think that it should be built and it certainly has inflamed those who don't think it should be built. And where I sit rear right now in Austin, Texas, I can tell you that most, if not all of the folks at this gathering, they don't want the wall built. So, it will be interesting as we see over the coming months how the president tries to play this out. But not only is he going to be fighting with Democrats, he'll be fighting with Republicans as well over the next year in this budget.</p><p>CABRERA: Boris mentioned how Democrats are already rejecting this. Go ahead Patrick.</p><p>HEALY: Yes. Just one other point, the -- just about Ann Coulter. I mean, Ann Coulter has been pretty consistent on the wall, reflecting a lot of energy and the base that has wanted some kind of very, you know, intense symbolic -- not just symbolic, but real effort -- physical structure.</p><p>CABRERA: Physical structure. Lock immigration.</p><p>HEALY: It's President Trump who has been flip-flopping on Ann Coulter. I mean, as we remember before the shutdown in December when Ann Coulter started going after him, he got very nervous about that. And he was at one point sort of looking to do a real deal with Democrats on border security.</p><p>And it was Ann Coulter and others certainly on the right and far right, who kind of sort of scared him back into submission. And now him coming out, I mean, that's the thing. When he goes to the nicknames as we all know by this point, someone has gotten under his skin and he's just going to, you know, that kind of cartoonish behavior. But, you know, in his mind, it works. But it does show her getting under his skin and him flip-flopping on that.</p><p>CABRERA: Patrick Healy, Mark Preston, good to have both of you. Thank you on the front lines.</p><p>The final assault on ISIS in Syria has begun and CNN is the only American T.V. network there. Plus, no survivor as a horrific plane crash claims the lives of every passenger and crew member on board. It's the second time in less than six months a brand-new Boeing aircraft has crashed just minutes into the flight. We have details, live in the \"CNN Newsroom.\"</p><p>[17:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CABRERA: We have breaking news now overseas, and you will see this only on CNN. Eastern Syria, mortars, artillery, explosion and nearly nonstop machine gun fire. This town, a small enclave is where the last concentration of ISIS fighters anywhere is now surrounded and were an offer for them to surrender is now off the table.</p><p>Military action to wipe them out has begun and CNN is the only American T.V. network in this area. Our senior international correspondent, Ben Wedeman, has been watching this heavy, heavy fighting for a couple of hours from just a few hundred yards away.</p><p>Ben, there are explosions behind you and tracers crisscrossing the sky. About how many ISIS terrorists are believed to be staging this last stand? Are we really seeing the end of ISIS as a centralized organization?</p><p>BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Ana, as far as the number of ISIS terrorists inside, we simply don't know. From the beginning of this battle going back more than a month, we have heard the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces making estimates that proved wrong time after time.</p><p>A month ago they were telling us that there were 1,500 civilians and 500 ISIS fighters. It turns out as far as the civilians go, it was about 20 times higher than that number and certainly with the fighters, several thousand have already surrendered.</p><p>[17:20:00] We've spoken with some of them but they said there were still many civilians and fighters left inside. So, it's not all together clear. Now, what's interesting is that after about four hours and 15 minutes of fairly heavy bombardment and some return fire, now I'll be able to stand up again, not sit on the ground, it's gone relatively quiet.</p><p>I just see one fire burning in the distance but there are planes overhead. What we've seen in the previous two operations where they were attempting to retake this pocket, the bombing went on all night long and well into the following day. So, it's hard to sit and understand what the situation inside that camp is.</p><p>Now, that encampment is only about half a square mile. What we saw, actually, we were just outside that encampment about an hour before the operation began and already there was an intense exchange of gunfire, a lot of incoming as well from the ISIS sniper position. And now I'm hearing more gunfire from the direction of the encampment. So, this is going to be a long night. Ana?</p><p>CABRERA: Dan, what kind of help are the Syrian forces getting or are they doing this alone?</p><p>WEDEMAN: No, they are definitely not alone, Ana. They're on the ground U.S., British and French Special Forces they are manning artillery positions, mortar positions. In addition to above in the sky, there are U.S., British and French planes flying overhead, bombing the hell out of that little, small sliver of land behind me.</p><p>So, they have quite a lot of help. They are the ones, obviously, the Syrian Democratic Forces are doing the heavy lifting when it comes to the combat, tent-to-tent combat at this point but they definitely have some serious help from the U.S.-led international coalition. Ana?</p><p>CABRERA: Ben, thank you, for putting yourself in such a vulnerable position to be able to report on this for us. We appreciate your work and your crew there on the ground. Stay safe.</p><p>As we stay overseas, enormous tragedy and so many unanswered questions after a commercial airliner crashed in Africa. One hundred and fifty- seven people are dead, everyone on board. The Boeing 737 belonging to Ethiopian Airlines crashed just a few minutes after takeoff. Passengers are from 35 different countries. They're all among those killed from all over Africa, Europe, Asia and the United States.</p><p>Richard Quest joins us now from London. He's our aviation correspondent. Richard, it's far too early to know what caused this crash. It's not even been a full day since it happened, but from what we know so far, this airplane was a Boeing 737 Max 8. It's brand new. The airline CEO says there were no technical red flags ahead of time and it was flown by a senior pilot. At this stage, what do you make of this?</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN AVIATON: That pilot requested to return back to Addis because of technical problems and that was the last it was heard of it. And you have to look at the similarities between this incident and the LionAir 610 flight which fell out the sky last year.</p><p>Now, that was also a brand-new Boeing 737 Max 8. The incident also happened at the very early part of the flight. In that case, 12 minutes, this case six minutes into the flight, and there is (inaudible) and altitude which also -- I can hear some people say, right, well one and one -- Richard say one on one makes three. I'm not.</p><p>I'm just saying that this is the rock the investigators are going to be looking at because it is highly unusual. In fact besides the comet back in Britain in the 1950s, I can't think of another case where a brand-new aircraft has had two major incidents with multiple fatalities so soon after entry into service.</p><p>CABRERA: So, Boeing has got to be freaking out right now?</p><p>QUEST: No, they won't be. They will be doing what Boeing does best, which is going through this methodically, recognizing that there may be a problem. They are sending a team obviously and that they will be waiting until the get the information.</p><p>There maybe telemetry already coming in from the aircraft's computer systems that are being transmitted. They will be looking at the service record. It was a brand new plane so there's almost nothing wrong with it. They will be looking at any previous incidents or had any of the other crew reported problems with sensors, with readings, with computers.</p><p>And then ultimately they will have to wait. They'll have to wait like everybody else for the Ethiopian investigators -- and they're very good at this, by the way, the Ethiopian investigators, and they will bring in the NTSB from the U.S.</p><p>[17:25:00] They will bring in the British. They will bring in Boeing. They will bring in the plane, the engine manufacturers and together they'll find the flight data recorder and work out what happened.</p><p>CABRERA: And so what kind of information might we expect then in the coming hours to help make sense of this horrible crash?</p><p>QUEST: Right. First thing we want to know is any -- what exactly did the pilot say to Addis traffic control when he requested to turnback? Did he give any indication of what was wrong with the aircraft? Secondly, how far are they in advance in finding the data recorders?</p><p>Now, this looks like it was a very serious impact, probably the plane diving out of the sky but those boxes are designed for much greater incidents than this in the sense of forces upon them. So, they will find them. They'll weed them out as it's known.</p><p>And it could be, if they find the boxes today and the boxes aren't damaged particularly badly, then you could be looking by week's end to get a good idea or midweek to weekend next week to get a good idea of what happened or at least the early parameters of what might have happened.</p><p>CABRERA: Well, the images are just so heart breaking. Richard Quest, thanks for that great reporting.</p><p>A new poll has solidified it. Two older Democrats everyone knows are the ones to beat. So how are young contenders making their mark on the 2020 race? Live to the site of tonight's presidential town halls, next. You're live in the \"CNN Newsroom.\"</p><p>[17:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CABRERA: Another busy day for the pack, and it is a pack of 2020 presidential hopefuls. We have a brand-new poll from the key state of Iowa giving us a fresh look where voters stand on these candidates. Former vice president Joe Biden maintaining his lead despite not even officially being in the race.</p><p>And with Biden and Bernie Sanders, the oldest of the candidates are leading right now, there is a growing number of young hopefuls who are looking to break through. CNN senior White House correspondent Jeff Zeleny is in Austin, Texas where three Democrats in the running will be in the spotlight tonight. Jeff, who are the young Democrats to watch?</p><p>JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUS CORRESPONDENT: Well, good evening, Ana. There is a diverse field of Democratic candidates as you said and age is a central part of that diversity. There are two candidates who we'll be hearing from this evening.</p><p>Pete Buttigieg is the mayor of South Bend, Indiana and Tulsi Gabbard, she is a member of Congress. And they have been out there making their case to voters. They are 37 years old. That means should they win, they will become the first millennial president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG, MAYOR (D), SOUTH BEND, INDIANA: Everywhere I go people sometimes, especially here in Iowa, a little too polite to ask the question as to why a 37-year-old mayor thinks he has any business being in a discussion about the highest office in the land.</p><p>ZELENY (voice-over): That's precisely the question facing Pete Buttigieg, the youngest candidate in the presidential race. He's the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, now turning heads as he audaciously eyes at the White House. (on camera): How can you make the argument to be president?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: So, I know you don't expect to hear this from the youngest person in the conversation but my simplest answer is experience. I know there is a more conventional path that involves marinating in Washington for 10 or 20 or 40 years, but I actually think we want Washington to begin looking more like our best-run cities and towns, not the other way around.</p><p>ZELENY (voice-over): He's touting his youth as virtue and his biography filled with a list if firsts.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: The fact that I'm a veteran, that I'm young, that I'm in a same-sex marriage, those are important parts of who I am. But that profile just gets you a look. The real question is once people take that look, who do they see and what do they hear?</p><p>ZELENY (voice-over): Democrats are giving them a look, but there are challenges to be seen as a serious candidate on a crowded stage. He's at the forefront of a new generation of leaders who have little appetite to wait their turn.</p><p>Even Democrats not constitutionally old enough to seek the presidency like Congresswoman Alexandria Oscasio-Cortez, 29, is also influencing the party. On the campaign trail, Buttigieg is not the only millennial in the race.</p><p>REP. TULSI GABBARD (D), HAWAII: I don't know about you guys. When someone tells me to be quiet, I speak up louder.</p><p>ZELENY (voice-over): Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is also 37, and an Iraq veteran, who is building her candidacy around foreign policy.</p><p>GABBARD: That is the change that I seek to bring to this country, of bringing these uniquely American ideals of putting service before self that come from my heart as a soldier.</p><p>ZELENY (voice-over): She's still explaining a 2017 meeting with Syria's president, Bahsar al-Assad.</p><p>GABBARD: I'm deeply sorry.</p><p>ZELENY (voice-over): And has apologized for what she now calls wrong and hurtful statements where she worked for an anti-gay group. Two young congressmen also exploring a White House bid. The 38-year-old Eric Swalwell of California and 48-year-old Seth Moulton of Massachusetts. Highlighting a divide with Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders nearly four decades older. It's become a ready made punch line at least for the younger candidates.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG: I understand the audacity of running for president at my age. Especially because sometimes downstairs I will still get carded when I order a beer.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) ZELENY (on camera): So he will not get carded tonight at this event, Ana. But there is a central theme through a lot of these younger candidates; that is military service. Pete Buttigieg served in Afghanistan, Tulsi Gabbard served in Iraq. That is a central theme we see in new members of Congress as well.</p><p>Now, when you ask mayor Buttigieg about his age, he said look, the constitution has settled that. The age of course is 35 to be president. Of course, at the end of the day that will be voters making that decision in this case. Ana?</p><p>CABRERA: I still think I'm almost 37 and I can't imagine being in a position to run for president. That alone is ambitious and impressive. Jeff Zeleny, thanks for bringing us that reporting.</p><p>[17:35:00] Live tonight from South by Southwest in Austin, Texas, three CNN presidential town halls back to back, former congressman, John Delaney at 7:00, Representative Tulsi Gabbard at 8:00 and Mayor Pete Buttigieg at 9:00. Jake Tapper and Dana Bash moderate. That starts again 7:00 eastern tonight right here on CNN.</p><p>CABRERA: Welcome back. We are uncovering new details this weekend that help connect a Florida massage parlor, the Chinese business community in this country and political influence that might go all the way to the White House.</p><p>This woman in a selfie with President Trump once owned the day spa where NFL owner Robert Kraft was charged with soliciting sex. Now, according to federal records, she runs a company that introduces clients to people close to President Trump for a fee. CNN's Kaylee Hartung is in Jupiter, Florida, outside that now infamous massage parlor. Kaylee, you have been digging on this story the last couple of days. Who is this woman, and is she accused of doing anything illegal?</p><p>[17:40:02] KAYLEE HARTUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Ana, Li or Cindy Yang is not accused of doing anything illegal. She no longer owns this day spa that is at the center of the human trafficking investigation. She's not been charged in relationship to that investigation in any way, but it's her new business that's now raising eyebrows.</p><p>\"The Miami Herald\" reports that she's running this consultant firm based in Florida that promises Chinese investors she can introduce them to U.S. political elite like President Trump and members of his family. So, the spotlight has moved on from that night she spent at the Super Bowl watch party at Mar-a-Lago with President Trump to a paid fund-raiser for Trump in December of 2017 in New York City.</p><p>Now, there are campaign finance laws in this country that govern who can and can't contribute to political campaigns. Well, in the case of that night, Yang did what she advertises she can do. She arranged for a group of Chinese businessmen to attend that event.</p><p>A source who was at that event told \"The Herald\" that Yang identified herself as an official with the National Committee of Asian American Republicans, that's a political action committee based in D.C. that was founded in the summer of 2016. And in reference to this group of Chinese businessmen at the event, she said they're all my guests.</p><p>Now, we've learned that in the days leading up to that event, Yang contributed significant amounts of money to President Trump's funds. She donated more than $5,000 to Trump's campaign fund and more than $23,000 to Trump's victory political action committee. In this country, a foreign national can go to a political fund-raiser of this nature just as long as they don't pay their way into it.</p><p>Only American citizens and permanent residents of this country can contribute to political campaigns. So, if a foreign national were to have paid Yang and reimbursed her for that entrance into this event that would be illegal, Ana. We've reached out to the White House, the RNC, the Trump campaign and Yang, but those efforts have been unsuccessful. Nobody has responded to our request for comment.</p><p>CABRERA: All right. Kaylee Hartung, thank you for the update.</p><p>In the days to come, crucial legal proceedings for several former Trump insiders, the most consequential of course is the second sentencing for Paul Manafort, why it's unlikely to look anything like his last hearing, next in the \"CNN Newsroom.\"</p><p>[17:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CABRERA: Paul Manafort is not out of the woods yet, not by a long shot. The man Trump chose to run his 2016 presidential campaign will be sentenced a second time this week. And this time, Manafort faces a much less sympathetic judge.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson is the one who effectively voided his plea deal when she ruled that Manafort intentionally lied to Robert Mueller despite agreeing to cooperate in his Russia probe. And what did Manafort lie about? His relationship with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian associate who worked with Manafort in Ukraine.</p><p>Prosecutors say Kilimnik has ties to Russian intelligence, an allegation he has denied. Manafort shared polling data with Kilimnik during the 2016 campaign, that's according to a court document filed by Manafort's own lawyers, and he met with Kilimnik again in Madrid after Trump was elected.</p><p>Also Judge Jackson is the one who says Manafort violated his bail, prosecutors telling the court Manafort plotted with Kilimnik to tamper with potential witnesses. A former federal prosecutor named Gene Rossi tells Bloomberg News, \"Judge Ellis, who sentenced Manafort to less than four years behind bars in the first case this past week, may simply have assumed Judge Jackson would impose significant additional time.\"</p><p>And Rossi says, \"That was in part why he went relatively easy on Paul Manafort.\" A lot of legal analysts may agree or disagree but here's the bottom line, Judge Jackson could punish Manafort an additional 10 years in the slammer for his crimes including conspiring to secretly lobby the U.S. on behalf of a pro-Russian Ukrainian government. Also, she gets to decide whether Manaforts serves the sentence she hands down at the same time concurrently with his first one or consecutively. Manafort is almost 70 years old so this could determine whether he spends the rest of his life behind bars.</p><p>Manafort's day of reckoning with Judge Jackson is set to happen on Wednesday. And that brings us to our weekly segment \"Cross-Exam\" with Elie Hoinig. Elie is a former federal and state prosecutor and CNN legal analyst. He's answering your questions about legal news.</p><p>Elie, understandably a lot of the questions this week were about Manafort. You said this is perhaps the biggest blockbuster week of questions that you received, one of them being what is the significance of the 47-month sentence he's already received?</p><p>ELIE HONIG, CNN LEGAL ANALYST: Yes. One of the best parts of doing this is you get to hear directly from viewers. And our viewers were really baffled and angered by this sentence and I think rightly so. I think this was an unjust sentence that we saw from the judge in Virginia.</p><p>Look, the sentencing guideline range, which is advisory, it's not mandatory, was 19 to 24 years. Now, I agree that would have been excessive given all the facts here, but this judge went 15 years below the bottom of that range.</p><p>And I thought (ph) back on the cases I did as a federal prosecutor. I did hundreds of cases, maybe a thousand. I never once had a case other than cooperators, which is a different game -- I never once had a case where a judge went that far below the bottom of the guidelines. That is how rare this was.</p><p>And I think people were angry for two reasons. One, as we said before, Manafort showed such disrespect for the law. He lied, he tampered with witnesses, he didn't even accept responsibility at his own sentencing, yet he got this enormous break.</p><p>And I think the other thing that's bothering people is the proportionality. The fact that so many people often aren't white, wealthy, powerful like him get sentenced to much more time for much less.</p><p>[17:50:03] But he's not out of the woods yet. Like you said, he has got to face Judge Jackson later and people asked, can the prosecutor appeal a low sentence? The answer is yes. Prosecutors can, but it's only done very rarely and I would not expect it here.</p><p>CABRERA: A lot of people are also talking about Michael Cohen and the checks that the president allegedly wrote Cohen, the hush money payments for having an affair or alleged affair with a couple of women trying to cover those up before the election. Here's the viewer question. Why would the president break those payments up into smaller checks?</p><p>HONIG: So the short answer is plausible deniability, meaning it can give a cover story for the president. The big question here is, were these payments reimbursement for the hush money or were they what we're not hearing as the defense retainer fees, meaning the normal fees that a client sometimes pays an attorney to be on call sort of month to month.</p><p>Overall, I think when you look at -- look, imagine if one huge check had been cut. It would be pretty obvious what that was. That's why I think the reason they broke it up was so they could claim, well, this is just an innocent retainer fee.</p><p>But when you look at all the facts, the timing, these payments started right after the hush money payments, the changing stories. Rudy Giuliani even said at one point Trump reimbursed Michael Cohen for these payments so, ultimately, I don't think that cover is going to hold.</p><p>CABRERA: Another question surrounding the investigations in the Southern District of New York, again, separate from Mueller's investigations, and a viewer asked, could Trump and the members of his organization be prosecuted for racketeering?</p><p>HONIG: Sure. So, RICO is the federal racketeering law and it was really pioneered, the use of it, in the '80s by Rudy Giuliani in the Southern District of New York where he used it to go after the mafia, the traditional Italian mob.</p><p>Decades later I used the same tool in the Southern District to also go after the mafia. But here's the thing, RICO is not just for the mafia anymore. In recent years, it's been used against corruption organizations, corrupt governmental entities, and corrupt political organizations. So, you could see it.</p><p>Now, people throw the phrase around, racketeering. What does it mean? It really boils down to you have to show a jury some organizational structure and you have to show the people within that organization committed a series of crimes related to one another and related to the organization.</p><p>So, the downside is it's extra work for the prosecutor but the advantage is, and I've tried RICO cases, you get to really show the jury the full picture, how this organization operated in the broader sense. So, it's a powerful tool and I do think the Southern District, if I had to guess, is giving a hard look at whether the Trump Org. qualifies as a racketeering enterprise.</p><p>CABRERA: Interesting. Elie Honig. Could be a very interesting week ahead. What will you be watching for?</p><p>HONIG: OK, three quick things. First of all, Congress has sent request for information to the White House. The White House has said no dice. Are we going to see Congress take it up to the next level by issuing subpoenas?</p><p>Second question, Judge Jackson, seems like everything is in front of her. She's asked for an answer from Roger Stone about the gag order. Now, it comes out now that Roger Stone has this book coming out where he says some things that probably violate the gag order. He forgot to tell her us about it.</p><p>Judge Jackson says, I want your explanation. This guy is on thin ice and he's just tapping away. He's trying to get thrown in jail. And the third one, the big one I think on everyone's mind is what we opened with, what's Judge Jackson going to do going to do with Paul Manafort? She can sentence him to up to 10 years and I think she's going to sentence him to ten years.</p><p>And I think she's going to sentence him to 10 years. I think she's going to run it concurrently, meaning it's not going to be on top of the four and a half years, but I think ultimately, Manafort's sentence when all is said and done is going to end up at 10 years and I think Judge Jackson is going to be the one to bring the hammer down.</p><p>CABRERA: All right. Elie Honig, as always, thank you.</p><p>HONIG: Thanks Ana.</p><p>CABRERA: And of course, if you have your own questions you want Elie to answer check out his \"Cross-Exam\" column at cnn.com/opinion.</p><p>OK, 2020 hopeful Elizabeth Warren, yet again, defending her aggressive push to break up tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Facebook. Why her proposal may be a tough one for her party to embrace. You're live in the \"CNN Newsroom.\"</p><p>[17:55:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CABRERA: This week, Democratic presidential hopeful elizabeth warren making waves from Washington to Silicon Valley. She's proposing an aggressive plan to break up major tech giants including Facebook, Amazon, Google. She was pressed on this today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED O'KEEFE, CBS NEWS HOST: Let me just get this clear. If you had your way, Facebook would have to sell off Instagram. Amazon would have to sell off Whole Foods.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS: All those little businesses that they're running, competing businesses. Yes.</p><p>O'KEEFE: Who is the federal government to tell these companies they have to do that?</p><p>WARREN: There's antitrust law that's been around more than 100 years and the federal government has done this many times, for example, broke up Standard Oil, broke up the great monopolies of the late 19th century and early 20th century. And the reason for that is to that we can keep a competitive economy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA: I asked CNN's global economic analyst, Rana Foroohar, what she makes of Warren's proposal. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CABRERA: Rana, I know you're writing a book on these big tech companies. What do you make of her idea to break them up?</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST: You know, it's actually a very elegant way, what she just described. It is like you own the marketplace and you can play in the marketplace. That's the problem with the big tech companies, Amazon, Google, Facebook.</p><p>There are privacy issues then there are competition issues. And I think what's interesting about her proposal, is it knits together some of those things and it says, look, we need to make sure that we're not living in a rigged game where not just people, but individual, small companies feel like they can't come into the marketplace and compete with these bigger players because that's bad for the overall economy.</p><p>I think it's very brave that she's taking on this issue and it's going to be a tough one for the Democrats because Democrats get a lot of money from the Silicon Valley.</p><p>CABRERA: Will this have a big impact on the economy at large?</p><p>FOROOHAR: You know, I think that over the longer term, if we actually regulate some of the biggest companies more tightly, it will be good for the economy. And if you look back say, 20 years ago, which is when we had the last big tech antitrust case, that was the Microsoft case, just the threat of that regulation actually allowed companies like Google to be born. There was more after an open marketplace and I think that that's what we'll see again.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[18:00:00] CABRERA: You are live in the \"CNN Newsroom.\" I'm Ana Cabrera in New York.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019031004CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMB-9KJ1-JB20-G2G9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7035\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 10, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NEW YORK GIANTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

I'm Ana Cabrera in New York and you are live in the \"CNNNewsroom.\"  Let me take you to the south on this Sunday for the secondstraight day the center of the Democratic universe is in Austin,Texas, where the size and diversity of the party's presidential fieldis on full display at the South by Southwest Festival.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CNN political senior analyst, Mark Preston, is in Austin, where threeof those hopefuls will soon take part in CNN's town halls tonight. Andhere in New York with me is Patrick Healy, politics editor for \"TheNew York Times.\" Mark, you have heard from a number of the 2020candidates there this weekend. Who's generating the most buzz?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARK PRESTON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAIL ANALYST:  Well, I think the mostnews is no news that has come out of South by Southwest so far thisweekend, Ana, and that is Beto O'Rourke. Beto O'Rourke, who appearedat a screening of a documentary that chronicled his run for the U.S.Senate showed up, appeared on stage.</p><p>A lot of people thought that they would hear him say that I've decidedto run for president. He did not say that. He was very coy about itbut at the same time that he was on stage, his campaign was sendingout an e-mail, a list-building e-mail. So, that is where we are as wecome into this evening.</p><p>As you said there are three candidates that we're going to hear fromtonight, Tulsi Gabbard, John Delaney and Peter Buttigieg. These arethree young candidates, these are three folks who are all trying tocut a path right now in this battle for the Democratic nomination.</p><p>They all bring something a little bit different and they are allunique in their own ways. Tulsi Gabbard served overseas in a war zone,as did Pete Buttigieg. You also have John Delaney. He was once one ofthe wealthiest members of Congress. More of a modern (ph), a verysuccessful businessman. So we'll hear from them tonight starting at7:00 eastern. It will be an interesting conversation.</p><p>CABRERA:  And take a look at the brand new poll we have this weekendout of Iowa. Only a couple of candidates right now in the doubledigits there, Biden and Senator Sanders followed by Warren, Harris,O'Rourke, Booker, and Klobuchar. Patrick, based on what we are seeingin this poll and some of the underlying numbers that came out, whoshould be the most excited and who should be the most concerned?</p><p>PATRICK HEALY, POLITICS EDITOR, NEW YORK TIMES:  Yes. It's veryinteresting for Bernie Sanders particularly because Bernie sanders isthe one second in that poll, very close to Joe Biden, but he alsolines up in terms of the issues that people in Iowa say they want tovote on, Medicare for all, green new deal, sort of an aggressiveapproach to raising taxes on wealthy Americans.</p><p>Those are the issues that are kind of aligned with what Bernie Sandersis talking the most about right now. Joe Biden as we know is thinkingabout the race as \"The Times\" has reported he's pretty committed togetting in --</p><p>CABRERA:  95 percent there, that is what you guys are reporting.</p><p>HEALY:  Ninety-five percent to getting in, but as we know, Joe Bidenwould be occupying more of the moderate lane here being sort of thevoice that comes in and says, you know, we need to work within ourmeans financially and that raising taxes, for instance, on thewealthy, you know, could be a hard sell with the Republican-controlledSenate.</p><p>So, I think you're seeing some good news in that poll certainly forBernie Sanders. Elizabeth Warren has crept up a little bit. BetoO'Rourke has come down a bit, but you're seeing a lot of -- certainlya lot of openness and opportunity there.</p><p>CABRERA:  One thing that stood out to me, not as much of a politicalexpert as you, Patrick or Mark, but it is, you know, we're dealingwith the most diverse presidential field in modern political history,plus the increasing diversity among Democratic voters, which we'vecontinued to say over and over again, but yet in Iowa that poll showsJoe Biden followed by Bernie Sanders, two older white men. Mark, isthere a disconnect?</p><p>PRESTON:  I don't think it's necessarily disconnect, but I do thinkthat that Iowa poll really does give us a snapshot of this battlewithin the Democratic Party. We haven't seen it play out that muchuntil we saw Alexandria Oscasio-Cortez, who when she ran, really putthe whole idea of socialism on the table.</p><p>And that's an argument right now in the Democratic Party as Patrickwas talking about raising taxes on the wealthy, about Medicare forall, that is where the liberal energy is right now. That is whereBernie Sanders is right now.</p><p>On the other side, you know, as Patrick was noting as well, you haveJoe Biden, more of a pragmatist, more of somebody who likes to walkdown the middle, who will cut a deal, certainly is liberal butsomebody again, who is more pragmatic about things as opposed toaspirational. And that's going to be the big divide for Democrats whenthey're deciding who to nominate to challenge President Trump in 2020. CABRERA:  Patrick, this past week could have been dubbed the weakpresidential candidates announced they weren't running. You have atleast four -- five if you include Hillary Clinton who told a localaffiliate that she wasn't planning to run. We also heard from OhioSenator Sherrod Brown, who is the latest to say I'm not running justthis weekend giving a message to those who are running. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP))</p><p>[17:04:59] SEN. SHERROD BROWN (D), OHIO:  Our goal is to inform thenarrative in the Democratic Party so that Democrats begin to talk moreto workers and talk about the dignity of work. A number of candidateshave already done that, have been talking about the dignity of work. Ipredict that the Democratic nominee is the one that talks to workersthe best.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA:  As Brown noted, several of the other candidates, CoryBooker, Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar among them have echoed hismessage. But I'm wondering who do you think so far is best channelingthe average worker who may be struggling right now?</p><p>HEALY:  That's a good question, Ana. I mean, the sort of the SherrodBrown announcement was a surprise to a lot of Democrats because thethought was is that he, coming from Ohio, having dealt with sort ofthe economic depressions in parts of that state, the layoffs that nowwe are seeing at GM and sort of in the Youngstown area, that he wouldbe able to sort of give voice to that in a way not a lot of otherDemocrats are.</p><p>I mean, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren with her big-tech policy,sort of talking about Amazon as a monopoly and sort of squeezing out,you know, more independent, smaller businesses. Amy Klobucharcertainly sort of talking about -- sort of the micro economies in theMidwest. They're talking about those issues but no one has brokenthrough at least on the level that Sherrod Brown did.</p><p>CABRERA:  That people feel they will only understand.</p><p>HEALY:  No, exactly. And I think part of Brown's appeal was that hecould go in and sort of credibly talk about issues like manufacturingand even trade, where he's a little bit closer to, frankly, PresidentTrump than he is to some of the Democrats in a way that might resonatewith people.</p><p>But you saw a lot of big names getting out of the race this weeksaying they aren't going to run, which sort of suggests, OK, there isagain really opportunity for some people to lay claim to some of thosemessages.</p><p>CABRERA:  All right, guys, stay with me. The president today,launching a fresh fight with Congress over his border wall, demandingbillions of additional dollars to pay for it in his 2020 budgetproposal. A White House official tells CNN, President Trump will asklawmakers on Monday for at least $8.6 billion in new wall funds inthat proposal.</p><p>And I want to remind you, that is roughly $3 billion more than Trumpasked Congress for just a few months ago and lawmakers said no. Thestandoff led to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history beforethe president eventually declared a national emergency to try to getthe funds.</p><p>Let's bring in CNN's White House correspondent, Boris Sanchez. Boris,where exactly does the president plan to get this money? Where are thefunds coming from? Is he having to rob Peter to pay Paul?</p><p>BORIS SANCHEZ, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Well Ana, some criticscertainly feel that way. This budget calls for a 5 percent reductionin spending from all federal agencies except those tied to defense.The president actually wants a $35 billion increase in defensespending from last year and he specifically is asking for $8.6 billionin funding for his long-promised border wall.</p><p>It's actually the first time the Trump administration is asking forborder wall funding for more than one source. He's asking for $5billion from Customs and Border Protection and another $3.6 billionfrom military construction funds over at the Pentagon and asking foran additional $3.6 billion basically to reimburse money that he isspending through his national emergency declaration.</p><p>The president is essentially trying to ask Congress to approve ofmoney that he went around them to spend. Democrats are not very happyabout this. Leadership in Congress, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and theMinority Leader Chuck Schumer put out a joint statement.</p><p>They write this, \"President Trump hurt millions of Americans andcaused widespread chaos when he recklessly shut down the government totry to get his expensive and ineffective wall, which he promised wouldbe paid for by Mexico. Congress refused to fund his wall and he wasforced to admit defeat and reopen the government. The same thing willrepeat itself if he tries this again. We hope he learned his lesson.\"</p><p>So, both sides are gearing up for what will be a nasty fight, one thatcould potentially lead to a third government shutdown within the Trumppresidency, Ana.</p><p>CABRERA:  And Boris, the president this weekend also lashing out on aconservative, Republican commentator who recently criticized PresidentTrump's lack of progress on the border wall.</p><p>SANCHEZ:  Yes, that's right. Ann Coulter, somebody who was one ofPresident Trump's earliest supporters. Here's what the presidenttweeted. He writes, \"Wacky nut job Ann Coulter, who still hasn'tfigured out that despite all odds and an entire Democrat of far leftradicals against me, not to mention certain Republicans who are sadlyunwilling to fight, I am winning on the border.</p><p>Major sections of wall are being built and renovated with much more tofollow shortly. Tens of thousands of illegals are being apprehended,captured at the border and not allowed into our country.\"He's sort of responding to things we have heard from Ann Coulter sincethe government shutdown when she called President Trump the biggestwimp to ever serve as president of the United States.</p><p>[17:10:03] She was critical of his state of the union address as well.Clearly she feels that he's not doing enough to get the border wallbuilt, something that he promised when he first went down thatescalator in June of 2015 and declared that he was running forpresident, Ana.</p><p>CABRERA:  All right, Boris Sanchez in Palm Beach, Florida, thanks.Patrick and Mark are back with us. Now Patrick, is the president's2020 budget proposal dead on arrival? What is the political strategybehind this move?</p><p>HEALY:  It's really going to be tough, Ana. I mean, Chuck Schumer andNancy Pelosi showed the Democrats in both the House the and Senatecould remain very unified on no funding for the wall. And there'sreally no reason, no pressure to believe that they will move off ofthat. They came away from the shutdown experience. They're like thepoll numbers were on their side and that they boxed the presidentineffectively.</p><p>Now, the president is going to be ramming up his re-election campaign.He knows that the wall is probably the single biggest promise from2016 that he has to show that he's either delivering on or going tocontinue to fight for. So, that is huge for him. I mean, he needs thatto be front and center, even if he's tilting at windmills constantly.</p><p>CABRERA:  And this number is huge, Mark, $8.6 billion in border wallmoney. Is this Ann Coulter getting under the president's skin here orcould this have been what Senator Lamar Alexander, for example, had inmind when he said he and other Republicans were trying to guide thepresident or convince him to get the wall money some other way thenthe emergency declaration?</p><p>PRESTON:  Well, given the options, Republicans would rather have thepresident offer a budget as we expect him to do as it's been leakedout where he asks for the money as opposed to basically going in anddemanding the money and taking the money away under emergencydeclaration.</p><p>This is a political problem for some Republicans especially whenthey're running in 2020. The president has taken money using thisemergency declaration in a very questionable way. Now, he's not goingto get the money that he's asked for in this budget. Democrats controlthe House. They have enough votes in the Senate to try to stop stufffrom going through.</p><p>The president is going to make this a campaign issue and really, theirony in all of this is that the president could either win re-election or he can lose re-election perhaps on the one issue of thatbeing the wall. It has so generated so much anger, so much buzz onboth sides, it has inflamed those who think that it should be builtand it certainly has inflamed those who don't think it should bebuilt. And where I sit rear right now in Austin, Texas, I can tell you thatmost, if not all of the folks at this gathering, they don't want thewall built. So, it will be interesting as we see over the comingmonths how the president tries to play this out. But not only is hegoing to be fighting with Democrats, he'll be fighting withRepublicans as well over the next year in this budget.</p><p>CABRERA:  Boris mentioned how Democrats are already rejecting this. Goahead Patrick.</p><p>HEALY:  Yes. Just one other point, the -- just about Ann Coulter. Imean, Ann Coulter has been pretty consistent on the wall, reflecting alot of energy and the base that has wanted some kind of very, youknow, intense symbolic -- not just symbolic, but real effort --physical structure.</p><p>CABRERA:  Physical structure. Lock immigration.</p><p>HEALY:  It's President Trump who has been flip-flopping on AnnCoulter. I mean, as we remember before the shutdown in December whenAnn Coulter started going after him, he got very nervous about that.And he was at one point sort of looking to do a real deal withDemocrats on border security.</p><p>And it was Ann Coulter and others certainly on the right and farright, who kind of sort of scared him back into submission. And nowhim coming out, I mean, that's the thing. When he goes to thenicknames as we all know by this point, someone has gotten under hisskin and he's just going to, you know, that kind of cartoonishbehavior. But, you know, in his mind, it works. But it does show hergetting under his skin and him flip-flopping on that.</p><p>CABRERA:  Patrick Healy, Mark Preston, good to have both of you. Thankyou on the front lines.</p><p>The final assault on ISIS in Syria has begun and CNN is the onlyAmerican T.V. network there. Plus, no survivor as a horrific planecrash claims the lives of every passenger and crew member on board.It's the second time in less than six months a brand-new Boeingaircraft has crashed just minutes into the flight. We have details,live in the \"CNN Newsroom.\"</p><p>[17:15:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CABRERA:  We have breaking news now overseas, and you will see thisonly on CNN. Eastern Syria, mortars, artillery, explosion and nearlynonstop machine gun fire. This town, a small enclave is where the lastconcentration of ISIS fighters anywhere is now surrounded and were anoffer for them to surrender is now off the table.</p><p>Military action to wipe them out has begun and CNN is the onlyAmerican T.V. network in this area. Our senior internationalcorrespondent, Ben Wedeman, has been watching this heavy, heavyfighting for a couple of hours from just a few hundred yards away.</p><p>Ben, there are explosions behind you and tracers crisscrossing thesky. About how many ISIS terrorists are believed to be staging thislast stand? Are we really seeing the end of ISIS as a centralizedorganization?</p><p>BEN WEDEMAN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Ana, as far asthe number of ISIS terrorists inside, we simply don't know. From thebeginning of this battle going back more than a month, we have heardthe U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces making estimates that provedwrong time after time.</p><p>A month ago they were telling us that there were 1,500 civilians and500 ISIS fighters. It turns out as far as the civilians go, it wasabout 20 times higher than that number and certainly with thefighters, several thousand have already surrendered.</p><p>[17:20:00] We've spoken with some of them but they said there werestill many civilians and fighters left inside. So, it's not alltogether clear. Now, what's interesting is that after about four hoursand 15 minutes of fairly heavy bombardment and some return fire, nowI'll be able to stand up again, not sit on the ground, it's gonerelatively quiet.</p><p>I just see one fire burning in the distance but there are planesoverhead. What we've seen in the previous two operations where theywere attempting to retake this pocket, the bombing went on all nightlong and well into the following day. So, it's hard to sit andunderstand what the situation inside that camp is.</p><p>Now, that encampment is only about half a square mile. What we saw,actually, we were just outside that encampment about an hour beforethe operation began and already there was an intense exchange ofgunfire, a lot of incoming as well from the ISIS sniper position. Andnow I'm hearing more gunfire from the direction of the encampment. So,this is going to be a long night. Ana?</p><p>CABRERA:  Dan, what kind of help are the Syrian forces getting or arethey doing this alone?</p><p>WEDEMAN:  No, they are definitely not alone, Ana. They're on theground U.S., British and French Special Forces they are manningartillery positions, mortar positions. In addition to above in thesky, there are U.S., British and French planes flying overhead,bombing the hell out of that little, small sliver of land behind me.</p><p>So, they have quite a lot of help. They are the ones, obviously, theSyrian Democratic Forces are doing the heavy lifting when it comes tothe combat, tent-to-tent combat at this point but they definitely havesome serious help from the U.S.-led international coalition. Ana?</p><p>CABRERA:  Ben, thank you, for putting yourself in such a vulnerableposition to be able to report on this for us. We appreciate your workand your crew there on the ground. Stay safe.</p><p>As we stay overseas, enormous tragedy and so many unanswered questionsafter a commercial airliner crashed in Africa. One hundred and fifty-seven people are dead, everyone on board. The Boeing 737 belonging toEthiopian Airlines crashed just a few minutes after takeoff.Passengers are from 35 different countries. They're all among thosekilled from all over Africa, Europe, Asia and the United States.</p><p>Richard Quest joins us now from London. He's our aviationcorrespondent. Richard, it's far too early to know what caused thiscrash. It's not even been a full day since it happened, but from whatwe know so far, this airplane was a Boeing 737 Max 8. It's brand new.The airline CEO says there were no technical red flags ahead of timeand it was flown by a senior pilot. At this stage, what do you make ofthis?</p><p>RICHARD QUEST, CNN AVIATON:  That pilot requested to return back toAddis because of technical problems and that was the last it was heardof it. And you have to look at the similarities between this incidentand the LionAir 610 flight which fell out the sky last year.</p><p>Now, that was also a brand-new Boeing 737 Max 8. The incident alsohappened at the very early part of the flight. In that case, 12minutes, this case six minutes into the flight, and there is(inaudible) and altitude which also -- I can hear some people say,right, well one and one -- Richard say one on one makes three. I'mnot.</p><p>I'm just saying that this is the rock the investigators are going tobe looking at because it is highly unusual. In fact besides the cometback in Britain in the 1950s, I can't think of another case where abrand-new aircraft has had two major incidents with multiplefatalities so soon after entry into service.</p><p>CABRERA:  So, Boeing has got to be freaking out right now?</p><p>QUEST:  No, they won't be. They will be doing what Boeing does best,which is going through this methodically, recognizing that there maybe a problem. They are sending a team obviously and that they will bewaiting until the get the information.</p><p>There maybe telemetry already coming in from the aircraft's computersystems that are being transmitted. They will be looking at theservice record. It was a brand new plane so there's almost nothingwrong with it. They will be looking at any previous incidents or hadany of the other crew reported problems with sensors, with readings,with computers.</p><p>And then ultimately they will have to wait. They'll have to wait likeeverybody else for the Ethiopian investigators -- and they're verygood at this, by the way, the Ethiopian investigators, and they willbring in the NTSB from the U.S.</p><p>[17:25:00] They will bring in the British. They will bring in Boeing.They will bring in the plane, the engine manufacturers and togetherthey'll find the flight data recorder and work out what happened.</p><p>CABRERA:  And so what kind of information might we expect then in thecoming hours to help make sense of this horrible crash?</p><p>QUEST:  Right. First thing we want to know is any -- what exactly didthe pilot say to Addis traffic control when he requested to turnback?Did he give any indication of what was wrong with the aircraft?Secondly, how far are they in advance in finding the data recorders?</p><p>Now, this looks like it was a very serious impact, probably the planediving out of the sky but those boxes are designed for much greaterincidents than this in the sense of forces upon them. So, they willfind them. They'll weed them out as it's known.</p><p>And it could be, if they find the boxes today and the boxes aren'tdamaged particularly badly, then you could be looking by week's end toget a good idea or midweek to weekend next week to get a good idea ofwhat happened or at least the early parameters of what might havehappened.</p><p>CABRERA:  Well, the images are just so heart breaking. Richard Quest,thanks for that great reporting.</p><p>A new poll has solidified it. Two older Democrats everyone knows arethe ones to beat. So how are young contenders making their mark on the2020 race? Live to the site of tonight's presidential town halls,next. You're live in the \"CNN Newsroom.\"</p><p>[17:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CABRERA:  Another busy day for the pack, and it is a pack of 2020presidential hopefuls. We have a brand-new poll from the key state ofIowa giving us a fresh look where voters stand on these candidates.Former vice president Joe Biden maintaining his lead despite not evenofficially being in the race.</p><p>And with Biden and Bernie Sanders, the oldest of the candidates areleading right now, there is a growing number of young hopefuls who arelooking to break through. CNN senior White House correspondent JeffZeleny is in Austin, Texas where three Democrats in the running willbe in the spotlight tonight. Jeff, who are the young Democrats towatch?</p><p>JEFF ZELENY, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, good evening,Ana. There is a diverse field of Democratic candidates as you said andage is a central part of that diversity. There are two candidates whowe'll be hearing from this evening.</p><p>Pete Buttigieg is the mayor of South Bend, Indiana and Tulsi Gabbard,she is a member of Congress. And they have been out there making theircase to voters. They are 37 years old. That means should they win,they will become the first millennial president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETE BUTTIGIEG, MAYOR (D), SOUTH BEND, INDIANA:  Everywhere I gopeople sometimes, especially here in Iowa, a little too polite to askthe question as to why a 37-year-old mayor thinks he has any businessbeing in a discussion about the highest office in the land.</p><p>ZELENY (voice-over):  That's precisely the question facing PeteButtigieg, the youngest candidate in the presidential race. He's themayor of South Bend, Indiana, now turning heads as he audaciously eyesat the White House. (on camera):  How can you make the argument to be president?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  So, I know you don't expect to hear this from the youngestperson in the conversation but my simplest answer is experience. Iknow there is a more conventional path that involves marinating inWashington for 10 or 20 or 40 years, but I actually think we wantWashington to begin looking more like our best-run cities and towns,not the other way around.</p><p>ZELENY (voice-over):  He's touting his youth as virtue and hisbiography filled with a list if firsts.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  The fact that I'm a veteran, that I'm young, that I'm in asame-sex marriage, those are important parts of who I am. But thatprofile just gets you a look. The real question is once people takethat look, who do they see and what do they hear?</p><p>ZELENY (voice-over):  Democrats are giving them a look, but there arechallenges to be seen as a serious candidate on a crowded stage. He'sat the forefront of a new generation of leaders who have littleappetite to wait their turn.</p><p>Even Democrats not constitutionally old enough to seek the presidencylike Congresswoman Alexandria Oscasio-Cortez, 29, is also influencingthe party. On the campaign trail, Buttigieg is not the only millennialin the race.</p><p>REP. TULSI GABBARD (D), HAWAII:  I don't know about you guys. Whensomeone tells me to be quiet, I speak up louder.</p><p>ZELENY (voice-over):  Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard is also 37,and an Iraq veteran, who is building her candidacy around foreignpolicy.</p><p>GABBARD:  That is the change that I seek to bring to this country, ofbringing these uniquely American ideals of putting service before selfthat come from my heart as a soldier.</p><p>ZELENY (voice-over):  She's still explaining a 2017 meeting withSyria's president, Bahsar al-Assad.</p><p>GABBARD: I'm deeply sorry.</p><p>ZELENY (voice-over):  And has apologized for what she now calls wrongand hurtful statements where she worked for an anti-gay group. Twoyoung congressmen also exploring a White House bid. The 38-year-oldEric Swalwell of California and 48-year-old Seth Moulton ofMassachusetts. Highlighting a divide with Joe Biden and Bernie Sandersnearly four decades older. It's become a ready made punch line atleast for the younger candidates.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  I understand the audacity of running for president at myage. Especially because sometimes downstairs I will still get cardedwhen I order a beer.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)ZELENY (on camera):  So he will not get carded tonight at this event,Ana. But there is a central theme through a lot of these youngercandidates; that is military service. Pete Buttigieg served inAfghanistan, Tulsi Gabbard served in Iraq. That is a central theme wesee in new members of Congress as well.</p><p>Now, when you ask mayor Buttigieg about his age, he said look, theconstitution has settled that. The age of course is 35 to bepresident. Of course, at the end of the day that will be voters makingthat decision in this case. Ana?</p><p>CABRERA:  I still think I'm almost 37 and I can't imagine being in aposition to run for president. That alone is ambitious and impressive.Jeff Zeleny, thanks for bringing us that reporting.</p><p>[17:35:00] Live tonight from South by Southwest in Austin, Texas,three CNN presidential town halls back to back, former congressman,John Delaney at 7:00, Representative Tulsi Gabbard at 8:00 and MayorPete Buttigieg at 9:00. Jake Tapper and Dana Bash moderate. Thatstarts again 7:00 eastern tonight right here on CNN.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CABRERA:  Welcome back. We are uncovering new details this weekendthat help connect a Florida massage parlor, the Chinese businesscommunity in this country and political influence that might go allthe way to the White House.</p><p>This woman in a selfie with President Trump once owned the day spawhere NFL owner Robert Kraft was charged with soliciting sex. Now,according to federal records, she runs a company that introducesclients to people close to President Trump for a fee. CNN's KayleeHartung is in Jupiter, Florida, outside that now infamous massageparlor. Kaylee, you have been digging on this story the last couple ofdays. Who is this woman, and is she accused of doing anything illegal?</p><p>[17:40:02] KAYLEE HARTUNG, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Ana, Li or Cindy Yangis not accused of doing anything illegal. She no longer owns this dayspa that is at the center of the human trafficking investigation.She's not been charged in relationship to that investigation in anyway, but it's her new business that's now raising eyebrows.</p><p>\"The Miami Herald\" reports that she's running this consultant firmbased in Florida that promises Chinese investors she can introducethem to U.S. political elite like President Trump and members of hisfamily. So, the spotlight has moved on from that night she spent atthe Super Bowl watch party at Mar-a-Lago with President Trump to apaid fund-raiser for Trump in December of 2017 in New York City.</p><p>Now, there are campaign finance laws in this country that govern whocan and can't contribute to political campaigns. Well, in the case ofthat night, Yang did what she advertises she can do. She arranged fora group of Chinese businessmen to attend that event.</p><p>A source who was at that event told \"The Herald\" that Yang identifiedherself as an official with the National Committee of Asian AmericanRepublicans, that's a political action committee based in D.C. thatwas founded in the summer of 2016. And in reference to this group ofChinese businessmen at the event, she said they're all my guests.</p><p>Now, we've learned that in the days leading up to that event, Yangcontributed significant amounts of money to President Trump's funds.She donated more than $5,000 to Trump's campaign fund and more than$23,000 to Trump's victory political action committee. In thiscountry, a foreign national can go to a political fund-raiser of thisnature just as long as they don't pay their way into it.</p><p>Only American citizens and permanent residents of this country cancontribute to political campaigns. So, if a foreign national were tohave paid Yang and reimbursed her for that entrance into this eventthat would be illegal, Ana. We've reached out to the White House, theRNC, the Trump campaign and Yang, but those efforts have beenunsuccessful. Nobody has responded to our request for comment.</p><p>CABRERA:  All right. Kaylee Hartung, thank you for the update.</p><p>In the days to come, crucial legal proceedings for several formerTrump insiders, the most consequential of course is the secondsentencing for Paul Manafort, why it's unlikely to look anything likehis last hearing, next in the \"CNN Newsroom.\"</p><p>[17:45:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CABRERA:  Paul Manafort is not out of the woods yet, not by a longshot. The man Trump chose to run his 2016 presidential campaign willbe sentenced a second time this week. And this time, Manafort faces amuch less sympathetic judge.</p><p>U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson is the one who effectivelyvoided his plea deal when she ruled that Manafort intentionally liedto Robert Mueller despite agreeing to cooperate in his Russia probe.And what did Manafort lie about? His relationship with KonstantinKilimnik, a Russian associate who worked with Manafort in Ukraine.</p><p>Prosecutors say Kilimnik has ties to Russian intelligence, anallegation he has denied. Manafort shared polling data with Kilimnikduring the 2016 campaign, that's according to a court document filedby Manafort's own lawyers, and he met with Kilimnik again in Madridafter Trump was elected.</p><p>Also Judge Jackson is the one who says Manafort violated his bail,prosecutors telling the court Manafort plotted with Kilimnik to tamperwith potential witnesses. A former federal prosecutor named Gene Rossitells Bloomberg News, \"Judge Ellis, who sentenced Manafort to lessthan four years behind bars in the first case this past week, maysimply have assumed Judge Jackson would impose significant additionaltime.\"</p><p>And Rossi says, \"That was in part why he went relatively easy on PaulManafort.\" A lot of legal analysts may agree or disagree but here'sthe bottom line, Judge Jackson could punish Manafort an additional 10years in the slammer for his crimes including conspiring to secretlylobby the U.S. on behalf of a pro-Russian Ukrainian government. Also, she gets to decide whether Manaforts serves the sentence shehands down at the same time concurrently with his first one orconsecutively. Manafort is almost 70 years old so this could determinewhether he spends the rest of his life behind bars.</p><p>Manafort's day of reckoning with Judge Jackson is set to happen onWednesday. And that brings us to our weekly segment \"Cross-Exam\" withElie Hoinig. Elie is a former federal and state prosecutor and CNNlegal analyst. He's answering your questions about legal news.</p><p>Elie, understandably a lot of the questions this week were aboutManafort. You said this is perhaps the biggest blockbuster week ofquestions that you received, one of them being what is thesignificance of the 47-month sentence he's already received?</p><p>ELIE HONIG, CNN LEGAL ANALYST:  Yes. One of the best parts of doingthis is you get to hear directly from viewers. And our viewers werereally baffled and angered by this sentence and I think rightly so. Ithink this was an unjust sentence that we saw from the judge inVirginia.</p><p>Look, the sentencing guideline range, which is advisory, it's notmandatory, was 19 to 24 years. Now, I agree that would have beenexcessive given all the facts here, but this judge went 15 years belowthe bottom of that range.</p><p>And I thought (ph) back on the cases I did as a federal prosecutor. Idid hundreds of cases, maybe a thousand. I never once had a case otherthan cooperators, which is a different game -- I never once had a casewhere a judge went that far below the bottom of the guidelines. Thatis how rare this was.</p><p>And I think people were angry for two reasons. One, as we said before,Manafort showed such disrespect for the law. He lied, he tampered withwitnesses, he didn't even accept responsibility at his own sentencing,yet he got this enormous break.</p><p>And I think the other thing that's bothering people is theproportionality. The fact that so many people often aren't white,wealthy, powerful like him get sentenced to much more time for muchless.</p><p>[17:50:03] But he's not out of the woods yet. Like you said, he hasgot to face Judge Jackson later and people asked, can the prosecutorappeal a low sentence? The answer is yes. Prosecutors can, but it'sonly done very rarely and I would not expect it here.</p><p>CABRERA:  A lot of people are also talking about Michael Cohen and thechecks that the president allegedly wrote Cohen, the hush moneypayments for having an affair or alleged affair with a couple of womentrying to cover those up before the election. Here's the viewerquestion. Why would the president break those payments up into smallerchecks?</p><p>HONIG:  So the short answer is plausible deniability, meaning it cangive a cover story for the president. The big question here is, werethese payments reimbursement for the hush money or were they whatwe're not hearing as the defense retainer fees, meaning the normalfees that a client sometimes pays an attorney to be on call sort ofmonth to month.</p><p>Overall, I think when you look at -- look, imagine if one huge checkhad been cut. It would be pretty obvious what that was. That's why Ithink the reason they broke it up was so they could claim, well, thisis just an innocent retainer fee.</p><p>But when you look at all the facts, the timing, these payments startedright after the hush money payments, the changing stories. RudyGiuliani even said at one point Trump reimbursed Michael Cohen forthese payments so, ultimately, I don't think that cover is going tohold.</p><p>CABRERA:  Another question surrounding the investigations in theSouthern District of New York, again, separate from Mueller'sinvestigations, and a viewer asked, could Trump and the members of hisorganization be prosecuted for racketeering?</p><p>HONIG:  Sure. So, RICO is the federal racketeering law and it wasreally pioneered, the use of it, in the '80s by Rudy Giuliani in theSouthern District of New York where he used it to go after the mafia,the traditional Italian mob.</p><p>Decades later I used the same tool in the Southern District to also goafter the mafia. But here's the thing, RICO is not just for the mafiaanymore. In recent years, it's been used against corruptionorganizations, corrupt governmental entities, and corrupt politicalorganizations. So, you could see it.</p><p>Now, people throw the phrase around, racketeering. What does it mean?It really boils down to you have to show a jury some organizationalstructure and you have to show the people within that organizationcommitted a series of crimes related to one another and related to theorganization.</p><p>So, the downside is it's extra work for the prosecutor but theadvantage is, and I've tried RICO cases, you get to really show thejury the full picture, how this organization operated in the broadersense. So, it's a powerful tool and I do think the Southern District,if I had to guess, is giving a hard look at whether the Trump Org.qualifies as a racketeering enterprise.</p><p>CABRERA:  Interesting. Elie Honig. Could be a very interesting weekahead. What will you be watching for?</p><p>HONIG:  OK, three quick things. First of all, Congress has sentrequest for information to the White House. The White House has saidno dice. Are we going to see Congress take it up to the next level byissuing subpoenas?</p><p>Second question, Judge Jackson, seems like everything is in front ofher. She's asked for an answer from Roger Stone about the gag order.Now, it comes out now that Roger Stone has this book coming out wherehe says some things that probably violate the gag order.  He forgot totell her us about it.</p><p>Judge Jackson says, I want your explanation. This guy is on thin iceand he's just tapping away. He's trying to get thrown in jail. And thethird one, the big one I think on everyone's mind is what we openedwith, what's Judge Jackson going to do going to do with Paul Manafort?She can sentence him to up to 10 years and I think she's going tosentence him to ten years.</p><p>And I think she's going to sentence him to 10 years. I think she'sgoing to run it concurrently, meaning it's not going to be on top ofthe four and a half years, but I think ultimately, Manafort's sentencewhen all is said and done is going to end up at 10 years and I thinkJudge Jackson is going to be the one to bring the hammer down.</p><p>CABRERA:  All right. Elie Honig, as always, thank you.</p><p>HONIG:  Thanks Ana.</p><p>CABRERA:  And of course, if you have your own questions you want Elieto answer check out his \"Cross-Exam\" column at cnn.com/opinion.</p><p>OK, 2020 hopeful Elizabeth Warren, yet again, defending her aggressivepush to break up tech giants like Amazon, Google, and Facebook. Whyher proposal may be a tough one for her party to embrace. You're livein the \"CNN Newsroom.\"</p><p>[17:55:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>CABRERA:  This week, Democratic presidential hopeful elizabeth warrenmaking waves from Washington to Silicon Valley. She's proposing anaggressive plan to break up major tech giants including Facebook,Amazon, Google. She was pressed on this today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED O'KEEFE, CBS NEWS HOST:  Let me just get this clear. If you hadyour way, Facebook would have to sell off Instagram. Amazon would haveto sell off Whole Foods.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), MASSACHUSETTS:  All those little businessesthat they're running, competing businesses. Yes.</p><p>O'KEEFE:  Who is the federal government to tell these companies theyhave to do that?</p><p>WARREN:  There's antitrust law that's been around more than 100 yearsand the federal government has done this many times, for example,broke up Standard Oil, broke up the great monopolies of the late 19thcentury and early 20th century. And the reason for that is to that wecan keep a competitive economy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CABRERA:  I asked CNN's global economic analyst, Rana Foroohar, whatshe makes of Warren's proposal. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CABRERA:  Rana, I know you're writing a book on these big techcompanies. What do you make of her idea to break them up?</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST:  You know, it's actually avery elegant way, what she just described. It is like you own themarketplace and you can play in the marketplace. That's the problemwith the big tech companies, Amazon, Google, Facebook.</p><p>There are privacy issues then there are competition issues. And Ithink what's interesting about her proposal, is it knits together someof those things and it says, look, we need to make sure that we're notliving in a rigged game where not just people, but individual, smallcompanies feel like they can't come into the marketplace and competewith these bigger players because that's bad for the overall economy.</p><p>I think it's very brave that she's taking on this issue and it's goingto be a tough one for the Democrats because Democrats get a lot ofmoney from the Silicon Valley.</p><p>CABRERA:  Will this have a big impact on the economy at large?</p><p>FOROOHAR:  You know, I think that over the longer term, if we actuallyregulate some of the biggest companies more tightly, it will be goodfor the economy. And if you look back say, 20 years ago, which is whenwe had the last big tech antitrust case, that was the Microsoft case,just the threat of that regulation actually allowed companies likeGoogle to be born. There was more after an open marketplace and Ithink that that's what we'll see again.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[18:00:00] CABRERA:  You are live in the \"CNN Newsroom.\" I'm AnaCabrera in New York.</p><p>[Byline: Ana Cabrera, Boris Sanchez, Mark Preston, Ben Wedeman,Richard Quest, Jeff Zeleny, Kaylee Hartung, Elie Honig, Rana Foroohar][Guest: Patrick Healy][High:  Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are leading the Democraticpresidential hopefuls for 2020 in a poll out of Iowa; President Trumpis now asking Congress for an additional $8.8 billion for a new wallfunding and leaders from Congress are refusing; Syrian forces haslaunched an ongoing military assault over the last ISIS stronghold inSyria; All 157 passenger and crew are dead as after an EthiopianAirlines crashed minutes after takeoff; Pete Buttigieg and TulsiGabbard are the young candidates aiming to win the presidency as theyjoin a diverse field of hopefuls for 2020; A former spa owner isadvertising access to Trump family and organization to wealthy Chinesebusinessmen; Elie Honig answers legal questions on Manafort's secondsentencing, it's importance and significance; Sen.

Representative David Cicilline, a Rhode Island Democrat, told Bloomberg in an interview Wednesday that Biden wouldn\u2019t favor the \u201ccorporate mega-mergers that have resulted in this terrible imbalance in our economy,\u201d adding that \u201ceverything he\u2019s done in his life makes me believe that he will be a strong advocate for real competition policy.\u201d   Biden \u201chas a very well-established record in public service of fighting for working people,\u201d Cicilline said, and would likely use the antitrust laws to tackle income inequality and improve labor conditions if he became president.   In the interview, Cicilline criticized past Democratic and Republican administrations for lax antitrust enforcement that he said has led to dominant companies across industries. He said Biden would want to use the antitrust laws to protect consumers, innovation, small business and \u201call the things that are at risk if we don\u2019t have competition in the digital marketplace,\u201d Cicilline said.   On Monday, Cicilline headlined a Biden fundraiser at which competition issues were broadly discussed. He said he hadn\u2019t talked about his subcommittee\u2019s work with the former vice president, but was sure Biden would appoint \u201caggressive\u201d enforcers.   A Biden campaign representative declined to comment.   Cicilline is preparing to urge Congress to strengthen the antitrust laws and reduce the market power of Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc.   Many left-of-center antitrust advocates, including Cicilline, are hoping to remake merger enforcement so that the predominant focus of analysis wouldn\u2019t just be on consumer price increases, but would also consider stagnant wages, innovation, income inequality and privacy rights.   Many of those who favor a broader view of harm wonder if a Biden administration would maintain the status quo or take a more aggressive stand. The Obama administration pursued a mostly traditional approach to antitrust enforcement. While its Justice Department stopped several high-profile mergers, it approved others that were criticized as worsening competition, such as the tie-up of American Airlines Group Inc. and US Airways. When it came to the big tech platforms, enforcers under Obama were mostly hands-off.   Biden has said little on the subject beyond opining last year in an Associated Press interview that the U.S. doesn\u2019t \u201cspend nearly enough time focusing on antitrust measures.\u201d He stopped short of calling for corporate break-ups.   Cicilline\u2019s comments reflect the party\u2019s internal struggle over which viewpoint will prevail in a potential Biden administration. Biden\u2019s campaign, which has struggled with skepticism from the Democrats\u2019 increasingly vocal left wing, is getting informal advice from some of the new thinkers, often referred to as the \u201chipster antitrust\u201d school, which has also worked with Cicilline, according to people familiar with the discussions.   Yet Biden is also getting plenty of input from veterans of Obama-era enforcement agencies, lawyers at major corporate firms and company officials, the people said.   Among a group of informal advisers are Sarah Miller, a key voice for overhauling antitrust as executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, and onetime Justice Department antitrust chief Bill Baer. Microsoft Corp. Chief Privacy Officer Julie Brill, who also served as a Federal Trade Commissioner, is one of the private-sector executives offering advice.   Terrell McSweeny, a former Biden aide and FTC commissioner who is now at Covington &amp; Burling LLP, is a leader of the group, as is former Federal Communications Commissioner Mignon Clyburn.   Miller said it was \u201creally an open question\u201d how Biden\u2019s administration would enforce antitrust laws if he wins, but that \u201cthere absolutely needs to be people involved that are not beholden to this old and discredited way of thinking.\u201d   Baer and Clyburn declined to comment on whether they\u2019re advising Biden and Microsoft declined to comment on Brill\u2019s behalf. McSweeny didn\u2019t respond to an email seeking comment.   A subgroup of informal Biden advisers is focusing on the effect of mergers and monopolies on inequality, according to two people familiar with the matter. Inequality currently doesn\u2019t figure into the economic equation in merger reviews. If a potential Biden administration adopted that view, it would represent a leftward shift from Obama\u2019s tenure.   The Democrats\u2019 2020 platform turned toward the hipster view by urging regulators to \u201cconsider potential effects of future mergers on the labor market, on low-income and marginalized communities, and on racial equity\u201d -- key tenets of the hipster antitrust project. It also outlined worries with \u201crunaway corporate concentration\u201d in several industries.   Cicilline warned that tech companies that have become powerful in Washington will push back on any legal changes he proposes.   \u201cThey\u2019re going to fight it in every way that they can,\u201d he said, adding that he and his allies \u201chave democracy and the people on our side and we\u2019ll be successful.\u201d   Business interests such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have already begun their pushback against proposals that it says \u201cwould radically remake a century\u2019s worth of bipartisan policy that has protected competition and championed innovation to the benefit of consumers and America\u2019s global competitiveness.\u201d It launched a website and ran ads earlier in the summer, and is planning more for September, a spokeswoman said in July.   That same month, Cicilline grilled the chief executives of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google parent Alphabet at a public hearing, and said he would be issuing a report recommending changes to toughen antitrust law in September as he wraps up his probe.   \u00a92020 Bloomberg L.P.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

This is what Democratic candidate Joe Biden had to say about climate change, gun control, health care and other issues.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Do you believe the earth's climate is changing? If yes, do you believe it is caused by humans?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This shouldn't be a question. The science is clear that our climate is changing, and humans' contributions to it are indisputable. Climate change poses an existential threat to our environment, our health, and our communities. That's why I have introduced a bold plan - a Clean Energy Revolution - to address this grave threat and lead the world in addressing the climate emergency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you could unilaterally make one change, or enact one policy, that would affect the climate, what would that be? And why?</p><p>On Day 1, I will kickstart a Clean Energy Revolution that ensures the U.S. achieves a 100% clean energy economy and reaches net-zero emissions no later than 2050. That includes demanding that Congress enacts legislation that establishes an enforcement mechanism, makes a historic investment in climate research and innovation, and incentivizes the rapid deployment of clean energy innovations and technology across the economy. I will also sign a series of new executive orders with unprecedented reach that go well beyond the Obama-Biden Administration platform and put us on the right track to tackle the climate emergency head on.</p><p>How would you engage foreign leaders to work with the United States on issues related to climate?</p><p>The United States represents just 15% of global carbon emissions, so we will not be able to address climate change without bold action from every country. That's why I will rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on Day 1 as president, and one of my first priorities will be calling a global summit to rally the world to step up our efforts - to get countries to ramp up the ambition of their own domestic climate targets - and to push us to move faster.</p><p>Read what all the candidates have to say about climate change here.</p><p>Should the U.S. explore additional use of nuclear power as an alternative energy source? Why or why not?</p><p>To address the climate emergency threatening our communities, economy, and national security, we must look at all low- and zero-carbon technologies. That includes identifying the future of nuclear energy. I will support a research agenda by establishing ARPA-C, a new, cross-agency Advanced Research Projects Agency focused on climate, to look at issues, ranging from cost to safety to waste disposal systems, that remain an ongoing challenge with nuclear power today.</p><p>Should the U.S. government offer subsidies for renewable energy, such as wind energy or ethanol? Why or why not?</p><p>I will make significant investments in clean energy technology and ensure we are curbing carbon emissions. I will allocate tax credits and subsidies to help businesses upgrade equipment, invest in expanded or new factories, and deploy low-carbon technologies - making sure there is bottom-line win for jobs, workers, clean energy, and long-term community investment. In addition, I'll invest $400 billion in clean energy research, innovation, and deployment - more than twice what America spent to put a man on the moon. As part of this effort, developing the next generation of biofuels will be a top priority.</p><p>How would you address gun violence in America?</p><p>Every day, there are shootings in America that don't make the national headlines. This nation faces a gun violence epidemic and we have to take action I have taken on the NRA and won - twice - and I will do it again. As president, I will ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, require background checks on all gun sales, close other loopholes in the background check system like the \"boyfriend loophole,\" accelerate smart gun technology, and more.</p><p>Read what all the candidates have to say about gun violence here.</p><p>How do you propose making schools safer from acts of violence?</p><p>No kid should fear violence in the classrooms they learn and no parent should have to worry about whether their kids will come from school. We cannot let the gun violence epidemic become an acceptable part of American life. I will ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and I will require background checks for all gun sales and close other loopholes in the federal background check system, including the \"boyfriend loophole\" and the \"Charleston loophole.\" I will hold gun manufacturers accountable by repealing the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. I've defeated the NRA before and will do it again.</p><p>What role, if any, should the government have in regulating large technology companies?</p><p>We haven't spent enough time focusing on antitrust measures, and it's no secret that we need to take a hard look at how we can rein in some of the abuses of power from big tech companies. These companies' actions have significant consequences on our society - from our economic prosperity to the integrity of our elections to the privacy of our citizens to the wellbeing of our children - and I will take forceful action to hold them accountable.</p><p>If you are elected, how would you interact with North Korea? What relationship would the U.S. and North Korea have?</p><p>Trump's approach to North Korea has failed at every turn because it lacks strategy, process, and competent leadership. He has prioritized creating made-for-TV summits but not delivered any real commitments from North Korea to curb their nuclear program. I will pursue smart diplomacy and work with our allies towards denuclearization in North Korea, using the historic Iran Nuclear Deal that blocked Iran from getting a nuclear weapon as a blueprint for an effective negotiation. I will empower our negotiators and jumpstart a sustained, coordinated campaign with our allies and others - including China - to advance our shared objective of a denuclearized North Korea.</p><p>Would you re-enter the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran? Why or why not?</p><p>The Iran Nuclear Deal was working - it blocked every one of Iran's paths to nuclear weapons, as repeatedly verified by international inspectors - but Trump abandoned it, isolating the U.S. on the world stage, with no plan for anything better. Iran must never be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon; if Iran moves back into compliance with its nuclear obligations, I would re-enter the JCPOA as a starting point to work alongside our allies and other partners to extend the deal's nuclear constraints. I would leverage renewed international consensus around America's Iran policy - and a redoubled commitment to diplomacy - to push back against Tehran's other malign behavior in the region.</p><p>How do you plan to address the threat of extremism in the U.S.?</p><p>We as a nation have to make the same commitment to rooting out domestic terrorism that we have to stopping international terrorism. We must condemn this hate in all its forms, including white supremacy, and not embolden it like Trump. I will ensure federal, state and local law enforcement have the resources needed to counter white supremacist terrorists. I will build on the progress of the Obama-Biden Administration to support our communities in this fight, restoring funding for initiatives to counter violent extremism at home. I will close the \"hate crime loophole\" and enact a federal domestic terrorism law without infringing on people's free speech or trampling civil liberties.</p><p>Do you believe there is equal access to voting in the U.S.? If not, how would you go about expanding access to voting?</p><p>I do not believe that there is equal access to voting. We've got to make it easier - not harder - for Americans to exercise their right to vote, regardless of their zip code or the color of their skin. I'll restore the Voting Rights Act and ensure the Justice Department challenges state laws suppressing the right to vote. We need automatic voter registration, same-day voter registration, and so many more steps to make exercising one's right to vote easier.</p><p>Do you believe voter fraud is a problem in the U.S.? If yes, how do you plan to you address it?</p><p>We don't have a widespread voter fraud problem. There is a widespread voter suppression problem. Donald Trump grows more scared everyday that he is going to lose this election - which is why he undermines the integrity of our elections by creating and perpetuating false and baseless claims about wide scale voter fraud. The real fraud is Donald Trump. He is attacking the fundamental rights of all Americans to vote - making it harder for communities of color, working families, and more to make their voices heard.</p><p>Should it be a crime to enter the U.S. illegally?</p><p>I don't believe crossing the border should be decriminalized, but unlike the Trump Administration, I will make sure that U.S. immigration law is enforced humanely. I will not separate children from families and I will use alternatives to detention and family management systems that are cheaper and more effective. If people do not have credible asylum claims or qualify for other relief under the law, then I will work with regional foreign governments to ensure migrants are repatriated humanely.</p><p>Read what all the candidates have to say about immigration here.</p><p>Should the U.S. expand or limit legal immigration?</p><p>The U.S. needs comprehensive immigration reform. Period. That includes changes that would expand access to legal immigration. As president, I will legalize DREAMers, create a roadmap to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already strengthening our communities, and reform our asylum system.</p><p>In many areas of the country, there is a critical shortage of affordable housing. What would your administration do to address it?</p><p>We need to provide more federal funding for housing and require that housing be inclusive. My housing infrastructure initiatives include grants for remediation of homes in lower-income neighborhoods to make them more energy efficient. I will also set a national goal of ensuring 100% of formerly incarcerated individuals have housing upon reentry into society, and use housing policy as a tool to battle climate change and expand the middle class.</p><p>What is your plan to address the growing national debt?</p><p>Staying vigilant on controlling our growing national debt is not only critical to our nation's economic health, but is also critical to ensuring that future generations won't be saddled with massive interest payments that will crowd-out other critical needs - like spending on health care and education. I will work with Congress to ensure we are addressing our national debt in a fair and effective way, reverse Trump's tax cuts for the super-wealthy and corporations, eliminate special tax breaks that reward special interests, close the capital gains loophole for multi-millionaires, and pare back on ineffective tax expenditures for the wealthiest Americans.</p><p>Do you think our national debt is a national security issue? Why or why not?</p><p>Economic security is national security. That is why, as president, I will pursue a foreign policy for the middle class. That includes significant investments in workers, families, communities, and the core sources of our national strength, including innovation, education, and infrastructure. It also includes putting our nation on a sustainable fiscal path to make our country less vulnerable to economic threats from foreign powers and to strengthen our ability to respond to future crises.</p><p>Is capitalism the best economic structure for the United States? If yes, why? If no, what is better and how do you believe it will benefit Americans?</p><p>Yes, a well-regulated capitalism is the best economic structure for the United States. The American middle class built this country. Yet today, CEOs and Wall Street are putting profits over workers, plain and simple. It's wrong. There used to be a basic bargain in this country that when you work hard, you were able to share in the prosperity your work helped create. It's time to restore the dignity of work and give workers back the power to earn what they're worth. I will increase the federal minimum wage to $15, reverse Trump's tax cuts for the super-wealthy and corporations, and encourage collective bargaining and unions.</p><p>In many parts of the country, there is a skilled worker gap. How would you close that gap to get more people employed in the industries that need them?</p><p>In today's increasingly globalized and technology-driven economy, 12 years of education is no longer enough for American workers to remain competitive and earn a middle class income. I will make significant investments in workforce training, including $50 billion for community college business partnerships and apprenticeships. These funds will create and support partnerships between schools, governments, unions, and businesses, to identify in-demand knowledge and skills in a community and develop or modernize training programs that lead to a relevant, high-demand industry-recognized credential.</p><p>Should the government forgive student loans? If yes, why and for whom? If no, why not?</p><p>Our country faces a student debt crisis. Even years after graduating, Americans are drowning in debt, and people of color are disproportionately affected. My plan will halve the payments on undergraduate federal student loans by simplifying and increasing the generosity of today's income-based repayment program, and not require payments or accrual of interest on undergraduate federal loans for those making less than $25,000 a year. I will also create a new, simple loan forgiveness program that offers $10,000 of student debt relief for every year of national or community service for up to five years.</p><p>Should community college be free to anyone who wants to attend? Should other colleges and universities be free to attend?</p><p>As my wife Dr. Jill Biden, a community college professor, says, community colleges are America's best kept secret. As president, I will provide two years of community college or other high-quality training program without debt to every hard-working individual,. I will create a new grant program to assist community colleges in improving their students' success by implementing evidence-based practices and innovative solutions to increase their students' retention and completion of credentials. And I will tackle barriers, such as child care, transportation costs, or unexpected financial challenges, that prevent students from completing their community college degree or training credential.</p><p>Is more funding needed for mental health care in America? If yes, what amount and how should it be allocated? Where should that money come from?</p><p>Yes. Mental health care is health care. As president, I will ensure enforcement of mental health parity laws and expand funding for mental health services. I will also double the number of psychologists, guidance counselors, nurses, social workers, and other health professionals in our schools so our kids get the mental health care they need. I will pay for my health care plan, which includes mental health care, by getting rid of capital gains tax loopholes for the super wealthy. The Biden plan will assure those making over $1 million will pay the top rate on capital gains, doubling the capital gains tax rate on the super wealthy.</p><p>Read what all the candidates have to say about health care here.</p><p>How would you address rising prescription drug costs, specifically for medications that are necessary for people to live, such as insulin and mental health medications?</p><p>Too many Americans cannot afford their prescription drugs, and drug corporations profiteer off sick individuals. It has to stop. I will repeal the law allowing drug companies to avoid negotiating with Medicare, limit the launch prices of their drugs with no competition, allow consumers to buy prescription drugs from other countries, and terminate big pharmas' tax breaks for egregious advertising spending. As a condition of participation in the Medicare program and the public option, I will prohibit all brand, biotech, and abusively priced generic drugs from increasing their prices more than the general inflation rate.</p><p>What do you believe is the biggest health care issue facing Americans? How would you solve it?</p><p>Making health care more affordable and accessible for every American, which is why I will protect and build on Obamacare. Every American has a right to the peace of mind that comes with knowing they have access to affordable, quality health care. Whether you're covered through your employer, buying your insurance on your own, or going without coverage altogether, my plan will give you the choice to purchase a public health insurance option like Medicare. It will reduce costs for patients by negotiating lower prices from hospitals and other health care providers, and won't force approximately 157 million people out of their existing coverage.</p><p>How would you address the opioid crisis?</p><p>So many lives, families, and communities throughout the United States have been destroyed by opioid addiction. The best way to tackle the opioid crisis is make sure people have access to affordable, quality health care, including insurance that covers addiction and mental health services. Obamacare provided coverage and lower premiums to millions of people with pre-existing conditions, including mental health issues, which is why I will protect and build on it to redouble efforts to ensure enforcement of mental health parity laws and expand funding for mental health services to support those with mental health issues and addiction so people can get the care they need.</p><p>Should marijuana be legalized federally for medicinal use? Should it be legalized for recreational use?</p><p>I support the legalization of cannabis for medical purposes. I will leave decisions regarding legalization for recreational use up to the states, and reschedule cannabis as a schedule II drug so researchers can study its positive and negative impacts. No one should be in jail because of cannabis use. As president, I will decriminalize recreational cannabis use at the federal level and automatically expunge all prior convictions.</p><p>Do you support a public health insurance option for all Americans? If yes, do you support the elimination of private health care in favor of a government-run plan, or do you support an option where Americans can choose a public or private plan? If no, why?</p><p>Yes, I support a public health insurance option for all Americans. Instead of eliminating private health insurance, my plan will protect and build on the Affordable Care Act. Whether you're covered through your employer, buying insurance on your own, or going without coverage altogether, my plan will make sure that everybody can purchase a public health insurance option like Medicare. My plan is the fastest way to achieve universal coverage at 1/30th the cost. Health care is personal to me. If I am elected president, I guarantee you I will protect your family's health care as if it were my own.</p><p>Should the federal government re-institute the death penalty? If yes, for what crimes?</p><p>No. We must eliminate the death penalty because we cannot ensure we get death penalty cases right every time.

But even during the biggest economic crisis in living memory, Americans back his captaining of the US economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump's economy approval rating remains in positive territory at +8, according to YouGov. More concerning still for Camp Biden is that just 34pc of Americans believe the economy would get better under his presidency. A total of 39pc fear it would get worse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If the \"it's the economy, stupid\" mantra still holds strong, November's election could be tighter than Biden's current nine-point lead suggests. Can the former vice president get voters to back Bidenomics? Despite his reputation as a moderate who can reach across the aisle, Biden's platform is seen by experts as the most extreme proposed by a Democratic presidential challenger in decades.</p><p>\"If we compare to previous Democratic plans or Trump's plan, it is a pretty radical change,\" says Stephen Gallagher, US economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. \"But if we compare to the offering of the other Democratic candidates, it is more moderate compared to Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren or even Kamala Harris.\"</p><p>There was a fairly serious risk that the shift would have been even more crashing had the man Trump derides as \"Sleepy Joe\" not come out on top in the primaries, Gallagher says.</p><p>Four years of Trump have pushed the Democratic Party further Left as the country becomes increasingly polarised. Biden has followed his party, being forced into a number of key pledges to curry favour with Left-wing Democrats who have grown in stature.</p><p>The field of candidates in this year's Democratic primaries have responded to the popularity of the party's Leftists, such as firebrand socialist Bernie Sanders and liberal policy wonk Elizabeth Warren. Ultimately Democratic voters opted for a candidate who they believe is bestplaced to defeat Trump - electability was a top concern, polling suggests - but the race has left its mark on Biden's platform.</p><p>Perhaps most important for the economy has been the former vice president's promise to do \"whatever it takes\" to tackle Covid-19.</p><p>\"I would shut it down. I would listen to the scientists,\" he said last month. States rather than the president ultimately have the power to shut down and reopen their economies, as Trump has found to his frustration. But a new Oval Office stance on the virus could still be significant for the economy.</p><p>Beyond Covid, Biden has a number of Leftist policies he claims will help America \"build back better\".</p><p>He wants to almost double the federal minimum wage to $15 (\u00a311.27) an hour, up from $7.25. Many states already have a higher minimum wage but Biden is seeking to bring the US closer to pay floors seen elsewhere. \"It's going to hurt more rural populations where the minimum wage is not nearly that high and it would be an abrupt change,\" says Gallagher.</p><p>Workers will also be bolstered by his plans to make it easier to organise unions and collectively bargain, although some voters are likely to fear this will hit the country's famously dynamic labour market. He wants universal paid sick days and 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, while social security payments will be $200 higher per month.</p><p>Biden has promised to create 5m new jobs in manufacturing and innovation and has vowed to spend $2 trillion over four years on clean energy infrastructure, aiming for a carbonzero power industry by 2035. He has promised no new taxes on those earning less than $400,000, while Trump's corporate tax cuts will be partially reversed. The corporate tax rate will rise from 21pc to 28pc.</p><p>\"It's going to be the wealthy that are going to be paying the tax rises and you get more income for the poorer people,\" says James Knightley, ING chief international economist.</p><p>Trade policy is likely to become less combative while experts say the tech titans could face a clampdown amid rising competition worries.</p><p>Biden has not made tech regulation a key plank of his campaign as rivals such as Warren did, but the Democratic party has decisively shifted towards stricter rules on Silicon Valley behemoths.</p><p>Sam McGowan of Beacon Policy Advisors, a research firm focused on Washington, says a Biden administration is likely to reflect a growing scepticism of Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"If Biden wins, there's going to be a lot of influences out there that are going to shape the kinds of the policy that they're going to put in place. And I really think the conversation will shift towards more stringent enforcement.\" McGowan says that even if a Biden administration does not aim to break up Big Tech, it will certainly make predatory acquisitions harder and enforce competition.</p><p>However, Biden's Left-leaning agenda faces key hurdles. The 77-year old needs to win big against Trump to push through the most radical parts of his agenda.</p><p>The Democrats currently hold the House of Representatives but the other half of Congress, the Senate, is controlled by the Republicans. Many of Biden's economic plans would be scuppered unless the Democrats win the three or more seats needed to take the Senate.</p><p>\"One question is whether he might be limited by Congressional opposition. The battle for Senate control looks tight,\" says Philip Shaw, Investec economist.</p><p>Knightley says: \"If Biden gets a clean sweep and the Democrats win the House and Senate, we are going to see a very significant shift in policy. Much more taxation, more spending and more regulation of energy, financial services and big tech.\"</p><p>His ambitions could also be limited by the state of public finances he inherits. Trump was running high deficits at close to 5pc even before Covid struck and sent debt soaring.</p><p>\"When we get in, the pantry is going to be bare,\" warned Ted Kaufman, a leading figure in Biden's transition team. Economists also argue that his platform could be harmful for the economy in the longer term.</p><p>Gallagher says Biden's policies would slow the economy or limit its potential, despite rising in popularity among voters. \"It's not until the economy slows that these voters will abandon their support for all these changes,\" he says, highlighting Biden's healthcare and energy plans.</p><p>Shaw adds that Biden's tax pledges could have a significant impact on investor confidence, while the roaring recovery on the US stock market could be derailed by an antitrust crackdown.</p><p>Biden has framed the 2020 election as a \"battle for the soul of the nation\". His plans would be transformative for the world's largest economy - but polling suggests Americans may be reluctant to give up on Trump's vision just yet.</p><p>$15 The rate Biden will set the minimum wage if he wins office, up from $7.25 an hour $2 trillion The amount Biden has promised to spend on clean energy infrastructure in the next four years 39pc The percentage of Americans who believe the economy will get worse under a Biden presidency, according to a YouGov poll 5m The number of new jobs Biden has pledged to create in manufacturing and innovation 5pc The deficit Trump was flirting with before Covid struck, limiting Biden's room for manoeuvre</p><p>'If Biden gets a clean sweep we are going to see a significant shift in policy'</p><p>'It's going to be the wealthy that are going to be paying the tax rises'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>$15 The rate Biden will set the minimum wage if he wins office, up from $7.25 an hour5m The number of new jobs Biden has pledged to create in manufacturing and innovation39pc The percentage of Americans who believe the economy will get worse under a Biden presidency, according to a YouGov poll$2 trillion The amount Biden has promised to spend on clean energy infrastructure in the next four years5pc The deficit Trump was flirting with before Covid struck, limiting Biden's room for manoeuvre</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-162801994</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60R8-SHJ1-DYTY-C24J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1236\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 1, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Fourteen states voted in Tuesday's primaries, with the key states of Texas and California alone accounting for a combined 643 delegates.</p><p><br/>Former Vice President Joe Biden notched important wins early in the evening, taking Virginia and North Carolina, the third most delegate-rich state in Tuesday's contest. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders won his home state early in the night, but failed to carve out a foothold in the East Coast and Midwest.<br/>\"Just a few days ago the press and the pundits had declared this campaign dead,\" Biden announced in a triumphant speech mid-way through the evening. \"I am here to report, we are very much alive.\"<br/>As of 8:45 p.m. Pacific Time, Biden had collected Alabama, Arkansas, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Massachusetts and Virginia with Sanders taking Colorado, Utah and Vermont. At the time of writing, a winner has yet to be declared in Maine, Texas and California, with the latter state leaning toward Sanders.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Biden stormed into Super Tuesday with new momentum, fresh off a vital win in South Carolina over the weekend and some swiftly collected endorsements friom his former rivals, including Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke. That momentum created a spate of decisive victories for Biden, as the moderate vote appeared to flow easily to him, overwhelming Sanders in some states the Vermont senator was favored in, including Oklahoma, Minnesota and his neighboring state of Massachusetts.<br/>Lacking endorsements from former candidates but not momentum, Bernie Sanders entered Super Tuesday with 60 delegates to Biden's 54 and Elizabeth Warren's eight. His results in early voting states, consistent debate performances and grassroots support marked Sanders as the candidate to beat, but those strengths failed to translate into boosted turnout for Sanders in some key states.<br/>In spite of early narratives, delegate totals before Super Tuesday represented just a sliver of the 1,991 delegates necessary to secure the nomination at the Democratic National Convention this July. A total of 1357 delegates are up for grabs on Super Tuesday.<br/>\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Super Tuesday marked the first time Bloomberg appeared on a ballot, but his massive cash spend still resulted in an underwhelming night, with the former mayor only picking up a small handful of delegates in American Samoa. Former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg entered the formal race with more than $400 million spent on ads but zero delegates. Warren also underperformed Tuesday, with a more competitive race than anticipated even in her home state of Massachusetts, which ultimately went to Biden. Oklahoma also showed no loyalty for Warren, who was born in the state-after choosing Sanders in 2016, Oklahoma opted for Biden in Tuesday's contest.<br/>Tuesday's results will reshape the race for the Democratic nomination, much as Biden's long-promised win in South Carolina breathed new life into a flagging campaign. Beyond likely narrowing into a two-person race, the new dynamics emerging out of Tuesday will shift the framing of the contest as a whole. That change is likely to pit political Biden's promise of incremental political change more directly against Sanders and democratic socialism.<br/>The 2020 race has challenged the tech industry in more ways than one. With both Trump and Bloomberg stress-testing social platforms with a deluge of ads, tech companies are still trying to figure out where to draw their respective lines on political advertising. Those efforts are on top of the imperative for major platforms to avoid a repeat of 2016 by fending off coordinated disinformation campaigns seeking to roil Americans politics.<br/>Beyond platform manipulation concerns, candidates like Warren and Sanders successfully tapped into mainstream backlash against big tech over the course of their campaigns, cultivating even more criticism for companies already under scrutiny from other parts of the government. Depending on which wing of the party seals the nomination, tech could be facing a very different regulatory environment in the event of a Democratic win come November.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M-678882</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC4-VDX1-JBYT-H061-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"706\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 5, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX001377</classCode><className>PRIMARY ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

The battle for the Democratic nomination is early and fluid, and Biden has plenty of work ahead to hold his lead among Democrats in Iowa and nationally. But the two mens convergence in a state that has swung between Democrats and Republicans over the past two decades could offer a glimpse into what a Trump-Biden matchup would look like if the former vice president prevails in his quest for the nomination.  On Tuesday, Biden will criticize the presidents economic policy as hurting those very voters who helped elect him. Excerpts from Bidens prepared remarks: He thinks hes being tough. </p><p>Well, its easy to be tough when someone else is feeling the pain.  How many sleepless nights do you think Trump has had over what hes doing to Americas farmers? Zero. (AP)  BIDEN IN IOWA. When he first launched his presidential bid in April, Biden promised hed visit Iowa so often the state would be sick of him.Theyre still waiting. After making just four appearances during a two-day swing here in late April, Biden has been AWOL from a key early state thats accustomed to seeing presidential candidates in the flesh. Hell be returning to Iowa Tuesday and Wednesdayand recently announced plans to add 50 paid staffers in the state by the end of the monthbut Democratic officials say Biden has already fallen behind in organizing and needs to accelerate his efforts. (Politico)  Biden rolled out eight Iowa endorsements Tuesday, including Betty Brim-Hunter, Former Political Director, Iowa Federation of Labor; Teri Hawks Goodman, Community Leader; Bruce Hunter, State Representative; Jim Lykam, State Senator; Mary Maloney, Polk County Treasurer; Jackie Norris, President  CEO, Goodwill of Central Iowa; Former Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff to First Lady Michelle Obama; Tom Powers, Former Councilman, City of Waterloo; and Ken Runde, Former Dubuque County Sheriff  Obama Administration United States Marshal. release)  MORE BIDEN. A month after Biden announced his bid for president, several Fox News stars have already begun quietly pushing rumors that the 76-year-old ex-veep is in poor health. Since the end of May, Fox Business Network and Fox News star Lisa Kennedy Montgomery and Fox News prime-time host Sean Hannity have speculated on-air, on at least four separate occasions, that the current Democratic presidential frontrunner is secretly dealing with health issues, often comparing his condition to illness-related conspiracy theories the network pushed about Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election. (Daily Beast)  Bidens reversal on his decades-long support for a law that prohibits using federal funds to pay for abortions could bring him more in line with Democratic primary voters, according to a new POLITICO/Morning Consult poll (June 7-9; 1,991 RVs, +/- 2%). Nearly a third of voters who say they plan to participate in a Democratic presidential primary or caucus, 32%, say they are more likely to vote for Biden after he changed his position on the Hyde Amendment Just 19% of potential Democratic primary voters say Bidens flip-flop makes them less likely to vote for him. (Politico)  Biden, speaking at a fundraiser in D.C., reiterated his call to work with Republicans: With Trump gone youre going to begin to see things change. Because these folks know better. They know this isnt what theyre supposed to be doing. (release)  BETO. \"It grates every time Antonia Morales and Romelia Mendoza hear former Rep. Beto ORourke (D-TX) talk about the awful plight of immigrants. Its not that theyre unsympathetic to the families coming across the border in record numbers. They are immigrants themselves and live a few blocks from the line between Texas and their native Mexico. What infuriates the two women is that the homegrown presidential candidate wont talk about themthe last two residents living in the path of an arena that wealthy developers backedeven though O'Rourke helped put their immigrant neighborhood in Duranguito in the crosshairs for redevelopment when he served on the El Paso City Council. While ORourke touts a sweeping new immigration plan on the campaign trail, back in his old council district there is a giant chain link fence, wrapped in green mesh and covered with no trespassing warnings, surrounding the heart of Duranguito. Inside sit crumbling artifacts of El Pasos historycherished by activists and preservationists, but standing in the way, arena proponents say, of its future. (Texas Tribune)  ORourkes campaign released a voter registration toolkit to empower more people to engage in their democracy by providing them the resources they need to register themselves and members of their communities to vote. (release)  BULLOCK. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock (D) has been barnstorming across western Iowa, telling caucus goers wherever he can find them that he's the one who can beat Trump in 2020. But Bullock won't have the opportunity to make that case before a national audience later this month at the first Democratic primary debate. A new rule announced last week by the Democratic National Committee disqualified a Washington Post/ABC poll that had previously been included in the debate qualification criteria. (CBS News)  BUTTIGIEG. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) will give a major address on his national security and foreign policy platform Tuesday morning at Indiana University, delving into details on a policy front that offers presidents wide latitude but which has gotten relatively little attention from Democratic 2020 candidates so far. It could be a standout issue for Buttigieg, a former Navy intelligence officer who served in Afghanistan and is the only veteran polling in the top half of the Democratic presidential primary. And its also a topic that Buttigieg can frame in general election terms by contrasting himself with Trump, whom Buttigieg has criticized for making up a disability to get out of serving during the Vietnam War. (Politico)  Buttigieg has picked up one of the most influential Hollywood financiers as a backer, as he continues to surge in the 2020 fundraising battle.  Nicole Avant, one of President Barack Obamas lead bundlers during his first run for president, has decided shes going all-in to back Buttigiegs run for president. (CNBC) CASTRO. Former HUD Secretary Julian Castro (D) wants to eliminate lead poisoning. He laid out the first dedicated plan on the issue of any 2020 candidate after a visit to Flint, Michigan, over the weekend.  Castro is proposing to set up a presidential task force on lead, which would be charged with eliminating lead poisoning as a major public health threat, and the plan would include a national assessment of communities at risk of lead poisoning. (BuzzFeed)  GILLIBRAND. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) said Monday that it hit the 65,000 unique donor threshold to help her shore up her spot on this months' debate stage, a mark the campaign reached after spending heavily on Facebook ads this past week. Gillibrand's campaign spent more than $200,000 on Facebook ads between June 2 and June 8, according to the platform's Ad Library.(NBC News)  Gillibrand will return to New Hampshire this weekend, and will hold several meet  greets across the state as well as headline a New Hampshire Young Democrats grassroots fundraiser along with Connie Britton. (release)  HARRIS. Five years before a major scandal on her watch as San Francisco district attorney, Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) confronted a choice that pitted two of her most important constituencies against each other. Aides to Ms. Harris in 2005 recommended adopting a policy popular among progressive criminal-justice reformers to disclose past misconduct by law enforcement in order to help ensure defendants received a fair trial. At the same time, police unions, who were already critical of the novice politician, opposed such a move as invasive and unnecessary. Harris didnt enact the policy at the time. That ended up backfiring years later in 2010, when her offices lack of whats known as a Brady policy was central in a scandal in which around 1,000 criminal cases were dismissed and a judge criticized Ms. Harris for violating defendants rights. She backtracked and enacted a policy in the aftermath. (Wall Street Journal)  WARREN. As the 23 candidates seeking the Democratic nomination struggle to distinguish themselves, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has set herself apart with a series of sweeping proposals that would significantly remake the American economy, covering everything from tax policy to student debt relief and offering a detailed portrait of what her presidency might look like. Many of the proposals from Ms. Warren, a former Harvard law professor and hawk on financial regulation, could face a difficult path to winning over moderates in a general election, and to gaining approval in Congress if she did take the White House. But the sheer volume of her plans, and their detail and variety, is forcing her rivals to play catch-up and stake out their own positions.  A review of the policy rollouts the 2020 Democrats have made since entering the race shows that Ms. Warren has issued the largest number of detailed plans among the major candidates  roughly 20 in all, on subjects as varied as Big Tech regulation, housing costs and Pentagon contracting. Most of her rivals have released fewer than half a dozen; Biden, who leads in early polling, has issued only two. But Ms. Warren has already drawn criticism from centrists and conservatives who say her plans  many calling for new regulationswould hurt business and the economy, stifle innovation and potentially harm the very workers they were intended to help. (New York Times)  Warren and Sanders are vying to become the progressive alternative to Biden, a competition thats especially pivotal in the Midwest. The region is critical to Democratic hopes of regaining the White House in 2020, and Sanders campaign wrote in an April memo that hes by far the best positioned candidate to win in three upper Midwest states that handed Trump the White House.

But it will look very different from the globalisation of the 1990s. Even if the US recommits to a rules- based order, the conflict over what the rules should be will become much fiercer. </p><p>Both Trump's trade war and the immediate impulse from the pandemic have been about repatriating production. Post- Trump, the fight will shift from where production is located to how it is carried out. Welcome to the new trade policy: trade promotion, but in the service of extending the reach of the three blocs who set the rules - the US, EU and China.</p><p>Signs of this shift already abound. The update of the North American Free Trade Agreement made Mexico's preferential access to the automaker supply chain conditional on paying workers in its car industry higher wages. </p><p>The EU's trade deal with the Mercosur bloc will impose requirements ranging from animal welfare standards to respecting the Paris agreement on climate change. Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative aims to tie countries into Chinese trade and financial networks.</p><p>Smaller econ- omies are squeezed when big trading blocs insist on their standards. Emerging countries have little choice but to acquiesce to the demands of the world's biggest markets. Even sizeable national economies can be caught in the squeeze, as demonstrated by the UK's illusory hope to have close trade relations with both the EU and the US, while being completely free to set whatever standards it likes.</p><h>Aligning sectors </h><p>What is new is that countries are increasingly forced to align entire sectors with one of the big blocs. In the past, when trade was mostly in basic commodities and finished industrial goods, exporters could adjust production to each foreign market. But, for many reasons, rules increasingly cover the whole process of production.</p><p>Take the growing trade in services, which even physical goods, such as software-rich cars, now embody. That raises the stakes for the three big blocs to make sure it is their rules that are chosen. Demands for countries to make a choice will not go away with Trump.</p><p>Tensions will rise even in the area where America's return to the fold is most welcome. A Biden White House would recommit the US to the Paris agreement and may pursue an ambitious climate change policy at home. Biden promises carbon border taxes on imports from countries that are deemed to be \"cheating on their climate commitments\", a policy the EU also intends to introduce. </p><p>But making peace with Europe risks confrontation with China. It clears the field for a reunited west to form a \"carbon club\" demanding Beijing cracks down on its emissions or lose market access. </p><p>There are many possible outcomes of the looming regulatory battles. One is harmonisation: countries agree on similar (or similar enough) rules. This is the model of European economic integration, but is extremely unlikely on a global scale. </p><p>A second outcome is that countries outside the blocs are deeply absorbed into the sphere they are economically closest to. This creates dilemmas for economies close to more than one - think Latin America choosing between China and the US, or Africa between China and Europe. </p><p>A third is splintering. In some areas, the rule books of the three main trading blocs are irreconcilable and will probably remain so. This seems true of personal data processing, where Europeans prioritise consumers over digital producers, the US favours Big Tech, and China facilitates state surveillance.</p><h>Brussels effect </h><p>But a final, more optimistic, possibility is that countries converge on the most demanding standards. Under this \"Brussels effect\", countries sometimes adopt European-style rules because, once their companies satisfy them, they can typically also export to other markets. </p><p>The previous phase of globalisation was often criticised for triggering a race to the bottom.

Why? Because that is what the Democratic Party has become, a radical leftwing party. Think about it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">See you next time on LIFE, LIBERTY &amp; LEVIN.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: Welcome to WATTERS' WORLD, I'm Jesse Watters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Trump turnaround. That's the subject of tonight's Watters' Words.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You can feel the momentum shift in the presidential race. It showed up in the polls, too, in key battleground states. Take a look at the screen.</p><p>See, they show a consistent shift across the board to the President. Six point shift towards Trump in PA, four points to. Trump in Arizona, four point shift towards Trump in Florida, two points towards Trump in Michigan, one towards Trump in Wisconsin. Although a two point shift towards Biden in North Carolina, maybe that's why the President was there the other day.</p><p>Forget about the national polls. It's all about the battlegrounds anyway. Most pollsters are under sampling Republicans as high as 10 points. They do that just to depress turnout. Don't fall for it.</p><p>And just a little perspective, Hillary was beating Trump in every single battleground state going into the 2016 election. What happened? Hillary lost every single battleground state.</p><p>In addition, national polls showed Hillary crushing Trump. National polls showed John Kerry crushing Bush. National polls should Dukakis crushing Bush's dad, 41. And only two insurgent candidates knocked off an incumbent in the last 40 years. Rock Star Ronald Reagan and the politically gifted Bill Clinton with a little help from Ross Perot.</p><p>Biden, he doesn't have anywhere near that kind of talent and that's why he is hiding.</p><p>The President has been a lot more focused on the last two weeks. He has brought back the Coronavirus Briefings, addressing the nation six times from the Briefing Room. His tone is more serious, realistic and steady.</p><p>He's made major announcements about restocking the National PPE Stockpiles depleted under Obama-Biden. The vaccine trial phase is smashing all records. The therapeutics have been effective in the early stages and hospitalizations and mortality rates slashed in half.</p><p>And the President also announced the U.S. will soon become pharmaceutically independent, meaning we will be producing enough medical ingredients to keep our supply chain here in America.</p><p>He is punishing China for unleashing the virus on the world, while Joe Biden says nothing about the communist threat. The President beefed up his travel schedule, too, visiting Florida, Texas, North Carolina, Georgia and Maryland just in the last few weeks. Leaving the White House and visiting oil rigs, military facilities and medical plants.</p><p>Now Biden, he stays home in Delaware pretty much, maybe visits nearby Pennsylvania, but that's it. Don't buy the hype about Biden winning from his basement either.</p><p>He held a virtual speech the other day. Look at the bottom of the screen right here, put that up. Only 247 people were watching. No one cares what he has to say.</p><p>Schools are opening safely. The President allocating over $100 billion to safely do that. Biden, he wants schools closed. Businesses closed and churches closed before the election. That's just not going to cut it here in America.</p><p>The anarchists in Portland, they're being put down by Federal agents. Finally, the Oregon Governor stepped up to stop the violence. She is sending state and local police to help the Feds protect the Federal Courthouse and the Federal agents will remain in Portland to protect that courthouse until the streets are calm.</p><p>Bill Barr's taskforces had been activated in cities that are seeing spikes in homicides. They'll be working with local police departments to stop illegal gun trafficking, narcotics trafficking and gang violence.</p><p>Biden, he doesn't have a clue how to keep the streets safe. He could barely muster up a response to the anarchy in the first place.</p><p>This is a base election -- all about turnout. Trump's base is twice as fired up as Joe's base is. In fact, Joe doesn't really have a base. Have you ever seen a Biden bumper sticker anywhere? They don't exist.</p><p>Biden's base is basically borrowed Bernie Bros and Trump haters. There's no love for Joe Biden. In fact, the squad may not even vote for Joe. Biden is having trouble with blacks. He is having trouble with Hispanics. He is having trouble with young voters. That's why Biden's going so far left.</p><p>His is radical on trade, taxes, immigration and healthcare, and doesn't have a clue how to run a business or how to confront China. That's why Biden is desperate to rally the radical left and let slip this week that he himself is radical left. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE BIDEN (D), PRESUMPTIVE DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: I think I have laid out the most detailed plans on the economy, and on issues relating to healthcare and the rest of any President in modern history.</p><p>I mean it's awful detail -- if I'm elected and this passes, I'm going to go down as the most progressive President in American history.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So the President doesn't have to stretch too far to paint Biden as left because Biden just admitted it. But Biden doesn't know who he is. He'll just read whatever you put in front of them. He doesn't even know what year it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN: We had a relatively small population, and we called it at the time, Hispanic population, mostly Puerto Ricans, American citizens already. But you know, in the 2020 census, which is now two censuses ago, soon to be --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Huh? Biden has always been a joke. He has run for President three times. He is a plagiarist. He is a hair sniffer. He's a national punchline, always has been.</p><p>Barack Obama didn't trust him to do anything. The two things he put Biden in charge of: the stimulus and Ukraine corruption. He fell flat on his face both.</p><p>So don't believe the lies you hear from the media or in social media about a Biden victory. This is going to be a very close election. But President Trump still has the edge.</p><p>Here with reaction, Fox News contributor, Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent and NYPD officer.</p><p>All right, Dan, what do you think about the analysis there at the top?</p><p>DAN BONGINO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CONTRIBUTOR: I think you really made a great point, a pretty brilliant point. The only time and the last, you know, post-World War II really that an incumbent has lost in in our lifetimes has been the Bill Clinton, you know, Ross Perot, George H.W. election, and Ronald Reagan.</p><p>And your point that you followed up there where you said, listen, Bill Clinton was a gifted politician. I worked for him, you know, as a Secret Service and he had skills. You may not agree with his politics, but he had a way to make you feel like the most important person in the room.</p><p>Reagan was just the Dynamo. That speaks for itself.</p><p>Biden, you're right, is neither one of these and here's what's worse, if I may add on to your excellent story there. You like that, right?</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I love it. Keep going.</p><p>BONGINO: We always throw the compliment to the show host.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>BONGINO: Here's the problem with Biden, not only is he terrible, he has obviously got issues, you know, listen, I'm not going to evaluate the guy with his psychological situation, but I mean, in fairness, he is going to be holding the nuclear codes and the guy doesn't know where he is.</p><p>I mean, he doesn't know what state he is in. He gets lost in the middle of an interview.</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>BONGINO: But not just is he bad, it's that who he attaches himself to via President Obama was terrible, too. Jesse, listen, nobody -- everybody gets what happened with the virus. That was the problem with the economy. Nobody, no sane person wants to go back to the Obama economy.</p><p>So he is bad and who he attaches himself to is even worse. He has got nowhere to go.</p><p>WATTERS: So do you think these are the four pillars of the reelection if the President confronts China, focuses on rebuilding the economy, keeps the streets safe, and basically tells Joe, you know, you can't even handle selling lemonade at a lemonade stand.</p><p>If he can do that, with the curveball thrown in because the vaccine is a curveball, Durham is a curveball, some sort of manufacturer October surprise from the fake news, that'll be a curveball. Is that how you see things shaping up in the next three months?</p><p>BONGINO: You know, I do. I just -- I'm torn on how much he should even pay attention to Biden. I know that sounds crazy. One side of me says, listen, chaos is never a message. Right? And Biden is the chaos candidate. There's no doubt about that.</p><p>Chaos. He doesn't know where he is. He doesn't even know he is running for President. He is clearly behind at a minimum, the redirecting funds from the police movement. I don't care what euphemism you want to use. He said it himself.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, that sunk him.</p><p>BONGINO: He is clearly behind economic chaos with his tax hikes and stuff, but then the other side of me, Jesse says, the more you beat up on Biden, people almost feel bad for him. And Jesse, let's be candid. Does anybody really believe Biden is going to be President? The answer is no.</p><p>Either he loses the election or he wins, and nobody thinks he is the President anyway. It is going to be the Vice President and the Cabinet. So they've got to get that delicate balance where you don't make people feel bad for him, but you do point out the fact that this guy is absolutely the chaos candidate.</p><p>Your life will be an economic and street chaos if he is elected.</p><p>WATTERS: All right, Dan Bongino with the excellent analysis. Thank you very much.</p><p>BONGINO: Good to see.</p><p>WATTERS: Powerful CEOs grilled on Capitol Hill running the Big Tech deals. The head of Amazon, Facebook, Apple and Google hit for censorship and bias against conservatives.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ (R-FL): It is possible that at Facebook, your employees do have the power to disadvantage conservative viewpoints.</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, Facebook: People make mistakes. People have some of their own goals some of the times.</p><p>GAETZ: There is either a little component or there is not a manual component, which is it?</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, GOOGLE, CEO: Creating those lists that process can involve a manual portion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Joining me now, Florida Congressman, Matt Gaetz and author of the upcoming book, \"Firebrand: Dispatches from the Frontlines of the MAGA Revolution,\" which is now available for preorder.</p><p>All right, so Congressman, you basically got these Big Tech executives to admit that they can have employees go rogue, censor conservatives, rewire and re-engineer sites to censor conservatives, and they don't have any idea what's going on under their own nose.</p><p>GAETZ: Big Tech used to tell us that it was just glitches in the algorithm that caused bias and mistreatment of conservatives. But now we see there are blacklists and deep inside the heart of every Silicon Valley woke- topian may beat the heart of an online tyrant.</p><p>And when you have those folks with that type of power, it does not give us the freedom, the democracy, the engagement that we deserve in a country as great as America.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, and you guys have to threaten to bust up these monopolies if they don't play fair. You had -- I can't believe you're not on this committee because you're on every single committee, but Fauci was getting grilled by a bunch of your colleagues the other day. And here's Jim Jordan kind of giving it to Fauci.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Can the government limit the protesting?</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I don't think that's relevant to --</p><p>JORDAN: Well, you just said, if it increases the spread of the virus, I'm just asking, should we limit it?</p><p>FAUCI: Well, I'm not in a position to determine what the government can do in a forceful way.</p><p>JORDAN: No limit to protests, but, boy, you can't go to church on Sunday.</p><p>FAUCI: I don't know how many times I can answer that. I'm not going to opine on limiting anything. I'm just going to tell you --</p><p>JORDAN: You've opined on a lot of things, Dr. Fauci.</p><p>FAUCI: Yes, but I've never said --</p><p>JORDAN: This is something that directly impacts the spread of the virus and I'm asking your position on the protests.</p><p>FAUCI: Yes, I'm -- well, I'm not going to opine on limiting anything --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: All right, Congressman, a very smart guy, Dr. Fauci, but it seems like he's wearing thin with some of your colleagues. Is that true?</p><p>GAETZ: Yes. After watching that, I wondered whether or not churchgoers should just adopt the language of the protesters. Maybe we can have potluck protests or Sunday school sit-ins.</p><p>Maybe instead of giving our donations through tithes, we can just count that as bail money to release our eternal souls.</p><p>Jim Jordan pointed out that we don't get to choose the parts of the First Amendment that the government is going to allow and not allow, and though this is an uncommon virus, it should not deprive public health officials of basic commonsense.</p><p>WATTERS: Right. I mean, both protected under the First Amendment, but they're playing games with the rhetoric and the regulations.</p><p>All right, Barack Obama, I guess made some news, came out and said some pretty wild stuff at the funeral of the former Congressman the other day. This is what he said about nuking the filibuster. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: By ending some of the partisan gerrymandering so that all voters have the power to choose their politicians, not the other way around.</p><p>And if all this takes eliminating the filibuster, another Jim Crow relic, in order to secure the God-given rights of every American, then that's what we should do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: All right, so there everybody at the Lewis funeral gave him a big round of applause. So that's the game now. If Biden wins and they retake the Senate, they already have the House. They nuke that filibuster, man, they could add D.C. as a state. That could really tip the balance of power.</p><p>They could expand the Supreme Court, Congressman. They could go after guns. They could do anything they want and just jam a radical agenda down everyone's throat. Are people prepared for that?</p><p>GAETZ: Well, you know, when you look at Barack Obama, I guess it's surprising and confusing, that he is such a fan of Jim Crow relics, because it was Senator Obama in 2005, on President Bush's judicial nominations, and again in 2006, when Justice Alito was nominated, who said that the filibuster was necessary and important to debate in the Senate.</p><p>So, you know, maybe he was more willing to embrace Jim Crow relics as a senator than he is as a former President. But gosh, you know, John Lewis is someone who just should be celebrated outside of politics of -- you know, at his funeral.</p><p>I didn't really think that it was appropriate to be talking about the intricacies of redistricting and the filibuster while honoring a great American icon like John Lewis.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, they lecture Republicans about decorum. All right, there he is, Congressman Matt Gaetz, best hair in Congress. I don't know --</p><p>GAETZ: You've got the best hair on Fox News, Jesse, so what a combo.</p><p>WATTERS: What a combo. I just don't have your hairdryer. I've got to save some money for that.</p><p>GAETZ: I'll send one to Emma.</p><p>WATTERS: Please do.</p><p>Damning documents unsealed in the Epstein-Maxwell case where we just confirmed about Bill Clinton on Epstein Island, and the long list of failures at the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice.</p><p>But first Mark Levin breaks down the other hearing on Capitol Hill that went off the rails.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Can we take a five-minute break, Mr. Chairman?</p><p>REP. JERROLD NADLER (D-NY): No.</p><p>BARR: You're a real class act. You're a real class act.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Tensions running high on Capitol Hill this week as Attorney General Bill Barr clashed with House Judiciary Democrats on a slew of issues.</p><p>They repeatedly talked over Barr and interrupted, even though they were the ones who invited him to testify in the first place.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARR: I gave instructions as to what the --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Reclaiming my time.</p><p>BARR: Yes. I'm answering your question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You've got to let him answer.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am reclaiming my time.</p><p>BARR: We were not taking down public health orders. We were making narrow --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The gentleman's time is --</p><p>BARR: We are calling attention --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Will you restore my time because this witness is speaking over my time.</p><p>REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): Mr. Barr, I just asked for a yes or no, so let me just tell you a -- I'm starting to lose my temper.</p><p>BARR: I'm very -- I am aware of protesters in the Federal government.</p><p>JAYAPAL: Excuse me, Mr. Barr, this is my time and I control it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'll get to that, Mr. Barr.</p><p>BARR: I mean, does it have to be --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Barr, I will get to that. Reclaiming my time. You answered the question.</p><p>BARR: Okay.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I have another question for you. On June 19, 2020.</p><p>BARR: Actually, I need to answer that question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Attorney General, you did answer the question.</p><p>BARR: No, you said under penalty of perjury. I'm going to answer the damn question.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Barr, if I may.</p><p>BARR: Yes, but this is a hearing, I thought I was the one that was supposed to be heard.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: House Democrats interrupting the A.G. at least 29 times exclaiming reclaiming my time.</p><p>Mark Levin tweeting this, \"House Judiciary Committee Democrats, I've never seen a bigger bunch of [bleep] holes.\"</p><p>There's no other way to put it more accurately. Here to elaborate, the host of \"Life, Liberty &amp; Levin,\" Mark Levin.</p><p>I mean, I was talking to Gutfeld about this, Mark. Gutfeld said if he was there, he would have jumped over the table and just rapped these Democrats straight across the face. I don't know how Bill Barr didn't just lose it up there. That was just despicable.</p><p>LEVIN: I've never seen a senior official of any administration ever treated like that. And I've been around a while. I was chief of staff to Attorney General Meese who was abused, but not like this.</p><p>This hearing should have been how do we come together as a nation to put down rioters who are trying to overthrow the country, Marxist anarchists, whether they're Black Lives Matter or Antifa, but that's not how it works.</p><p>The Democratic Party is all in on this radical hardcore agenda and so that they're beating up on the Attorney General.</p><p>Furthermore, this Attorney General is trying to get the bottom of the of the horrific corruption in the Obama administration, the abuse of the F.B.I., the abuse of the Intelligence Agencies, the abuse of the FISA Court, lying to the American people, leaking to the press, and the Attorney General is trying to get to the bottom of that with Durham, and so they're trying to soften him up and ruin his reputation when that information comes out.</p><p>This is a disgrace.</p><p>WATTERS: I think they've just destroyed the hearing process. They've destroyed the appropriations process. They're trying to destroy the electoral process. You saw what they did with the impeachment process.</p><p>It's just a nuclear war on everything and yet, they lecture us about the dignity of the office.</p><p>So this is Barack Obama, who was at John Lewis's funeral the other day, and he really politicized it. I just want you to listen to what he said and then we can react. Roll it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>OBAMA: There are those in power who are doing their best darndest to discourage people from voting, by closing polling locations and targeting minorities and students with restrictive ID laws and attacking our voting rights with surgical precision, even undermining the Postal Service in the run up to an election that's going to be dependent on mail-in ballots, so people don't get sick.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: So this was just a gross manipulation of a funeral to basically accuse a sitting President of taking direct aim at black voting rights, when all the President really wants to do is make sure that there's integrity in the election. I thought that's what the Democrats wanted -- was election integrity.</p><p>And he said he wanted to go after the filibuster and nuke that, too.</p><p>LEVIN: First of all, I'm utterly confused. I thought people weren't allowed to have funerals. I thought there was a case brought to the Supreme Court where churches aren't allowed to have more than 10 people in one of these states, but casinos could have 50.</p><p>And John Roberts and the liberals on the court said, no, we're not taking up that case.</p><p>So there are funerals and then their funerals, I guess, look, Barack Obama is a pathological liar. They're trying to set the stage if it's a close election of one or two battleground states, that it's systemic racism. They've been laying this foundation for months and months and months.</p><p>No, every vote doesn't count. Every legal vote counts. And that's the point. And when you're asking somebody for ID, it's not a big deal, because somebody need an ID to get into that church and to attend that service.</p><p>We need ID all over the country for a thousand different reasons. And so what? You have to actually vote.</p><p>Now, my problem is this. They're talking about it that the President even raised the possibility, well, maybe we have to put the vote off a little but he is trying to poke them in the eye and so forth.</p><p>I have a legitimate question, I think, if Joe Biden is going to hide in the basement and if it's good enough for him, then how the hell are we supposed to vote on Election Day? Should we all be hiding in the basement?</p><p>And we all know that the mail-in vote won't work. There have been studies. CBS recently did something that showed it. We're going to rely on the Post Office?</p><p>Whatever the Democrats want, it's because they're corrupt. They are tearing down and burning down every institutional aspect of this society, every check and balance of this society.</p><p>And remember, they wanted to get rid of the Electoral College, too.</p><p>WATTERS: That's right.</p><p>LEVIN: I would say this to Barack Obama. You're one of the great reasons in this country where there is a huge racial divide, and you could have been a great leader. You could have been a great leader of the American people of all races, but you couldn't put aside your community activism.</p><p>I would just say this, you're a pathological liar. Let Joe Biden run his own race. You're not going to carry him across the finish line anyway.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes. It's just ironic that the President who cheated in the last election by spying on Trump is now accusing Trump of planning to cheat in the next election. Unbelievable, Mark.</p><p>Mark Levin, watch his Sunday show, a huge hit and very provocative language on Twitter from Mr. Levin. Very Trump-esque.</p><p>Follow Mark on Twitter. Thanks, Mark.</p><p>LEVIN: It happens.</p><p>WATTERS: Sports are back in the United States of America. We'll show you who is kneeling and who is standing for the anthem. Mike Ditka, running out of the tunnel, all fired up on that.</p><p>Also Bill Clinton partied on Pedophile Island. That's according to new bombshell documents just unsealed. Stay tuned.</p><p>JACKIE IBANEZ, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Live from \"America's News Headquarters,\" I'm Jackie Ibanez in New York.</p><p>Isaias continues to hammer parts of the Bahamas with its eyes set on the Florida Coast right now. The tropical storm is threatening to complicate areas already hit hard by the coronavirus, residents bracing for torrential rain, storm surge and high winds. Warnings and emergency declarations already issued for Florida's Eastern Coast.</p><p>As of now, Governor DeSantis does not believe the storm will require the use of shelters, but warns that things can change quickly.</p><p>Meanwhile, wildfires in Southern California prompting more than 200 evacuations. The blaze named the Apple Fire is raging across more than 1,900 acres of land and is currently 75 miles east of Los Angeles.</p><p>Firefighters are hoping to contain most of the fire by tomorrow morning.</p><p>I'm Jackie Ibanez, now back to WATTERS' WORLD.</p><p>For all of your headlines, log on to foxnews.com.</p><p>You're watching the most powerful name in news, Fox News Channel.</p><p>WATTERS: Bombshell revelations in the Jeffrey Epstein case. Newly unsealed documents from Epstein victim Virginia Roberts Giuffre's 2015 deposition shed light on the dead pedophile's big name connections and detailing her torture at the hands of Ghislaine Maxwell.</p><p>The documents put Bill Clinton on Epstein Island in the company of two underage girls, claim Roberts Giuffre was trafficked to Prince Andrew when she was just 17 and implicate famed attorney. Alan Dershowitz and former New Mexico Governor, Bill Richardson among several other prominent men who allegedly took part in the sexual abuse of underage girls.</p><p>The documents also show that Maxwell and Epstein kept in contact as recently as 2015, shooting down her claims and any credibility she may have had in court.</p><p>Epstein telling her, you have done nothing wrong and I would urge you to start acting like it. Go outside, head high, not as an escaping convict. Go to parties. Deal with it.</p><p>Clinton, Prince Andrew, Dershowitz and Richardson have all previously denied involvement in the sex trafficking situation.</p><p>Here to unpack all of this, Fox News legal analyst Gregg Jarrett has been pouring over the documents.</p><p>All right, Gregg. So it looks like -- so you have this alleged underage sex trafficking victim who says she saw Bill Clinton on Pedophile Island while underage girls were there and that's not the first person who has fingered Bill Clinton for being there.</p><p>We had a Netflix documentary, one of the maintenance men said he saw Bill Clinton there. We've had a private investigator on WATTERS' WORLD say Bill Clinton was on the jet with women dressed provocatively, and Bill Clinton denies this. He says he has never been there.</p><p>But I don't know, Gregg, I don't know.</p><p>GREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL LEGAL ANALYST: Well, there's no smoking gun in this document, Jesse and as a consequence of that, you know, I would urge some measure of caution.</p><p>Here's why, because as I read this testimony from Giuffre, what I see is vague, ambiguous statements. I see self-contradictory statements, and I see most of all, hearsay, which is inherently unreliable.</p><p>You're right, at one point, she says she saw Bill Clinton on the island, though she said she saw nothing inappropriate with regards to Bill Clinton. But at another point, she seems to be saying, well, she just heard that Bill Clinton was on the island and you're correct to point out that Clinton has repeatedly said, I was at his apartment once in New York. I was on his plane once. I have never been to the island.</p><p>So you know, I would counsel, caution here.</p><p>WATTERS: Listen. He says he's never been on the island. We've had a couple of people say he was on the island.</p><p>JARRETT: Right.</p><p>WATTERS: There's no way to prove it, except, well, they have footage of every single room on that damn island that the F.B.I. went in there and seized.</p><p>I don't know why the F.B.I. doesn't do more about this case, because the F.B.I. was investigating these victims, actually stopped investigating some of the victims when they cut a hole sweetheart deal in 2008.</p><p>At the time, Mueller was F.B.I. Director, Alberto Gonzales, Michael Mukasey were Attorney Generals. Alex Acosta, U.S. Attorney at the time. You know, it's ugly, I don't like it. It's ugly, and it stinks.</p><p>JARRETT: Well, as you well know, I'm no fan of the F.B.I. You know, I think people like James Comey, Andrew McCabe, and Peter Strzok ruined the good name and reputation of the vast majority of the hard working honest and honorable people there.</p><p>But the other thing that's sort of a red flag to me, Jesse, is that Virginia Giuffre -- you know, she spent years talking to the F.B.I. telling them her story, and yet no charges arose from her allegation.</p><p>She is not one of the named three alleged victims in the current case against Ghislaine Maxwell. So, you know, as a defense attorney, that raises a significant red flag as to her credibility. As for somebody --</p><p>WATTERS: I don't think it does and let me tell you why. Because a lot of people, they go into these negotiations and if you're going to get a $10 million, $20 million, $30 million settlement to drop any sort of criminal charges, you might take the money. I think a lot of people would take the money.</p><p>JARRETT: You have just raised a red flag on your own argument taking money as a motive to lie and that is often presented in court to damage the credibility of an accuser.</p><p>WATTERS: Sure. But it's also --</p><p>JARRETT: And sometimes, it's quite true.</p><p>WATTERS: It's also trying to settle your life and get back to normal after you've been put through hell.</p><p>JARRETT: Absolutely.</p><p>WATTERS: By adults who've allegedly sex trafficked you all over the world repeatedly with celebrities, politicians, and royalty. So a lot of people just need to get their life back on track.</p><p>All right, Gregg Jarrett, thank you very much.</p><p>JARRETT: Okay.</p><p>WATTERS: Social media trying to silence the President's son, but boy, did that backfire. Donald Trump Jr. joins us to respond.</p><p>WATTERS: It pains me to say this, but Democrats have done something very, very smart. They launched this campaign in Silicon Valley for these tech giants to root out hate speech and misinformation.</p><p>But the Democrats in D.C. agree with the Democrats in Silicon Valley that they hate speech and the misinformation it only comes from conservatives.</p><p>Hate speech is basically anything that offends a Democrat and misinformation is anything a Democrat disagrees with.</p><p>So these PC police types and the fact checkers and the mainstream media, they get on these platforms, and they build these speech walls against conservative speech and these walls keep closing in.</p><p>The Democrats can -- they can talk about misinformation all day long, like the Russia hoax and they don't pay a price.</p><p>Donald Trump Jr. knows this well. He was just suspended from Twitter for sharing a video by a group of doctors about potential coronavirus treatments. Twitter claims he violated their rules.</p><p>Joining me now the President's son and Executive VP at the Trump Organization and author of the book \"Liberal Privilege,\" which is available for preorder, Donald Trump Jr.</p><p>So Don, explained to me this is, so a Yale epidemiologist, he says that hydroxychloroquine can be effective in early stages of coronavirus. So if you retweet a doctor who agrees with the Yale guy, how is that misinformation? Isn't that just a second opinion?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP JR., EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, TRUMP ORGANIZATIONS: Well, I think that's what's called science, right? Science -- certain things aren't definitive. They argue back and forth, and I thought as an American, that that kind of discourse is what actually makes us American, to be able to have a dissenting opinion.</p><p>Twitter -- the great doctors at Twitter of which I believe there are none have decided that one doctor is more right than another group of doctors. I want to hear all sides, and that was what was interesting about my tweet, which is, I didn't say, everyone else was wrong. This is right.</p><p>I just go. Wow. You know, Jesse, this is really interesting. This is so different than the narrative that they've been jamming down my throat for the last three months. We should probably hear that. That was enough to get me thrown off Twitter.</p><p>Now, they didn't have a problem. Twitter did not have a problem with the Chinese government literally spreading coronavirus disinformation. There's an article in \"The Hill\" where they say no, the Chinese government spreading coronavirus disinformation, which by the way probably cost millions of people's their lives over the course of the world. Right? That does not violate their rules.</p><p>The Ayatollah Khomeini talking about death to Israel, you know, and genocide, that doesn't violate the rules. Me saying, I don't know, maybe you should hear from a couple of doctors who have a disagreement on this that are actually treating patients in the field. My father retweeting a meme. You know, that's enough to get us thrown off of these platforms. And that's the problem.</p><p>Big Tech is activist liberal. They are out there putting their hand and it's a very powerful hand, more powerful probably than any hand in modern history, weighing the scales down in favor of the left.</p><p>You notice, you've not heard of a single leftist, no matter whether it is moderate left or some of the radical, you know, crazy people you're seeing so much of these days on the left. You've never seen them thrown off the platform. You've never seen them suspended. You've never seen them demonetized.</p><p>WATTERS: Right.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: You don't -- you know, they don't have the same in-boxing problems.</p><p>WATTERS: Well, Don, that's because they believe --</p><p>TRUMP JR.: The Gmail and Google.</p><p>WATTERS: That you, Donald Trump Jr., are more dangerous than the Ayatollah and the Communist Chinese. Everyone -- everyone is scared of Donald Trump Jr. and you're right, because here's the deal. It's about censorship.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: I think that's a little bit of a compliment.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I know. You are that powerful.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: ... that much power in my fingers. It's truly --</p><p>WATTERS: You really are that big of a threat with your fingers and you don't have a finger on any nuclear buttons. It's just a retweet and retweets --</p><p>TRUMP JR.: I know. I've got nothing.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, right. Retweets are not endorsements. That's what they tell you. You know, and this way -- you can plot Antifa riots on Twitter. They don't do anything about that. You can accuse the President of treason, the Russia collusion. That's misinformation.</p><p>You can call someone a rapist, a white supremacist. That's not hate speech at all. It's all going one way.</p><p>It's a blitzkrieg of regulation against conservative speech because they don't trust the American people to make up their own minds because if there are both sides out there and they can decide, based on the facts, you'll always choose against the totalitarian left.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: They will do whatever they can.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: They will do whatever they can to push the voter to believe the radical left and to vote accordingly. That is their job in this. They've been doing it for a while. I mean, it's no secret. I've been on your show talking about, you know, social media censorship, what they're doing.</p><p>I've said in the past that everything I've seen from '16 on has been a dry run for 2020. They're not even hiding anymore. They're just doing it.</p><p>Again, if literal disinformation -- information put out by the Chinese government that places like the World Health Organization and others relied upon, that is not enough to get you thrown off of Twitter, deplatformed or censored, but me being like, I don't know, maybe you should watch this. We like to believe in free speech. Let's hear what they have to say. That's a problem.</p><p>You know, that's what we are up against, Jesse.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, I think honestly -- yes, I think the Republicans need to threaten to break up these monopolies if they're not treated fairly.</p><p>All right, so you have Joe Biden out there. He is running for President. He is walking for President, whatever you want to call it. He's gone far left. I don't know where his brain has gone. It might just be gone.</p><p>Here he is walking to the podium the other day. I don't know if he knows where he is. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN: Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome at Kingswood Community Center. Actually, that's the one down I used to work -- that's a joke. You know where we are anyway. It's great to be here and back in a place where, you know --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: Where am I?</p><p>TRUMP JR.: Jesse, what I want to know is, when does this -- when does this start being considered elder abuse? I mean, it's really not fair.</p><p>I mean, honestly, it wouldn't be truly sad if it wasn't so scary that this guy could be in charge of the nuclear football. You see it every day.</p><p>WATTERS: He fumbles.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: He doesn't remember where he is. He forgets who his wife is. He forgets what office he is running for. He gets in front of a crowd -- and don't forget Joe Biden is a 50-year swamp creature, right?</p><p>If you've been a politician for 50 years, you should be able to get in front of a whopping crowd of seven people and be able to do it without a teleprompter.</p><p>WATTERS: You're right. It should come naturally.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: He can't do that. His team pulls him off any interview, because you see him start to go off the rails and most notably, was sort of during the debates.</p><p>Notice how -- I don't think he ever completed a question without going, well, I don't want to take up any more of your time. So I'll give my time so everyone else can speak.</p><p>He is literally the first politician in the history of politics to not go over his time in a debate and it's because he didn't remember where he was going.</p><p>He spoke for 45 seconds, forgot the point he was trying to make, forgot the question, and now he is ceding back the time because he is this magnanimous guy.</p><p>I mean, give me a break. It's not funny. I mean, we're laughing because this is the people we are, right?</p><p>WATTERS: No, I know we're laughing at it now, but it's scary.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: And I am like, this guy could be in charge.</p><p>WATTERS: And it looks like he's going to put Kamala Harris on the ticket, which is even more of a scarier idea. Not as scary as Donald Trump Jr., who everybody believes is scarier than the Iranians and the Chinese communists.</p><p>All right. Check out his book. You can order right now. Donald Trump Jr. There he is. Thanks.</p><p>TRUMP JR.: Thank you, Jesse.</p><p>WATTERS: Sports is back in America, but so is the kneeling. Mike Ditka has a message for these guys.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE DITKA, PRO FOOTBALL HALL OF FAME COACH: If you can respect our National Anthem, get the hell out of the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATTERS: The Pro Football Hall of Fame coach joins WATTERS' WORLD, next.</p><p>WATTERS: Sports are finally back in America, but not without controversy. NBA players and coaches restarted the season with kneeling during the National Anthem, wearing Black Lives Matter shirts.</p><p>[VIDEO CLIP PLAYS]</p><p>WATTERS: MLB kicked off the season with the New York Yankees and the Washington Nationals kneeling in unison before the anthem began and then they rose for it, and then there's the NHL, players standing and linking arms during the National Anthem showing support for equality.</p><p>Chicago Bears legend Mike Ditka says if you can't respect our National Anthem, get the hell out of the country. The Hall of Famer joins me now.</p><p>All right, Coach, when you were with the Bears, if Singletary, if the Fridge, if anybody kneeled during the anthem, what would you do?</p><p>DITKA: Oh, they wouldn't play for us.</p><p>WATTERS: You'd bench them.</p><p>DITKA: It's that simple. Yes.</p><p>WATTERS: You just rip them right off the field? Or you just suspend them for the season? Or what would you do?</p><p>DITKA: You take them out. No, no. I would bench them. That's it. Until they found that it was honorable to respect the country.</p><p>This country has given them an opportunity to become millionaires. You understand, what I'm saying? You can't play American football in Peru. You can't play it in England.</p><p>American football can only be played in America and they make a lot of money doing it. Enjoy it. Respect it, but don't act like a clown.</p><p>WATTERS: You know, a lot of people agree with you, Coach. You know, they don't have players, and other countries do it.</p><p>DITKA: A lot don't agree with me, too. I know.</p><p>WATTERS: Yes, other countries. They don't disrespect their anthems. They don't do it in in France and Germany and Great Britain. They don't do that. And those European countries have done a lot worse things than the United States. Why do you think in the United States this happens?</p><p>DITKA: I don't know. I really don't know. I don't understand what we've had -- I grew up in a community probably that was at least 50 percent black and 50 percent, a steel mill town, Aliquippa, Pennsylvania and we had no problem.</p><p>I played football my whole life and we had more black football players on our team we did than white, but it was never a problem. We played football. It wasn't about the color of a guy's skin. It was about the way he played the game, and what his contributions could be to society and to the school.</p><p>I mean, I don't get it. What's the big difference?</p><p>WATTERS: I don't get it either. I don't think a lot of the rest of the country gets it and if it happens in the NFL this season, I think a lot of people are going to go, click.</p><p>All right, Coach Ditka, thank you very much, and everybody go check out the X-League, women's tackle football. Mike Ditka is involved in that. Thank you.</p><p>Up next, a very special Last Call.</p><p>WATTERS: WATTERS' WORLD losing a friend this week, Herman Cain, the CEO of Godfathers Pizza, former Republican presidential candidate in 2012 has passed away after a battle with coronavirus.</p><p>He was a frequent guest on the show and we will remember Herman for his sharp wit and humor and he certainly knew how to butter up yours truly.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HERMAN CAIN, FORMER REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Jesse, I don't want this the go to your head. Brilliant monologue. Okay. Brilliant.</p><p>Your commentary, Jesse, was brilliant.</p><p>WATTERS: I kind of like having you guys on the show.</p><p>CAIN: President Trump nailed it when he said weakness gets us into wars.</p><p>Trump supporters are not defecting. They are not jumping ship.</p><p>Here is the bottom line on both nights of the Democratic debates. They were all losers.</p><p>Here is what I believe Mayor de Blasio suffers from, New York-itis.</p><p>New York-itis is where they believe that they are the center of the universe and that everybody agrees with them.</p><p>WATTERS: I hope I don't have any of this New York-itis rubbing off of me.

Coming up this morning on \"MONEY  FOR BREAKFAST,\" the planes are out, the hybrids are in, and those  turnaround plans delivered.  But will Detroit automakers blueprints for  survival convince Congress to give them a bailout?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And a Fox Business Exclusive, Anheuser-Busch President David Peacock with  the latest on the Inbev buyout and what the future may hold for the  company's marketing icon ,the Clydesdales.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And then we'll hit the catwalk for Victoria's Secret annual fashion show,  in another Fox Business Exclusive, an interview with Victoria's Secret's  CEO.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today is Wednesday, December 3rd, 2008.  \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" starts right  now.</p><p>Good morning and welcome to \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.\"  I'm Alexis Glick.</p><p>We have the very latest on the auto bailout coming up and Senator Arlen  Specter will join us a little bit later.</p><p>Also the latest challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas numbers and the ADP private  sector numbers will all be coming out this morning.</p><p>But first a quick look on how the futures are stacking up here in the U.S.</p><p>This after a nice rally yesterday while most of the major markets were up  anywhere from three to four percent, lifting up about I guess a third to  half of the losses that we saw on Monday.</p><p>But this morning we have reversed trend.  We are now looking lower, down  1.3 percent or down 115 points on the DOW we're staying at about 8,320.   The S&amp;P is down 13 or 1.7 percent.  The NASDAQ is down 17 or down about one  and a half percent as we speak.</p><p>All right, let's get things started with the three things you should know  this morning.</p><p>After saying he was not going to touch the remaining TARP funds, Secretary  of the Treasury Henry Paulson is according to the \"Wall Street Journal\"  debating whether to ask Congress for the second half of those funds.</p><p>The Journal says he may ask for it as early as next week.</p><p>And one month after Election Day, incumbent Republican Senator Saxby  Chambliss is claiming victory against Democrat Jim Martin in a runoff  election in Georgia after neither received at least 50 percent of the votes  as mandated by state law.</p><p>Meanwhile, Minnesota says they are into day nine of the recount between  Republican incumbent Senator Norm Coleman and comic Al Franken.</p><p>And Super Bowl hero Plaxico Burress is done for the year and maybe for good  with the New York Giants who fined and suspended him yesterday after he  accidentally shot himself in the leg last weekend at a Manhattan nightclub.   He now faces a minimum two-year jail term under New York law.</p><p>All right, those are the three things you should know about this morning.</p><p>Now for the three things you need to know about in the overseas markets,  here's Mr. Ashley Webster in London.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FBN OVERSEAS MARKETS WRITER:  Hey, good morning, Alexis and  good morning, everybody.</p><p>Well, we saw some nice gains in Asia, but not so, so far in Europe.  Let's  take a look at the latest numbers.  Here in London on the FTSE 100, down  about half a percent at this hour.  Although this is off of our lows.  In  Paris the CAC-40 off one and a half.  And in Germany the DAX 30 index also  off close to two percent now.</p><p>Talking of Germany, shares in a big German semiconductor company are short  circuiting this morning; Infineon, reporting its seventh straight quarterly  loss.  The company says the fourth quarter loss came in at a whopping $970  million more than expected.  The company blaming weakness in the sector,  restructuring costs and write-downs associated with its stake in chipmaker  Qimonda, Infineon's stock now down 25 percent.</p><p>Sacre bleu, Warren Buffett is facing a fight now with a French utility.   Electricity de France is making a $4.5 billion bid for 50 percent of  Constellation Energy's nuclear assets now Warren Buffett's Berkshire  Hathaway already made a $4.7 billion bid for this company for all of the  company; it is a U.S. power company.  Shareholders will vote on Buffett's  offer later this month.  But EBS says it undervalues Constellations true  worth, it is a battle royale no doubt.</p><p>Let's go to Connell McShane for today's three market movers.  Good morning,  Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Ashley.</p><p>The Blackberry maker Research in Motion making a list this morning cutting  its third quarter forecast.  The company saying earnings per share are  going to come in somewhere between 81 and 83 cents.  The problem with that  is that Wall Street is looking for 91 cents.  So RIM saying a stronger  dollar as well as the general economic slowdown have hurt its business and  had hurt its stock plunging more than 67 percent so far this year.</p><p>Google is bracing for very difficult times.  The Internet search engine  giant is cutting back spending and cutting back on projects; a lot of the  perks that go into being an employee at Google are apparently going by the  wayside.  So we'll keep an eye on Google stock down from the 700s into the  275 range on that stock here over the last year or so.</p><p>Now, we do have some breaking news this morning that we want to bring to  you on mortgage applications.  We don't always give you this number as it  comes out but it is just being released now and what a gain in mortgage  applications as mortgage rates come down.</p><p>In fact, according to the Mortgage Banker's Association, this is the  biggest gain they have ever seen, in record.  It is just in this morning.   An increase has been reported in refinancing activity; that is a very, very  big increase.  Overall we're talking about re-fi's being up percentage  terms at least by 200 percent here over the same -- over the last week and  the overall market index increasing 112 percent according to the MBA which  is just out with these numbers.</p><p>Again, it's their largest rise on record Alexis, the mortgage applications  with the drop we've seen in mortgage rates apparently more people going out  and refinancing their mortgages and getting new mortgages all together.  So  that's an interesting stat that's just in.</p><p>Those are the three market movers and it's back over to you in the studio.</p><p>GLICK:  All right, I love that stat.  I'm trying to refinance my mortgage  too, Connell, just not getting the phone call back.</p><p>MCSHANE:  Get in there.</p><p>GLICK:  But we'll talk about that later.</p><p>All right, Detroit's big three automakers presented recovery plans to  Congress late yesterday, and the pitch has become more dramatic as General  Motors and Chrysler now say they are on the verge of a collapse by month's  end unless they get the money from the government they need right now.</p><p>For more on what the plans say, Fox Business's Rich Edson joins us this  morning from Washington, D.C. with more of the details.  Good morning Rich.</p><p>RICH EDSON, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi good morning, Alexis.  When these guys  were up on Capitol Hill a couple of weeks ago and they were asking for $25  billion, it wasn't all that convincing that $25 billion was all that they  needed especially when Congressmen were asking them to basically add up and  individually separate how much they would need out of that $25 billion.</p><p>Two car companies went first and when the third went, they really couldn't  answer to bring to that $25 billion number.  Eventually they got there.   And then they said ok we do need only 25 billion.  But today that number  has been just blown out of the water; $34 billion is potentially what these  guys say they are going to need over the next year from the federal  government.</p><p>The biggest coming from GM, $18 billion they say they are going to need at  least $12 billion to operate next year, $4 billion immediately of that $12  billion, and if the economy gets worse, they say they are going to need an  extra $6 billion.  That goes to $18 billion for next year.</p><p>Ford is asking for $9 billion.  Though it says it does not need it right  away, it would like a $9 billion line of credit from the government.</p><p>And Chrysler is saying that it wants $7 billion in loans from the federal  government.</p><p>So the proposals are in.  They are on Capitol Hill.  And one analyst said  it's time to get to legislative work.  Here's what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEAN WEST, GROUP ANALYST:  The last round was a nice bit of political  theater.  The Democrats got that out of the way.  They don't look like they  are soft on automakers anymore.  They played tough.  They wouldn't have  continued to keep the session open if they weren't planning on actually  funding something.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON:  All right, here the concessions all three CEOs say they will take  only a dollar in compensation if they get the loans.  Chrysler is talking  about an electric drive model in 2010.  Ford says its 2015 fleet will be 36  percent more efficient than the models it offered in 2005.  GM is giving  corporate jets, they're giving them up.  Ford is selling its jets and they  are all driving to Washington, D.C. this time around; big difference from  last time.</p><p>They're asking for billions of dollars, and they're also offering warrants  in exchange for those billions.  As far as the differences are concerned,  Ford says it can turn a profit by 2011 or at least break even by that year.   Chrysler is in merger talks.  That really separates them.  They are still  looking for a partner.</p><p>And GM will focus its U.S. branding to Chevy, Buick, GMC and Cadillac.   Pontiac is going to stay more of a niche brand.  Rick Wagoner says GM is  looking hard at all its other names and they can possibly contract them.</p><p>But Alexis as you know, when GM got rid of Oldsmobile a couple of years  ago, it was a lengthy process, it was an expensive process.  It cost them  more than a million bucks, a billion bucks excuse me, back to you.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes, I was going to say, it was a little bit more than that.  All  right, Rich Edson thank you so much, for bringing us up to date on all of  that because wow it is complicated.</p><p>Well, as lawmakers debate that total of $34 billion that Rich Edson just  talked about, automakers say they need the money to speed up production of  new energy saving vehicles.</p><p>Now, based on yesterday's sales figures, no one is buying their current  crop of cars.  Get this, Chrysler sales were down 47 percent.  GM was down  41.  Ford down 31.  Now, if GM survives it is betting big on the Volt, an  electric car that has been rushed into production and will hit show rooms  ideally within 18 months.</p><p>Here to discuss if the $40,000 Volt can save GM is Michael Duoba, he is the  mechanical engineer at the Center for Transportation Research Energy  Systems Division.  And John Grisma is the chief insights officer for Young  and Rubican Brands.  He is also the author of \"The Brand Bubble: The  looming crisis in brand value and how to avoid it.\"</p><p>Welcome, gentlemen, thanks for being here.</p><p>MICHAEL DUOBA, CENTER FOR TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH:  Thanks, Alexis.</p><p>GLICK:  Michael, let me start with you.  GM has been talking about this  Volt.  In fact the vice chairman sort of staked his career on it.  He's  been incredibly well known in the industry for the kind of cars he's  developed.  What do you make of whether or not GM could be successful with  this car?</p><p>DUOBA:  Well, I think that the Chevy Volt is a pretty exciting car.  I  think Bob Lutz is kind of the John F. Kennedy saying that he's going to go  to the moon and end of the decade.  And I think GM is kind of staking their  brand on taking this car to the next level and perhaps dethroning the Prius  as being the ultimate environmental car.</p><p>GLICK:  John, there's some big differences between how people look at a car  like the Toyota Prius and how they're trying to market this GM's Volt car  here.  Tell me what the differences are and why this is so important in  their ability to sell this car.</p><p>JOHN GRISMA, CHIEF INSIGHTS OFFICER FOR YOUNG AND RUBICAN BRANDS:   Absolutely.  I think first and most importantly you have to look at GM is  looking at this strategy clearly to improve its overall corporate image.   And if you look back at some of the studies we've got actually seen there  was a halo effect on the Toyota Prius meaning that there was actually  moving across the board.  You saw the SUVs and the trucks actually  improving their perceptions of fuel efficiency just on the basis of having  this one product in the line.</p><p>So clearly that's important from a perspective.  But I think we have to  slow down a little bit and really focus on what is the essence of this car?   Will it really make an impact in the marketplace?</p><p>I think you've got to look at the fact that it is essentially they are  talking 10,000 cars in what 2011.  You're talking $30,000 at a price point  a lot of questions it just loses with consumers.</p><p>GLICK:  Yes and right now the price tag we're hearing is more like $40,000  but there's some vagary around it because it's still a long ways away.</p><p>But John, part of the issue here, you are a brand expert, and you've been  watching what's been happening to the quality and the franchise behind the  GM name.  What has been happening and why is that contributing sort to the  lack of, I guess, belief that this company can turn the story around?</p><p>GRISMA:  You know, one of the things we wrote about in our book was the  concept that consumers are actually acting more and more like shareholders,  like investors.  They are actually looking into the future for their  expectations of brands.</p><p>And when we look at GM in the context of brand asset value which is our  consumer brand database we have seen decline in trust, decline in  differentiation, a decline in sort of perceived quality.  This isn't  necessarily fair because they are making some great products and the  critics have actually -- the car critic really praised recent brands like  the Cadillac, GTS, as well as the Saturn Aura.</p><p>So in that context I think what GM is trying to do is clearly get on board  with green.  I think all the big three automakers were behind a little bit  in this in the 90s.  They're trying to practice the sense of humility as  well as sustainability.  I mean I think if also if you step back and you  look at GM, they pulled out of the Super Bowl this year, a very high- profile venue, $three million for a 30 second spot.  They have ended their  relationship with Tiger Woods which was a long time spokesperson.  So I  think they're trying to kind of be a little bit less flashy, a little bit  more demure and try to get aligned with the administration's priorities.</p><p>GLICK:  Michael, when you talk about the quality of this car or what it  might do to turn GM's business around, they are sort of staking their  future on it, who is going to buy this car?</p><p>DOUBA:  That's a very good question.  And I think that anyone can buy the  car if you have a place to plug in.  So there is a concern about the  infrastructure involved you have to plug the car in every night as you  would plug in your cell phone.  So it is kind of a new paradigm of what we  do with our car and how we use it.</p><p>But I think you know people who live in the suburbs who can drive enough  miles to displace all the fuel that the vehicle promises to displace can  buy the car.</p><p>GLICK:  And are you concerned at all Michael about the price point?  I mean  I know we're looking out a couple of years from now, but on the other hand,  you know, they are kind of staking their future on it, so it is kind of  important.</p><p>DUOBA:  Yes, I mean the price is -- it might be a little bit out of the  reach of the average buyer, but it's -- they're not going to make money --  GM's is not going to make money on this product, so it is matter of just  having enough, enough sales that they can show it's a strong product.</p><p>GLICK:  John, what do you think?</p><p>GRISMA:  I think that's the real key issue.  I think you have to look at  the infrastructure issues.  You're talking about a $30,000 car.  You're  talking about perhaps urban environments because it's got a 40 miles range.   How do you set up the infrastructure to basically plug in cars?  How do you  deal with that in New York?  How do you deal with that in Boston?</p><p>Now, I think that these technologies will follow this car and it is an  exciting thing but I think GM has to step back and think this isn't  necessarily the one single silver bullet.  They were successful in the past  with the Corvette but let's look at this in the long-term plans for what  they are going to do to roll out more sustainable vehicles.</p><p>GLICK:  The one thing that you mentioned earlier is you said humility and  sustainability.  I presume that the combination of those two things is what  they need to demonstrate to Congress later this week that they have both of  those things.</p><p>You mentioned pulling back from the Super Bowl and a couple other moves  that they've made but how do they bring about sustainability if they've now  come to the well and said we need an additional $6 billion this after just  testifying two weeks ago?</p><p>GRISMA:  Yes, I mean first of all you've seen them out of their corporate  jets and into their hybrids going to Capitol Hill.  But I also think it's  important to really look at how do they align with the administration's  priorities?  How do they align now with the Uber shareholders which is the  taxpayers right?  If GM is dealing with taxpayer money?</p><p>So I think in that context, what they have to do is prove their long-term  sustainability, their ability to actually get in line with where Americans  want to go, lessen their dependence on foreign oil and focus on really  marketing this car in the context of where GM and Ford and Chrysler where  are they're going in the future.</p><p>GLICK:  It's interesting because we're going to talk to one of the top  executives at Anheuser-Busch this morning and there used to be a concept  here called made in America and we used to be excited about that and  somehow we've got to turn this philosophy around because we're not very  excited about it right now when it concerns the automakers.</p><p>All right, John and Michael, thank you guys so much.  I appreciate it.</p><p>All right, coming up the newly formed Anheuser-Busch Inbev brought the  largest European and American brewers together.  After the break we're  going to have an exclusive interview with the president of the Anheuser- Busch division to talk about the transition.</p><p>And then for all you Victoria's Secret lovers out there, Victoria's Secret  angels are hitting the runway to revive sales this holiday season.  We're  going to have another exclusive interview with their CEO in just a little  bit.  You won't want to miss it.  I promise.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK:  Newly formed Anheuser-Busch Inbev brought the largest European and  American brewers together.  Here to talk about the transition and the  future of the famous Anheuser-Busch Clydesdale Horses, Anheuser-Busch  President, David Peacock joins us now in a Fox Business Exclusive.</p><p>Good morning, great to see you.</p><p>DAVID PEACOCK, ANHEUSER-BUSCH PRESIDENT:  Good to see you again Alexis.</p><p>GLICK:  It is the first time that I'm talking to you live in person.</p><p>PEACOCK:  That's right.</p><p>GLICK:  Since the deal, walk me through, how has the transition been?</p><p>PEACOCK:  It's been good.  You know I tell you, we've been very impressed  with the people from Inbev.  And I think there's a lot of commonality on  how we approach the business and just how we work.  And I've got to say  it's been a very collaborative effort.</p><p>GLICK:  And I said to you when you walked in, I imagine that this has  required a lot of traveling, a lot of getting to know each other and also a  lot of calming people's fears because the transition, a change of this  magnitude is pretty big for one of the largest independent private  companies -- I mean public but owned by a family.</p><p>PEACOCK:  Right.</p><p>GLICK:  What has that been like addressing their concerns?</p><p>PEACOCK:  I think you just have to be honest with people and be up front  and just make sure they understand that the best interests of the  organization are always top of mind.  And that we are committed to treating  everybody with great respect.  And the organization, our performance has  been great so I give them the big thumbs up on the effort that they have  shown during all these uncertainty.</p><p>GLICK:  Anheuser-Busch obviously is an iconic brand and a lot of people  were concerned about the concept that an iconic brand going to a European  company.  How will the brand change or will we not see a lot of changes at  least here in the United States?</p><p>PEACOCK:  I think the things that work and the things that matter won't  change.  You know the heirs of our company will never change, the brand  Budweiser is such a part of our company.  And saw it when you came to see  us, we don't have Anheuser-Busch on the top of our building, we have  Budweiser.  And that's what people buy and that's what people believe in.   And that's what not going to change.</p><p>And the Clydesdales, the book you're holding, the Clydesdales aren't going  to change.  They are going to continue to graze in the pastures in mid- Missouri where their new farm is where we moved them a couple weeks ago.   And they are going to be continued to be housed on the campus.</p><p>GLICK:  We just showed a copy of this, and I have it in my hand it's called  \"The Great American Tradition.\"  As a matter of fact, when I went down to  St. Louis to visit you guys, I was there for the 75th anniversary of the  Clydesdales.</p><p>PEACOCK:  Right.</p><p>GLICK:  And what's the meaning behind this?  Tell people about this.  This  is part of the tradition of the company.</p><p>PEACOCK:  The story was back in when prohibition was repealed 1933, August  Busch Jr. wanted to show his father some respect and commemorate the  moment.  And they offered an eight horse hitch to deliver the first beer to  the governor Al Smith, I think governor or mayor of New York and then FDR  in Washington, D.C.</p><p>And they've just been a part of our heritage ever since then.  And they  represent strength, power, quality, beauty, all the great things that we  think are synonymous with America and are synonymous with our brand  Budweiser.</p><p>GLICK:  One of the things that's also synonymous with your brand is huge  advertising in the Super Bowl.  And you are going ahead with some huge  spots.  Tell me a little bit about that, and why you've continued along  with the investment because as you and I both know Inbev is known for cost- cutting.</p><p>PEACOCK:  Yes, but it is a knock they don't deserve.  I mean, if you look  at their third quarter, they actually had an increase in marketing and  selling up about 12 percent.  So they will invest behind brands.  We're  going to have actually nine commercials in the Super Bowl this year, and  about half of them will be dedicated to the Clydesdales.</p><p>And we've got some really nice spots on the horizon and one I think  especially that just wrapped up last week that I think could be the winner  hopefully.</p><p>GLICK:  Oh, I like that.</p><p>Now, one of the things you guys have done is you've always invested a lot  in sports, sports across the globe.</p><p>PEACOCK:  Right.</p><p>GLICK:  And had some huge partnerships with some of the biggest sports in  the industry.  Will you continue to have those partnerships?  Will you, you  know, readdress them?  You know, where does that stand?  </p><p>PEACOCK:  Sports is a big part of our DNA.  Last night we had an event  where we invited a lot of the New York media and sports community in for a  happy hour and told all those folks from ESPN and the different teams,  we're still there.  We are still a big part of what you do, and you are  still a big part of reaching our consumers in the proper way.</p><p>GLICK:  Let's talk a little bit about financials because the stock has been  very turbulent, and it's been a difficult economy.  One of the things I  said to you in the very beginning that I didn't realize about the deal and  I was pretty much in the know about this I didn't necessarily understand  that there was a six-month bridge loan that Inbev used which was part of  financing this deal.</p><p>PEACOCK:  Right.</p><p>GLICK:  They have now announced this they are going to go -- that they are  going to go out there through a rights offering and raise funds in the  marketplace.  It really hurt the stock.  First day it was announced, the  stock was down 13 percent.  Why are you doing this and what do you want  shareholders to know?</p><p>PEACOCK:  I think most important is the intrinsic value of the deal is  still there.  It is a tough market, but combining these two great companies  and the growth opportunities and the expansion of the brand Budweiser,  which is a big part of this globally still have merit.  And I think at the  end of the day, from what we have seen, if you've got a combination that  makes sense, and there's opportunity for growth, you're going to see the  financials fall into place.</p><p>So we're not too worried about what we have seen out in the marketplace.   It's like anything else, when you have a good idea and two companies should  come together, then I think at the end of the day the financial community  and the markets will respond positively.</p><p>GLICK:  Even though it is dilutive to shareholders right now because this  rights offerings is going to be in existence now for a two-week period,  over the long haul you think you will make up for it with growth and  opportunities?</p><p>PEACOCK:  Yes, the synergies we talked about are still there.  We still  have visibility to them.  All the reasons why it made sense for these  companies to come together are still there.</p><p>GLICK:  you and I have talked in the past about beverage sales here in the  United States.  And the numbers have been very small increases, low single  digit percentage gains, but that there are tremendous opportunities still  in emerging economies.  How much of those opportunities have changed  because we are now in a much more difficult global environment, or will you  still look to get more penetration?</p><p>PEACOCK:  Oh, definitely.  I think brand Budweiser has a lot of opportunity  in the emerging markets.  The beer industry so far in the U.S. has been  very good.  It probably will come in just under one percent growth which  for us is good, and it is very resilient in this kind of time.</p><p>Recessions are short-term.  This is a long-term deal.  We are going to be  in business a long time.  We have been in business a long time.  And I  think that's the long-term view we are going to continue to take.</p><p>GLICK:  One last question, China.  China has said you guys have a big stake  in a Chinese brewer as does Inbev.  They have capped the stake.  They have  said no more acquisitions of any other brewers in China, no percentage  stakes.  What does that mean to your business model, are you concerned  about that?</p><p>PEACOCK:  No, I think we have got a very good model in China, and we have  really created the premium segment with Budweiser years ago.  And recently  just this year we rolled out to over 100 markets where we hadn't sold  before.</p><p>What's interesting about China is you have constant geographic expansion  opportunities because it's just so vast.  And it is amazing to me still  when you can see a city in China that may be 20th in size and there's still  six million people, and you may not have even really penetrated that  market.  So we have a lot of growth opportunities there and in combining  the two companies that we've got now with some of the brands like Harbin  and some of the brands that Inbev has.</p><p>GLICK:  The book is \"The Great American Tradition: the 75th anniversary of  the Budweiser Clydesdales.\"  It is a good gift for the family.  I like it.</p><p>PEACOCK:  I was going to say I gave you a horse shoe the last time I saw  you.  This time you get you a book.  Boys around Clydesdales.</p><p>GLICK:  So this time I get a book.  I love that horse shoe.  David Peacock  as always so great seeing you.  Congratulations and best of luck happy  holidays.  </p><p>PEACOCK:  Thank you.  You too.  </p><p>GLICK:  We're going to take a quick break and we'll right back with much  more \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" including Victoria's Secret, the ladies on the  runway, you won't want to miss this coming up in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LEE:  Welcome back everyone to \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.\"  I am Jenna Lee and  here's this morning's top news stories.</p><p>We're going to begin with a look at President elect Barack Obama's up  coming cabinet.  Fox News confirming that Mr. Obama will name New Mexico  Governor Bill Richardson as his commerce secretary today.  You might  remember that just a few weeks ago the governor's name was also tossed out  for potentially the secretary of state position.  That didn't happen of  course.  But Richardson has a long history in Washington serving as energy  secretary under President Clinton.  He was also the U.S. Ambassador to the  United Nations.  </p><p>Secretary of state Condoleezza Rice arriving in New Delhi, India today one  of her last trips abroad as the top U.S. diplomat.  Rice is in India to  urge a fast response to the Mumbai attacks and to ease tensions between  India and neighboring Pakistan.  Rice also saying that officials in  Islamabad need to cooperate with India's request.</p><p>You are up-to-date on the Fox Business Network.  Much more ahead.  The  latest report on job cut activity.  And Victoria's Secret, can't beat that.   We will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK:  Welcome back to \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.\"  I'm Alexis Glick.</p><p>We are waiting for the Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas jobs report.  It is due  out in just about ten seconds.  We will also get the ADP private sector job  report.  That number comes out in just about 45 minutes.</p><p>Let's go upstairs to the Fox Business Desk to Connell McShane to see if we  can get the Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas numbers.  </p><p>MCSHANE:  Yes, we have them, Alexis, and the layoffs are going up.  No  surprise there.  Actually the highest since back in 2002.  Up 46 percent  from the same time a year ago.  </p><p>Layoff announcements for the month of November, according to Challenger,  Gray &amp; Christmas coming in at more than 181,000.  Want to be exact,  181,671.  That's the most number of layoffs, the highest number of layoffs  monthly since January of 2002.  We're up in the 250 range there.  </p><p>And it is up from the same time -- from a month ago by almost -- by more  than 60 percent, and from a year ago by 46 percent.  A couple of notable  factors here.  Number one, year to date this brings the number of layoffs  according to this particular metric above a million.  </p><p>It's a million and 57,000 give or take, it was 875,000, you added that on,  you're over a million now year-to-date in layoffs.  </p><p>What's leading the way?  Well, again, no surprise.  Financial and retail  sectors are really leading the way when we come to -- to job cuts there.   Year to date in the financial sector, you're talking about 220,000 plus  layoffs, 21 percent of the total so far this year.  </p><p>So the financial sector is really getting hit hard.  We have the Citigroup  plan that was announced in this month with the 50,000 employees being let  go.  </p><p>So a quick recap for you, Alexis, layoffs, according to the firm -- the  outplacement firm, Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, are going up, 46 percent  above the level they were at a year ago, above 181,000 and above a million  so far this year.  </p><p>It's back to you in the studios.  </p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Not the best of news.  Connell, thank you so much.  </p><p>Well, let's get the latest and break down the numbers on this jobs number  and ask our guests here to break it down and see what they think about it.  </p><p>Mark Lieberman is our FOX Business senior economist, FOX Business  contributor Charles Payne, and Leo Tilman is the former chief strategist  for Bear Stearns.  </p><p>Leo, I'll start with you.  I would assume no great surprise here, but the  trend is not our friend.  </p><p>LEO TILMAN, L.M. TILMAN PRESIDENT:  Absolutely, Alexis.  And I think the  employment numbers today are the most important ones of all because we're  still trying to ascertain to which extent this credit crisis continues to  hurt the economy and obviously it is, and it means that the bailout is not  working fast enough.  </p><p>GLICK:  Charles?  </p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, yes -- you know, listen, I  agree with that, and I also think this whole thing underscores the notion  that perhaps we need to give corporate America lower taxes, you know, much  lower tax rate.  </p><p>GLICK:  You're here.  </p><p>PAYNE:  I know that -- you know that President Obama is against that, and,  you know, the whole mandate was sticking to the corporations and the rich,  but you know what, at this point, you know, they're getting their just  desserts, you know, you can call it karma, whatever you want.  </p><p>The bottom line is when you see these types of numbers and at the end of  the day, if it takes jobs -- and I think Mark will agree with me -- it  takes jobs to turn this economy around.  One of the good things is to  incentivize corporations or even make it possible for them to do some  hiring in this environment.  </p><p>MARK LIEBERMAN, FOX BUSINESS SENIOR ECONOMIST:  Charles, I agree with you  in part.  Yes, we have to incent corporations to do something but just to  say across the board tax cut doesn't necessarily do it.  </p><p>GLICK:  Yes, no.  We got...</p><p>LIEBERMAN:  If you're talking ...</p><p>GLICK:  ... strings attached.  </p><p>LIEBERMAN:  If you're talking about job tax credits or something for job  creation, that's a better plan than just saying we've got to reduce  corporate tax rates.  Just to say that doesn't necessarily put more...</p><p>PAYNE:  No, you know what it is, though, Mark?  Put strings attached to it,  it's like...</p><p>LIEBERMAN:  It is not a question of putting strings.  It's a question of --  use a tax code to incentivize a particular type of behavior.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Like for instance, you'll -- we'll give you a tax break but the  jobs have to be in -- you know, in North Dakota.  </p><p>LIEBERMAN:  Something like that.  Yes.  </p><p>GLICK:  Yes, I mean, but you see, my concern, Charles, if is we -- like  Mark said, if we did -- we're totally getting off...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK:  But let me -- I was just going to say...</p><p>PAYNE:  But it does circle back to jobs, though.  </p><p>GLICK:  Well, what -- to me, what I worry about, though, is if you give a  blanket cut without some kind of strings attached that we have the same  thing that we got with this TARP program, which is you're giving all this  money to these banks, there were zero strings attached and now they're not  doing anything to make lending any better.  </p><p>They are not necessarily doing anything to really increase or improve the  foreclosure situation and I think that's why, frankly, when Treasury  Secretary Paulson goes there next week and ask the other 350, I don't think  they're going to give it to him.  </p><p>But that's a whole other topic.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  </p><p>LIEBERMAN:  Yes, let's go back to these job numbers if we -- this  Challenger announcement and put it into context.  It is scary when you look  at a number like 181,000 and huge increases year to date and huge increases  year over year.  </p><p>This is the first time that full year announcements have topped a million  in -- since 2000 -- by November in 2003, but A, these are just  announcements.  They may not be followed through.  Employment is a lagging  indicator in any economic situation.  </p><p>GLICK:  Everybody says to me employment is a lagging indicator, but who on  this planet doesn't think that employment is going to get worse?  </p><p>LIEBERMAN:  It will get worse.  It will get worse because the economy is  continuing to deteriorate.  It's -- we saw the corporate profits report in  the last week when we got -- a couple weeks ago when we got GDP numbers.   That showed corporate profits declining and the response to that is to trim  expenses.  </p><p>GLICK:  OK.  Guys, I hate to do this, I'm sorry, but we're going to have to  wrap it up right now.  You guys are going to come back for the ADP.  </p><p>I'm sorry, Leo, I didn't get a chance to talk to you more about it just  because we have somebody standing by.  So we're going to come back to those  ADP, as I said, the private sector numbers, in just a moment.  </p><p>But President elect Barack Obama met with governors from across the country  yesterday in Philadelphia.  They were tackling state's growing financial  and economic problems.  Take a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA (D), PRESIDENT ELECT:  To solve this crisis and to ease the  burden on our states, we're going to need action and we're going to need  actions swiftly.  We intend to help save or create 2.5 million jobs.  We  intend to put tax cuts into the pockets of hard-pressed middle class  families in your states.  And we are not, as a nation, going to be able to  just keep on printing money.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLICK:  Now the country's mayors are turning to the president elect for  help, too.  The U.S. conference of mayors has released a list of more than  4600 infrastructure projects that would add more than 261,000 jobs in 154  cities.  </p><p>Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter met with the president elect yesterday  and he joins us this morning.  </p><p>Good morning, Mayor.  </p><p>MAYOR MICHAEL NUTTER (D), PHILADELPHIA:  Good morning, Alexis.  How are  you?  </p><p>GLICK:  Great, good to see you.  </p><p>NUTTER:  Good.  </p><p>GLICK:  Well, you spoke yesterday...</p><p>NUTTER:  Always good to be with you.  </p><p>GLICK:  Well, thanks for being here.  You spoke yesterday, as I mentioned,  to President-elect Obama.  What was on the agenda?  </p><p>NUTTER:  Yes.  </p><p>GLICK:  What did you guys discuss?  </p><p>NUTTER:  We discussed three things after, again, congratulating him and he  thanked us for the great electoral victory here in Philadelphia, talked  about infrastructure, talked about mortgage foreclosure, and talked about  pension systems.  </p><p>All three key issues and certainly I'm very supportive of Mayor Manny Diaz,  our great president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the larger agenda  that was put out, but we need access to credit markets for borrowing  purposes, and that's all I wanted to talk with president-elect about.  </p><p>Our pension systems are all taking massive losses because of a third to a  half loss in the overall stock market.  Access to capital, to borrow for  infrastructure projects, which is a big topic of conversation between the  president-elect and the governors yesterday, and then the mortgage  foreclosure crisis.  </p><p>You mentioned in the earlier segment that the financial institutions and  the banks have been helped tremendously by treasury.  But they are doing  virtually nothing to help homeowners on the ground stay in their homes.   Banks don't want to own houses.  They want to service mortgages.  </p><p>We have a unique program, our Mortgage Foreclosure Reduction Program here  in Philadelphia.  We'd like to see that replicated across the country to  keep people in their homes and stabilize neighborhoods.  </p><p>So those were a few of the things that I talked to the president-elect  about yesterday.  It was a very good conversation.  </p><p>GLICK:  You know, I don't know about your mortgage foreclosure reduction  plan.  Can you tell me about it, Mayor, because a lot of people are talking  about...</p><p>NUTTER:  Sure.  </p><p>GLICK:  ... what FDIC chair Sheila Bair is doing particularly with Indymac,  but -- but how is your plan different?  </p><p>NUTTER:  Yes.  Our plan is different -- earlier this year through a  tremendously cooperative effort between our court system, our judges, the  legal community, as well as the banking industry, we first put a hold on --  a moratorium on mortgage foreclosures in Philadelphia for three to four  months, just stopped them dead cold, and then brought the homeowners, the  bankers, legal team together and the courts and the sheriff to create  reconciliation conferences so that we can sit down with these homeowners  and figure out how to restructure their payments so they can stay in their  home.  </p><p>We have saved hundreds of people from foreclosure and literally possibly  being thrown out on the streets, and it's -- the program has worked very  well.  We have a hotline, outreach workers, literally people out on the  street knocking on doors in targeted neighborhoods throughout Philadelphia  to get people to the help they need, did PSAs for this effort.  </p><p>It's worked very, very well.  And we've had a lot of support from some  local banks and a couple foundations.  But certainly the federal government  has a role to play.  This is a national program in the makings, and the  federal government really could step up and help us out.  </p><p>GLICK:  Well, that's pretty impressive.  I'm glad to hear more about  that...</p><p>NUTTER:  Thank you.  </p><p>GLICK:  ... because I think we need to...</p><p>NUTTER:  Yes.  </p><p>GLICK:  We need to be doing a lot more about it, obviously, on a state by  state basis.  </p><p>You know, Mayor, you -- we're all talking about everybody's fiscal house,  and the fiscal house in Pennsylvania...</p><p>NUTTER:  Yes.  </p><p>GLICK:  ... is feeling some heat, too.  You are right now...</p><p>NUTTER:  It's tough.  </p><p>GLICK:  ... facing a budget shortfall as you know better than I do, the  number I've heard reported is up to 2 billion by the middle of next year  and that you're facing $1 billion...</p><p>NUTTER:  For the state.  </p><p>GLICK:  For the state, for the state.  </p><p>NUTTER:  For the state.  I don't want to give my citizen...</p><p>GLICK:  Not for Philadelphia.  </p><p>NUTTER:  Yes.  </p><p>GLICK:  Well, when you say access to capital or access to credit...</p><p>NUTTER:  Yes.  </p><p>GLICK:  ... for some of these infrastructure, how do you address those  budget gaps?  I mean are you talking about the Federal Reserve Bank,  perhaps, stepping up and purchasing municipal funding?  </p><p>NUTTER:  Yes.  </p><p>GLICK:  I mean, walk me through what you would like to see happen.  </p><p>NUTTER:  There are a couple things.  A couple weeks ago I was down in -- I  was in Washington, delivered a letter to -- for Treasury Secretary Paulson  and specifically I talked to big and medium sized city mayors about this  issue.  </p><p>We'd like to borrow directly from the treasury for infrastructure projects  that are ready to go.  You can put a shovel in the ground in just a couple  of months and put people back to work, but we've not had great access to  the capital markets to borrow money from.  </p><p>So we'd like to borrow directly from treasury, repay at 50 basis points  over treasury so the Feds are actually going to make money off of this  deal, and allow us to get our crucial infrastructure projects under way,  bridges, roads, telecommunications lines, underground infrastructure as  well, put people to work quickly, but we need access to capital markets.  </p><p>Virtually, no one could borrow anything from anybody regardless of your  credit rating for months, and that has had a serious impact on cash flow as  well as the ability to put shovels in the ground, so that was a big topic  of conversation with the governors yesterday.  </p><p>GLICK:  OK, so -- so Mayor, because, you know, I know you have $180 million  in what was recently rated as triple B status paper for the...</p><p>NUTTER:  Yes.  </p><p>GLICK:  ... for the city of Philadelphia.  </p><p>NUTTER:  For the city, yes, just last week.  </p><p>GLICK:  In essence what you're suggesting that if you were to get some kind  of deal like that through treasury, 50 basis points above current rates.  </p><p>NUTTER:  Right.  </p><p>GLICK:  That that would save your funding costs, I mean, what do you expect  your funding rates to be going forward, and how big a difference will it  make?  And then -- and then, finally, one other thing, Mayor, that Governor  Tim Pawlenty talked to me about yesterday, he says, look, we've also got to  make some hard choices.  </p><p>NUTTER:  Yes.  </p><p>GLICK:  What hard choices are you willing to make to offset...</p><p>NUTTER:  Well...</p><p>GLICK:  ... access to capital?  </p><p>NUTTER:  Yes.  Well, we've made the hard choices already.  I made an  announcement, a pretty big announcement two days after the election, I'm  laying off upwards of 220 people, not filling 600 positions, closing 11  libraries, only reopening 12 of our 70 plus swimming pools, and so we've  cut back significantly.  </p><p>This is a very, very painful time between the layoffs and impact to some  very important programs.  I have never asked for a bailout.  We're not  asking for handouts.  Access to capital has been the big request by cities  all across America because we've been shut out of the credit markets, but  all these big city mayors -- you look at what Mayor Bloomberg has done in  New York, Mayor Daley in Chicago, Gavin Newsom in San Francisco, Shirley  Franklin in Atlanta, Phil Gordon in Phoenix.  </p><p>All of these mayors are making drastic cuts in programs and services, but  the federal government -- we need your help in accessing the capital  markets.  We're willing to take out loans, we will repay.  We're good  credits.  We're not going anywhere.  We don't go out of business.  And so  we're stable and secure, unlike, you know, some of the others who are  lining up.  </p><p>GLICK:  All right, well, Mayor Nutter, as always, fantastic pleasure  talking to you.  </p><p>NUTTER:  Thanks, Alexis.  </p><p>GLICK:  Best of luck in your endeavor.  </p><p>NUTTER:  Thank you.  </p><p>GLICK:  And you and I haven't talked since your Phillies won so I do need  to tell you congratulations.  </p><p>NUTTER:  Thank you, go Phillies.  </p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Did Governor Crist...</p><p>NUTTER:  It's been a wonderful time.  And we're going to -- we're going to  turn things around in all these cities across America.  President-elect  Obama understands these issues, talked with the governors yesterday, and I  know he is interested in talking to, to the mayors as well.  </p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Well, we certainly hope things turn around very soon.   Thank you so much, great pleasure seeing you.  </p><p>NUTTER:  They will.  Thank you.  You, too.  </p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Coming up Charles Payne is chasing after Chuck E.  Cheese.  He says the pizza stock is cooking.  Details just ahead.  </p><p>And later strutting for sales.  We're going to talk to the CEO of  Victoria's Secret when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST returns.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK:  In his Wall Street strategy's hotline Charles Payne says he longs  for the days of the bologna sandwiches and when people were just in a  better mood all around.  So do I.  </p><p>He says seeing the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile on his way into work bring a  smile to his face and it reminds him that we just aren't happy as we used  to be.  </p><p>He says, \"I believe there is a feeling of self-loathing that has been  creeping into the psyche of America for a long time.  It seems like we find  it harder to be happy.  We find it harder to smile.\"  </p><p>Here he is, smiley himself, FOX Business contributor, Charles Payne.  Oh my  god, you know, I love bologna.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Do you?  </p><p>GLICK:  I hate to admit it.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Yes, fried, regular, any kind.  </p><p>GLICK:  Oh yes.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  </p><p>GLICK:  Yes, I do.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Have you seen the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile?  </p><p>GLICK:  Of course, and I -- I have the little keychain.  But they were here  with us, remember?  </p><p>PAYNE:  Yes, I loved it.  You know, it was created in 1936, the Depression,  and I went through a list last night of all the great things that were  simple and created during difficult economic times.  </p><p>GLICK:  OK, tell me what they are.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Pet rock.  Rock and Roll.  The lava land.  The CD player.  The list  goes on and on so we can be happy with very simple things in very depressed  times.  </p><p>GLICK:  You need to give me that list as if you report it.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Here's the list right there.  Look at that list right there.  </p><p>GLICK:  I want to look at this list.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Here it is.  </p><p>GLICK:  This needs to go -- I'm going to put this on my blog even though  you have your -- all your huge fan base.  </p><p>OK.  So, so yes, we need to smile a little bit.  We need to sort of, you  know, move past this, but let's talk about some picks.  </p><p>PAYNE:  OK.  </p><p>GLICK:  What are you looking at today?  </p><p>PAYNE:  The one that intrigues me the most this morning is a company called  Cyberonics.  And it's been around for a long time.  It gets a lot of hype.   They make an implantable device that controls nerve stimulation.  </p><p>Now the first -- the first approval was for epilepsy seizures but they  think they can use this thing to fight depression, to control hunger, a lot  of different things.  The stock has been acting great this week.  Piper  Jaffrey has had some positive comments recently.  I love this.  It's come  down a lot, I like the risk reward.  </p><p>GLICK:  OK.  What's next?  </p><p>PAYNE:  Chuck E. Cheese, which is the last time I mentioned it on the show  it came down a lot since then.  But I think it's oversold here.  I do  believe that, you know what, it's going to do pretty well in this sort of  economy.  </p><p>You can see where at one point -- if we even had a longer term chart, it  really was on a great tear.  I will say those September quarter they  missed.  However, I would wait for a breakout and buy the stock north to 17  1/2.  </p><p>GLICK:  And where are Chuck E. Cheeses?  </p><p>PAYNE:  There's not one next door.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK:  Yes, I heard the -- oh my goodness.  Did you guys -- you guys  scared for me, right?  I got a little scared myself because Charles...</p><p>PAYNE:  There's a lot of them out in Jersey, though.  </p><p>GLICK:  ... says that I don't walk around the neighborhood -- OK, what's  the last one?  </p><p>PAYNE:  Cree Research.  You know, it's interesting because I interviewed  the CEO of OSRAM SYLVANIA yesterday and he talked about light emitting  diodes.  </p><p>GLICK:  Yes.  </p><p>PAYNE:  I've always liked this place -- this space.  It's very sexy.  You  know the NASDAQ building, all those lights, those are light emitting  diodes.  Eventually we'll have them in our home so we'll replace every  single thing.  </p><p>This is a stock that's been in a rumor mill for a long time, bad  management, nevertheless, think -- I would buy it north of 16.  That's the  caveat.  </p><p>GLICK:  OK.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Traders look to get out at 19.  If you're willing to hold through  the gyrations a year from now it could be 24.  </p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Charles Payne.  </p><p>PAYNE:  All right.  </p><p>GLICK:  Very good.  </p><p>PAYNE:  All of these use a 15 percent stop loss.  </p><p>GLICK:  Stop loss on the down side.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Yes.  </p><p>GLICK:  Great point.  </p><p>PAYNE:  Yes. </p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Let's quickly go over to Ashley Webster in London, get  an update from him.  </p><p>Ashley, you should look at this list of the things that have been created  in difficult periods, Pacman, CD players, hula hoops.  </p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS OVERSEAS MARKETS EDITOR:  Yes, they're all  good.  </p><p>GLICK:  Ashley, you missed it.  Keep going.  </p><p>WEBSTER:  I missed it.  I'm going, I'm going.  All right.  Let's go to the  markets.  I still have the (INAUDIBLE) 3000 models away.  </p><p>OK, let's talk about the markets.  London down 0.5 percent.  France down 1  1/3 percent.  As we speak Germany down 1.5, despite the gains in Asia, we  are losing ground here in Europe so far.  </p><p>We're keeping an eye on the airline sector after the big merger talks were  revealed yesterday between British Airways and Qantas of Australia.  BA,  though, down 1 percent.  </p><p>The big story of the morning, though, in the European tech sector.  German  semiconductor company Infineon reporting its 7th straight quarterly loss.   That means that the company is saying today that it is continuing to  struggle.  Sales don't look good.  The loss for the fourth quarter -- oh by  the way $970 million dollars.  </p><p>Also very quickly Anglo Irish Bank in the banking sector reporting full  profit loss in the four-year profit loss of 33 percent.  Also says it's  putting aside $635 million for bad loans.  Ouch.  </p><p>Anglo Irish down 17 percent.  The only good news is that the dollar is  slightly higher today against both the euro and the British pound.  </p><p>All right time to take a break.  Coming up the Victoria's Secrets angels  will be strutting their stuff and sales tonight.  So what is the retail  outlook for Victoria's Secret?  We'll ask the CEO.  An exclusive interview  after the break.  </p><p>And yes, we have video, and I have seen it and Victoria doesn't have many  secrets left.  We will be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK:  Intimate apparel giant Victoria's Secret is one of the biggest  money makers for its parent company Limited Brands and the models are  strutting their stuff tonight on CBS to hit holiday sales.  </p><p>I sat down with the CEO of the company.  Take a look.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SHAREN TURNEY, VICTORIA' SECRET CEO:  This year's show we shot at the  Fontainebleau which has a lot of history to it.  The Rat Pack used to hang  out there.  Elvis Presley would sing there.  So it's really about return to  glamour.  And that's what our assortments are for holiday.  </p><p>We all know we're in a little bit of a downturn in terms of our economy so  we're really trying to offer our customers this year a real credible  promise of value in all that we do.  </p><p>GLICK:  One of the things that we have seen for Victoria's Secret and the  parent company of Limited Brands is that it's been a difficult climate.  I  mean everybody has sort of been facing the new heat, the new environment,  and that we've heard reports that Black Friday wasn't quite up to  expectations.  </p><p>You tell me, what are your projections this holiday season and how are you  doing thus far if you were to give yourself a report card?  </p><p>TURNEY:  Well, I think we went into this fall and holiday season with a  very conservative plan.  We saw that the downside of the economy was  happening, not to the degree that it has happened.  We've been really  controlling inventories, our inventory -- put it down almost 17 percent.  </p><p>As we entered the fourth quarter really looking at our capex spending, and  we were investing our dollars and to make sure that we're investing into  the stores that are coming to the end of their lease line.  </p><p>What we've done is try to be prepared and that's what we're trying to do  for our customers as well.  And I think that we're meeting our expectations  as we talked about in our third quarter on our call is the fact that we  made more money than the year before, as well as our (INAUDIBLE) doors were  down about 9, our direct business was at double digits.  </p><p>GLICK:  One of the things, I'm glad you brought up direct business, because  that's something that you are very well known for and very famous in the  industry for is what you have created in direct business not only in your  past positions but here at Victoria's Secret.  </p><p>Why is that so crucial and how do you succeed even more in this kind of  environment on direct business?  </p><p>TURNEY:  Well, I think that today the consumer has many venues of which  they want to shop.  And they might want to go to a store, they might want  to use online to see what's happening, and then go into the store.  They  might have gone to the store and said, I wish I would have bought that, and  it gives them an opportunity to go online.  </p><p>And it's really not one way, but it's what is the preference of the  customer and being able to offer that to them no matter how they want to  shop.  </p><p>GLICK:  You know, it's interesting because a lot of people suggest that the  bricks and mortar model several years ago was going to die.  And now you're  hearing that commercial real estate and strip malls are feeling the pain  because people are not going into the malls to the degree that one would  hope or expect given what's happened with the economy.  </p><p>Will you look to downsize the amount of stores that you have as you look  into 2009 and direct more of that energy and attention toward the Internet?  </p><p>TURNEY:  I think you're going to see us do both.  We have some stores that  are coming up to their end -- end of their lease line, but we'll also in --  when we start building stores, there are only 4,000 square feet.  </p><p>Today we've added on the pink line.  We've extended the beauty assortments.   We have the new VSX sports line.  We're adding swim wear to our stores so a  5,000 square foot store for us today is really too small.  So where we can  get the real estate, you'll see bigger stores from us that house all of  these different opportunities for Victoria's Secret.  </p><p>GLICK:  I said to you in the very beginning, you know, I look at people  like Heidi Klum and some of the other faces of Victoria's Secret, and we  all sort of want to be that person but of course, you know, part of the  beauty is the imagination or dreaming up how we can look like that person,  but can we do that affordably?  </p><p>TURNEY:  Well, there is that $5 million diamond bra but also within the  assortments today you can buy a bra for $20 from Victoria's Secret.  You  can buy a bra for $32 to $42 to $68 to $120.  </p><p>So we really do have a breath of price range for women today to come in and  buy a bra from Victoria's Secret.  </p><p>GLICK:  One last question for you.  Limited Brands was recently downgraded.   The debt was downgraded technically to junk status.  A lot of businesses  have said that they're having a very difficult time either getting access  to the credit markets or raising funds in this kind of climate.  </p><p>How are you guys doing?  How concerned about that are you?  And what do you  project that will mean for you in your ability to continue to either grow  or evolve as a business?  </p><p>TURNEY:  You know, we are very fortunate that we have over a billion  dollars in cash in the bank.  We have over a billion and a half credit line  today.  We've never had to go out and get into that credit line.  We are a  high margin, fast-turning business, and I think with the right prudent and  conservativism going into 2009 I don't believe at all that Limited Brands  will have any issues.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GLICK:  In fact she also told me that they plan to expand as many as four  stores in Canada.  They are looking at some other options.  They have a  thousand stores across the country.  </p><p>And if you're wondering about that runway show this evening, 500 hours  worth of fittings for the models to prepare for this evening's show.  </p><p>All right, well, my thanks again to the CEO, of course, of Victoria's  Secret for joining me yesterday.  </p><p>Coming up, we're going to continue our look at the bailout for automakers.   Senator Arlen Specter is going to join us live.  And the bailout could be  felt hundreds of miles away from Detroit.  </p><p>We're going to fill you in when the second hour of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST  returns.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK:  Good morning and welcome to hour number two of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.   I'm Alexis Glick.  </p><p>We're going to have the latest on the auto bailout coming up and Senator  Arlen Specter will join us to tell us what he is expecting of the  automakers.  </p><p>Also we'll get the latest numbers from the ADP jobs report.  That is due  out in 15 minutes.  This on the heels of a weaker than expected Challenger,  Gray &amp; Christmas numbers that came out just moments ago of a loss of  181,000 jobs in the month of November.  </p><p>Also coming up the CEO of Blockbuster Videos is going to join us as well.  </p><p>But first let's get a quick check of the futures as we stand right now.   We've been in negative territory throughout the morning, but right now we  are close back to the lows of the morning.  We're down 116 points.  We're  down 1.38 percent.  The S&amp;P is down 1.5 percent.  And NASDAQ is now down 2  1/4 percent.  </p><p>We've been jockeying all around this morning and after those employment  numbers this morning, we've moved lower.  </p><p>All right.  Congressional leaders are set to begin hearings Thursday on the  U.S. automakers' plan for survival and their request for as much as $34  billion in government loans.  For a look at what the plans say, here's Fox  Business Washington correspondent, Rich Edson, who's going to break down  all the details.  </p><p>Good morning, Rich.  </p><p>RICH EDSON, FBN CORRESPONDENT: And good morning, Alexis.</p><p>And all three automakers say they will make smaller, more fuel efficient  cars.  All three are willing to exchange warrants for government loans.  GM  says it will cut as many as 31,000 additional jobs.  Ford says it will at  least break even by 2011.  And Chrysler says it could start repaying the  government by 2012.  </p><p>The price tag for all of that and more is $34 billion worth of federal  loans.  GM wants $4 billion this month and up to $18 billion overall if the  economy gets worse.  Ford says it doesn't need the money now, but would  like a $9 billion line of credit.  Chrysler is asking for $7 billion.  And  Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson says the Bush administration supports  helping the automakers as long as the assistance comes from somewhere other  than the rescue package.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENRY PAULSON, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: So we have been very much for -- we  need a solution that avoids bankruptcy, but it's got to be leading to a  viable industry.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON: The administration still supports using $25 billion already set  aside to help the automakers reach fuel efficiency standards.  It is all up  to Democratic leadership.  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says no  decisions have been made yet, including whether the Senate or the House  will go first.  And none will be made, at least until the hearings, later  this week.</p><p>GM's COO Fritz Henderson is briefing lawmakers here this afternoon.  Reps  from the other two automakers will also work The Hill today.  The United  Auto Workers Union meets in the motor city today to perhaps discuss  concessions.  And GM's CEO Rick Wagoner says he and UAW President Ron  Gettlefinger agree that the union can be part of the solution, but not all  of it.</p><p>Alexis, back to you.  </p><p>GLICK: Yes, and, Rich, I imagine that the rhetoric is going to get tougher  and tougher, particularly given the fact that now -- particularly General  Motors is asking for an additional $6 billion.  Even Ford, who said they  may not need the $9 billion line, are talking about the need perhaps for an  additional $4 billion if the recession gets worse.  I mean, at what point  can we believe that enough is enough? </p><p>EDSON: Yes.  Well, that, and also look at the way that they're getting  here.  Now they're driving and giving up the corporate jets.  What you're  hearing in D.C. is, why didn't you come to us with this plan and this type  of approach the first time around?  We almost had to draw you in to doing  it the right way the second time.  </p><p>GLICK: Great point.  All right, Rich, we're going to leave it there.  Thank  you so much.  And I will check in with you in a little while.</p><p>Well, while much of the U.S. carmakers' bailout discussion focuses on the  impact the big three are having on Detroit, the auto industry's reach  extends far beyond Michigan's borders.  Take, for example, Chattanooga,  Tennessee.  Now despite the economic downturn, Volkswagen is putting $1  billion into a new plant in Chattanooga that will help create about 2,000  jobs.  For a look at how the possible bailout will affect the economy, both  in and out of Detroit, I'm joined by Trevor Hamilton.  He's the vice  president of economic development for the Chattanooga Chamber of Commerce,  and Republican Congressman Thaddeus McCotter of Michigan.  </p><p>Good  morning, gentlemen.  Thanks for being here.  </p><p>REP. THADDEUS MCCOTTER, (R) MICHIGAN: Thanks for having me.</p><p>TREVOR HAMILTON, CHATTANOOGA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE VP: Good morning, Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Trevor, let me start with you.  How has that Chattanooga  billion dollar project affected your local economy?  And why do you think  it is that Volkswagen has decided to invest in the U.S., particularly at a  time when we're all struggling? </p><p>HAMILTON: Well, for Chattanooga, this is really the culmination of a long- term vision for our community to recruit an automobile manufacturer to our  region.  Chattanooga has had a long history with manufacturing.  We believe  that manufacturing is still important to the economic base of this nation's  economy.  And so this is really a culmination of a long-term vision for our  community and our state here in Tennessee.  </p><p>Volkswagen carries less than a 3 percent market share in the United States  currently.  And their hope is that by the time this facility is operational  in 2011, that our economy will be again on the rebound and that they'll  have the right vehicle at the right price for the American consumer at that  time.  </p><p>GLICK: Congressman McCotter, I know that you understand more than anybody  how crucial this talk about a rescue plan is for the big three automakers.   You've had an opportunity to see the plans they put in place yesterday.   Did they make enough progress?</p><p>MCCOTTER: Well, I hope that they did.  It's going to be difficult because  much of what we've seen occur through the cost of restructuring to date in  flesh and blood we finally saw in black and white in a report issued to  Congress.  It's going to be a very tough haul.  It's going to be a tough  argument to make.  But I think members of Congress are going to realize  that the auto industry has been moving in the direction they wanted and  that there will be a viable plan for the future that protects taxpayers as  well because they're intrinsically, concomitivly (ph) mutually beneficial.  </p><p>GLICK: You know, congressman, we talk a lot about the big three and the  impact that it has on Detroit.  But here it is.  You and I both know, this  is a lot more than what's going on in Detroit or in the state of Michigan.   It's much grander than that.  Walk me through why some kind of plan is so  essential.  </p><p>MCCOTTER: I think it's important for the prosperity and the security of the  United States to have a domestic auto industry and a manufacturing  industry.  The auto industry is the heart of it.  If you look at what's  happening, especially in the foreclosure crisis, as Secretary Paulson has  admitted, if foreclosures continue to rise, you're going to have a very  difficult time stabilizing credit markets.  If people who are employed in  the auto industry now go into bankruptcy and are potentially losing  hundreds of thousands of their homes, they're going to exacerbate the  foreclosure crisis and our credit markets won't stabilize and we will  remain in the recession, if not find ourselves in a more dire position.</p><p>GLICK: Trevor, let me switch back to you.  Your state is the fifth largest  auto manufacturer in the country.  How much are you watching these bailout  hearings, or these rescue plan hearings, and how important do you think it  is to support the big three manufacturers? </p><p>HAMILTON: Well, here in Tennessee, as you say, we're the fifth largest auto  producing state in the country.  And over 160,000 Tennesseeans are employed  in that industry.  So we are watching the issue very closely.</p><p>And while it's difficult to say how it specifically will impact our  community, certainly our state is affected by the big three.  And we're  hopeful for a full economic recovery of the big three.</p><p>Here in Tennessee, we have a Saturn plant in the Nashville area.  And even  closer to Chattanooga, less than two hours from here, Ford recently  shuttered a plant in Atlanta.  And GM is slated to close their facility  there as well.  So I won't venture to guess what the solution is, but  certainly we hope for a full economic recovery of our domestic big three.  </p><p>GLICK: Congressman, one of the things that is on the table right now is a  discussion that's going on in Washington, D.C., and away from Washington,  D.C., and that is the concept of allowing some sort of government sort of  sponsored bailout plan where whereby the likes of GM and Chrysler do file  Chapter 11 bankruptcy but the government backstops any of the debt  thereafter, including the warranties.  How do you feel about that? </p><p>MCCOTTER: The auto companies and the UAW and everyone in the Michigan  delegation knows that bankruptcy is not an option.  What we want to see is  a bridge loan to the auto industry that can be repaid over time to the  taxpayers with the appropriate interest and, again, with the appropriate  taxpayer protection.  The ultimate one of which will be a viable plan for  the future.  We believe that those have been presented and we will be  making our case to our colleagues to approve one.  </p><p>GLICK: All right.  We're going to leave it there.  Congressman, thank you  very much.  And Trevor Hamilton, thank you both very much.  I'll be looking  forward to much more of this over the next couple of days.  Thank you,  gentlemen.  </p><p>And now let's send it over to Charles.  </p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Alexis.  </p><p>Well, you know, banks have seen better days in recent months.  But an  unlikely company, Microsoft, is showing banks how to attract and keep new  customers.  And not just any new customers.  The company group known as  millennials goes between ages of 18 and 30.  Bill Hartnett, Microsoft's  U.S. industry solutions director of insurance, joins us to discuss the new  strategy.  </p><p>Bill, you just finished your survey on the banking preferences of this  coveted group.  Tell us what you found.  </p><p>BILL HARTNETT, MICROSOFT FINANCIAL SERVICES: You bet, Charles.  </p><p>What we found is a real crisis of confidence and trust that's going on  right now.  And the group that's most affected by this are the millennials.   There are 80 million people in that group.  It's a really an amazing group  of people and there's a land grab out there for what will be the next  generation of high net worth individuals.  And we think technology and the  use of technology is going to be the key to attracting them.  </p><p>PAYNE: Bill, how specifically can Microsoft take this sort of information  and help banks to understand this group of folks? </p><p>HARTNETT: Well, one of the things you can do with technology is really  change the experience people have of dealing with a financial institution.   And if you look at the preferences of that millennial group, most of them  use technology in very interesting ways.  And we like to say they've been  marinading in technology since birth, right?  They don't know a world  without the PC or the Internet.  So they use social networking sites like  FaceBook and MySpace.  They instant message all the time.  In fact, they  prefer instant messaging over e-mail.  They use wickies (ph) and blogs all  the time.  When I was growing up, we didn't know what those things were,  right?</p><p>PAYNE: Right.  </p><p>HARTNETT: So if you really want to attract that customer base, and you  really want to reach them in a way where they start to build a trust  relationship with you, using technology in a way they want to use it will  be very key.  </p><p>PAYNE: Now even since the Internet boom, we heard about online banking and  Internet banking.  And it seems like a lot of companies came around, they  fell apart.  Which banks are now positioned, do you think right now, to  take advantage of this? </p><p>HARTNETT: Well, I think it's the banks that don't think like banks,  frankly.  If you think like a bank or a banker . . .</p><p>PAYNE: Is there one that you can tell -- is there someone . . .</p><p>HARTNETT: There are many.  I can give you a great example of a small bank,  a regional bank out on the West Coast we've done a lot of work with.  Umqua  Bank (ph).  They have a CEO who is just an amazing guy who focuses on that  customer experience and the employee experience, frankly, how does he  attract employees into </p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>GLICK: The Fox 50 makes up some lost ground, gaining 28 points.  Its  biggest one day advance since November 24th.  Forty-eight of the 50  components were up.  The biggest percentage gainers were Sprint, CBS and  General Electric.  Today, some big tech stocks in the index are in the  news.  Here now with a closer look is Fox Business contributor Charles  Payne and Leo Tilman, president of L.M. Tilman and former chief strategist  for Bear Stearns.</p><p>Good morning, gentlemen.  Thanks for being back.</p><p>PAYNE: Good morning.</p><p>GLICK: Leo, let's start with you.  Google out today waving a cautious flag  about future investments.  Tell me about this.  </p><p>LEO TILMAN, L.M. TILMAN PRESIDENT: Not particularly surprising, right?  The  economy continues to deteriorate.  Consumers are in trouble.  The housing  continues to deteriorate.  So Google's not immune to these problems.  </p><p>PAYNE: Yes, well, you know, Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: Look at this stock price.  I mean, I need people to take a look at  this because look at how high this stock was.  This stock was about $730 at  the beginning of the year.  </p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: It's $275, Charles.  </p><p>PAYNE: Yes, year over year it's down well over 50 percent.  And it's  absolutely mind boggling.  You know, Wall Street was -- Wall Street and  Google have always been somewhat at odds.  Google wanted to do it their way  from an unconventional IPO and since then and you always get the vision of  Google as being on one of those typical Silicon Valley -- they've got this  skate board ramping guys walking around, you know, brainstorming in the  conference room but no real obligations.  Wall Street never liked that.   They were always really upset with that aspect of the business.  You know,  it's one thing to be an intelligent company, but . . .</p><p>GLICK: But Wall Street loved the amount of cash that they had sitting on  the books.  And I would imagine what they didn't like was it looked like it  was excess.  And the day that a Google comes out and says, we're going to  lay off 10 percent of our workforce, then we begin to panic.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, yes.  Go ahead.</p><p>TILMAN: And I'm not sure if it's about Wall Street sort of causing this  sell-off.  I think it's an objective way that advertising revenues are  declining.  </p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>TILMAN: Consumer spending is declining.  So I think it's more of the  fundamentals that are affecting Google rather than . . .</p><p>PAYNE: Right.  And another point too.  The run-up in that stock, every time  they announced that they were doing a new initiative, the stock would run  up as if they were going to be completely successful in everything they  touched, you know.  And investors gave them the benefit of the doubt and,  of course, they have not been successful in everything they've tried.  </p><p>GLICK: OK.  There's another big story today.  I like this.  This is juicy.   The former AOL CEO may actually -- Jonathan Miller -- he is apparently  talking to a group of private equity investors, some sovereign wealth  funds, about perhaps trying to make a bid for all or part of Yahoo!'s  business for the tune of perhaps $20 to $22 a share.  Leo, what do you make  of this? </p><p>TILMAN: Will, I think it's interesting on many different counts.  And I'm  sure Charles will pitch in.  But one of them is that there's a fair amount  of private equity in sovereign wealth funds available to step in and buy  attractive stocks.  And that's a duality.  Nobody is lending.  That's what  we keep hearing.  But at the same time, a lot of money is available  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>GLICK: You still think there is money on the sidelines? </p><p>TILMAN: Definitely.  </p><p>PAYNE: Well, there's money on the sidelines.  But you talk about a group of  people that have been burnt.  Sovereign wealth guys have been scorched.  </p><p>GLICK: I was going to say, they've lost so much.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.  And also, a $40 billion deal right now.  I haven't seen any  sort -- listen, if he's going to get the money from TARP, he's got a better  shot, you know.  </p><p>GLICK: Yes.  This is -- oh, this is -- but it's a fascinating story.  </p><p>PAYNE: It is.</p><p>GLICK: All right, guys, we're going to leave it here.  You guys are going  to come back in just about 10 minutes.  We're going to talk more about some  important economic numbers coming out.  </p><p>PAYNE: OK.</p><p>GLICK: Well, the big three of Detroit, they have made their second bids for  a loan.  And now it has risen to $34 billion.  General Motors is looking  for up to $18 billion.  Chrysler wants 7.  And Ford is looking for $9  billion, although it says it may not need to use the funds.  For a glimpse  into how congressional leaders are reacting to these survival plans is  Republican Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.  </p><p>Senator, good morning.  Great to see you.  </p><p>SEN. ARLEN SPECTER, (D) PENNSYLVANIA: Good morning.  Nice to have a chance  to talk to you.  Thank you.  </p><p>GLICK: So, senator, I don't know, I'm a little skeptical here, I've got to  be honest with you.  I saw the proposals yesterday.  They finally did what  they needed to do.  They cleaned it up a little bit.  They brought a  proposal.  But they asked now for more money.  When is enough enough? </p><p>SPECTER: Well, there is good reason to be skeptical.  We know that the big  three, they haven't performed in the past.  They haven't kept up with the  times on fuel efficiency and cars that will sell.  But we're facing a  situation here where the consequences of their going under could be very,  very devastating for the entire economy.  </p><p>So the issue is, will their plans provide a realistic opportunity for  success?  And in our free enterprise system, we let the market determine  winners and losers.  But where you have a situation where there could be a  very serious impact on the entire economy, I think we ought to consider the  specifics as to what they've proposed.  </p><p>GLICK: Yes.  I mean my concern, senator, is, look, believe me, I'm worried  about the job losses, I'm worried about the industry and the implications  it could have for the greater economy.  What bothers me about the story is  it has not been clearly demonstrated to me what the sustainability is of  the industry.  And perhaps what we need to consider is, maybe it shouldn't  be the big three.  I mean maybe it should be the big seven or a  combination, you know.  I just haven't heard enough of a justification as  to how the industry is going to change.  We're built for 16 million cars.   We're selling 10 million cars.  And I imagine that number's not going to  get much better over the next couple of years.  </p><p>SPECTER: Well, you haven't heard enough justification.  And, frankly,  neither have I.  But I'm prepared to look.  That's my pedigree.  My job as  a senator is to take a look at the specifics as to what they have proposed.   I want to see where their efficiencies are.  I want to see the economists  and the experts in the field make an evaluation which is objective.  And  then I want to make the determination as to whether there's a realistic  chance that they can succeed.  Because if we can avoid having them go under  and having a lot of people lose their jobs and having the ripple effect go  through suppliers and automobile dealers across the economy, that's  something what we want to do.  But we're not going to do it blindly.  Only  if they make a solid case.  </p><p>GLICK: Great point.  A solid case.  </p><p>Now, let me ask you, there are two members who are going to be sitting on  the panel.  I know you had Peter Morici from the University of Maryland  sitting on the panel last time.  This time you're going to have comptroller  Mr. Gene Didarro (ph), who's a Moody's chief economist.  Tell me why you're  adding these two names to the panel and what you hope to get out of them in  addition to talking to the executives.  </p><p>SPECTER: Well, the economists have been added to the panel to get some  independent evaluation as to what the consequences would be.  Look here,  when you talk about what's going to happen in the future on the economy, it  is very, very hard to judge.  And we want to have the best experts we can  find to give us some insights.  And then there's examination and cross- examination.  </p><p>You must watch C-Span occasionally, as well as your own network, and you  see the way the senators probe and get more information.  And we'll be  doing that.  It's our judgment.  It's not their judgment.  We're elected to  make these judgments.  And that's why I convened a meeting yesterday in  Philadelphia, why my staff and I have been pouring over the details of the  semicolons (ph) so that when we go back to Washington on Monday, we're in a  position to make an informed judgment.  </p><p>GLICK: You know, you were speaking of Philadelphia, senator.  Tell me, how  do the people in Pennsylvania feel about the bailout of the auto industry? </p><p>SPECTER: Well, people in Pennsylvania haven't spoken about the bailout of  the auto industry.  But let me tell you how they felt about the $700  billion which we legislated all last October.  They didn't like it.  </p><p>I spent the month of October doing town meetings, which is my practice, to  touch all of Pennsylvania's 67 counties.  The temperature was 212.  They  wanted to know why the regulators hadn't done their job.  They wanted to  know what was going to be done with the $700 billion.  And I told them that  it was a very bitter decision that I faced and that the others faced  because of what we were informed would be the consequences.  </p><p>So the issue now to help the big three is something that I'm prepared to do  only if they really make, as I said before, the solid case.  I know that  the public opinion is against the bailouts, but sometimes, in my position,  you have to make decisions which may not be the most popular if that really  is my judgment or our collective judgment about what is in the public  interest.  </p><p>GLICK: You know, senator, I am so glad that you brought up the TARP program  because there are reports that Treasury Secretary Paulson may go as early  as next week to members of Congress to ask for the other $350 billion.  If  he stands in front of the Senate, what will you tell him if he asks for the  money?  </p><p>SPECTER:  Well, the first thing I will ask him is what he has done  with the first $350 billion.  We have a problem which was created because  of the mortgage situation, defaults on mortgages, and the Treasury  Department has done precious little on that subject.  </p><p>Then we took a look at the credit freeze, and there were a lot of  highly sophisticated fandangos that they were undertaking to try to put  money in the banks and nothing has happened there.  Before we're going to  consider giving him $350 billion more, he is going to have to have some  really good explanations as to what he has done with the first $350  billion.  </p><p>And I've had a chance to meet with Treasury Secretary Paulson, and  very bluntly, I haven't been impressed with what he has had to say.  </p><p>GLICK:  Finally, before I let you go, in Philadelphia yesterday, in  addition to the meetings that you said you had about the auto manufacturers  and the plans they laid out, President-elect Obama met with many current  governors and former governors about this proposed stimulus plan.  </p><p>We are now hearing to the tune of $500 billion, maybe more, how do you  feel about it, and do you believe that infrastructure, rebuilding, job  creation are essential parts of a fiscal stimulus plan if in fact we have  the money to pay for it?  </p><p>SPECTER:  There's no doubt that our highways and our bridges are  crumbling.  What I'm going to be looking for are parts of a stimulus plan  which are pro-growth.  For example, the stimulus package we passed last  summer, I had a proposal which had been pending for a long time to  authorize expensing or deductibility of 50 percent in the first year of  capital advances.  </p><p>For example, if a steel company built a big hearth, they had it  depreciated 20 years, 5 percent a year, my legislation, which is put into  the plan, is able to take 50 percent in the first year.  And that's the  kind of a pro-growth proposal which sticks to the regs, which is more than  giving several hundred dollars to people to spend, which doesn't have any  lasting effect.  </p><p>It may feel good for a short period of time.  So when we talk about  highways and bridges and items which will enable us to be pro-growth in the  future, those are the proposals which will draw my support.  </p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Well, Senator Specter, great pleasure speaking  with you this morning.  Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with  us.  </p><p>SPECTER:  Thank you.  I have enjoyed it.  </p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Let's go upstairs to Connell McShane, because,  Connell, I know we saw those third-quarter productivity numbers just came  out.  And a little bit more analysis on those ADP numbers as well.  </p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Yes, we see the productivity at  the bottom of your screen has actually been revised higher in the third  quarter which is a surprise.  The expectation was it would be revised  lower.  So 1.3 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter compared to  the prior quarter.  That is an upward revision compared to the first  number.  And it was expected to be downward.  </p><p>So that is a bit of a surprise to the market.  The futures have  actually come off their lows, for what it is worth, they're down 142, and  the Dow futures have been about 20 points more than that there a moment  ago.  </p><p>So that's the economic data this morning that has just been released.   There are your futures.  We are going to give you, as we go to break here,  two quick stocks to watch in the day ahead, Goldman Sachs and Morgan  Stanley.  Merrill Lynch has just come out and significantly cut its fourth- quarter earnings estimates or lack thereof for both Goldman and Morgan.</p><p>Instead of a profit, they are expecting losses of both of these firms.   And they've -- the downward revision could affect both of those stocks.   Keep an eye on them today.  Our panel is going to weigh in on all of the  economic numbers, and a FOX Business exclusive, the CEO of Blockbuster  coming up, explaining how they are competing in a crowded market.  So don't  go away. \"Money for Breakfast\" continues here in just a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>GLICK:  All right.  As Connell just mentioned, the productivity  numbers, the revision to the third quarter just came out.  In addition we  saw the second announcement of jobs reports this morning coming out of ADP  on private sectors, a decline of 250,000.  That did exceed estimates.  And  Q3 productivity was slightly better than anticipated, coming in at 1.3  percent.  </p><p>This on the heels of a Challenger Gray &amp; Christmas jobs number that  came out earlier this morning that showed a job loss of 181,000 in the  month of November.  To break down all three of those numbers, Leo Tilman is  the former chief strategist for Bear Stearns; Mark Lieberman is our FOX  Business senior economist; and our FOX Business contributor Charles Payne  is here.  </p><p>All right, guys.  Mark, you got an opportunity to look at the Q3  productivity number.  I know unit labor costs is something you are  concerned about.  What did you find and how does it look?  </p><p>MARK LIEBERMAN, FOX BUSINESS SR. ECONOMIST:  Unit labor costs went up  3.1 percent in the final report...  </p><p>GLICK:  What does that mean?  </p><p>LIEBERMAN:  It means it is actually the cost of producing each  specific item.  It is an index that tracks that.  It tells us something  about where inflation is going and this is obviously tracking what we have  seen in other inflation indicators.  </p><p>Similarly, as we look at the overall productivity number, a strong  productivity gain is probably more important in a good economy because it  keeps prices down and it keeps a standard of living up.  </p><p>What's happening now is, and it's tracking what we see in the rest of  the economy, output is down, we see that from GDP, but employment and jobs  are down further.  So when you do simple arithmetic...</p><p>GLICK:  Workers are becoming more productive.  </p><p>LIEBERMAN:  Exactly.  </p><p>GLICK:  Charles, what do you make of these numbers?  Also the ADP  number -- which let's keep in mind, the ADP number saw a loss of 250,000  jobs, there's usually not the best of correlations between the private  sector number and the non-farm payrolls that we see from the Bureau of  Labor Statistics on Friday.  But we've been looking for a loss of 300,000.  </p><p>I wonder whether or not those estimates are going to go higher since  the private sector number was so depressing.  </p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely.  And to that  point, ADP numbers always seem to be a lot rosier, if you will, than the  Bureau of Labor statistics.  So for them to come out with 250,000, you have  got to be nervous.  </p><p>I mean, if you weren't nervous already, to be quite frank, you are  right now.  As far as productivity, Alexis, I mean, this is something that  was really more important in a different sort of economy where the Fed  didn't know if it wanted to lower rates or raise rates and they needed  cover.  You know, I know Greenspan was able to use that productivity boom  to keep rates low, much to everyone's chagrin...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)   </p><p>GLICK:  Yes, but what we really care about is jobs today.  </p><p>PAYNE:  At this point, yes.  It doesn't seem like it matters.  </p><p>GLICK:  So, Leo, you have two pieces of data that came out this  morning, both worse than anticipated, what do you now think the non-farm  payrolls numbers is going to look like on Friday?  </p><p>LEO TILMAN, FMR. CHIEF STRATEGIST, BEAR STEARNS:  I think it is going  to be weak.  And all indications point to that.  And to that point I think  the inflation story is less important today.  It is interesting that early  in the year we were all concerned about systemic inflation pressures.  Then  we went into deflation worries.  And now I think it's just not an issue for  any foreseeable future.  </p><p>It is conceivable that down the road the stimuli, the monetary policy  are going to reignite inflation, but it is not in any foreseeable future.  </p><p>GLICK:  Mark?  </p><p>LIEBERMAN:  I think that's right.  I mean, you know, deflation became  more and more of a concern.  And when you think about it, I mean, what can  the Fed do if we were in an inflationary environment?  Well, the Fed can  raise interest rates.  One of the ways you would combat deflation is to  reduce interest rates.  Well, there's a floor on how far you can go down on  deflation.  </p><p>GLICK:  But if deflation becomes, as some suspect it might, a really  big problem, let's just say for the sake of argument over the next six  months, I know everybody is talking about inflation longer term being the  bigger issue because we're -- the printing presses have not shut down since  we arrived on television a year ago, but what if deflation becomes a real  issue?  How do we address it knowing that real interest rates are actually  negative?  </p><p>LIEBERMAN:  A couple of things are going to work on this.  Number one,  as income improves, as the economy does recover, and this may shock some of  the people who I work with regularly, it will recover.  The...</p><p>GLICK:  Oh, so that was the rose-colored glasses, the question,  Mark...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>GLICK:  ... which we get like once every three months.</p><p>PAYNE:  He has a rose-colored monocle somewhere.</p><p>LIEBERMAN:  Exactly.  No, the economy clearly will recover.  It's  going to take some time.  And what's going to happen at the recovery, there  will be pent up demand, and demand is the furor (ph) for deflation.  You  have to do whatever you can to pump up demand.  </p><p>We have to put people back to work.  We talk about that ad nauseam.   Although it's obviously...</p><p>GLICK:  Investments, all that kind of stuff.</p><p>LIEBERMAN:  ... investments and things like that.  And people -- you  know, there's going to be -- if you deprive yourself of that big screen TV,  at some point you are going to want to buy it, even though it's not made  here.  </p><p>TILMAN:  On that note, bringing down long-term rates is going to play  to that as well.  So all the purchases of Treasury securities and agency  securities by the Fed are an additional stimulus that should...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>GLICK:  ... mortgage applications explode.  And I understand you say  it is only applications, it is not necessarily full refinance activity.   But, look, Charles and I have been talking about it, I'm like -- the minute  I started seeing rates come down, I'm like, let's get on it.  And I think a  lot of people across this country are.  So hopefully that's one good piece  of...  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>LIEBERMAN:  Let's think about that for a second, because what that is  saying is that homeowners who are refi-ing -- it is not purchases, it is  homeowners who are refi-ing, if they are doing that, why are they doing it?   They desperately need cash.  </p><p>GLICK:  Yes.  I'd like a little extra cash.  Hey, it is a good thing.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>PAYNE:  Since the National Bureau of Economic Research gave this time  stamp to the recession, we have got to give Mark props.  Because Mark did  call this.  </p><p>GLICK:  Yes, he did say fourth quarter last year.</p><p>LIEBERMAN:  Thank you.  </p><p>GLICK:  You did call it, yes.</p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>GLICK:  Yes, there he is.  We love Mark Lieberman, even when he's  depressed, we always try to cheer him up though.  </p><p>LIEBERMAN:  For depression you take a pill.  Otherwise for  recession...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>GLICK:  A pill.  A cocktail.  I was thinking these should be Bloody  Mary conversations from now on.  What do you think?  I mean, we could  propose that.  </p><p>LIEBERMAN:  Mimosas, whatever.  </p><p>GLICK:  Yes.  See, look, there he is, mimosas.  All right, guys, thank  you very much.  And I do want to mention by the way that Leo Tilman has a  book, and I haven't even mentioned it, it's \"Financial Darwinism.\" This is  a very brilliant guy.  So you want to pick that up.  All right, guys.  </p><p>Coming up, we're going to talk to Blockbuster video because they are  making some huge changes.  The CEO of the movie rental chain is going to be  with us in a FOX Business exclusive when we return.  They've got some very  exciting things up their sleeves that I'm not sure you have heard about.   We will talk about that coming up next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>GLICK:  Blockbuster the leading brand for video rentals has seen its  original business model attacked by technology, but now it's hitting the  fast forward button to reinvent itself.  The company is teaming up with  Microsoft to develop new digital services that will let you watch movies on  your phone.  And it has entered into a partnership with Live Nation to sell  concert tickets.  This morning we welcome James Keyes, he's the chairman  and CEO of Blockbuster.  </p><p>Good to see you. </p><p>JAMES KEYES, CHMN. &amp; CEO, BLOCKBUSTER:  Great to be here, thanks.  </p><p>GLICK:  So you are doing a lot of inventive things because there's  always this tug-of-war between Netflix and Blockbuster, each trying to move  one step ahead of each other.  Tell me about some of these -- this new  technological road map, particularly as it relates to cell phones or mobile  devices.  </p><p>KEYES:  Well, mobile devices, eventually portability is going to be  king.  We all like the convenience of being able to watch content when we  want, where we want.  And that really is the legacy of Blockbuster.   Blockbuster was never really about video rentals.  It was always about  convenient access to media entertainment.  </p><p>So the key is for us to transcend all of the various channels to keep  up with technology and to provide our customers with the most convenient  access wherever it is, even on your mobile phone.  </p><p>GLICK:  So I understand you are working on a deal here with Microsoft  in terms of how to get the technology and the software so that we can get  it on our mobile devices, and one of the things you are doing right now is  testing it on kiosks and the ability for us perhaps to travel in an airport  and upload it at some point in the future.  Where is that going?  </p><p>KEYES:  Well, the key with the digital technology is that it's a  wonderful thing.  It allows so much flexibility with content, and yet, it  seems that everyone is trying to get content on their big screen TV.   Bandwidth in the United States is going to take some time to catch up to  this demand because the file size for movies is actually very large.  </p><p>So in the interim, in the next five years or 10 years, there are many  other ways to deliver digital content.  We are trying out some kiosks in  stores, for example, so instead of taking an hour, hour-and-a-half to load  a movie, you can load it in 30 seconds or 60 seconds right directly onto a  portable device and have the convenience and flexibility of digital content  in a portable fashion.  </p><p>GLICK:  You know, there are a lot of people who look at the video game  industry, as I said to you yesterday, I spoke to an executive at Xbox, and  I know they have a relationship with Netflix, but they look at that  industry as a place which is experiencing unusual growth in a very  difficult economy, and they are experiencing it year-over-year.  </p><p>What kind of things are you trying to do perhaps to maybe address that  audience, that demo which is a tremendous demo by doing partnerships like  what Netflix and Xbox are doing together?  </p><p>KEYES:  We are -- again, it is very early, the idea of digital content  directly to the home through game consoles or set-top boxes, very, very  early in its development.  Yes, we just released just a week ago a deal  with a company called 2Wire, that's a large provider of these boxes and  this technology to deliver content directly to the television, so now you  can get Blockbuster on demand.  </p><p>We have several thousand movies, new releases available from the ease  of pulling up video-on-demand from your couch.  And this is just another  step.  Again, very early.</p><p>GLICK:  So who will sell those boxes?  I mean, if 2Wire is a company  that makes them, like, would I be able to get them on my set-top cable box?   I mean, where will I see that come to me, the consumer?  </p><p>KEYES:  Today you can actually buy Blockbuster on demand online at  blockbuster.com.  We are selling it in a few stores just trying to test the  consumer demand.  That's really our objective right now.  It is very early  in the developmental stage.  </p><p>But eventually you will find that this capability is baked not only  into your cable box, but directly into your television set.  In fact, we  announced a deal with Intel not too long ago where their new chip for their  Internet-ready television set in the next couple of years will include a  widget that allows you to pull up the Blockbuster icon right there on your  television set and have immediate access to all of your favorite movies.  </p><p>GLICK:  OK.  So let's just take that example and let's just assume  that for the sake of argument you live here in a place like New York City,  you have Time Warner Cable.  So I have Time Warner Cable and I have now  just purchased this Internet television.  Time Warner offers pay-per-view  events, on demand events, how is it that I'm going to go to you as opposed  to going to my cable operator who has been wired into my home?  </p><p>KEYES:  Well, today Blockbuster really owns that entertainment  customer, particularly the customer for movies.  And so our job is to make  it a nice smooth transition for that customer to move over to these other  services.  And that's why we're leading now with Blockbuster on demand.  </p><p>Eventually the cable companies will want to offer their customers  various services.  We will all have unique content.  We will all have  proprietary and exclusive content, and that will keep Blockbuster, the  brand, relevant for the consumer.  </p><p>GLICK:  You know, one of the things I said yesterday to this executive  at Xbox is I said, listen, you know, when we're on that console and they  show the list of Netflix movies, they tend to be outdated, frankly.   They're not the kind of movies, I'm sorry to say, that I want to see in  today's world.  </p><p>How do you make sure that you are delivering the newest, most credible  content on any device right now so that it makes me want to do it?  And if  iPhone is doing something similar, why would I go with one of the devices  that you have in a relationship with Microsoft as opposed to everybody  carrying around that iPhone or that iPod?  </p><p>KEYES:  Well, first of all, you won't have that problem with  Blockbuster.  People have come to know and trust Blockbuster for the newest  releases, the latest releases.  Our Blockbuster on demand will have new  releases.  It is very different from the Netflix offering, as an example,  which is a unique product, a very good product, but it is a subscription  product.</p><p>And by nature, subscription content delivered digitally will be a  little bit older content.  It will be more in the pay TV window or two or  three years older on average than the new releases that you can find  available on Blockbuster.  </p><p>So this is an opportunity for us.  And as we go forward, our key  competitive advantage will be to make it easy, convenient for the customer,  and to have the best content available, the newest releases, exclusive  content only available at Blockbuster.  </p><p>GLICK:  All right.  James Keyes, sounds terrific.  Come back, join us  again, particularly as you put some of these plans in place.  I want to see  some of these devices and learn a little bit more about it.  </p><p>KEYES:  Well, thanks, great to be here.  </p><p>GLICK:  Great to have you.  </p><p>All right, guys.  We will be right back in just a moment with the \"1  Thing You Should Know.\"  Unfortunately, the one thing you should know right  now is the market is pretty much at the low of the day.  We are down 140 --  156 points right now.  The S&amp;P down 2 percent, the Nasdaq down 2.25  percent.  Some of this of course on the heels of those jobs numbers this  morning.  We will be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>GLICK:  All right.  Now it is time for the \"1 Thing You Should Know.   We get started with Ashley Webster in London.  </p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you know what,  Alexis?  I was looking at all this miserable news that's coming about in  the U.K. and the Eurozone, I thought, well, I will do this story.  It's  kind of interesting.  </p><p>But there is quite a lot of snow around the U.K. and there's some  blizzards forecast for tonight in the northern part of the country.  So  that means the odds of it snowing in London on Christmas Day now down to 11  to 4.  It was 7 to 1.  </p><p>You know, we bet on anything in the U.K.  The odds are now down that a  snow flake will fall on the London weather center on Christmas Day is now  down to 11 to 4.  I may take that bet.  </p><p>GLICK:  Wow, yes.  Wouldn't it be great to have a white Christmas?  We  don't have enough white Christmases, at least here in New York.  I'm sure  for you in California it rarely ever happens.  When you were growing up,  did they do -- like I heard some families would bring in like the fake  snow?  </p><p>JENNA LEE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Oh, they do that, yes, absolutely.   They will have like places that the kids can sled, but it will be sunny.   So it never really felt like Christmas.  It was always sunny.  </p><p>GLICK:  Yes, but now you are here.  </p><p>LEE:  Now I can freeze and feel...  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>GLICK:  OK.  So what's your \"1 Thing\"?  </p><p>LEE:  You know, we (INAUDIBLE) talk so much about mortgage  applications and refinances being way up.  And I think that after the  program that was announced last week, that can't be a bad sign.  And we  have to take it in relative terms from the weeks before, but it can't be a  bad thing.  </p><p>GLICK:  Yes, I like that.  I actually think it is a good sign.  I  understand Lieberman is like, Alexis, it is only applications, but you know  what?  The fact that we can make homeownership more affordable or that  we'll go out and refinance, personally I'm hoping to take advantage of it.  </p><p>PAYNE:  I think it is fantastic.  My \"1 Thing\" though is, by the way,  I think automakers, the CEOs should go on horseback to Capitol Hill.  </p><p>GLICK:  Maybe they should do the Clydesdales.  </p><p>PAYNE:  They should ride horses because, you know what, you bring back  the thought of Paul Revere and how important it is for America.  And also  you suggest to America, you don't bail us out, everybody is going to be  riding one of these.  </p><p>GLICK:  Yes, that's a great point.  What about that \"made in America.\"  You know, we need to like be excited about \"made in America\" again.  We  need to work on them.  Give them some tips.  </p><p>All right, guys.  We are going to go to commercial break.  We are  going to come back.  We are going to have \"The Opening Bell\" coming up  next.  We are going to talk to a top executive in the power and energy  world who can talk to us a little bit about all of this electricity grid,  infrastructure building, some of the things that we have been talking about  in terms of fiscal stimulus.  </p><p>Stay with us.  \"The Opening Bell\" is next.  Thanks, guys.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2008 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Coming up this morning on \"MONEY  FOR BREAKFAST,\" the planes are out, the hybrids are in, and those  turnaround plans delivered.  But will Detroit automakers blueprints for  survival convince Congress to give them a bailout?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And a Fox Business Exclusive, Anheuser-Busch President David Peacock with  the latest on the Inbev buyout and what the future may hold for the  company's marketing icon ,the Clydesdales.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And then we'll hit the catwalk for Victoria's Secret annual fashion show,  in another Fox Business Exclusive, an interview with Victoria's Secret's  CEO.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Today is Wednesday, December 3rd, 2008.  \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" starts right  now.</p><p> Good morning and welcome to \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.\"  I'm Alexis Glick.</p><p> We have the very latest on the auto bailout coming up and Senator Arlen  Specter will join us a little bit later.</p><p> Also the latest challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas numbers and the ADP private  sector numbers will all be coming out this morning.</p><p> But first a quick look on how the futures are stacking up here in the U.S.</p><p> This after a nice rally yesterday while most of the major markets were up  anywhere from three to four percent, lifting up about I guess a third to  half of the losses that we saw on Monday.</p><p> But this morning we have reversed trend.  We are now looking lower, down  1.3 percent or down 115 points on the DOW we're staying at about 8,320.   The S&amp;P is down 13 or 1.7 percent.  The NASDAQ is down 17 or down about one  and a half percent as we speak.</p><p> All right, let's get things started with the three things you should know  this morning.</p><p> After saying he was not going to touch the remaining TARP funds, Secretary  of the Treasury Henry Paulson is according to the \"Wall Street Journal\"  debating whether to ask Congress for the second half of those funds.</p><p> The Journal says he may ask for it as early as next week.</p><p> And one month after Election Day, incumbent Republican Senator Saxby  Chambliss is claiming victory against Democrat Jim Martin in a runoff  election in Georgia after neither received at least 50 percent of the votes  as mandated by state law.</p><p> Meanwhile, Minnesota says they are into day nine of the recount between  Republican incumbent Senator Norm Coleman and comic Al Franken.</p><p> And Super Bowl hero Plaxico Burress is done for the year and maybe for good  with the New York Giants who fined and suspended him yesterday after he  accidentally shot himself in the leg last weekend at a Manhattan nightclub.   He now faces a minimum two-year jail term under New York law.</p><p> All right, those are the three things you should know about this morning.</p><p> Now for the three things you need to know about in the overseas markets,  here's Mr. Ashley Webster in London.</p><p> ASHLEY WEBSTER, FBN OVERSEAS MARKETS WRITER:  Hey, good morning, Alexis and  good morning, everybody.</p><p> Well, we saw some nice gains in Asia, but not so, so far in Europe.  Let's  take a look at the latest numbers.  Here in London on the FTSE 100, down  about half a percent at this hour.  Although this is off of our lows.  In  Paris the CAC-40 off one and a half.  And in Germany the DAX 30 index also  off close to two percent now.</p><p> Talking of Germany, shares in a big German semiconductor company are short  circuiting this morning; Infineon, reporting its seventh straight quarterly  loss.  The company says the fourth quarter loss came in at a whopping $970  million more than expected.  The company blaming weakness in the sector,  restructuring costs and write-downs associated with its stake in chipmaker  Qimonda, Infineon's stock now down 25 percent.</p><p> Sacre bleu, Warren Buffett is facing a fight now with a French utility.   Electricity de France is making a $4.5 billion bid for 50 percent of  Constellation Energy's nuclear assets now Warren Buffett's Berkshire  Hathaway already made a $4.7 billion bid for this company for all of the  company; it is a U.S. power company.  Shareholders will vote on Buffett's  offer later this month.  But EBS says it undervalues Constellations true  worth, it is a battle royale no doubt.</p><p> Let's go to Connell McShane for today's three market movers.  Good morning,  Connell.</p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Ashley.</p><p> The Blackberry maker Research in Motion making a list this morning cutting  its third quarter forecast.  The company saying earnings per share are  going to come in somewhere between 81 and 83 cents.  The problem with that  is that Wall Street is looking for 91 cents.  So RIM saying a stronger  dollar as well as the general economic slowdown have hurt its business and  had hurt its stock plunging more than 67 percent so far this year.</p><p> Google is bracing for very difficult times.  The Internet search engine  giant is cutting back spending and cutting back on projects; a lot of the  perks that go into being an employee at Google are apparently going by the  wayside.  So we'll keep an eye on Google stock down from the 700s into the  275 range on that stock here over the last year or so.</p><p> Now, we do have some breaking news this morning that we want to bring to  you on mortgage applications.  We don't always give you this number as it  comes out but it is just being released now and what a gain in mortgage  applications as mortgage rates come down.</p><p> In fact, according to the Mortgage Banker's Association, this is the  biggest gain they have ever seen, in record.  It is just in this morning.   An increase has been reported in refinancing activity; that is a very, very  big increase.  Overall we're talking about re-fi's being up percentage  terms at least by 200 percent here over the same -- over the last week and  the overall market index increasing 112 percent according to the MBA which  is just out with these numbers.</p><p> Again, it's their largest rise on record Alexis, the mortgage applications  with the drop we've seen in mortgage rates apparently more people going out  and refinancing their mortgages and getting new mortgages all together.  So  that's an interesting stat that's just in.</p><p> Those are the three market movers and it's back over to you in the studio.</p><p> GLICK:  All right, I love that stat.  I'm trying to refinance my mortgage  too, Connell, just not getting the phone call back.</p><p> MCSHANE:  Get in there.</p><p> GLICK:  But we'll talk about that later.</p><p> All right, Detroit's big three automakers presented recovery plans to  Congress late yesterday, and the pitch has become more dramatic as General  Motors and Chrysler now say they are on the verge of a collapse by month's  end unless they get the money from the government they need right now.</p><p> For more on what the plans say, Fox Business's Rich Edson joins us this  morning from Washington, D.C. with more of the details.  Good morning Rich.</p><p> RICH EDSON, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hi good morning, Alexis.  When these guys  were up on Capitol Hill a couple of weeks ago and they were asking for $25  billion, it wasn't all that convincing that $25 billion was all that they  needed especially when Congressmen were asking them to basically add up and  individually separate how much they would need out of that $25 billion.</p><p> Two car companies went first and when the third went, they really couldn't  answer to bring to that $25 billion number.  Eventually they got there.   And then they said ok we do need only 25 billion.  But today that number  has been just blown out of the water; $34 billion is potentially what these  guys say they are going to need over the next year from the federal  government.</p><p> The biggest coming from GM, $18 billion they say they are going to need at  least $12 billion to operate next year, $4 billion immediately of that $12  billion, and if the economy gets worse, they say they are going to need an  extra $6 billion.  That goes to $18 billion for next year.</p><p> Ford is asking for $9 billion.  Though it says it does not need it right  away, it would like a $9 billion line of credit from the government.</p><p> And Chrysler is saying that it wants $7 billion in loans from the federal  government.</p><p> So the proposals are in.  They are on Capitol Hill.  And one analyst said  it's time to get to legislative work.  Here's what he had to say.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEAN WEST, GROUP ANALYST:  The last round was a nice bit of political  theater.  The Democrats got that out of the way.  They don't look like they  are soft on automakers anymore.  They played tough.  They wouldn't have  continued to keep the session open if they weren't planning on actually  funding something.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EDSON:  All right, here the concessions all three CEOs say they will take  only a dollar in compensation if they get the loans.  Chrysler is talking  about an electric drive model in 2010.  Ford says its 2015 fleet will be 36  percent more efficient than the models it offered in 2005.  GM is giving  corporate jets, they're giving them up.  Ford is selling its jets and they  are all driving to Washington, D.C. this time around; big difference from  last time.</p><p> They're asking for billions of dollars, and they're also offering warrants  in exchange for those billions.  As far as the differences are concerned,  Ford says it can turn a profit by 2011 or at least break even by that year.   Chrysler is in merger talks.  That really separates them.  They are still  looking for a partner.</p><p> And GM will focus its U.S. branding to Chevy, Buick, GMC and Cadillac.   Pontiac is going to stay more of a niche brand.  Rick Wagoner says GM is  looking hard at all its other names and they can possibly contract them.</p><p> But Alexis as you know, when GM got rid of Oldsmobile a couple of years  ago, it was a lengthy process, it was an expensive process.  It cost them  more than a million bucks, a billion bucks excuse me, back to you.</p><p> GLICK:  Yes, I was going to say, it was a little bit more than that.  All  right, Rich Edson thank you so much, for bringing us up to date on all of  that because wow it is complicated.</p><p> Well, as lawmakers debate that total of $34 billion that Rich Edson just  talked about, automakers say they need the money to speed up production of  new energy saving vehicles.</p><p> Now, based on yesterday's sales figures, no one is buying their current  crop of cars.  Get this, Chrysler sales were down 47 percent.  GM was down  41.  Ford down 31.  Now, if GM survives it is betting big on the Volt, an  electric car that has been rushed into production and will hit show rooms  ideally within 18 months.</p><p> Here to discuss if the $40,000 Volt can save GM is Michael Duoba, he is the  mechanical engineer at the Center for Transportation Research Energy  Systems Division.  And John Grisma is the chief insights officer for Young  and Rubican Brands.  He is also the author of \"The Brand Bubble: The  looming crisis in brand value and how to avoid it.\"</p><p> Welcome, gentlemen, thanks for being here.</p><p> MICHAEL DUOBA, CENTER FOR TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH:  Thanks, Alexis.</p><p> GLICK:  Michael, let me start with you.  GM has been talking about this  Volt.  In fact the vice chairman sort of staked his career on it.  He's  been incredibly well known in the industry for the kind of cars he's  developed.  What do you make of whether or not GM could be successful with  this car?</p><p> DUOBA:  Well, I think that the Chevy Volt is a pretty exciting car.  I  think Bob Lutz is kind of the John F. Kennedy saying that he's going to go  to the moon and end of the decade.  And I think GM is kind of staking their  brand on taking this car to the next level and perhaps dethroning the Prius  as being the ultimate environmental car.</p><p> GLICK:  John, there's some big differences between how people look at a car  like the Toyota Prius and how they're trying to market this GM's Volt car  here.  Tell me what the differences are and why this is so important in  their ability to sell this car.</p><p> JOHN GRISMA, CHIEF INSIGHTS OFFICER FOR YOUNG AND RUBICAN BRANDS:   Absolutely.  I think first and most importantly you have to look at GM is  looking at this strategy clearly to improve its overall corporate image.   And if you look back at some of the studies we've got actually seen there  was a halo effect on the Toyota Prius meaning that there was actually  moving across the board.  You saw the SUVs and the trucks actually  improving their perceptions of fuel efficiency just on the basis of having  this one product in the line.</p><p> So clearly that's important from a perspective.  But I think we have to  slow down a little bit and really focus on what is the essence of this car?   Will it really make an impact in the marketplace?</p><p> I think you've got to look at the fact that it is essentially they are  talking 10,000 cars in what 2011.  You're talking $30,000 at a price point  a lot of questions it just loses with consumers.</p><p> GLICK:  Yes and right now the price tag we're hearing is more like $40,000  but there's some vagary around it because it's still a long ways away.</p><p> But John, part of the issue here, you are a brand expert, and you've been  watching what's been happening to the quality and the franchise behind the  GM name.  What has been happening and why is that contributing sort to the  lack of, I guess, belief that this company can turn the story around?</p><p> GRISMA:  You know, one of the things we wrote about in our book was the  concept that consumers are actually acting more and more like shareholders,  like investors.  They are actually looking into the future for their  expectations of brands.</p><p> And when we look at GM in the context of brand asset value which is our  consumer brand database we have seen decline in trust, decline in  differentiation, a decline in sort of perceived quality.  This isn't  necessarily fair because they are making some great products and the  critics have actually -- the car critic really praised recent brands like  the Cadillac, GTS, as well as the Saturn Aura.</p><p> So in that context I think what GM is trying to do is clearly get on board  with green.  I think all the big three automakers were behind a little bit  in this in the 90s.  They're trying to practice the sense of humility as  well as sustainability.  I mean I think if also if you step back and you  look at GM, they pulled out of the Super Bowl this year, a very high- profile venue, $three million for a 30 second spot.  They have ended their  relationship with Tiger Woods which was a long time spokesperson.  So I  think they're trying to kind of be a little bit less flashy, a little bit  more demure and try to get aligned with the administration's priorities.</p><p> GLICK:  Michael, when you talk about the quality of this car or what it  might do to turn GM's business around, they are sort of staking their  future on it, who is going to buy this car?</p><p> DOUBA:  That's a very good question.  And I think that anyone can buy the  car if you have a place to plug in.  So there is a concern about the  infrastructure involved you have to plug the car in every night as you  would plug in your cell phone.  So it is kind of a new paradigm of what we  do with our car and how we use it.</p><p> But I think you know people who live in the suburbs who can drive enough  miles to displace all the fuel that the vehicle promises to displace can  buy the car.</p><p> GLICK:  And are you concerned at all Michael about the price point?  I mean  I know we're looking out a couple of years from now, but on the other hand,  you know, they are kind of staking their future on it, so it is kind of  important.</p><p> DUOBA:  Yes, I mean the price is -- it might be a little bit out of the  reach of the average buyer, but it's -- they're not going to make money --  GM's is not going to make money on this product, so it is matter of just  having enough, enough sales that they can show it's a strong product.</p><p> GLICK:  John, what do you think?</p><p> GRISMA:  I think that's the real key issue.  I think you have to look at  the infrastructure issues.  You're talking about a $30,000 car.  You're  talking about perhaps urban environments because it's got a 40 miles range.   How do you set up the infrastructure to basically plug in cars?  How do you  deal with that in New York?  How do you deal with that in Boston?</p><p> Now, I think that these technologies will follow this car and it is an  exciting thing but I think GM has to step back and think this isn't  necessarily the one single silver bullet.  They were successful in the past  with the Corvette but let's look at this in the long-term plans for what  they are going to do to roll out more sustainable vehicles.</p><p> GLICK:  The one thing that you mentioned earlier is you said humility and  sustainability.  I presume that the combination of those two things is what  they need to demonstrate to Congress later this week that they have both of  those things.</p><p> You mentioned pulling back from the Super Bowl and a couple other moves  that they've made but how do they bring about sustainability if they've now  come to the well and said we need an additional $6 billion this after just  testifying two weeks ago?</p><p> GRISMA:  Yes, I mean first of all you've seen them out of their corporate  jets and into their hybrids going to Capitol Hill.  But I also think it's  important to really look at how do they align with the administration's  priorities?  How do they align now with the Uber shareholders which is the  taxpayers right?  If GM is dealing with taxpayer money?</p><p> So I think in that context, what they have to do is prove their long-term  sustainability, their ability to actually get in line with where Americans  want to go, lessen their dependence on foreign oil and focus on really  marketing this car in the context of where GM and Ford and Chrysler where  are they're going in the future.</p><p> GLICK:  It's interesting because we're going to talk to one of the top  executives at Anheuser-Busch this morning and there used to be a concept  here called made in America and we used to be excited about that and  somehow we've got to turn this philosophy around because we're not very  excited about it right now when it concerns the automakers.</p><p> All right, John and Michael, thank you guys so much.  I appreciate it.</p><p> All right, coming up the newly formed Anheuser-Busch Inbev brought the  largest European and American brewers together.  After the break we're  going to have an exclusive interview with the president of the Anheuser- Busch division to talk about the transition.</p><p> And then for all you Victoria's Secret lovers out there, Victoria's Secret  angels are hitting the runway to revive sales this holiday season.  We're  going to have another exclusive interview with their CEO in just a little  bit.  You won't want to miss it.  I promise.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GLICK:  Newly formed Anheuser-Busch Inbev brought the largest European and  American brewers together.  Here to talk about the transition and the  future of the famous Anheuser-Busch Clydesdale Horses, Anheuser-Busch  President, David Peacock joins us now in a Fox Business Exclusive.</p><p> Good morning, great to see you.</p><p> DAVID PEACOCK, ANHEUSER-BUSCH PRESIDENT:  Good to see you again Alexis.</p><p> GLICK:  It is the first time that I'm talking to you live in person.</p><p> PEACOCK:  That's right.</p><p> GLICK:  Since the deal, walk me through, how has the transition been?</p><p> PEACOCK:  It's been good.  You know I tell you, we've been very impressed  with the people from Inbev.  And I think there's a lot of commonality on  how we approach the business and just how we work.  And I've got to say  it's been a very collaborative effort.</p><p> GLICK:  And I said to you when you walked in, I imagine that this has  required a lot of traveling, a lot of getting to know each other and also a  lot of calming people's fears because the transition, a change of this  magnitude is pretty big for one of the largest independent private  companies -- I mean public but owned by a family.</p><p> PEACOCK:  Right.</p><p> GLICK:  What has that been like addressing their concerns?</p><p> PEACOCK:  I think you just have to be honest with people and be up front  and just make sure they understand that the best interests of the  organization are always top of mind.  And that we are committed to treating  everybody with great respect.  And the organization, our performance has  been great so I give them the big thumbs up on the effort that they have  shown during all these uncertainty.</p><p> GLICK:  Anheuser-Busch obviously is an iconic brand and a lot of people  were concerned about the concept that an iconic brand going to a European  company.  How will the brand change or will we not see a lot of changes at  least here in the United States?</p><p> PEACOCK:  I think the things that work and the things that matter won't  change.  You know the heirs of our company will never change, the brand  Budweiser is such a part of our company.  And saw it when you came to see  us, we don't have Anheuser-Busch on the top of our building, we have  Budweiser.  And that's what people buy and that's what people believe in.   And that's what not going to change.</p><p> And the Clydesdales, the book you're holding, the Clydesdales aren't going  to change.  They are going to continue to graze in the pastures in mid- Missouri where their new farm is where we moved them a couple weeks ago.   And they are going to be continued to be housed on the campus.</p><p> GLICK:  We just showed a copy of this, and I have it in my hand it's called  \"The Great American Tradition.\"  As a matter of fact, when I went down to  St. Louis to visit you guys, I was there for the 75th anniversary of the  Clydesdales.</p><p> PEACOCK:  Right.</p><p> GLICK:  And what's the meaning behind this?  Tell people about this.  This  is part of the tradition of the company.</p><p> PEACOCK:  The story was back in when prohibition was repealed 1933, August  Busch Jr. wanted to show his father some respect and commemorate the  moment.  And they offered an eight horse hitch to deliver the first beer to  the governor Al Smith, I think governor or mayor of New York and then FDR  in Washington, D.C.</p><p> And they've just been a part of our heritage ever since then.  And they  represent strength, power, quality, beauty, all the great things that we  think are synonymous with America and are synonymous with our brand  Budweiser.</p><p> GLICK:  One of the things that's also synonymous with your brand is huge  advertising in the Super Bowl.  And you are going ahead with some huge  spots.  Tell me a little bit about that, and why you've continued along  with the investment because as you and I both know Inbev is known for cost- cutting.</p><p> PEACOCK:  Yes, but it is a knock they don't deserve.  I mean, if you look  at their third quarter, they actually had an increase in marketing and  selling up about 12 percent.  So they will invest behind brands.  We're  going to have actually nine commercials in the Super Bowl this year, and  about half of them will be dedicated to the Clydesdales.</p><p> And we've got some really nice spots on the horizon and one I think  especially that just wrapped up last week that I think could be the winner  hopefully.</p><p> GLICK:  Oh, I like that.</p><p> Now, one of the things you guys have done is you've always invested a lot  in sports, sports across the globe.</p><p> PEACOCK:  Right.</p><p> GLICK:  And had some huge partnerships with some of the biggest sports in  the industry.  Will you continue to have those partnerships?  Will you, you  know, readdress them?  You know, where does that stand?  </p><p> PEACOCK:  Sports is a big part of our DNA.  Last night we had an event  where we invited a lot of the New York media and sports community in for a  happy hour and told all those folks from ESPN and the different teams,  we're still there.  We are still a big part of what you do, and you are  still a big part of reaching our consumers in the proper way.</p><p> GLICK:  Let's talk a little bit about financials because the stock has been  very turbulent, and it's been a difficult economy.  One of the things I  said to you in the very beginning that I didn't realize about the deal and  I was pretty much in the know about this I didn't necessarily understand  that there was a six-month bridge loan that Inbev used which was part of  financing this deal.</p><p> PEACOCK:  Right.</p><p> GLICK:  They have now announced this they are going to go -- that they are  going to go out there through a rights offering and raise funds in the  marketplace.  It really hurt the stock.  First day it was announced, the  stock was down 13 percent.  Why are you doing this and what do you want  shareholders to know?</p><p> PEACOCK:  I think most important is the intrinsic value of the deal is  still there.  It is a tough market, but combining these two great companies  and the growth opportunities and the expansion of the brand Budweiser,  which is a big part of this globally still have merit.  And I think at the  end of the day, from what we have seen, if you've got a combination that  makes sense, and there's opportunity for growth, you're going to see the  financials fall into place.</p><p> So we're not too worried about what we have seen out in the marketplace.   It's like anything else, when you have a good idea and two companies should  come together, then I think at the end of the day the financial community  and the markets will respond positively.</p><p> GLICK:  Even though it is dilutive to shareholders right now because this  rights offerings is going to be in existence now for a two-week period,  over the long haul you think you will make up for it with growth and  opportunities?</p><p> PEACOCK:  Yes, the synergies we talked about are still there.  We still  have visibility to them.  All the reasons why it made sense for these  companies to come together are still there.</p><p> GLICK:  you and I have talked in the past about beverage sales here in the  United States.  And the numbers have been very small increases, low single  digit percentage gains, but that there are tremendous opportunities still  in emerging economies.  How much of those opportunities have changed  because we are now in a much more difficult global environment, or will you  still look to get more penetration?</p><p> PEACOCK:  Oh, definitely.  I think brand Budweiser has a lot of opportunity  in the emerging markets.  The beer industry so far in the U.S. has been  very good.  It probably will come in just under one percent growth which  for us is good, and it is very resilient in this kind of time.</p><p> Recessions are short-term.  This is a long-term deal.  We are going to be  in business a long time.  We have been in business a long time.  And I  think that's the long-term view we are going to continue to take.</p><p> GLICK:  One last question, China.  China has said you guys have a big stake  in a Chinese brewer as does Inbev.  They have capped the stake.  They have  said no more acquisitions of any other brewers in China, no percentage  stakes.  What does that mean to your business model, are you concerned  about that?</p><p> PEACOCK:  No, I think we have got a very good model in China, and we have  really created the premium segment with Budweiser years ago.  And recently  just this year we rolled out to over 100 markets where we hadn't sold  before.</p><p> What's interesting about China is you have constant geographic expansion  opportunities because it's just so vast.  And it is amazing to me still  when you can see a city in China that may be 20th in size and there's still  six million people, and you may not have even really penetrated that  market.  So we have a lot of growth opportunities there and in combining  the two companies that we've got now with some of the brands like Harbin  and some of the brands that Inbev has.</p><p> GLICK:  The book is \"The Great American Tradition: the 75th anniversary of  the Budweiser Clydesdales.\"  It is a good gift for the family.  I like it.</p><p> PEACOCK:  I was going to say I gave you a horse shoe the last time I saw  you.  This time you get you a book.  Boys around Clydesdales.</p><p> GLICK:  So this time I get a book.  I love that horse shoe.  David Peacock  as always so great seeing you.  Congratulations and best of luck happy  holidays.  </p><p> PEACOCK:  Thank you.  You too.  </p><p> GLICK:  We're going to take a quick break and we'll right back with much  more \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" including Victoria's Secret, the ladies on the  runway, you won't want to miss this coming up in just a moment.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> LEE:  Welcome back everyone to \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.\"  I am Jenna Lee and  here's this morning's top news stories.</p><p> We're going to begin with a look at President elect Barack Obama's up  coming cabinet.  Fox News confirming that Mr. Obama will name New Mexico  Governor Bill Richardson as his commerce secretary today.  You might  remember that just a few weeks ago the governor's name was also tossed out  for potentially the secretary of state position.  That didn't happen of  course.  But Richardson has a long history in Washington serving as energy  secretary under President Clinton.  He was also the U.S. Ambassador to the  United Nations.  </p><p> Secretary of state Condoleezza Rice arriving in New Delhi, India today one  of her last trips abroad as the top U.S. diplomat.  Rice is in India to  urge a fast response to the Mumbai attacks and to ease tensions between  India and neighboring Pakistan.  Rice also saying that officials in  Islamabad need to cooperate with India's request.</p><p> You are up-to-date on the Fox Business Network.  Much more ahead.  The  latest report on job cut activity.  And Victoria's Secret, can't beat that.   We will be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GLICK:  Welcome back to \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.\"  I'm Alexis Glick.</p><p> We are waiting for the Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas jobs report.  It is due  out in just about ten seconds.  We will also get the ADP private sector job  report.  That number comes out in just about 45 minutes.</p><p> Let's go upstairs to the Fox Business Desk to Connell McShane to see if we  can get the Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas numbers.  </p><p> MCSHANE:  Yes, we have them, Alexis, and the layoffs are going up.  No  surprise there.  Actually the highest since back in 2002.  Up 46 percent  from the same time a year ago.  </p><p> Layoff announcements for the month of November, according to Challenger,  Gray &amp; Christmas coming in at more than 181,000.  Want to be exact,  181,671.  That's the most number of layoffs, the highest number of layoffs  monthly since January of 2002.  We're up in the 250 range there.  </p><p> And it is up from the same time -- from a month ago by almost -- by more  than 60 percent, and from a year ago by 46 percent.  A couple of notable  factors here.  Number one, year to date this brings the number of layoffs  according to this particular metric above a million.  </p><p> It's a million and 57,000 give or take, it was 875,000, you added that on,  you're over a million now year-to-date in layoffs.  </p><p> What's leading the way?  Well, again, no surprise.  Financial and retail  sectors are really leading the way when we come to -- to job cuts there.   Year to date in the financial sector, you're talking about 220,000 plus  layoffs, 21 percent of the total so far this year.  </p><p> So the financial sector is really getting hit hard.  We have the Citigroup  plan that was announced in this month with the 50,000 employees being let  go.  </p><p> So a quick recap for you, Alexis, layoffs, according to the firm -- the  outplacement firm, Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, are going up, 46 percent  above the level they were at a year ago, above 181,000 and above a million  so far this year.  </p><p> It's back to you in the studios.  </p><p> GLICK:  All right.  Not the best of news.  Connell, thank you so much.  </p><p> Well, let's get the latest and break down the numbers on this jobs number  and ask our guests here to break it down and see what they think about it.  </p><p> Mark Lieberman is our FOX Business senior economist, FOX Business  contributor Charles Payne, and Leo Tilman is the former chief strategist  for Bear Stearns.  </p><p> Leo, I'll start with you.  I would assume no great surprise here, but the  trend is not our friend.  </p><p> LEO TILMAN, L.M. TILMAN PRESIDENT:  Absolutely, Alexis.  And I think the  employment numbers today are the most important ones of all because we're  still trying to ascertain to which extent this credit crisis continues to  hurt the economy and obviously it is, and it means that the bailout is not  working fast enough.  </p><p> GLICK:  Charles?  </p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Well, yes -- you know, listen, I  agree with that, and I also think this whole thing underscores the notion  that perhaps we need to give corporate America lower taxes, you know, much  lower tax rate.  </p><p> GLICK:  You're here.  </p><p> PAYNE:  I know that -- you know that President Obama is against that, and,  you know, the whole mandate was sticking to the corporations and the rich,  but you know what, at this point, you know, they're getting their just  desserts, you know, you can call it karma, whatever you want.  </p><p> The bottom line is when you see these types of numbers and at the end of  the day, if it takes jobs -- and I think Mark will agree with me -- it  takes jobs to turn this economy around.  One of the good things is to  incentivize corporations or even make it possible for them to do some  hiring in this environment.  </p><p> MARK LIEBERMAN, FOX BUSINESS SENIOR ECONOMIST:  Charles, I agree with you  in part.  Yes, we have to incent corporations to do something but just to  say across the board tax cut doesn't necessarily do it.  </p><p> GLICK:  Yes, no.  We got...</p><p> LIEBERMAN:  If you're talking ...</p><p> GLICK:  ... strings attached.  </p><p> LIEBERMAN:  If you're talking about job tax credits or something for job  creation, that's a better plan than just saying we've got to reduce  corporate tax rates.  Just to say that doesn't necessarily put more...</p><p> PAYNE:  No, you know what it is, though, Mark?  Put strings attached to it,  it's like...</p><p> LIEBERMAN:  It is not a question of putting strings.  It's a question of --  use a tax code to incentivize a particular type of behavior.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Like for instance, you'll -- we'll give you a tax break but the  jobs have to be in -- you know, in North Dakota.  </p><p> LIEBERMAN:  Something like that.  Yes.  </p><p> GLICK:  Yes, I mean, but you see, my concern, Charles, if is we -- like  Mark said, if we did -- we're totally getting off...</p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GLICK:  But let me -- I was just going to say...</p><p> PAYNE:  But it does circle back to jobs, though.  </p><p> GLICK:  Well, what -- to me, what I worry about, though, is if you give a  blanket cut without some kind of strings attached that we have the same  thing that we got with this TARP program, which is you're giving all this  money to these banks, there were zero strings attached and now they're not  doing anything to make lending any better.  </p><p> They are not necessarily doing anything to really increase or improve the  foreclosure situation and I think that's why, frankly, when Treasury  Secretary Paulson goes there next week and ask the other 350, I don't think  they're going to give it to him.  </p><p> But that's a whole other topic.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Yes.  </p><p> LIEBERMAN:  Yes, let's go back to these job numbers if we -- this  Challenger announcement and put it into context.  It is scary when you look  at a number like 181,000 and huge increases year to date and huge increases  year over year.  </p><p> This is the first time that full year announcements have topped a million  in -- since 2000 -- by November in 2003, but A, these are just  announcements.  They may not be followed through.  Employment is a lagging  indicator in any economic situation.  </p><p> GLICK:  Everybody says to me employment is a lagging indicator, but who on  this planet doesn't think that employment is going to get worse?  </p><p> LIEBERMAN:  It will get worse.  It will get worse because the economy is  continuing to deteriorate.  It's -- we saw the corporate profits report in  the last week when we got -- a couple weeks ago when we got GDP numbers.   That showed corporate profits declining and the response to that is to trim  expenses.  </p><p> GLICK:  OK.  Guys, I hate to do this, I'm sorry, but we're going to have to  wrap it up right now.  You guys are going to come back for the ADP.  </p><p> I'm sorry, Leo, I didn't get a chance to talk to you more about it just  because we have somebody standing by.  So we're going to come back to those  ADP, as I said, the private sector numbers, in just a moment.  </p><p> But President elect Barack Obama met with governors from across the country  yesterday in Philadelphia.  They were tackling state's growing financial  and economic problems.  Take a look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARACK OBAMA (D), PRESIDENT ELECT:  To solve this crisis and to ease the  burden on our states, we're going to need action and we're going to need  actions swiftly.  We intend to help save or create 2.5 million jobs.  We  intend to put tax cuts into the pockets of hard-pressed middle class  families in your states.  And we are not, as a nation, going to be able to  just keep on printing money.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GLICK:  Now the country's mayors are turning to the president elect for  help, too.  The U.S. conference of mayors has released a list of more than  4600 infrastructure projects that would add more than 261,000 jobs in 154  cities.  </p><p> Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter met with the president elect yesterday  and he joins us this morning.  </p><p> Good morning, Mayor.  </p><p> MAYOR MICHAEL NUTTER (D), PHILADELPHIA:  Good morning, Alexis.  How are  you?  </p><p> GLICK:  Great, good to see you.  </p><p> NUTTER:  Good.  </p><p> GLICK:  Well, you spoke yesterday...</p><p> NUTTER:  Always good to be with you.  </p><p> GLICK:  Well, thanks for being here.  You spoke yesterday, as I mentioned,  to President-elect Obama.  What was on the agenda?  </p><p> NUTTER:  Yes.  </p><p> GLICK:  What did you guys discuss?  </p><p> NUTTER:  We discussed three things after, again, congratulating him and he  thanked us for the great electoral victory here in Philadelphia, talked  about infrastructure, talked about mortgage foreclosure, and talked about  pension systems.  </p><p> All three key issues and certainly I'm very supportive of Mayor Manny Diaz,  our great president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the larger agenda  that was put out, but we need access to credit markets for borrowing  purposes, and that's all I wanted to talk with president-elect about.  </p><p> Our pension systems are all taking massive losses because of a third to a  half loss in the overall stock market.  Access to capital, to borrow for  infrastructure projects, which is a big topic of conversation between the  president-elect and the governors yesterday, and then the mortgage  foreclosure crisis.  </p><p> You mentioned in the earlier segment that the financial institutions and  the banks have been helped tremendously by treasury.  But they are doing  virtually nothing to help homeowners on the ground stay in their homes.   Banks don't want to own houses.  They want to service mortgages.  </p><p> We have a unique program, our Mortgage Foreclosure Reduction Program here  in Philadelphia.  We'd like to see that replicated across the country to  keep people in their homes and stabilize neighborhoods.  </p><p> So those were a few of the things that I talked to the president-elect  about yesterday.  It was a very good conversation.  </p><p> GLICK:  You know, I don't know about your mortgage foreclosure reduction  plan.  Can you tell me about it, Mayor, because a lot of people are talking  about...</p><p> NUTTER:  Sure.  </p><p> GLICK:  ... what FDIC chair Sheila Bair is doing particularly with Indymac,  but -- but how is your plan different?  </p><p> NUTTER:  Yes.  Our plan is different -- earlier this year through a  tremendously cooperative effort between our court system, our judges, the  legal community, as well as the banking industry, we first put a hold on --  a moratorium on mortgage foreclosures in Philadelphia for three to four  months, just stopped them dead cold, and then brought the homeowners, the  bankers, legal team together and the courts and the sheriff to create  reconciliation conferences so that we can sit down with these homeowners  and figure out how to restructure their payments so they can stay in their  home.  </p><p> We have saved hundreds of people from foreclosure and literally possibly  being thrown out on the streets, and it's -- the program has worked very  well.  We have a hotline, outreach workers, literally people out on the  street knocking on doors in targeted neighborhoods throughout Philadelphia  to get people to the help they need, did PSAs for this effort.  </p><p> It's worked very, very well.  And we've had a lot of support from some  local banks and a couple foundations.  But certainly the federal government  has a role to play.  This is a national program in the makings, and the  federal government really could step up and help us out.  </p><p> GLICK:  Well, that's pretty impressive.  I'm glad to hear more about  that...</p><p> NUTTER:  Thank you.  </p><p> GLICK:  ... because I think we need to...</p><p> NUTTER:  Yes.  </p><p> GLICK:  We need to be doing a lot more about it, obviously, on a state by  state basis.  </p><p> You know, Mayor, you -- we're all talking about everybody's fiscal house,  and the fiscal house in Pennsylvania...</p><p> NUTTER:  Yes.  </p><p> GLICK:  ... is feeling some heat, too.  You are right now...</p><p> NUTTER:  It's tough.  </p><p> GLICK:  ... facing a budget shortfall as you know better than I do, the  number I've heard reported is up to 2 billion by the middle of next year  and that you're facing $1 billion...</p><p> NUTTER:  For the state.  </p><p> GLICK:  For the state, for the state.  </p><p> NUTTER:  For the state.  I don't want to give my citizen...</p><p> GLICK:  Not for Philadelphia.  </p><p> NUTTER:  Yes.  </p><p> GLICK:  Well, when you say access to capital or access to credit...</p><p> NUTTER:  Yes.  </p><p> GLICK:  ... for some of these infrastructure, how do you address those  budget gaps?  I mean are you talking about the Federal Reserve Bank,  perhaps, stepping up and purchasing municipal funding?  </p><p> NUTTER:  Yes.  </p><p> GLICK:  I mean, walk me through what you would like to see happen.  </p><p> NUTTER:  There are a couple things.  A couple weeks ago I was down in -- I  was in Washington, delivered a letter to -- for Treasury Secretary Paulson  and specifically I talked to big and medium sized city mayors about this  issue.  </p><p> We'd like to borrow directly from the treasury for infrastructure projects  that are ready to go.  You can put a shovel in the ground in just a couple  of months and put people back to work, but we've not had great access to  the capital markets to borrow money from.  </p><p> So we'd like to borrow directly from treasury, repay at 50 basis points  over treasury so the Feds are actually going to make money off of this  deal, and allow us to get our crucial infrastructure projects under way,  bridges, roads, telecommunications lines, underground infrastructure as  well, put people to work quickly, but we need access to capital markets.  </p><p> Virtually, no one could borrow anything from anybody regardless of your  credit rating for months, and that has had a serious impact on cash flow as  well as the ability to put shovels in the ground, so that was a big topic  of conversation with the governors yesterday.  </p><p> GLICK:  OK, so -- so Mayor, because, you know, I know you have $180 million  in what was recently rated as triple B status paper for the...</p><p> NUTTER:  Yes.  </p><p> GLICK:  ... for the city of Philadelphia.  </p><p> NUTTER:  For the city, yes, just last week.  </p><p> GLICK:  In essence what you're suggesting that if you were to get some kind  of deal like that through treasury, 50 basis points above current rates.  </p><p> NUTTER:  Right.  </p><p> GLICK:  That that would save your funding costs, I mean, what do you expect  your funding rates to be going forward, and how big a difference will it  make?  And then -- and then, finally, one other thing, Mayor, that Governor  Tim Pawlenty talked to me about yesterday, he says, look, we've also got to  make some hard choices.  </p><p> NUTTER:  Yes.  </p><p> GLICK:  What hard choices are you willing to make to offset...</p><p> NUTTER:  Well...</p><p> GLICK:  ... access to capital?  </p><p> NUTTER:  Yes.  Well, we've made the hard choices already.  I made an  announcement, a pretty big announcement two days after the election, I'm  laying off upwards of 220 people, not filling 600 positions, closing 11  libraries, only reopening 12 of our 70 plus swimming pools, and so we've  cut back significantly.  </p><p> This is a very, very painful time between the layoffs and impact to some  very important programs.  I have never asked for a bailout.  We're not  asking for handouts.  Access to capital has been the big request by cities  all across America because we've been shut out of the credit markets, but  all these big city mayors -- you look at what Mayor Bloomberg has done in  New York, Mayor Daley in Chicago, Gavin Newsom in San Francisco, Shirley  Franklin in Atlanta, Phil Gordon in Phoenix.  </p><p> All of these mayors are making drastic cuts in programs and services, but  the federal government -- we need your help in accessing the capital  markets.  We're willing to take out loans, we will repay.  We're good  credits.  We're not going anywhere.  We don't go out of business.  And so  we're stable and secure, unlike, you know, some of the others who are  lining up.  </p><p> GLICK:  All right, well, Mayor Nutter, as always, fantastic pleasure  talking to you.  </p><p> NUTTER:  Thanks, Alexis.  </p><p> GLICK:  Best of luck in your endeavor.  </p><p> NUTTER:  Thank you.  </p><p> GLICK:  And you and I haven't talked since your Phillies won so I do need  to tell you congratulations.  </p><p> NUTTER:  Thank you, go Phillies.  </p><p> GLICK:  All right.  Did Governor Crist...</p><p> NUTTER:  It's been a wonderful time.  And we're going to -- we're going to  turn things around in all these cities across America.  President-elect  Obama understands these issues, talked with the governors yesterday, and I  know he is interested in talking to, to the mayors as well.  </p><p> GLICK:  All right.  Well, we certainly hope things turn around very soon.   Thank you so much, great pleasure seeing you.  </p><p> NUTTER:  They will.  Thank you.  You, too.  </p><p> GLICK:  All right.  Coming up Charles Payne is chasing after Chuck E.  Cheese.  He says the pizza stock is cooking.  Details just ahead.  </p><p> And later strutting for sales.  We're going to talk to the CEO of  Victoria's Secret when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST returns.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GLICK:  In his Wall Street strategy's hotline Charles Payne says he longs  for the days of the bologna sandwiches and when people were just in a  better mood all around.  So do I.  </p><p> He says seeing the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile on his way into work bring a  smile to his face and it reminds him that we just aren't happy as we used  to be.  </p><p> He says, \"I believe there is a feeling of self-loathing that has been  creeping into the psyche of America for a long time.  It seems like we find  it harder to be happy.  We find it harder to smile.\"  </p><p> Here he is, smiley himself, FOX Business contributor, Charles Payne.  Oh my  god, you know, I love bologna.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Do you?  </p><p> GLICK:  I hate to admit it.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Yes, fried, regular, any kind.  </p><p> GLICK:  Oh yes.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Yes.  </p><p> GLICK:  Yes, I do.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Have you seen the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile?  </p><p> GLICK:  Of course, and I -- I have the little keychain.  But they were here  with us, remember?  </p><p> PAYNE:  Yes, I loved it.  You know, it was created in 1936, the Depression,  and I went through a list last night of all the great things that were  simple and created during difficult economic times.  </p><p> GLICK:  OK, tell me what they are.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Pet rock.  Rock and Roll.  The lava land.  The CD player.  The list  goes on and on so we can be happy with very simple things in very depressed  times.  </p><p> GLICK:  You need to give me that list as if you report it.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Here's the list right there.  Look at that list right there.  </p><p> GLICK:  I want to look at this list.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Here it is.  </p><p> GLICK:  This needs to go -- I'm going to put this on my blog even though  you have your -- all your huge fan base.  </p><p> OK.  So, so yes, we need to smile a little bit.  We need to sort of, you  know, move past this, but let's talk about some picks.  </p><p> PAYNE:  OK.  </p><p> GLICK:  What are you looking at today?  </p><p> PAYNE:  The one that intrigues me the most this morning is a company called  Cyberonics.  And it's been around for a long time.  It gets a lot of hype.   They make an implantable device that controls nerve stimulation.  </p><p> Now the first -- the first approval was for epilepsy seizures but they  think they can use this thing to fight depression, to control hunger, a lot  of different things.  The stock has been acting great this week.  Piper  Jaffrey has had some positive comments recently.  I love this.  It's come  down a lot, I like the risk reward.  </p><p> GLICK:  OK.  What's next?  </p><p> PAYNE:  Chuck E. Cheese, which is the last time I mentioned it on the show  it came down a lot since then.  But I think it's oversold here.  I do  believe that, you know what, it's going to do pretty well in this sort of  economy.  </p><p> You can see where at one point -- if we even had a longer term chart, it  really was on a great tear.  I will say those September quarter they  missed.  However, I would wait for a breakout and buy the stock north to 17  1/2.  </p><p> GLICK:  And where are Chuck E. Cheeses?  </p><p> PAYNE:  There's not one next door.  </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> GLICK:  Yes, I heard the -- oh my goodness.  Did you guys -- you guys  scared for me, right?  I got a little scared myself because Charles...</p><p> PAYNE:  There's a lot of them out in Jersey, though.  </p><p> GLICK:  ... says that I don't walk around the neighborhood -- OK, what's  the last one?  </p><p> PAYNE:  Cree Research.  You know, it's interesting because I interviewed  the CEO of OSRAM SYLVANIA yesterday and he talked about light emitting  diodes.  </p><p> GLICK:  Yes.  </p><p> PAYNE:  I've always liked this place -- this space.  It's very sexy.  You  know the NASDAQ building, all those lights, those are light emitting  diodes.  Eventually we'll have them in our home so we'll replace every  single thing.  </p><p> This is a stock that's been in a rumor mill for a long time, bad  management, nevertheless, think -- I would buy it north of 16.  That's the  caveat.  </p><p> GLICK:  OK.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Traders look to get out at 19.  If you're willing to hold through  the gyrations a year from now it could be 24.  </p><p> GLICK:  All right.  Charles Payne.  </p><p> PAYNE:  All right.  </p><p> GLICK:  Very good.  </p><p> PAYNE:  All of these use a 15 percent stop loss.  </p><p> GLICK:  Stop loss on the down side.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Yes.  </p><p> GLICK:  Great point.  </p><p> PAYNE:  Yes. </p><p> GLICK:  All right.  Let's quickly go over to Ashley Webster in London, get  an update from him.  </p><p> Ashley, you should look at this list of the things that have been created  in difficult periods, Pacman, CD players, hula hoops.  </p><p> ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS OVERSEAS MARKETS EDITOR:  Yes, they're all  good.  </p><p> GLICK:  Ashley, you missed it.  Keep going.  </p><p> WEBSTER:  I missed it.  I'm going, I'm going.  All right.  Let's go to the  markets.  I still have the (INAUDIBLE) 3000 models away.  </p><p> OK, let's talk about the markets.  London down 0.5 percent.  France down 1  1/3 percent.  As we speak Germany down 1.5, despite the gains in Asia, we  are losing ground here in Europe so far.  </p><p> We're keeping an eye on the airline sector after the big merger talks were  revealed yesterday between British Airways and Qantas of Australia.  BA,  though, down 1 percent.  </p><p> The big story of the morning, though, in the European tech sector.  German  semiconductor company Infineon reporting its 7th straight quarterly loss.   That means that the company is saying today that it is continuing to  struggle.  Sales don't look good.  The loss for the fourth quarter -- oh by  the way $970 million dollars.  </p><p> Also very quickly Anglo Irish Bank in the banking sector reporting full  profit loss in the four-year profit loss of 33 percent.  Also says it's  putting aside $635 million for bad loans.  Ouch.  </p><p>Anglo Irish down 17 percent.  The only good news is that the dollar is  slightly higher today against both the euro and the British pound.  </p><p> All right time to take a break.  Coming up the Victoria's Secrets angels  will be strutting their stuff and sales tonight.  So what is the retail  outlook for Victoria's Secret?  We'll ask the CEO.  An exclusive interview  after the break.  </p><p> And yes, we have video, and I have seen it and Victoria doesn't have many  secrets left.  We will be right back.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GLICK:  Intimate apparel giant Victoria's Secret is one of the biggest  money makers for its parent company Limited Brands and the models are  strutting their stuff tonight on CBS to hit holiday sales.  </p><p> I sat down with the CEO of the company.  Take a look.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> SHAREN TURNEY, VICTORIA' SECRET CEO:  This year's show we shot at the  Fontainebleau which has a lot of history to it.  The Rat Pack used to hang  out there.  Elvis Presley would sing there.  So it's really about return to  glamour.  And that's what our assortments are for holiday.  </p><p> We all know we're in a little bit of a downturn in terms of our economy so  we're really trying to offer our customers this year a real credible  promise of value in all that we do.  </p><p> GLICK:  One of the things that we have seen for Victoria's Secret and the  parent company of Limited Brands is that it's been a difficult climate.  I  mean everybody has sort of been facing the new heat, the new environment,  and that we've heard reports that Black Friday wasn't quite up to  expectations.  </p><p> You tell me, what are your projections this holiday season and how are you  doing thus far if you were to give yourself a report card?  </p><p> TURNEY:  Well, I think we went into this fall and holiday season with a  very conservative plan.  We saw that the downside of the economy was  happening, not to the degree that it has happened.  We've been really  controlling inventories, our inventory -- put it down almost 17 percent.  </p><p> As we entered the fourth quarter really looking at our capex spending, and  we were investing our dollars and to make sure that we're investing into  the stores that are coming to the end of their lease line.  </p><p> What we've done is try to be prepared and that's what we're trying to do  for our customers as well.  And I think that we're meeting our expectations  as we talked about in our third quarter on our call is the fact that we  made more money than the year before, as well as our (INAUDIBLE) doors were  down about 9, our direct business was at double digits.  </p><p> GLICK:  One of the things, I'm glad you brought up direct business, because  that's something that you are very well known for and very famous in the  industry for is what you have created in direct business not only in your  past positions but here at Victoria's Secret.  </p><p> Why is that so crucial and how do you succeed even more in this kind of  environment on direct business?  </p><p> TURNEY:  Well, I think that today the consumer has many venues of which  they want to shop.  And they might want to go to a store, they might want  to use online to see what's happening, and then go into the store.  They  might have gone to the store and said, I wish I would have bought that, and  it gives them an opportunity to go online.  </p><p> And it's really not one way, but it's what is the preference of the  customer and being able to offer that to them no matter how they want to  shop.  </p><p> GLICK:  You know, it's interesting because a lot of people suggest that the  bricks and mortar model several years ago was going to die.  And now you're  hearing that commercial real estate and strip malls are feeling the pain  because people are not going into the malls to the degree that one would  hope or expect given what's happened with the economy.  </p><p> Will you look to downsize the amount of stores that you have as you look  into 2009 and direct more of that energy and attention toward the Internet?  </p><p> TURNEY:  I think you're going to see us do both.  We have some stores that  are coming up to their end -- end of their lease line, but we'll also in --  when we start building stores, there are only 4,000 square feet.  </p><p> Today we've added on the pink line.  We've extended the beauty assortments.   We have the new VSX sports line.  We're adding swim wear to our stores so a  5,000 square foot store for us today is really too small.  So where we can  get the real estate, you'll see bigger stores from us that house all of  these different opportunities for Victoria's Secret.  </p><p> GLICK:  I said to you in the very beginning, you know, I look at people  like Heidi Klum and some of the other faces of Victoria's Secret, and we  all sort of want to be that person but of course, you know, part of the  beauty is the imagination or dreaming up how we can look like that person,  but can we do that affordably?  </p><p> TURNEY:  Well, there is that $5 million diamond bra but also within the  assortments today you can buy a bra for $20 from Victoria's Secret.  You  can buy a bra for $32 to $42 to $68 to $120.  </p><p> So we really do have a breath of price range for women today to come in and  buy a bra from Victoria's Secret.  </p><p> GLICK:  One last question for you.  Limited Brands was recently downgraded.   The debt was downgraded technically to junk status.  A lot of businesses  have said that they're having a very difficult time either getting access  to the credit markets or raising funds in this kind of climate.  </p><p> How are you guys doing?  How concerned about that are you?  And what do you  project that will mean for you in your ability to continue to either grow  or evolve as a business?  </p><p> TURNEY:  You know, we are very fortunate that we have over a billion  dollars in cash in the bank.  We have over a billion and a half credit line  today.  We've never had to go out and get into that credit line.  We are a  high margin, fast-turning business, and I think with the right prudent and  conservativism going into 2009 I don't believe at all that Limited Brands  will have any issues.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> GLICK:  In fact she also told me that they plan to expand as many as four  stores in Canada.  They are looking at some other options.  They have a  thousand stores across the country.  </p><p> And if you're wondering about that runway show this evening, 500 hours  worth of fittings for the models to prepare for this evening's show.  </p><p> All right, well, my thanks again to the CEO, of course, of Victoria's  Secret for joining me yesterday.  </p><p> Coming up, we're going to continue our look at the bailout for automakers.   Senator Arlen Specter is going to join us live.  And the bailout could be  felt hundreds of miles away from Detroit.  </p><p> We're going to fill you in when the second hour of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST  returns.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> GLICK:  Good morning and welcome to hour number two of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.   I'm Alexis Glick.  </p><p> We're going to have the latest on the auto bailout coming up and Senator  Arlen Specter will join us to tell us what he is expecting of the  automakers.  </p><p> Also we'll get the latest numbers from the ADP jobs report.  That is due  out in 15 minutes.  This on the heels of a weaker than expected Challenger,  Gray &amp; Christmas numbers that came out just moments ago of a loss of  181,000 jobs in the month of November.  </p><p> Also coming up the CEO of Blockbuster Videos is going to join us as well.  </p><p> But first let's get a quick check of the futures as we stand right now.   We've been in negative territory throughout the morning, but right now we  are close back to the lows of the morning.  We're down 116 points.  We're  down 1.38 percent.  The S&amp;P is down 1.5 percent.  And NASDAQ is now down 2  1/4 percent.  </p><p> We've been jockeying all around this morning and after those employment  numbers this morning, we've moved lower.  </p><p> All right.  Congressional leaders are set to begin hearings Thursday on the  U.S. automakers' plan for survival and their request for as much as $34  billion in government loans.  For a look at what the plans say, here's Fox  Business Washington correspondent, Rich Edson, who's going to break down  all the details.  </p><p> Good morning, Rich.  </p><p> RICH EDSON, FBN CORRESPONDENT: And good morning, Alexis.</p><p> And all three automakers say they will make smaller, more fuel efficient  cars.  All three are willing to exchange warrants for government loans.  GM  says it will cut as many as 31,000 additional jobs.  Ford says it will at  least break even by 2011.  And Chrysler says it could start repaying the  government by 2012.  </p><p> The price tag for all of that and more is $34 billion worth of federal  loans.  GM wants $4 billion this month and up to $18 billion overall if the  economy gets worse.  Ford says it doesn't need the money now, but would  like a $9 billion line of credit.  Chrysler is asking for $7 billion.  And  Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson says the Bush administration supports  helping the automakers as long as the assistance comes from somewhere other  than the rescue package.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HENRY PAULSON, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: So we have been very much for -- we  need a solution that avoids bankruptcy, but it's got to be leading to a  viable industry.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EDSON: The administration still supports using $25 billion already set  aside to help the automakers reach fuel efficiency standards.  It is all up  to Democratic leadership.  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says no  decisions have been made yet, including whether the Senate or the House  will go first.  And none will be made, at least until the hearings, later  this week.</p><p> GM's COO Fritz Henderson is briefing lawmakers here this afternoon.  Reps  from the other two automakers will also work The Hill today.  The United  Auto Workers Union meets in the motor city today to perhaps discuss  concessions.  And GM's CEO Rick Wagoner says he and UAW President Ron  Gettlefinger agree that the union can be part of the solution, but not all  of it.</p><p>Alexis, back to you.  </p><p> GLICK: Yes, and, Rich, I imagine that the rhetoric is going to get tougher  and tougher, particularly given the fact that now -- particularly General  Motors is asking for an additional $6 billion.  Even Ford, who said they  may not need the $9 billion line, are talking about the need perhaps for an  additional $4 billion if the recession gets worse.  I mean, at what point  can we believe that enough is enough? </p><p> EDSON: Yes.  Well, that, and also look at the way that they're getting  here.  Now they're driving and giving up the corporate jets.  What you're  hearing in D.C. is, why didn't you come to us with this plan and this type  of approach the first time around?  We almost had to draw you in to doing  it the right way the second time.  </p><p> GLICK: Great point.  All right, Rich, we're going to leave it there.  Thank  you so much.  And I will check in with you in a little while.</p><p> Well, while much of the U.S. carmakers' bailout discussion focuses on the  impact the big three are having on Detroit, the auto industry's reach  extends far beyond Michigan's borders.  Take, for example, Chattanooga,  Tennessee.  Now despite the economic downturn, Volkswagen is putting $1  billion into a new plant in Chattanooga that will help create about 2,000  jobs.  For a look at how the possible bailout will affect the economy, both  in and out of Detroit, I'm joined by Trevor Hamilton.  He's the vice  president of economic development for the Chattanooga Chamber of Commerce,  and Republican Congressman Thaddeus McCotter of Michigan.  </p><p> Good  morning, gentlemen.  Thanks for being here.  </p><p> REP. THADDEUS MCCOTTER, (R) MICHIGAN: Thanks for having me.</p><p> TREVOR HAMILTON, CHATTANOOGA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE VP: Good morning, Alexis.</p><p> GLICK: All right, Trevor, let me start with you.  How has that Chattanooga  billion dollar project affected your local economy?  And why do you think  it is that Volkswagen has decided to invest in the U.S., particularly at a  time when we're all struggling? </p><p> HAMILTON: Well, for Chattanooga, this is really the culmination of a long- term vision for our community to recruit an automobile manufacturer to our  region.  Chattanooga has had a long history with manufacturing.  We believe  that manufacturing is still important to the economic base of this nation's  economy.  And so this is really a culmination of a long-term vision for our  community and our state here in Tennessee.  </p><p>Volkswagen carries less than a 3 percent market share in the United States  currently.  And their hope is that by the time this facility is operational  in 2011, that our economy will be again on the rebound and that they'll  have the right vehicle at the right price for the American consumer at that  time.  </p><p> GLICK: Congressman McCotter, I know that you understand more than anybody  how crucial this talk about a rescue plan is for the big three automakers.   You've had an opportunity to see the plans they put in place yesterday.   Did they make enough progress?</p><p> MCCOTTER: Well, I hope that they did.  It's going to be difficult because  much of what we've seen occur through the cost of restructuring to date in  flesh and blood we finally saw in black and white in a report issued to  Congress.  It's going to be a very tough haul.  It's going to be a tough  argument to make.  But I think members of Congress are going to realize  that the auto industry has been moving in the direction they wanted and  that there will be a viable plan for the future that protects taxpayers as  well because they're intrinsically, concomitivly (ph) mutually beneficial.  </p><p> GLICK: You know, congressman, we talk a lot about the big three and the  impact that it has on Detroit.  But here it is.  You and I both know, this  is a lot more than what's going on in Detroit or in the state of Michigan.   It's much grander than that.  Walk me through why some kind of plan is so  essential.  </p><p> MCCOTTER: I think it's important for the prosperity and the security of the  United States to have a domestic auto industry and a manufacturing  industry.  The auto industry is the heart of it.  If you look at what's  happening, especially in the foreclosure crisis, as Secretary Paulson has  admitted, if foreclosures continue to rise, you're going to have a very  difficult time stabilizing credit markets.  If people who are employed in  the auto industry now go into bankruptcy and are potentially losing  hundreds of thousands of their homes, they're going to exacerbate the  foreclosure crisis and our credit markets won't stabilize and we will  remain in the recession, if not find ourselves in a more dire position.</p><p> GLICK: Trevor, let me switch back to you.  Your state is the fifth largest  auto manufacturer in the country.  How much are you watching these bailout  hearings, or these rescue plan hearings, and how important do you think it  is to support the big three manufacturers? </p><p> HAMILTON: Well, here in Tennessee, as you say, we're the fifth largest auto  producing state in the country.  And over 160,000 Tennesseeans are employed  in that industry.  So we are watching the issue very closely.</p><p> And while it's difficult to say how it specifically will impact our  community, certainly our state is affected by the big three.  And we're  hopeful for a full economic recovery of the big three.</p><p> Here in Tennessee, we have a Saturn plant in the Nashville area.  And even  closer to Chattanooga, less than two hours from here, Ford recently  shuttered a plant in Atlanta.  And GM is slated to close their facility  there as well.  So I won't venture to guess what the solution is, but  certainly we hope for a full economic recovery of our domestic big three.  </p><p> GLICK: Congressman, one of the things that is on the table right now is a  discussion that's going on in Washington, D.C., and away from Washington,  D.C., and that is the concept of allowing some sort of government sort of  sponsored bailout plan where whereby the likes of GM and Chrysler do file  Chapter 11 bankruptcy but the government backstops any of the debt  thereafter, including the warranties.  How do you feel about that? </p><p> MCCOTTER: The auto companies and the UAW and everyone in the Michigan  delegation knows that bankruptcy is not an option.  What we want to see is  a bridge loan to the auto industry that can be repaid over time to the  taxpayers with the appropriate interest and, again, with the appropriate  taxpayer protection.  The ultimate one of which will be a viable plan for  the future.  We believe that those have been presented and we will be  making our case to our colleagues to approve one.  </p><p> GLICK: All right.  We're going to leave it there.  Congressman, thank you  very much.  And Trevor Hamilton, thank you both very much.  I'll be looking  forward to much more of this over the next couple of days.  Thank you,  gentlemen.  </p><p> And now let's send it over to Charles.  </p><p> CHARLES PAYNE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Alexis.  </p><p> Well, you know, banks have seen better days in recent months.  But an  unlikely company, Microsoft, is showing banks how to attract and keep new  customers.  And not just any new customers.  The company group known as  millennials goes between ages of 18 and 30.  Bill Hartnett, Microsoft's  U.S. industry solutions director of insurance, joins us to discuss the new  strategy.  </p><p> Bill, you just finished your survey on the banking preferences of this  coveted group.  Tell us what you found.  </p><p> BILL HARTNETT, MICROSOFT FINANCIAL SERVICES: You bet, Charles.  </p><p> What we found is a real crisis of confidence and trust that's going on  right now.  And the group that's most affected by this are the millennials.   There are 80 million people in that group.  It's a really an amazing group  of people and there's a land grab out there for what will be the next  generation of high net worth individuals.  And we think technology and the  use of technology is going to be the key to attracting them.  </p><p> PAYNE: Bill, how specifically can Microsoft take this sort of information  and help banks to understand this group of folks? </p><p> HARTNETT: Well, one of the things you can do with technology is really  change the experience people have of dealing with a financial institution.   And if you look at the preferences of that millennial group, most of them  use technology in very interesting ways.  And we like to say they've been  marinading in technology since birth, right?  They don't know a world  without the PC or the Internet.  So they use social networking sites like  FaceBook and MySpace.  They instant message all the time.  In fact, they  prefer instant messaging over e-mail.  They use wickies (ph) and blogs all  the time.  When I was growing up, we didn't know what those things were,  right?</p><p> PAYNE: Right.  </p><p> HARTNETT: So if you really want to attract that customer base, and you  really want to reach them in a way where they start to build a trust  relationship with you, using technology in a way they want to use it will  be very key.  </p><p> PAYNE: Now even since the Internet boom, we heard about online banking and  Internet banking.  And it seems like a lot of companies came around, they  fell apart.  Which banks are now positioned, do you think right now, to  take advantage of this? </p><p> HARTNETT: Well, I think it's the banks that don't think like banks,  frankly.  If you think like a bank or a banker . . .</p><p> PAYNE: Is there one that you can tell -- is there someone . . .</p><p> HARTNETT: There are many.  I can give you a great example of a small bank,  a regional bank out on the West Coast we've done a lot of work with.  Umqua  Bank (ph).  They have a CEO who is just an amazing guy who focuses on that  customer experience and the employee experience, frankly, how does he  attract employees into </p><p> (AUDIO GAP)</p><p> GLICK: The Fox 50 makes up some lost ground, gaining 28 points.  Its  biggest one day advance since November 24th.  Forty-eight of the 50  components were up.  The biggest percentage gainers were Sprint, CBS and  General Electric.  Today, some big tech stocks in the index are in the  news.  Here now with a closer look is Fox Business contributor Charles  Payne and Leo Tilman, president of L.M. Tilman and former chief strategist  for Bear Stearns.</p><p> Good morning, gentlemen.  Thanks for being back.</p><p> PAYNE: Good morning.</p><p> GLICK: Leo, let's start with you.  Google out today waving a cautious flag  about future investments.  Tell me about this.  </p><p> LEO TILMAN, L.M. TILMAN PRESIDENT: Not particularly surprising, right?  The  economy continues to deteriorate.  Consumers are in trouble.  The housing  continues to deteriorate.  So Google's not immune to these problems.  </p><p> PAYNE: Yes, well, you know, Alexis.</p><p> GLICK: Look at this stock price.  I mean, I need people to take a look at  this because look at how high this stock was.  This stock was about $730 at  the beginning of the year.  </p><p> PAYNE: Yes.</p><p> GLICK: It's $275, Charles.  </p><p> PAYNE: Yes, year over year it's down well over 50 percent.  And it's  absolutely mind boggling.  You know, Wall Street was -- Wall Street and  Google have always been somewhat at odds.  Google wanted to do it their way  from an unconventional IPO and since then and you always get the vision of  Google as being on one of those typical Silicon Valley -- they've got this  skate board ramping guys walking around, you know, brainstorming in the  conference room but no real obligations.  Wall Street never liked that.   They were always really upset with that aspect of the business.  You know,  it's one thing to be an intelligent company, but . . .</p><p> GLICK: But Wall Street loved the amount of cash that they had sitting on  the books.  And I would imagine what they didn't like was it looked like it  was excess.  And the day that a Google comes out and says, we're going to  lay off 10 percent of our workforce, then we begin to panic.</p><p> PAYNE: Well, yes.  Go ahead.</p><p> TILMAN: And I'm not sure if it's about Wall Street sort of causing this  sell-off.  I think it's an objective way that advertising revenues are  declining.  </p><p> GLICK: Yes.</p><p> TILMAN: Consumer spending is declining.  So I think it's more of the  fundamentals that are affecting Google rather than . . .</p><p> PAYNE: Right.  And another point too.  The run-up in that stock, every time  they announced that they were doing a new initiative, the stock would run  up as if they were going to be completely successful in everything they  touched, you know.  And investors gave them the benefit of the doubt and,  of course, they have not been successful in everything they've tried.  </p><p> GLICK: OK.  There's another big story today.  I like this.  This is juicy.   The former AOL CEO may actually -- Jonathan Miller -- he is apparently  talking to a group of private equity investors, some sovereign wealth  funds, about perhaps trying to make a bid for all or part of Yahoo!'s  business for the tune of perhaps $20 to $22 a share.  Leo, what do you make  of this? </p><p> TILMAN: Will, I think it's interesting on many different counts.  And I'm  sure Charles will pitch in.  But one of them is that there's a fair amount  of private equity in sovereign wealth funds available to step in and buy  attractive stocks.  And that's a duality.  Nobody is lending.  That's what  we keep hearing.  But at the same time, a lot of money is available  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> GLICK: You still think there is money on the sidelines? </p><p> TILMAN: Definitely.  </p><p> PAYNE: Well, there's money on the sidelines.  But you talk about a group of  people that have been burnt.  Sovereign wealth guys have been scorched.  </p><p> GLICK: I was going to say, they've lost so much.</p><p> PAYNE: Yes.  And also, a $40 billion deal right now.  I haven't seen any  sort -- listen, if he's going to get the money from TARP, he's got a better  shot, you know.  </p><p> GLICK: Yes.  This is -- oh, this is -- but it's a fascinating story.  </p><p> PAYNE: It is.</p><p> GLICK: All right, guys, we're going to leave it here.  You guys are going  to come back in just about 10 minutes.  We're going to talk more about some  important economic numbers coming out.  </p><p> PAYNE: OK.</p><p> GLICK: Well, the big three of Detroit, they have made their second bids for  a loan.  And now it has risen to $34 billion.  General Motors is looking  for up to $18 billion.  Chrysler wants 7.  And Ford is looking for $9  billion, although it says it may not need to use the funds.  For a glimpse  into how congressional leaders are reacting to these survival plans is  Republican Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.  </p><p> Senator, good morning.  Great to see you.  </p><p> SEN. ARLEN SPECTER, (D) PENNSYLVANIA: Good morning.  Nice to have a chance  to talk to you.  Thank you.  </p><p> GLICK: So, senator, I don't know, I'm a little skeptical here, I've got to  be honest with you.  I saw the proposals yesterday.  They finally did what  they needed to do.  They cleaned it up a little bit.  They brought a  proposal.  But they asked now for more money.  When is enough enough? </p><p> SPECTER: Well, there is good reason to be skeptical.  We know that the big  three, they haven't performed in the past.  They haven't kept up with the  times on fuel efficiency and cars that will sell.  But we're facing a  situation here where the consequences of their going under could be very,  very devastating for the entire economy.  </p><p> So the issue is, will their plans provide a realistic opportunity for  success?  And in our free enterprise system, we let the market determine  winners and losers.  But where you have a situation where there could be a  very serious impact on the entire economy, I think we ought to consider the  specifics as to what they've proposed.  </p><p> GLICK: Yes.  I mean my concern, senator, is, look, believe me, I'm worried  about the job losses, I'm worried about the industry and the implications  it could have for the greater economy.  What bothers me about the story is  it has not been clearly demonstrated to me what the sustainability is of  the industry.  And perhaps what we need to consider is, maybe it shouldn't  be the big three.  I mean maybe it should be the big seven or a  combination, you know.  I just haven't heard enough of a justification as  to how the industry is going to change.  We're built for 16 million cars.   We're selling 10 million cars.  And I imagine that number's not going to  get much better over the next couple of years.  </p><p> SPECTER: Well, you haven't heard enough justification.  And, frankly,  neither have I.  But I'm prepared to look.  That's my pedigree.  My job as  a senator is to take a look at the specifics as to what they have proposed.   I want to see where their efficiencies are.  I want to see the economists  and the experts in the field make an evaluation which is objective.  And  then I want to make the determination as to whether there's a realistic  chance that they can succeed.  Because if we can avoid having them go under  and having a lot of people lose their jobs and having the ripple effect go  through suppliers and automobile dealers across the economy, that's  something what we want to do.  But we're not going to do it blindly.  Only  if they make a solid case.  </p><p> GLICK: Great point.  A solid case.  </p><p> Now, let me ask you, there are two members who are going to be sitting on  the panel.  I know you had Peter Morici from the University of Maryland  sitting on the panel last time.  This time you're going to have comptroller  Mr. Gene Didarro (ph), who's a Moody's chief economist.  Tell me why you're  adding these two names to the panel and what you hope to get out of them in  addition to talking to the executives.  </p><p> SPECTER: Well, the economists have been added to the panel to get some  independent evaluation as to what the consequences would be.  Look here,  when you talk about what's going to happen in the future on the economy, it  is very, very hard to judge.  And we want to have the best experts we can  find to give us some insights.  And then there's examination and cross- examination.  </p><p> You must watch C-Span occasionally, as well as your own network, and you  see the way the senators probe and get more information.  And we'll be  doing that.  It's our judgment.  It's not their judgment.  We're elected to  make these judgments.  And that's why I convened a meeting yesterday in  Philadelphia, why my staff and I have been pouring over the details of the  semicolons (ph) so that when we go back to Washington on Monday, we're in a  position to make an informed judgment.  </p><p> GLICK: You know, you were speaking of Philadelphia, senator.  Tell me, how  do the people in Pennsylvania feel about the bailout of the auto industry? </p><p> SPECTER: Well, people in Pennsylvania haven't spoken about the bailout of  the auto industry.  But let me tell you how they felt about the $700  billion which we legislated all last October.  They didn't like it.  </p><p> I spent the month of October doing town meetings, which is my practice, to  touch all of Pennsylvania's 67 counties.  The temperature was 212.  They  wanted to know why the regulators hadn't done their job.  They wanted to  know what was going to be done with the $700 billion.  And I told them that  it was a very bitter decision that I faced and that the others faced  because of what we were informed would be the consequences.  </p><p> So the issue now to help the big three is something that I'm prepared to do  only if they really make, as I said before, the solid case.  I know that  the public opinion is against the bailouts, but sometimes, in my position,  you have to make decisions which may not be the most popular if that really  is my judgment or our collective judgment about what is in the public  interest.  </p><p> GLICK: You know, senator, I am so glad that you brought up the TARP program  because there are reports that Treasury Secretary Paulson may go as early  as next week to members of Congress to ask for the other $350 billion.  If  he stands in front of the Senate, what will you tell him if he asks for the  money?  </p><p>  SPECTER:  Well, the first thing I will ask him is what he has done  with the first $350 billion.  We have a problem which was created because  of the mortgage situation, defaults on mortgages, and the Treasury  Department has done precious little on that subject.  </p><p>  Then we took a look at the credit freeze, and there were a lot of  highly sophisticated fandangos that they were undertaking to try to put  money in the banks and nothing has happened there.  Before we're going to  consider giving him $350 billion more, he is going to have to have some  really good explanations as to what he has done with the first $350  billion.  </p><p>  And I've had a chance to meet with Treasury Secretary Paulson, and  very bluntly, I haven't been impressed with what he has had to say.  </p><p>  GLICK:  Finally, before I let you go, in Philadelphia yesterday, in  addition to the meetings that you said you had about the auto manufacturers  and the plans they laid out, President-elect Obama met with many current  governors and former governors about this proposed stimulus plan.  </p><p>  We are now hearing to the tune of $500 billion, maybe more, how do you  feel about it, and do you believe that infrastructure, rebuilding, job  creation are essential parts of a fiscal stimulus plan if in fact we have  the money to pay for it?  </p><p>  SPECTER:  There's no doubt that our highways and our bridges are  crumbling.  What I'm going to be looking for are parts of a stimulus plan  which are pro-growth.  For example, the stimulus package we passed last  summer, I had a proposal which had been pending for a long time to  authorize expensing or deductibility of 50 percent in the first year of  capital advances.  </p><p>  For example, if a steel company built a big hearth, they had it  depreciated 20 years, 5 percent a year, my legislation, which is put into  the plan, is able to take 50 percent in the first year.  And that's the  kind of a pro-growth proposal which sticks to the regs, which is more than  giving several hundred dollars to people to spend, which doesn't have any  lasting effect.  </p><p>  It may feel good for a short period of time.  So when we talk about  highways and bridges and items which will enable us to be pro-growth in the  future, those are the proposals which will draw my support.  </p><p>  GLICK:  All right.  Well, Senator Specter, great pleasure speaking  with you this morning.  Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with  us.  </p><p>  SPECTER:  Thank you.  I have enjoyed it.  </p><p>  GLICK:  All right.  Let's go upstairs to Connell McShane, because,  Connell, I know we saw those third-quarter productivity numbers just came  out.  And a little bit more analysis on those ADP numbers as well.  </p><p>  CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Yes, we see the productivity at  the bottom of your screen has actually been revised higher in the third  quarter which is a surprise.  The expectation was it would be revised  lower.  So 1.3 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter compared to  the prior quarter.  That is an upward revision compared to the first  number.  And it was expected to be downward.  </p><p>  So that is a bit of a surprise to the market.  The futures have  actually come off their lows, for what it is worth, they're down 142, and  the Dow futures have been about 20 points more than that there a moment  ago.  </p><p>  So that's the economic data this morning that has just been released.   There are your futures.  We are going to give you, as we go to break here,  two quick stocks to watch in the day ahead, Goldman Sachs and Morgan  Stanley.  Merrill Lynch has just come out and significantly cut its fourth- quarter earnings estimates or lack thereof for both Goldman and Morgan.</p><p>  Instead of a profit, they are expecting losses of both of these firms.   And they've -- the downward revision could affect both of those stocks.   Keep an eye on them today.  Our panel is going to weigh in on all of the  economic numbers, and a FOX Business exclusive, the CEO of Blockbuster  coming up, explaining how they are competing in a crowded market.  So don't  go away. \"Money for Breakfast\" continues here in just a moment.  </p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>  GLICK:  All right.  As Connell just mentioned, the productivity  numbers, the revision to the third quarter just came out.  In addition we  saw the second announcement of jobs reports this morning coming out of ADP  on private sectors, a decline of 250,000.  That did exceed estimates.  And  Q3 productivity was slightly better than anticipated, coming in at 1.3  percent.  </p><p>  This on the heels of a Challenger Gray &amp; Christmas jobs number that  came out earlier this morning that showed a job loss of 181,000 in the  month of November.  To break down all three of those numbers, Leo Tilman is  the former chief strategist for Bear Stearns; Mark Lieberman is our FOX  Business senior economist; and our FOX Business contributor Charles Payne  is here.  </p><p>  All right, guys.  Mark, you got an opportunity to look at the Q3  productivity number.  I know unit labor costs is something you are  concerned about.  What did you find and how does it look?  </p><p>  MARK LIEBERMAN, FOX BUSINESS SR. ECONOMIST:  Unit labor costs went up  3.1 percent in the final report...  </p><p>  GLICK:  What does that mean?  </p><p>  LIEBERMAN:  It means it is actually the cost of producing each  specific item.  It is an index that tracks that.  It tells us something  about where inflation is going and this is obviously tracking what we have  seen in other inflation indicators.  </p><p>  Similarly, as we look at the overall productivity number, a strong  productivity gain is probably more important in a good economy because it  keeps prices down and it keeps a standard of living up.  </p><p>  What's happening now is, and it's tracking what we see in the rest of  the economy, output is down, we see that from GDP, but employment and jobs  are down further.  So when you do simple arithmetic...</p><p>  GLICK:  Workers are becoming more productive.  </p><p>  LIEBERMAN:  Exactly.  </p><p>  GLICK:  Charles, what do you make of these numbers?  Also the ADP  number -- which let's keep in mind, the ADP number saw a loss of 250,000  jobs, there's usually not the best of correlations between the private  sector number and the non-farm payrolls that we see from the Bureau of  Labor Statistics on Friday.  But we've been looking for a loss of 300,000.  </p><p>  I wonder whether or not those estimates are going to go higher since  the private sector number was so depressing.  </p><p>  CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR:  Absolutely.  And to that  point, ADP numbers always seem to be a lot rosier, if you will, than the  Bureau of Labor statistics.  So for them to come out with 250,000, you have  got to be nervous.  </p><p>  I mean, if you weren't nervous already, to be quite frank, you are  right now.  As far as productivity, Alexis, I mean, this is something that  was really more important in a different sort of economy where the Fed  didn't know if it wanted to lower rates or raise rates and they needed  cover.  You know, I know Greenspan was able to use that productivity boom  to keep rates low, much to everyone's chagrin...</p><p>  (CROSSTALK)   </p><p>  GLICK:  Yes, but what we really care about is jobs today.  </p><p>  PAYNE:  At this point, yes.  It doesn't seem like it matters.  </p><p>  GLICK:  So, Leo, you have two pieces of data that came out this  morning, both worse than anticipated, what do you now think the non-farm  payrolls numbers is going to look like on Friday?  </p><p>  LEO TILMAN, FMR. CHIEF STRATEGIST, BEAR STEARNS:  I think it is going  to be weak.  And all indications point to that.  And to that point I think  the inflation story is less important today.  It is interesting that early  in the year we were all concerned about systemic inflation pressures.  Then  we went into deflation worries.  And now I think it's just not an issue for  any foreseeable future.  </p><p>  It is conceivable that down the road the stimuli, the monetary policy  are going to reignite inflation, but it is not in any foreseeable future.  </p><p>  GLICK:  Mark?  </p><p>  LIEBERMAN:  I think that's right.  I mean, you know, deflation became  more and more of a concern.  And when you think about it, I mean, what can  the Fed do if we were in an inflationary environment?  Well, the Fed can  raise interest rates.  One of the ways you would combat deflation is to  reduce interest rates.  Well, there's a floor on how far you can go down on  deflation.  </p><p>  GLICK:  But if deflation becomes, as some suspect it might, a really  big problem, let's just say for the sake of argument over the next six  months, I know everybody is talking about inflation longer term being the  bigger issue because we're -- the printing presses have not shut down since  we arrived on television a year ago, but what if deflation becomes a real  issue?  How do we address it knowing that real interest rates are actually  negative?  </p><p>  LIEBERMAN:  A couple of things are going to work on this.  Number one,  as income improves, as the economy does recover, and this may shock some of  the people who I work with regularly, it will recover.  The...</p><p>  GLICK:  Oh, so that was the rose-colored glasses, the question,  Mark...</p><p>  (CROSSTALK) </p><p>  GLICK:  ... which we get like once every three months.</p><p>  PAYNE:  He has a rose-colored monocle somewhere.</p><p>  LIEBERMAN:  Exactly.  No, the economy clearly will recover.  It's  going to take some time.  And what's going to happen at the recovery, there  will be pent up demand, and demand is the furor (ph) for deflation.  You  have to do whatever you can to pump up demand.  </p><p>  We have to put people back to work.  We talk about that ad nauseam.   Although it's obviously...</p><p>  GLICK:  Investments, all that kind of stuff.</p><p>  LIEBERMAN:  ... investments and things like that.  And people -- you  know, there's going to be -- if you deprive yourself of that big screen TV,  at some point you are going to want to buy it, even though it's not made  here.  </p><p>  TILMAN:  On that note, bringing down long-term rates is going to play  to that as well.  So all the purchases of Treasury securities and agency  securities by the Fed are an additional stimulus that should...</p><p>  (CROSSTALK) </p><p>  GLICK:  ... mortgage applications explode.  And I understand you say  it is only applications, it is not necessarily full refinance activity.   But, look, Charles and I have been talking about it, I'm like -- the minute  I started seeing rates come down, I'm like, let's get on it.  And I think a  lot of people across this country are.  So hopefully that's one good piece  of...  </p><p>  (CROSSTALK) </p><p>  LIEBERMAN:  Let's think about that for a second, because what that is  saying is that homeowners who are refi-ing -- it is not purchases, it is  homeowners who are refi-ing, if they are doing that, why are they doing it?   They desperately need cash.  </p><p>  GLICK:  Yes.  I'd like a little extra cash.  Hey, it is a good thing.  </p><p>  (CROSSTALK) </p><p>  PAYNE:  Since the National Bureau of Economic Research gave this time  stamp to the recession, we have got to give Mark props.  Because Mark did  call this.  </p><p>  GLICK:  Yes, he did say fourth quarter last year.</p><p>  LIEBERMAN:  Thank you.  </p><p>  GLICK:  You did call it, yes.</p><p>  (APPLAUSE) </p><p>  (CROSSTALK) </p><p>  GLICK:  Yes, there he is.  We love Mark Lieberman, even when he's  depressed, we always try to cheer him up though.  </p><p>  LIEBERMAN:  For depression you take a pill.  Otherwise for  recession...</p><p>  (CROSSTALK) </p><p>  GLICK:  A pill.  A cocktail.  I was thinking these should be Bloody  Mary conversations from now on.  What do you think?  I mean, we could  propose that.  </p><p>  LIEBERMAN:  Mimosas, whatever.  </p><p>  GLICK:  Yes.  See, look, there he is, mimosas.  All right, guys, thank  you very much.  And I do want to mention by the way that Leo Tilman has a  book, and I haven't even mentioned it, it's \"Financial Darwinism.\" This is  a very brilliant guy.  So you want to pick that up.  All right, guys.  </p><p>  Coming up, we're going to talk to Blockbuster video because they are  making some huge changes.  The CEO of the movie rental chain is going to be  with us in a FOX Business exclusive when we return.  They've got some very  exciting things up their sleeves that I'm not sure you have heard about.   We will talk about that coming up next.  </p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>  GLICK:  Blockbuster the leading brand for video rentals has seen its  original business model attacked by technology, but now it's hitting the  fast forward button to reinvent itself.  The company is teaming up with  Microsoft to develop new digital services that will let you watch movies on  your phone.  And it has entered into a partnership with Live Nation to sell  concert tickets.  This morning we welcome James Keyes, he's the chairman  and CEO of Blockbuster.  </p><p>  Good to see you. </p><p>  JAMES KEYES, CHMN. &amp; CEO, BLOCKBUSTER:  Great to be here, thanks.  </p><p>  GLICK:  So you are doing a lot of inventive things because there's  always this tug-of-war between Netflix and Blockbuster, each trying to move  one step ahead of each other.  Tell me about some of these -- this new  technological road map, particularly as it relates to cell phones or mobile  devices.  </p><p>  KEYES:  Well, mobile devices, eventually portability is going to be  king.  We all like the convenience of being able to watch content when we  want, where we want.  And that really is the legacy of Blockbuster.   Blockbuster was never really about video rentals.  It was always about  convenient access to media entertainment.  </p><p>  So the key is for us to transcend all of the various channels to keep  up with technology and to provide our customers with the most convenient  access wherever it is, even on your mobile phone.  </p><p>  GLICK:  So I understand you are working on a deal here with Microsoft  in terms of how to get the technology and the software so that we can get  it on our mobile devices, and one of the things you are doing right now is  testing it on kiosks and the ability for us perhaps to travel in an airport  and upload it at some point in the future.  Where is that going?  </p><p>  KEYES:  Well, the key with the digital technology is that it's a  wonderful thing.  It allows so much flexibility with content, and yet, it  seems that everyone is trying to get content on their big screen TV.   Bandwidth in the United States is going to take some time to catch up to  this demand because the file size for movies is actually very large.  </p><p>  So in the interim, in the next five years or 10 years, there are many  other ways to deliver digital content.  We are trying out some kiosks in  stores, for example, so instead of taking an hour, hour-and-a-half to load  a movie, you can load it in 30 seconds or 60 seconds right directly onto a  portable device and have the convenience and flexibility of digital content  in a portable fashion.  </p><p>  GLICK:  You know, there are a lot of people who look at the video game  industry, as I said to you yesterday, I spoke to an executive at Xbox, and  I know they have a relationship with Netflix, but they look at that  industry as a place which is experiencing unusual growth in a very  difficult economy, and they are experiencing it year-over-year.  </p><p>  What kind of things are you trying to do perhaps to maybe address that  audience, that demo which is a tremendous demo by doing partnerships like  what Netflix and Xbox are doing together?  </p><p>  KEYES:  We are -- again, it is very early, the idea of digital content  directly to the home through game consoles or set-top boxes, very, very  early in its development.  Yes, we just released just a week ago a deal  with a company called 2Wire, that's a large provider of these boxes and  this technology to deliver content directly to the television, so now you  can get Blockbuster on demand.  </p><p>  We have several thousand movies, new releases available from the ease  of pulling up video-on-demand from your couch.  And this is just another  step.  Again, very early.</p><p>  GLICK:  So who will sell those boxes?  I mean, if 2Wire is a company  that makes them, like, would I be able to get them on my set-top cable box?   I mean, where will I see that come to me, the consumer?  </p><p>  KEYES:  Today you can actually buy Blockbuster on demand online at  blockbuster.com.  We are selling it in a few stores just trying to test the  consumer demand.  That's really our objective right now.  It is very early  in the developmental stage.  </p><p>  But eventually you will find that this capability is baked not only  into your cable box, but directly into your television set.  In fact, we  announced a deal with Intel not too long ago where their new chip for their  Internet-ready television set in the next couple of years will include a  widget that allows you to pull up the Blockbuster icon right there on your  television set and have immediate access to all of your favorite movies.  </p><p>  GLICK:  OK.  So let's just take that example and let's just assume  that for the sake of argument you live here in a place like New York City,  you have Time Warner Cable.  So I have Time Warner Cable and I have now  just purchased this Internet television.  Time Warner offers pay-per-view  events, on demand events, how is it that I'm going to go to you as opposed  to going to my cable operator who has been wired into my home?  </p><p>  KEYES:  Well, today Blockbuster really owns that entertainment  customer, particularly the customer for movies.  And so our job is to make  it a nice smooth transition for that customer to move over to these other  services.  And that's why we're leading now with Blockbuster on demand.  </p><p>  Eventually the cable companies will want to offer their customers  various services.  We will all have unique content.  We will all have  proprietary and exclusive content, and that will keep Blockbuster, the  brand, relevant for the consumer.  </p><p>  GLICK:  You know, one of the things I said yesterday to this executive  at Xbox is I said, listen, you know, when we're on that console and they  show the list of Netflix movies, they tend to be outdated, frankly.   They're not the kind of movies, I'm sorry to say, that I want to see in  today's world.  </p><p>  How do you make sure that you are delivering the newest, most credible  content on any device right now so that it makes me want to do it?  And if  iPhone is doing something similar, why would I go with one of the devices  that you have in a relationship with Microsoft as opposed to everybody  carrying around that iPhone or that iPod?  </p><p>  KEYES:  Well, first of all, you won't have that problem with  Blockbuster.  People have come to know and trust Blockbuster for the newest  releases, the latest releases.  Our Blockbuster on demand will have new  releases.  It is very different from the Netflix offering, as an example,  which is a unique product, a very good product, but it is a subscription  product.</p><p>  And by nature, subscription content delivered digitally will be a  little bit older content.  It will be more in the pay TV window or two or  three years older on average than the new releases that you can find  available on Blockbuster.  </p><p>  So this is an opportunity for us.  And as we go forward, our key  competitive advantage will be to make it easy, convenient for the customer,  and to have the best content available, the newest releases, exclusive  content only available at Blockbuster.  </p><p>  GLICK:  All right.  James Keyes, sounds terrific.  Come back, join us  again, particularly as you put some of these plans in place.  I want to see  some of these devices and learn a little bit more about it.  </p><p>  KEYES:  Well, thanks, great to be here.  </p><p>  GLICK:  Great to have you.  </p><p>  All right, guys.  We will be right back in just a moment with the \"1  Thing You Should Know.\"  Unfortunately, the one thing you should know right  now is the market is pretty much at the low of the day.  We are down 140 --  156 points right now.  The S&amp;P down 2 percent, the Nasdaq down 2.25  percent.  Some of this of course on the heels of those jobs numbers this  morning.  We will be right back.  </p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>  GLICK:  All right.  Now it is time for the \"1 Thing You Should Know.   We get started with Ashley Webster in London.  </p><p>  ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, you know what,  Alexis?  I was looking at all this miserable news that's coming about in  the U.K. and the Eurozone, I thought, well, I will do this story.  It's  kind of interesting.  </p><p>  But there is quite a lot of snow around the U.K. and there's some  blizzards forecast for tonight in the northern part of the country.  So  that means the odds of it snowing in London on Christmas Day now down to 11  to 4.  It was 7 to 1.  </p><p>  You know, we bet on anything in the U.K.  The odds are now down that a  snow flake will fall on the London weather center on Christmas Day is now  down to 11 to 4.  I may take that bet.  </p><p>  GLICK:  Wow, yes.  Wouldn't it be great to have a white Christmas?  We  don't have enough white Christmases, at least here in New York.  I'm sure  for you in California it rarely ever happens.  When you were growing up,  did they do -- like I heard some families would bring in like the fake  snow?  </p><p>  JENNA LEE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR:  Oh, they do that, yes, absolutely.   They will have like places that the kids can sled, but it will be sunny.   So it never really felt like Christmas.  It was always sunny.  </p><p>  GLICK:  Yes, but now you are here.  </p><p>  LEE:  Now I can freeze and feel...  </p><p>  (CROSSTALK) </p><p>  GLICK:  OK.  So what's your \"1 Thing\"?  </p><p>  LEE:  You know, we (INAUDIBLE) talk so much about mortgage  applications and refinances being way up.  And I think that after the  program that was announced last week, that can't be a bad sign.  And we  have to take it in relative terms from the weeks before, but it can't be a  bad thing.  </p><p>  GLICK:  Yes, I like that.  I actually think it is a good sign.  I  understand Lieberman is like, Alexis, it is only applications, but you know  what?  The fact that we can make homeownership more affordable or that  we'll go out and refinance, personally I'm hoping to take advantage of it.  </p><p>  PAYNE:  I think it is fantastic.  My \"1 Thing\" though is, by the way,  I think automakers, the CEOs should go on horseback to Capitol Hill.  </p><p>  GLICK:  Maybe they should do the Clydesdales.  </p><p>  PAYNE:  They should ride horses because, you know what, you bring back  the thought of Paul Revere and how important it is for America.  And also  you suggest to America, you don't bail us out, everybody is going to be  riding one of these.  </p><p>  GLICK:  Yes, that's a great point.  What about that \"made in America.\"  You know, we need to like be excited about \"made in America\" again.  We  need to work on them.  Give them some tips.  </p><p>  All right, guys.  We are going to go to commercial break.  We are  going to come back.  We are going to have \"The Opening Bell\" coming up  next.  We are going to talk to a top executive in the power and energy  world who can talk to us a little bit about all of this electricity grid,  infrastructure building, some of the things that we have been talking about  in terms of fiscal stimulus.  </p><p>  Stay with us.  \"The Opening Bell\" is next.  Thanks, guys.  </p><p>  (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2008 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

But will Detroit automakers blueprints for survival convince Congress to give them a bailout?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And a Fox Business Exclusive, Anheuser-Busch President David Peacock with the latest on the Inbev buyout and what the future may hold for the company's marketing icon ,the Clydesdales.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And then we'll hit the catwalk for Victoria's Secret annual fashion show, in another Fox Business Exclusive, an interview with Victoria's Secret's CEO.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today is Wednesday, December 3rd, 2008. \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" starts right now.</p><p>Good morning and welcome to \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.\" I'm Alexis Glick.</p><p>We have the very latest on the auto bailout coming up and Senator Arlen Specter will join us a little bit later.</p><p>Also the latest challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas numbers and the ADP private sector numbers will all be coming out this morning.</p><p>But first a quick look on how the futures are stacking up here in the U.S.</p><p>This after a nice rally yesterday while most of the major markets were up anywhere from three to four percent, lifting up about I guess a third to half of the losses that we saw on Monday.</p><p>But this morning we have reversed trend. We are now looking lower, down 1.3 percent or down 115 points on the DOW we're staying at about 8,320. The S&amp;P is down 13 or 1.7 percent. The NASDAQ is down 17 or down about one and a half percent as we speak.</p><p>All right, let's get things started with the three things you should know this morning.</p><p>After saying he was not going to touch the remaining TARP funds, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson is according to the \"Wall Street Journal\" debating whether to ask Congress for the second half of those funds.</p><p>The Journal says he may ask for it as early as next week.</p><p>And one month after Election Day, incumbent Republican Senator Saxby Chambliss is claiming victory against Democrat Jim Martin in a runoff election in Georgia after neither received at least 50 percent of the votes as mandated by state law.</p><p>Meanwhile, Minnesota says they are into day nine of the recount between Republican incumbent Senator Norm Coleman and comic Al Franken.</p><p>And Super Bowl hero Plaxico Burress is done for the year and maybe for good with the New York Giants who fined and suspended him yesterday after he accidentally shot himself in the leg last weekend at a Manhattan nightclub. He now faces a minimum two-year jail term under New York law.</p><p>All right, those are the three things you should know about this morning.</p><p>Now for the three things you need to know about in the overseas markets, here's Mr. Ashley Webster in London.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FBN OVERSEAS MARKETS WRITER: Hey, good morning, Alexis and good morning, everybody.</p><p>Well, we saw some nice gains in Asia, but not so, so far in Europe. Let's take a look at the latest numbers. Here in London on the FTSE 100, down about half a percent at this hour. Although this is off of our lows. In Paris the CAC-40 off one and a half. And in Germany the DAX 30 index also off close to two percent now.</p><p>Talking of Germany, shares in a big German semiconductor company are short circuiting this morning; Infineon, reporting its seventh straight quarterly loss. The company says the fourth quarter loss came in at a whopping $970 million more than expected. The company blaming weakness in the sector, restructuring costs and write-downs associated with its stake in chipmaker Qimonda, Infineon's stock now down 25 percent.</p><p>Sacre bleu, Warren Buffett is facing a fight now with a French utility. Electricity de France is making a $4.5 billion bid for 50 percent of Constellation Energy's nuclear assets now Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway already made a $4.7 billion bid for this company for all of the company; it is a U.S. power company. Shareholders will vote on Buffett's offer later this month. But EBS says it undervalues Constellations true worth, it is a battle royale no doubt.</p><p>Let's go to Connell McShane for today's three market movers. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning Ashley.</p><p>The Blackberry maker Research in Motion making a list this morning cutting its third quarter forecast. The company saying earnings per share are going to come in somewhere between 81 and 83 cents. The problem with that is that Wall Street is looking for 91 cents. So RIM saying a stronger dollar as well as the general economic slowdown have hurt its business and had hurt its stock plunging more than 67 percent so far this year.</p><p>Google is bracing for very difficult times. The Internet search engine giant is cutting back spending and cutting back on projects; a lot of the perks that go into being an employee at Google are apparently going by the wayside. So we'll keep an eye on Google stock down from the 700s into the 275 range on that stock here over the last year or so.</p><p>Now, we do have some breaking news this morning that we want to bring to you on mortgage applications. We don't always give you this number as it comes out but it is just being released now and what a gain in mortgage applications as mortgage rates come down.</p><p>In fact, according to the Mortgage Banker's Association, this is the biggest gain they have ever seen, in record. It is just in this morning. An increase has been reported in refinancing activity; that is a very, very big increase. Overall we're talking about re-fi's being up percentage terms at least by 200 percent here over the same -- over the last week and the overall market index increasing 112 percent according to the MBA which is just out with these numbers.</p><p>Again, it's their largest rise on record Alexis, the mortgage applications with the drop we've seen in mortgage rates apparently more people going out and refinancing their mortgages and getting new mortgages all together. So that's an interesting stat that's just in.</p><p>Those are the three market movers and it's back over to you in the studio.</p><p>GLICK: All right, I love that stat. I'm trying to refinance my mortgage too, Connell, just not getting the phone call back.</p><p>MCSHANE: Get in there.</p><p>GLICK: But we'll talk about that later.</p><p>All right, Detroit's big three automakers presented recovery plans to Congress late yesterday, and the pitch has become more dramatic as General Motors and Chrysler now say they are on the verge of a collapse by month's end unless they get the money from the government they need right now.</p><p>For more on what the plans say, Fox Business's Rich Edson joins us this morning from Washington, D.C. with more of the details. Good morning Rich.</p><p>RICH EDSON, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hi good morning, Alexis. When these guys were up on Capitol Hill a couple of weeks ago and they were asking for $25 billion, it wasn't all that convincing that $25 billion was all that they needed especially when Congressmen were asking them to basically add up and individually separate how much they would need out of that $25 billion.</p><p>Two car companies went first and when the third went, they really couldn't answer to bring to that $25 billion number. Eventually they got there. And then they said ok we do need only 25 billion. But today that number has been just blown out of the water; $34 billion is potentially what these guys say they are going to need over the next year from the federal government.</p><p>The biggest coming from GM, $18 billion they say they are going to need at least $12 billion to operate next year, $4 billion immediately of that $12 billion, and if the economy gets worse, they say they are going to need an extra $6 billion. That goes to $18 billion for next year.</p><p>Ford is asking for $9 billion. Though it says it does not need it right away, it would like a $9 billion line of credit from the government.</p><p>And Chrysler is saying that it wants $7 billion in loans from the federal government.</p><p>So the proposals are in. They are on Capitol Hill. And one analyst said it's time to get to legislative work. Here's what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEAN WEST, GROUP ANALYST: The last round was a nice bit of political theater. The Democrats got that out of the way. They don't look like they are soft on automakers anymore. They played tough. They wouldn't have continued to keep the session open if they weren't planning on actually funding something.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON: All right, here the concessions all three CEOs say they will take only a dollar in compensation if they get the loans. Chrysler is talking about an electric drive model in 2010. Ford says its 2015 fleet will be 36 percent more efficient than the models it offered in 2005. GM is giving corporate jets, they're giving them up. Ford is selling its jets and they are all driving to Washington, D.C. this time around; big difference from last time.</p><p>They're asking for billions of dollars, and they're also offering warrants in exchange for those billions. As far as the differences are concerned, Ford says it can turn a profit by 2011 or at least break even by that year. Chrysler is in merger talks. That really separates them. They are still looking for a partner.</p><p>And GM will focus its U.S. branding to Chevy, Buick, GMC and Cadillac. Pontiac is going to stay more of a niche brand. Rick Wagoner says GM is looking hard at all its other names and they can possibly contract them.</p><p>But Alexis as you know, when GM got rid of Oldsmobile a couple of years ago, it was a lengthy process, it was an expensive process. It cost them more than a million bucks, a billion bucks excuse me, back to you.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, I was going to say, it was a little bit more than that. All right, Rich Edson thank you so much, for bringing us up to date on all of that because wow it is complicated.</p><p>Well, as lawmakers debate that total of $34 billion that Rich Edson just talked about, automakers say they need the money to speed up production of new energy saving vehicles.</p><p>Now, based on yesterday's sales figures, no one is buying their current crop of cars. Get this, Chrysler sales were down 47 percent. GM was down 41. Ford down 31. Now, if GM survives it is betting big on the Volt, an electric car that has been rushed into production and will hit show rooms ideally within 18 months.</p><p>Here to discuss if the $40,000 Volt can save GM is Michael Duoba, he is the mechanical engineer at the Center for Transportation Research Energy Systems Division. And John Grisma is the chief insights officer for Young and Rubican Brands. He is also the author of \"The Brand Bubble: The looming crisis in brand value and how to avoid it.\"</p><p>Welcome, gentlemen, thanks for being here.</p><p>MICHAEL DUOBA, CENTER FOR TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH: Thanks, Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: Michael, let me start with you. GM has been talking about this Volt. In fact the vice chairman sort of staked his career on it. He's been incredibly well known in the industry for the kind of cars he's developed. What do you make of whether or not GM could be successful with this car?</p><p>DUOBA: Well, I think that the Chevy Volt is a pretty exciting car. I think Bob Lutz is kind of the John F. Kennedy saying that he's going to go to the moon and end of the decade. And I think GM is kind of staking their brand on taking this car to the next level and perhaps dethroning the Prius as being the ultimate environmental car.</p><p>GLICK: John, there's some big differences between how people look at a car like the Toyota Prius and how they're trying to market this GM's Volt car here. Tell me what the differences are and why this is so important in their ability to sell this car.</p><p>JOHN GRISMA, CHIEF INSIGHTS OFFICER FOR YOUNG AND RUBICAN BRANDS: Absolutely. I think first and most importantly you have to look at GM is looking at this strategy clearly to improve its overall corporate image. And if you look back at some of the studies we've got actually seen there was a halo effect on the Toyota Prius meaning that there was actually moving across the board. You saw the SUVs and the trucks actually improving their perceptions of fuel efficiency just on the basis of having this one product in the line.</p><p>So clearly that's important from a perspective. But I think we have to slow down a little bit and really focus on what is the essence of this car? Will it really make an impact in the marketplace?</p><p>I think you've got to look at the fact that it is essentially they are talking 10,000 cars in what 2011. You're talking $30,000 at a price point a lot of questions it just loses with consumers.</p><p>GLICK: Yes and right now the price tag we're hearing is more like $40,000 but there's some vagary around it because it's still a long ways away.</p><p>But John, part of the issue here, you are a brand expert, and you've been watching what's been happening to the quality and the franchise behind the GM name. What has been happening and why is that contributing sort to the lack of, I guess, belief that this company can turn the story around?</p><p>GRISMA: You know, one of the things we wrote about in our book was the concept that consumers are actually acting more and more like shareholders, like investors. They are actually looking into the future for their expectations of brands.</p><p>And when we look at GM in the context of brand asset value which is our consumer brand database we have seen decline in trust, decline in differentiation, a decline in sort of perceived quality. This isn't necessarily fair because they are making some great products and the critics have actually -- the car critic really praised recent brands like the Cadillac, GTS, as well as the Saturn Aura.</p><p>So in that context I think what GM is trying to do is clearly get on board with green. I think all the big three automakers were behind a little bit in this in the 90s. They're trying to practice the sense of humility as well as sustainability. I mean I think if also if you step back and you look at GM, they pulled out of the Super Bowl this year, a very high- profile venue, $three million for a 30 second spot. They have ended their relationship with Tiger Woods which was a long time spokesperson. So I think they're trying to kind of be a little bit less flashy, a little bit more demure and try to get aligned with the administration's priorities.</p><p>GLICK: Michael, when you talk about the quality of this car or what it might do to turn GM's business around, they are sort of staking their future on it, who is going to buy this car?</p><p>DOUBA: That's a very good question. And I think that anyone can buy the car if you have a place to plug in. So there is a concern about the infrastructure involved you have to plug the car in every night as you would plug in your cell phone. So it is kind of a new paradigm of what we do with our car and how we use it.</p><p>But I think you know people who live in the suburbs who can drive enough miles to displace all the fuel that the vehicle promises to displace can buy the car.</p><p>GLICK: And are you concerned at all Michael about the price point? I mean I know we're looking out a couple of years from now, but on the other hand, you know, they are kind of staking their future on it, so it is kind of important.</p><p>DUOBA: Yes, I mean the price is -- it might be a little bit out of the reach of the average buyer, but it's -- they're not going to make money -- GM's is not going to make money on this product, so it is matter of just having enough, enough sales that they can show it's a strong product.</p><p>GLICK: John, what do you think?</p><p>GRISMA: I think that's the real key issue. I think you have to look at the infrastructure issues. You're talking about a $30,000 car. You're talking about perhaps urban environments because it's got a 40 miles range. How do you set up the infrastructure to basically plug in cars? How do you deal with that in New York? How do you deal with that in Boston?</p><p>Now, I think that these technologies will follow this car and it is an exciting thing but I think GM has to step back and think this isn't necessarily the one single silver bullet. They were successful in the past with the Corvette but let's look at this in the long-term plans for what they are going to do to roll out more sustainable vehicles.</p><p>GLICK: The one thing that you mentioned earlier is you said humility and sustainability. I presume that the combination of those two things is what they need to demonstrate to Congress later this week that they have both of those things.</p><p>You mentioned pulling back from the Super Bowl and a couple other moves that they've made but how do they bring about sustainability if they've now come to the well and said we need an additional $6 billion this after just testifying two weeks ago?</p><p>GRISMA: Yes, I mean first of all you've seen them out of their corporate jets and into their hybrids going to Capitol Hill. But I also think it's important to really look at how do they align with the administration's priorities? How do they align now with the Uber shareholders which is the taxpayers right? If GM is dealing with taxpayer money?</p><p>So I think in that context, what they have to do is prove their long-term sustainability, their ability to actually get in line with where Americans want to go, lessen their dependence on foreign oil and focus on really marketing this car in the context of where GM and Ford and Chrysler where are they're going in the future.</p><p>GLICK: It's interesting because we're going to talk to one of the top executives at Anheuser-Busch this morning and there used to be a concept here called made in America and we used to be excited about that and somehow we've got to turn this philosophy around because we're not very excited about it right now when it concerns the automakers.</p><p>All right, John and Michael, thank you guys so much. I appreciate it.</p><p>All right, coming up the newly formed Anheuser-Busch Inbev brought the largest European and American brewers together. After the break we're going to have an exclusive interview with the president of the Anheuser- Busch division to talk about the transition.</p><p>And then for all you Victoria's Secret lovers out there, Victoria's Secret angels are hitting the runway to revive sales this holiday season. We're going to have another exclusive interview with their CEO in just a little bit. You won't want to miss it. I promise.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: Newly formed Anheuser-Busch Inbev brought the largest European and American brewers together. Here to talk about the transition and the future of the famous Anheuser-Busch Clydesdale Horses, Anheuser-Busch President, David Peacock joins us now in a Fox Business Exclusive.</p><p>Good morning, great to see you.</p><p>DAVID PEACOCK, ANHEUSER-BUSCH PRESIDENT: Good to see you again Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: It is the first time that I'm talking to you live in person.</p><p>PEACOCK: That's right.</p><p>GLICK: Since the deal, walk me through, how has the transition been?</p><p>PEACOCK: It's been good. You know I tell you, we've been very impressed with the people from Inbev. And I think there's a lot of commonality on how we approach the business and just how we work. And I've got to say it's been a very collaborative effort.</p><p>GLICK: And I said to you when you walked in, I imagine that this has required a lot of traveling, a lot of getting to know each other and also a lot of calming people's fears because the transition, a change of this magnitude is pretty big for one of the largest independent private companies -- I mean public but owned by a family.</p><p>PEACOCK: Right.</p><p>GLICK: What has that been like addressing their concerns?</p><p>PEACOCK: I think you just have to be honest with people and be up front and just make sure they understand that the best interests of the organization are always top of mind. And that we are committed to treating everybody with great respect. And the organization, our performance has been great so I give them the big thumbs up on the effort that they have shown during all these uncertainty.</p><p>GLICK: Anheuser-Busch obviously is an iconic brand and a lot of people were concerned about the concept that an iconic brand going to a European company. How will the brand change or will we not see a lot of changes at least here in the United States?</p><p>PEACOCK: I think the things that work and the things that matter won't change. You know the heirs of our company will never change, the brand Budweiser is such a part of our company. And saw it when you came to see us, we don't have Anheuser-Busch on the top of our building, we have Budweiser. And that's what people buy and that's what people believe in. And that's what not going to change.</p><p>And the Clydesdales, the book you're holding, the Clydesdales aren't going to change. They are going to continue to graze in the pastures in mid- Missouri where their new farm is where we moved them a couple weeks ago. And they are going to be continued to be housed on the campus.</p><p>GLICK: We just showed a copy of this, and I have it in my hand it's called \"The Great American Tradition.\" As a matter of fact, when I went down to St. Louis to visit you guys, I was there for the 75th anniversary of the Clydesdales.</p><p>PEACOCK: Right.</p><p>GLICK: And what's the meaning behind this? Tell people about this. This is part of the tradition of the company.</p><p>PEACOCK: The story was back in when prohibition was repealed 1933, August Busch Jr. wanted to show his father some respect and commemorate the moment. And they offered an eight horse hitch to deliver the first beer to the governor Al Smith, I think governor or mayor of New York and then FDR in Washington, D.C.</p><p>And they've just been a part of our heritage ever since then. And they represent strength, power, quality, beauty, all the great things that we think are synonymous with America and are synonymous with our brand Budweiser.</p><p>GLICK: One of the things that's also synonymous with your brand is huge advertising in the Super Bowl. And you are going ahead with some huge spots. Tell me a little bit about that, and why you've continued along with the investment because as you and I both know Inbev is known for cost- cutting.</p><p>PEACOCK: Yes, but it is a knock they don't deserve. I mean, if you look at their third quarter, they actually had an increase in marketing and selling up about 12 percent. So they will invest behind brands. We're going to have actually nine commercials in the Super Bowl this year, and about half of them will be dedicated to the Clydesdales.</p><p>And we've got some really nice spots on the horizon and one I think especially that just wrapped up last week that I think could be the winner hopefully.</p><p>GLICK: Oh, I like that.</p><p>Now, one of the things you guys have done is you've always invested a lot in sports, sports across the globe.</p><p>PEACOCK: Right.</p><p>GLICK: And had some huge partnerships with some of the biggest sports in the industry. Will you continue to have those partnerships? Will you, you know, readdress them? You know, where does that stand?</p><p>PEACOCK: Sports is a big part of our DNA. Last night we had an event where we invited a lot of the New York media and sports community in for a happy hour and told all those folks from ESPN and the different teams, we're still there. We are still a big part of what you do, and you are still a big part of reaching our consumers in the proper way.</p><p>GLICK: Let's talk a little bit about financials because the stock has been very turbulent, and it's been a difficult economy. One of the things I said to you in the very beginning that I didn't realize about the deal and I was pretty much in the know about this I didn't necessarily understand that there was a six-month bridge loan that Inbev used which was part of financing this deal.</p><p>PEACOCK: Right.</p><p>GLICK: They have now announced this they are going to go -- that they are going to go out there through a rights offering and raise funds in the marketplace. It really hurt the stock. First day it was announced, the stock was down 13 percent. Why are you doing this and what do you want shareholders to know?</p><p>PEACOCK: I think most important is the intrinsic value of the deal is still there. It is a tough market, but combining these two great companies and the growth opportunities and the expansion of the brand Budweiser, which is a big part of this globally still have merit. And I think at the end of the day, from what we have seen, if you've got a combination that makes sense, and there's opportunity for growth, you're going to see the financials fall into place.</p><p>So we're not too worried about what we have seen out in the marketplace. It's like anything else, when you have a good idea and two companies should come together, then I think at the end of the day the financial community and the markets will respond positively.</p><p>GLICK: Even though it is dilutive to shareholders right now because this rights offerings is going to be in existence now for a two-week period, over the long haul you think you will make up for it with growth and opportunities?</p><p>PEACOCK: Yes, the synergies we talked about are still there. We still have visibility to them. All the reasons why it made sense for these companies to come together are still there.</p><p>GLICK: you and I have talked in the past about beverage sales here in the United States. And the numbers have been very small increases, low single digit percentage gains, but that there are tremendous opportunities still in emerging economies. How much of those opportunities have changed because we are now in a much more difficult global environment, or will you still look to get more penetration?</p><p>PEACOCK: Oh, definitely. I think brand Budweiser has a lot of opportunity in the emerging markets. The beer industry so far in the U.S. has been very good. It probably will come in just under one percent growth which for us is good, and it is very resilient in this kind of time.</p><p>Recessions are short-term. This is a long-term deal. We are going to be in business a long time. We have been in business a long time. And I think that's the long-term view we are going to continue to take.</p><p>GLICK: One last question, China. China has said you guys have a big stake in a Chinese brewer as does Inbev. They have capped the stake. They have said no more acquisitions of any other brewers in China, no percentage stakes. What does that mean to your business model, are you concerned about that?</p><p>PEACOCK: No, I think we have got a very good model in China, and we have really created the premium segment with Budweiser years ago. And recently just this year we rolled out to over 100 markets where we hadn't sold before.</p><p>What's interesting about China is you have constant geographic expansion opportunities because it's just so vast. And it is amazing to me still when you can see a city in China that may be 20th in size and there's still six million people, and you may not have even really penetrated that market. So we have a lot of growth opportunities there and in combining the two companies that we've got now with some of the brands like Harbin and some of the brands that Inbev has.</p><p>GLICK: The book is \"The Great American Tradition: the 75th anniversary of the Budweiser Clydesdales.\" It is a good gift for the family. I like it.</p><p>PEACOCK: I was going to say I gave you a horse shoe the last time I saw you. This time you get you a book. Boys around Clydesdales.</p><p>GLICK: So this time I get a book. I love that horse shoe. David Peacock as always so great seeing you. Congratulations and best of luck happy holidays.</p><p>PEACOCK: Thank you. You too.</p><p>GLICK: We're going to take a quick break and we'll right back with much more \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" including Victoria's Secret, the ladies on the runway, you won't want to miss this coming up in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LEE: Welcome back everyone to \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.\" I am Jenna Lee and here's this morning's top news stories.</p><p>We're going to begin with a look at President elect Barack Obama's up coming cabinet. Fox News confirming that Mr. Obama will name New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson as his commerce secretary today. You might remember that just a few weeks ago the governor's name was also tossed out for potentially the secretary of state position. That didn't happen of course. But Richardson has a long history in Washington serving as energy secretary under President Clinton. He was also the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.</p><p>Secretary of state Condoleezza Rice arriving in New Delhi, India today one of her last trips abroad as the top U.S. diplomat. Rice is in India to urge a fast response to the Mumbai attacks and to ease tensions between India and neighboring Pakistan. Rice also saying that officials in Islamabad need to cooperate with India's request.</p><p>You are up-to-date on the Fox Business Network. Much more ahead. The latest report on job cut activity. And Victoria's Secret, can't beat that. We will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: Welcome back to \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.\" I'm Alexis Glick.</p><p>We are waiting for the Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas jobs report. It is due out in just about ten seconds. We will also get the ADP private sector job report. That number comes out in just about 45 minutes.</p><p>Let's go upstairs to the Fox Business Desk to Connell McShane to see if we can get the Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas numbers.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, we have them, Alexis, and the layoffs are going up. No surprise there. Actually the highest since back in 2002. Up 46 percent from the same time a year ago.</p><p>Layoff announcements for the month of November, according to Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas coming in at more than 181,000. Want to be exact, 181,671. That's the most number of layoffs, the highest number of layoffs monthly since January of 2002. We're up in the 250 range there.</p><p>And it is up from the same time -- from a month ago by almost -- by more than 60 percent, and from a year ago by 46 percent. A couple of notable factors here. Number one, year to date this brings the number of layoffs according to this particular metric above a million.</p><p>It's a million and 57,000 give or take, it was 875,000, you added that on, you're over a million now year-to-date in layoffs.</p><p>What's leading the way? Well, again, no surprise. Financial and retail sectors are really leading the way when we come to -- to job cuts there. Year to date in the financial sector, you're talking about 220,000 plus layoffs, 21 percent of the total so far this year.</p><p>So the financial sector is really getting hit hard. We have the Citigroup plan that was announced in this month with the 50,000 employees being let go.</p><p>So a quick recap for you, Alexis, layoffs, according to the firm -- the outplacement firm, Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, are going up, 46 percent above the level they were at a year ago, above 181,000 and above a million so far this year.</p><p>It's back to you in the studios. </p><p>GLICK: All right. Not the best of news. Connell, thank you so much.</p><p>Well, let's get the latest and break down the numbers on this jobs number and ask our guests here to break it down and see what they think about it.</p><p>Mark Lieberman is our FOX Business senior economist, FOX Business contributor Charles Payne, and Leo Tilman is the former chief strategist for Bear Stearns.</p><p>Leo, I'll start with you. I would assume no great surprise here, but the trend is not our friend.</p><p>LEO TILMAN, L.M. TILMAN PRESIDENT: Absolutely, Alexis. And I think the employment numbers today are the most important ones of all because we're still trying to ascertain to which extent this credit crisis continues to hurt the economy and obviously it is, and it means that the bailout is not working fast enough.</p><p>GLICK: Charles?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, yes -- you know, listen, I agree with that, and I also think this whole thing underscores the notion that perhaps we need to give corporate America lower taxes, you know, much lower tax rate.</p><p>GLICK: You're here.</p><p>PAYNE: I know that -- you know that President Obama is against that, and, you know, the whole mandate was sticking to the corporations and the rich, but you know what, at this point, you know, they're getting their just desserts, you know, you can call it karma, whatever you want.</p><p>The bottom line is when you see these types of numbers and at the end of the day, if it takes jobs -- and I think Mark will agree with me -- it takes jobs to turn this economy around. One of the good things is to incentivize corporations or even make it possible for them to do some hiring in this environment.</p><p>MARK LIEBERMAN, FOX BUSINESS SENIOR ECONOMIST: Charles, I agree with you in part. Yes, we have to incent corporations to do something but just to say across the board tax cut doesn't necessarily do it.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, no. We got...</p><p>LIEBERMAN: If you're talking ...</p><p>GLICK: ... strings attached.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: If you're talking about job tax credits or something for job creation, that's a better plan than just saying we've got to reduce corporate tax rates. Just to say that doesn't necessarily put more...</p><p>PAYNE: No, you know what it is, though, Mark? Put strings attached to it, it's like...</p><p>LIEBERMAN: It is not a question of putting strings. It's a question of -- use a tax code to incentivize a particular type of behavior.</p><p>PAYNE: Like for instance, you'll -- we'll give you a tax break but the jobs have to be in -- you know, in North Dakota.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Something like that. Yes.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, I mean, but you see, my concern, Charles, if is we -- like Mark said, if we did -- we're totally getting off...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK: But let me -- I was just going to say...</p><p>PAYNE: But it does circle back to jobs, though.</p><p>GLICK: Well, what -- to me, what I worry about, though, is if you give a blanket cut without some kind of strings attached that we have the same thing that we got with this TARP program, which is you're giving all this money to these banks, there were zero strings attached and now they're not doing anything to make lending any better.</p><p>They are not necessarily doing anything to really increase or improve the foreclosure situation and I think that's why, frankly, when Treasury Secretary Paulson goes there next week and ask the other 350, I don't think they're going to give it to him.</p><p>But that's a whole other topic.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Yes, let's go back to these job numbers if we -- this Challenger announcement and put it into context. It is scary when you look at a number like 181,000 and huge increases year to date and huge increases year over year.</p><p>This is the first time that full year announcements have topped a million in -- since 2000 -- by November in 2003, but A, these are just announcements. They may not be followed through. Employment is a lagging indicator in any economic situation.</p><p>GLICK: Everybody says to me employment is a lagging indicator, but who on this planet doesn't think that employment is going to get worse?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: It will get worse. It will get worse because the economy is continuing to deteriorate. It's -- we saw the corporate profits report in the last week when we got -- a couple weeks ago when we got GDP numbers. That showed corporate profits declining and the response to that is to trim expenses.</p><p>GLICK: OK. Guys, I hate to do this, I'm sorry, but we're going to have to wrap it up right now. You guys are going to come back for the ADP.</p><p>I'm sorry, Leo, I didn't get a chance to talk to you more about it just because we have somebody standing by. So we're going to come back to those ADP, as I said, the private sector numbers, in just a moment.</p><p>But President elect Barack Obama met with governors from across the country yesterday in Philadelphia. They were tackling state's growing financial and economic problems. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA (D), PRESIDENT ELECT: To solve this crisis and to ease the burden on our states, we're going to need action and we're going to need actions swiftly. We intend to help save or create 2.5 million jobs. We intend to put tax cuts into the pockets of hard-pressed middle class families in your states. And we are not, as a nation, going to be able to just keep on printing money.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLICK: Now the country's mayors are turning to the president elect for help, too. The U.S. conference of mayors has released a list of more than 4600 infrastructure projects that would add more than 261,000 jobs in 154 cities.</p><p>Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter met with the president elect yesterday and he joins us this morning.</p><p>Good morning, Mayor.</p><p>MAYOR MICHAEL NUTTER (D), PHILADELPHIA: Good morning, Alexis. How are you?</p><p>GLICK: Great, good to see you.</p><p>NUTTER: Good.</p><p>GLICK: Well, you spoke yesterday...</p><p>NUTTER: Always good to be with you.</p><p>GLICK: Well, thanks for being here. You spoke yesterday, as I mentioned, to President-elect Obama. What was on the agenda?</p><p>NUTTER: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: What did you guys discuss?</p><p>NUTTER: We discussed three things after, again, congratulating him and he thanked us for the great electoral victory here in Philadelphia, talked about infrastructure, talked about mortgage foreclosure, and talked about pension systems.</p><p>All three key issues and certainly I'm very supportive of Mayor Manny Diaz, our great president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the larger agenda that was put out, but we need access to credit markets for borrowing purposes, and that's all I wanted to talk with president-elect about.</p><p>Our pension systems are all taking massive losses because of a third to a half loss in the overall stock market. Access to capital, to borrow for infrastructure projects, which is a big topic of conversation between the president-elect and the governors yesterday, and then the mortgage foreclosure crisis.</p><p>You mentioned in the earlier segment that the financial institutions and the banks have been helped tremendously by treasury. But they are doing virtually nothing to help homeowners on the ground stay in their homes. Banks don't want to own houses. They want to service mortgages.</p><p>We have a unique program, our Mortgage Foreclosure Reduction Program here in Philadelphia. We'd like to see that replicated across the country to keep people in their homes and stabilize neighborhoods.</p><p>So those were a few of the things that I talked to the president-elect about yesterday. It was a very good conversation.</p><p>GLICK: You know, I don't know about your mortgage foreclosure reduction plan. Can you tell me about it, Mayor, because a lot of people are talking about...</p><p>NUTTER: Sure.</p><p>GLICK: ... what FDIC chair Sheila Bair is doing particularly with Indymac, but -- but how is your plan different?</p><p>NUTTER: Yes. Our plan is different -- earlier this year through a tremendously cooperative effort between our court system, our judges, the legal community, as well as the banking industry, we first put a hold on -- a moratorium on mortgage foreclosures in Philadelphia for three to four months, just stopped them dead cold, and then brought the homeowners, the bankers, legal team together and the courts and the sheriff to create reconciliation conferences so that we can sit down with these homeowners and figure out how to restructure their payments so they can stay in their home.</p><p>We have saved hundreds of people from foreclosure and literally possibly being thrown out on the streets, and it's -- the program has worked very well. We have a hotline, outreach workers, literally people out on the street knocking on doors in targeted neighborhoods throughout Philadelphia to get people to the help they need, did PSAs for this effort.</p><p>It's worked very, very well. And we've had a lot of support from some local banks and a couple foundations. But certainly the federal government has a role to play. This is a national program in the makings, and the federal government really could step up and help us out.</p><p>GLICK: Well, that's pretty impressive. I'm glad to hear more about that...</p><p>NUTTER: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: ... because I think we need to...</p><p>NUTTER: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: We need to be doing a lot more about it, obviously, on a state by state basis.</p><p>You know, Mayor, you -- we're all talking about everybody's fiscal house, and the fiscal house in Pennsylvania...</p><p>NUTTER: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: ... is feeling some heat, too. You are right now...</p><p>NUTTER: It's tough.</p><p>GLICK: ... facing a budget shortfall as you know better than I do, the number I've heard reported is up to 2 billion by the middle of next year and that you're facing $1 billion...</p><p>NUTTER: For the state.</p><p>GLICK: For the state, for the state.</p><p>NUTTER: For the state. I don't want to give my citizen...</p><p>GLICK: Not for Philadelphia.</p><p>NUTTER: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: Well, when you say access to capital or access to credit...</p><p>NUTTER: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: ... for some of these infrastructure, how do you address those budget gaps? I mean are you talking about the Federal Reserve Bank, perhaps, stepping up and purchasing municipal funding? </p><p>NUTTER: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: I mean, walk me through what you would like to see happen.</p><p>NUTTER: There are a couple things. A couple weeks ago I was down in -- I was in Washington, delivered a letter to -- for Treasury Secretary Paulson and specifically I talked to big and medium sized city mayors about this issue. </p><p>We'd like to borrow directly from the treasury for infrastructure projects that are ready to go. You can put a shovel in the ground in just a couple of months and put people back to work, but we've not had great access to the capital markets to borrow money from.</p><p>So we'd like to borrow directly from treasury, repay at 50 basis points over treasury so the Feds are actually going to make money off of this deal, and allow us to get our crucial infrastructure projects under way, bridges, roads, telecommunications lines, underground infrastructure as well, put people to work quickly, but we need access to capital markets.</p><p>Virtually, no one could borrow anything from anybody regardless of your credit rating for months, and that has had a serious impact on cash flow as well as the ability to put shovels in the ground, so that was a big topic of conversation with the governors yesterday.</p><p>GLICK: OK, so -- so Mayor, because, you know, I know you have $180 million in what was recently rated as triple B status paper for the...</p><p>NUTTER: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: ... for the city of Philadelphia.</p><p>NUTTER: For the city, yes, just last week.</p><p>GLICK: In essence what you're suggesting that if you were to get some kind of deal like that through treasury, 50 basis points above current rates.</p><p>NUTTER: Right.</p><p>GLICK: That that would save your funding costs, I mean, what do you expect your funding rates to be going forward, and how big a difference will it make? And then -- and then, finally, one other thing, Mayor, that Governor Tim Pawlenty talked to me about yesterday, he says, look, we've also got to make some hard choices.</p><p>NUTTER: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: What hard choices are you willing to make to offset...</p><p>NUTTER: Well...</p><p>GLICK: ... access to capital?</p><p>NUTTER: Yes. Well, we've made the hard choices already. I made an announcement, a pretty big announcement two days after the election, I'm laying off upwards of 220 people, not filling 600 positions, closing 11 libraries, only reopening 12 of our 70 plus swimming pools, and so we've cut back significantly.</p><p>This is a very, very painful time between the layoffs and impact to some very important programs. I have never asked for a bailout. We're not asking for handouts. Access to capital has been the big request by cities all across America because we've been shut out of the credit markets, but all these big city mayors -- you look at what Mayor Bloomberg has done in New York, Mayor Daley in Chicago, Gavin Newsom in San Francisco, Shirley Franklin in Atlanta, Phil Gordon in Phoenix.</p><p>All of these mayors are making drastic cuts in programs and services, but the federal government -- we need your help in accessing the capital markets. We're willing to take out loans, we will repay. We're good credits. We're not going anywhere. We don't go out of business. And so we're stable and secure, unlike, you know, some of the others who are lining up.</p><p>GLICK: All right, well, Mayor Nutter, as always, fantastic pleasure talking to you.</p><p>NUTTER: Thanks, Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: Best of luck in your endeavor.</p><p>NUTTER: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: And you and I haven't talked since your Phillies won so I do need to tell you congratulations.</p><p>NUTTER: Thank you, go Phillies.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Did Governor Crist...</p><p>NUTTER: It's been a wonderful time. And we're going to -- we're going to turn things around in all these cities across America. President-elect Obama understands these issues, talked with the governors yesterday, and I know he is interested in talking to, to the mayors as well.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Well, we certainly hope things turn around very soon. Thank you so much, great pleasure seeing you.</p><p>NUTTER: They will. Thank you. You, too.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Coming up Charles Payne is chasing after Chuck E. Cheese. He says the pizza stock is cooking. Details just ahead.</p><p>And later strutting for sales. We're going to talk to the CEO of Victoria's Secret when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: In his Wall Street strategy's hotline Charles Payne says he longs for the days of the bologna sandwiches and when people were just in a better mood all around. So do I.</p><p>He says seeing the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile on his way into work bring a smile to his face and it reminds him that we just aren't happy as we used to be.</p><p>He says, \"I believe there is a feeling of self-loathing that has been creeping into the psyche of America for a long time. It seems like we find it harder to be happy. We find it harder to smile.\"</p><p>Here he is, smiley himself, FOX Business contributor, Charles Payne. Oh my god, you know, I love bologna.</p><p>PAYNE: Do you?</p><p>GLICK: I hate to admit it. </p><p>PAYNE: Yes, fried, regular, any kind.</p><p>GLICK: Oh yes.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, I do.</p><p>PAYNE: Have you seen the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile?</p><p>GLICK: Of course, and I -- I have the little keychain. But they were here with us, remember?</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, I loved it. You know, it was created in 1936, the Depression, and I went through a list last night of all the great things that were simple and created during difficult economic times.</p><p>GLICK: OK, tell me what they are.</p><p>PAYNE: Pet rock. Rock and Roll. The lava land. The CD player. The list goes on and on so we can be happy with very simple things in very depressed times.</p><p>GLICK: You need to give me that list as if you report it.</p><p>PAYNE: Here's the list right there. Look at that list right there.</p><p>GLICK: I want to look at this list.</p><p>PAYNE: Here it is.</p><p>GLICK: This needs to go -- I'm going to put this on my blog even though you have your -- all your huge fan base. </p><p>OK. So, so yes, we need to smile a little bit. We need to sort of, you know, move past this, but let's talk about some picks.</p><p>PAYNE: OK.</p><p>GLICK: What are you looking at today?</p><p>PAYNE: The one that intrigues me the most this morning is a company called Cyberonics. And it's been around for a long time. It gets a lot of hype. They make an implantable device that controls nerve stimulation.</p><p>Now the first -- the first approval was for epilepsy seizures but they think they can use this thing to fight depression, to control hunger, a lot of different things. The stock has been acting great this week. Piper Jaffrey has had some positive comments recently. I love this. It's come down a lot, I like the risk reward.</p><p>GLICK: OK. What's next?</p><p>PAYNE: Chuck E. Cheese, which is the last time I mentioned it on the show it came down a lot since then. But I think it's oversold here. I do believe that, you know what, it's going to do pretty well in this sort of economy.</p><p>You can see where at one point -- if we even had a longer term chart, it really was on a great tear. I will say those September quarter they missed. However, I would wait for a breakout and buy the stock north to 17 1/2.</p><p>GLICK: And where are Chuck E. Cheeses?</p><p>PAYNE: There's not one next door.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK: Yes, I heard the -- oh my goodness. Did you guys -- you guys scared for me, right? I got a little scared myself because Charles...</p><p>PAYNE: There's a lot of them out in Jersey, though.</p><p>GLICK: ... says that I don't walk around the neighborhood -- OK, what's the last one?</p><p>PAYNE: Cree Research. You know, it's interesting because I interviewed the CEO of OSRAM SYLVANIA yesterday and he talked about light emitting diodes.</p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: I've always liked this place -- this space. It's very sexy. You know the NASDAQ building, all those lights, those are light emitting diodes. Eventually we'll have them in our home so we'll replace every single thing.</p><p>This is a stock that's been in a rumor mill for a long time, bad management, nevertheless, think -- I would buy it north of 16. That's the caveat.</p><p>GLICK: OK.</p><p>PAYNE: Traders look to get out at 19. If you're willing to hold through the gyrations a year from now it could be 24.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Charles Payne.</p><p>PAYNE: All right.</p><p>GLICK: Very good.</p><p>PAYNE: All of these use a 15 percent stop loss.</p><p>GLICK: Stop loss on the down side.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: Great point.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Let's quickly go over to Ashley Webster in London, get an update from him.</p><p>Ashley, you should look at this list of the things that have been created in difficult periods, Pacman, CD players, hula hoops.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS OVERSEAS MARKETS EDITOR: Yes, they're all good.</p><p>GLICK: Ashley, you missed it. Keep going.</p><p>WEBSTER: I missed it. I'm going, I'm going. All right. Let's go to the markets. I still have the (INAUDIBLE) 3000 models away.</p><p>OK, let's talk about the markets. London down 0.5 percent. France down 1 1/3 percent. As we speak Germany down 1.5, despite the gains in Asia, we are losing ground here in Europe so far.</p><p>We're keeping an eye on the airline sector after the big merger talks were revealed yesterday between British Airways and Qantas of Australia. BA, though, down 1 percent.</p><p>The big story of the morning, though, in the European tech sector. German semiconductor company Infineon reporting its 7th straight quarterly loss. That means that the company is saying today that it is continuing to struggle. Sales don't look good. The loss for the fourth quarter -- oh by the way $970 million dollars.</p><p>Also very quickly Anglo Irish Bank in the banking sector reporting full profit loss in the four-year profit loss of 33 percent. Also says it's putting aside $635 million for bad loans. Ouch.</p><p>Anglo Irish down 17 percent. The only good news is that the dollar is slightly higher today against both the euro and the British pound.</p><p>All right time to take a break. Coming up the Victoria's Secrets angels will be strutting their stuff and sales tonight. So what is the retail outlook for Victoria's Secret? We'll ask the CEO. An exclusive interview after the break.</p><p>And yes, we have video, and I have seen it and Victoria doesn't have many secrets left. We will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: Intimate apparel giant Victoria's Secret is one of the biggest money makers for its parent company Limited Brands and the models are strutting their stuff tonight on CBS to hit holiday sales.</p><p>I sat down with the CEO of the company. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SHAREN TURNEY, VICTORIA' SECRET CEO: This year's show we shot at the Fontainebleau which has a lot of history to it. The Rat Pack used to hang out there. Elvis Presley would sing there. So it's really about return to glamour. And that's what our assortments are for holiday.</p><p>We all know we're in a little bit of a downturn in terms of our economy so we're really trying to offer our customers this year a real credible promise of value in all that we do.</p><p>GLICK: One of the things that we have seen for Victoria's Secret and the parent company of Limited Brands is that it's been a difficult climate. I mean everybody has sort of been facing the new heat, the new environment, and that we've heard reports that Black Friday wasn't quite up to expectations.</p><p>You tell me, what are your projections this holiday season and how are you doing thus far if you were to give yourself a report card?</p><p>TURNEY: Well, I think we went into this fall and holiday season with a very conservative plan. We saw that the downside of the economy was happening, not to the degree that it has happened. We've been really controlling inventories, our inventory -- put it down almost 17 percent.</p><p>As we entered the fourth quarter really looking at our capex spending, and we were investing our dollars and to make sure that we're investing into the stores that are coming to the end of their lease line.</p><p>What we've done is try to be prepared and that's what we're trying to do for our customers as well. And I think that we're meeting our expectations as we talked about in our third quarter on our call is the fact that we made more money than the year before, as well as our (INAUDIBLE) doors were down about 9, our direct business was at double digits.</p><p>GLICK: One of the things, I'm glad you brought up direct business, because that's something that you are very well known for and very famous in the industry for is what you have created in direct business not only in your past positions but here at Victoria's Secret.</p><p>Why is that so crucial and how do you succeed even more in this kind of environment on direct business?</p><p>TURNEY: Well, I think that today the consumer has many venues of which they want to shop. And they might want to go to a store, they might want to use online to see what's happening, and then go into the store. They might have gone to the store and said, I wish I would have bought that, and it gives them an opportunity to go online.</p><p>And it's really not one way, but it's what is the preference of the customer and being able to offer that to them no matter how they want to shop.</p><p>GLICK: You know, it's interesting because a lot of people suggest that the bricks and mortar model several years ago was going to die. And now you're hearing that commercial real estate and strip malls are feeling the pain because people are not going into the malls to the degree that one would hope or expect given what's happened with the economy.</p><p>Will you look to downsize the amount of stores that you have as you look into 2009 and direct more of that energy and attention toward the Internet?</p><p>TURNEY: I think you're going to see us do both. We have some stores that are coming up to their end -- end of their lease line, but we'll also in -- when we start building stores, there are only 4,000 square feet.</p><p>Today we've added on the pink line. We've extended the beauty assortments. We have the new VSX sports line. We're adding swim wear to our stores so a 5,000 square foot store for us today is really too small. So where we can get the real estate, you'll see bigger stores from us that house all of these different opportunities for Victoria's Secret.</p><p>GLICK: I said to you in the very beginning, you know, I look at people like Heidi Klum and some of the other faces of Victoria's Secret, and we all sort of want to be that person but of course, you know, part of the beauty is the imagination or dreaming up how we can look like that person, but can we do that affordably?</p><p>TURNEY: Well, there is that $5 million diamond bra but also within the assortments today you can buy a bra for $20 from Victoria's Secret. You can buy a bra for $32 to $42 to $68 to $120.</p><p>So we really do have a breath of price range for women today to come in and buy a bra from Victoria's Secret.</p><p>GLICK: One last question for you. Limited Brands was recently downgraded. The debt was downgraded technically to junk status. A lot of businesses have said that they're having a very difficult time either getting access to the credit markets or raising funds in this kind of climate.</p><p>How are you guys doing? How concerned about that are you? And what do you project that will mean for you in your ability to continue to either grow or evolve as a business?</p><p>TURNEY: You know, we are very fortunate that we have over a billion dollars in cash in the bank. We have over a billion and a half credit line today. We've never had to go out and get into that credit line. We are a high margin, fast-turning business, and I think with the right prudent and conservativism going into 2009 I don't believe at all that Limited Brands will have any issues.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GLICK: In fact she also told me that they plan to expand as many as four stores in Canada. They are looking at some other options. They have a thousand stores across the country.</p><p>And if you're wondering about that runway show this evening, 500 hours worth of fittings for the models to prepare for this evening's show.</p><p>All right, well, my thanks again to the CEO, of course, of Victoria's Secret for joining me yesterday.</p><p>Coming up, we're going to continue our look at the bailout for automakers. Senator Arlen Specter is going to join us live. And the bailout could be felt hundreds of miles away from Detroit.</p><p>We're going to fill you in when the second hour of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST returns.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: Good morning and welcome to hour number two of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Alexis Glick.</p><p>We're going to have the latest on the auto bailout coming up and Senator Arlen Specter will join us to tell us what he is expecting of the automakers.</p><p>Also we'll get the latest numbers from the ADP jobs report. That is due out in 15 minutes. This on the heels of a weaker than expected Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas numbers that came out just moments ago of a loss of 181,000 jobs in the month of November.</p><p>Also coming up the CEO of Blockbuster Videos is going to join us as well.</p><p>But first let's get a quick check of the futures as we stand right now. We've been in negative territory throughout the morning, but right now we are close back to the lows of the morning. We're down 116 points. We're down 1.38 percent. The S&amp;P is down 1.5 percent. And NASDAQ is now down 2 1/4 percent.</p><p>We've been jockeying all around this morning and after those employment numbers this morning, we've moved lower.</p><p>All right. Congressional leaders are set to begin hearings Thursday on the U.S. automakers' plan for survival and their request for as much as $34 billion in government loans. For a look at what the plans say, here's Fox Business Washington correspondent, Rich Edson, who's going to break down all the details.</p><p>Good morning, Rich.</p><p>RICH EDSON, FBN CORRESPONDENT: And good morning, Alexis.</p><p>And all three automakers say they will make smaller, more fuel efficient cars. All three are willing to exchange warrants for government loans. GM says it will cut as many as 31,000 additional jobs. Ford says it will at least break even by 2011. And Chrysler says it could start repaying the government by 2012.</p><p>The price tag for all of that and more is $34 billion worth of federal loans. GM wants $4 billion this month and up to $18 billion overall if the economy gets worse. Ford says it doesn't need the money now, but would like a $9 billion line of credit. Chrysler is asking for $7 billion. And Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson says the Bush administration supports helping the automakers as long as the assistance comes from somewhere other than the rescue package.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENRY PAULSON, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: So we have been very much for -- we need a solution that avoids bankruptcy, but it's got to be leading to a viable industry.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON: The administration still supports using $25 billion already set aside to help the automakers reach fuel efficiency standards. It is all up to Democratic leadership. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says no decisions have been made yet, including whether the Senate or the House will go first. And none will be made, at least until the hearings, later this week.</p><p>GM's COO Fritz Henderson is briefing lawmakers here this afternoon. Reps from the other two automakers will also work The Hill today. The United Auto Workers Union meets in the motor city today to perhaps discuss concessions. And GM's CEO Rick Wagoner says he and UAW President Ron Gettlefinger agree that the union can be part of the solution, but not all of it.</p><p>Alexis, back to you.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, and, Rich, I imagine that the rhetoric is going to get tougher and tougher, particularly given the fact that now -- particularly General Motors is asking for an additional $6 billion. Even Ford, who said they may not need the $9 billion line, are talking about the need perhaps for an additional $4 billion if the recession gets worse. I mean, at what point can we believe that enough is enough?</p><p>EDSON: Yes. Well, that, and also look at the way that they're getting here. Now they're driving and giving up the corporate jets. What you're hearing in D.C. is, why didn't you come to us with this plan and this type of approach the first time around? We almost had to draw you in to doing it the right way the second time.</p><p>GLICK: Great point. All right, Rich, we're going to leave it there. Thank you so much. And I will check in with you in a little while.</p><p>Well, while much of the U.S. carmakers' bailout discussion focuses on the impact the big three are having on Detroit, the auto industry's reach extends far beyond Michigan's borders. Take, for example, Chattanooga, Tennessee. Now despite the economic downturn, Volkswagen is putting $1 billion into a new plant in Chattanooga that will help create about 2,000 jobs. For a look at how the possible bailout will affect the economy, both in and out of Detroit, I'm joined by Trevor Hamilton. He's the vice president of economic development for the Chattanooga Chamber of Commerce, and Republican Congressman Thaddeus McCotter of Michigan.</p><p>Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for being here.</p><p>REP. THADDEUS MCCOTTER, (R) MICHIGAN: Thanks for having me.</p><p>TREVOR HAMILTON, CHATTANOOGA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE VP: Good morning, Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Trevor, let me start with you. How has that Chattanooga billion dollar project affected your local economy? And why do you think it is that Volkswagen has decided to invest in the U.S., particularly at a time when we're all struggling?</p><p>HAMILTON: Well, for Chattanooga, this is really the culmination of a long- term vision for our community to recruit an automobile manufacturer to our region. Chattanooga has had a long history with manufacturing. We believe that manufacturing is still important to the economic base of this nation's economy. And so this is really a culmination of a long-term vision for our community and our state here in Tennessee.</p><p>Volkswagen carries less than a 3 percent market share in the United States currently. And their hope is that by the time this facility is operational in 2011, that our economy will be again on the rebound and that they'll have the right vehicle at the right price for the American consumer at that time.</p><p>GLICK: Congressman McCotter, I know that you understand more than anybody how crucial this talk about a rescue plan is for the big three automakers. You've had an opportunity to see the plans they put in place yesterday. Did they make enough progress?</p><p>MCCOTTER: Well, I hope that they did. It's going to be difficult because much of what we've seen occur through the cost of restructuring to date in flesh and blood we finally saw in black and white in a report issued to Congress. It's going to be a very tough haul. It's going to be a tough argument to make. But I think members of Congress are going to realize that the auto industry has been moving in the direction they wanted and that there will be a viable plan for the future that protects taxpayers as well because they're intrinsically, concomitivly (ph) mutually beneficial.</p><p>GLICK: You know, congressman, we talk a lot about the big three and the impact that it has on Detroit. But here it is. You and I both know, this is a lot more than what's going on in Detroit or in the state of Michigan. It's much grander than that. Walk me through why some kind of plan is so essential.</p><p>MCCOTTER: I think it's important for the prosperity and the security of the United States to have a domestic auto industry and a manufacturing industry. The auto industry is the heart of it. If you look at what's happening, especially in the foreclosure crisis, as Secretary Paulson has admitted, if foreclosures continue to rise, you're going to have a very difficult time stabilizing credit markets. If people who are employed in the auto industry now go into bankruptcy and are potentially losing hundreds of thousands of their homes, they're going to exacerbate the foreclosure crisis and our credit markets won't stabilize and we will remain in the recession, if not find ourselves in a more dire position.</p><p>GLICK: Trevor, let me switch back to you. Your state is the fifth largest auto manufacturer in the country. How much are you watching these bailout hearings, or these rescue plan hearings, and how important do you think it is to support the big three manufacturers?</p><p>HAMILTON: Well, here in Tennessee, as you say, we're the fifth largest auto producing state in the country. And over 160,000 Tennesseeans are employed in that industry. So we are watching the issue very closely.</p><p>And while it's difficult to say how it specifically will impact our community, certainly our state is affected by the big three. And we're hopeful for a full economic recovery of the big three.</p><p>Here in Tennessee, we have a Saturn plant in the Nashville area. And even closer to Chattanooga, less than two hours from here, Ford recently shuttered a plant in Atlanta. And GM is slated to close their facility there as well. So I won't venture to guess what the solution is, but certainly we hope for a full economic recovery of our domestic big three.</p><p>GLICK: Congressman, one of the things that is on the table right now is a discussion that's going on in Washington, D.C., and away from Washington, D.C., and that is the concept of allowing some sort of government sort of sponsored bailout plan where whereby the likes of GM and Chrysler do file Chapter 11 bankruptcy but the government backstops any of the debt thereafter, including the warranties. How do you feel about that?</p><p>MCCOTTER: The auto companies and the UAW and everyone in the Michigan delegation knows that bankruptcy is not an option. What we want to see is a bridge loan to the auto industry that can be repaid over time to the taxpayers with the appropriate interest and, again, with the appropriate taxpayer protection. The ultimate one of which will be a viable plan for the future. We believe that those have been presented and we will be making our case to our colleagues to approve one.</p><p>GLICK: All right. We're going to leave it there. Congressman, thank you very much. And Trevor Hamilton, thank you both very much. I'll be looking forward to much more of this over the next couple of days. Thank you, gentlemen.</p><p>And now let's send it over to Charles.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Alexis.</p><p>Well, you know, banks have seen better days in recent months. But an unlikely company, Microsoft, is showing banks how to attract and keep new customers. And not just any new customers. The company group known as millennials goes between ages of 18 and 30. Bill Hartnett, Microsoft's U.S. industry solutions director of insurance, joins us to discuss the new strategy.</p><p>Bill, you just finished your survey on the banking preferences of this coveted group. Tell us what you found.</p><p>BILL HARTNETT, MICROSOFT FINANCIAL SERVICES: You bet, Charles.</p><p>What we found is a real crisis of confidence and trust that's going on right now. And the group that's most affected by this are the millennials. There are 80 million people in that group. It's a really an amazing group of people and there's a land grab out there for what will be the next generation of high net worth individuals. And we think technology and the use of technology is going to be the key to attracting them.</p><p>PAYNE: Bill, how specifically can Microsoft take this sort of information and help banks to understand this group of folks?</p><p>HARTNETT: Well, one of the things you can do with technology is really change the experience people have of dealing with a financial institution. And if you look at the preferences of that millennial group, most of them use technology in very interesting ways. And we like to say they've been marinading in technology since birth, right? They don't know a world without the PC or the Internet. So they use social networking sites like FaceBook and MySpace. They instant message all the time. In fact, they prefer instant messaging over e-mail. They use wickies (ph) and blogs all the time. When I was growing up, we didn't know what those things were, right?</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>HARTNETT: So if you really want to attract that customer base, and you really want to reach them in a way where they start to build a trust relationship with you, using technology in a way they want to use it will be very key.</p><p>PAYNE: Now even since the Internet boom, we heard about online banking and Internet banking. And it seems like a lot of companies came around, they fell apart. Which banks are now positioned, do you think right now, to take advantage of this?</p><p>HARTNETT: Well, I think it's the banks that don't think like banks, frankly. If you think like a bank or a banker . . .</p><p>PAYNE: Is there one that you can tell -- is there someone . . .</p><p>HARTNETT: There are many. I can give you a great example of a small bank, a regional bank out on the West Coast we've done a lot of work with. Umqua Bank (ph). They have a CEO who is just an amazing guy who focuses on that customer experience and the employee experience, frankly, how does he attract employees into</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>GLICK: The Fox 50 makes up some lost ground, gaining 28 points. Its biggest one day advance since November 24th. Forty-eight of the 50 components were up. The biggest percentage gainers were Sprint, CBS and General Electric. Today, some big tech stocks in the index are in the news. Here now with a closer look is Fox Business contributor Charles Payne and Leo Tilman, president of L.M. Tilman and former chief strategist for Bear Stearns.</p><p>Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for being back.</p><p>PAYNE: Good morning.</p><p>GLICK: Leo, let's start with you. Google out today waving a cautious flag about future investments. Tell me about this.</p><p>LEO TILMAN, L.M. TILMAN PRESIDENT: Not particularly surprising, right? The economy continues to deteriorate. Consumers are in trouble. The housing continues to deteriorate. So Google's not immune to these problems.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, well, you know, Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: Look at this stock price. I mean, I need people to take a look at this because look at how high this stock was. This stock was about $730 at the beginning of the year.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: It's $275, Charles.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, year over year it's down well over 50 percent. And it's absolutely mind boggling. You know, Wall Street was -- Wall Street and Google have always been somewhat at odds. Google wanted to do it their way from an unconventional IPO and since then and you always get the vision of Google as being on one of those typical Silicon Valley -- they've got this skate board ramping guys walking around, you know, brainstorming in the conference room but no real obligations. Wall Street never liked that. They were always really upset with that aspect of the business. You know, it's one thing to be an intelligent company, but . . .</p><p>GLICK: But Wall Street loved the amount of cash that they had sitting on the books. And I would imagine what they didn't like was it looked like it was excess. And the day that a Google comes out and says, we're going to lay off 10 percent of our workforce, then we begin to panic.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, yes. Go ahead.</p><p>TILMAN: And I'm not sure if it's about Wall Street sort of causing this sell-off. I think it's an objective way that advertising revenues are declining.</p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>TILMAN: Consumer spending is declining. So I think it's more of the fundamentals that are affecting Google rather than . . .</p><p>PAYNE: Right. And another point too. The run-up in that stock, every time they announced that they were doing a new initiative, the stock would run up as if they were going to be completely successful in everything they touched, you know. And investors gave them the benefit of the doubt and, of course, they have not been successful in everything they've tried.</p><p>GLICK: OK. There's another big story today. I like this. This is juicy. The former AOL CEO may actually -- Jonathan Miller -- he is apparently talking to a group of private equity investors, some sovereign wealth funds, about perhaps trying to make a bid for all or part of Yahoo!'s business for the tune of perhaps $20 to $22 a share. Leo, what do you make of this?</p><p>TILMAN: Will, I think it's interesting on many different counts. And I'm sure Charles will pitch in. But one of them is that there's a fair amount of private equity in sovereign wealth funds available to step in and buy attractive stocks. And that's a duality. Nobody is lending. That's what we keep hearing. But at the same time, a lot of money is available (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>GLICK: You still think there is money on the sidelines?</p><p>TILMAN: Definitely.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, there's money on the sidelines. But you talk about a group of people that have been burnt. Sovereign wealth guys have been scorched.</p><p>GLICK: I was going to say, they've lost so much.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. And also, a $40 billion deal right now. I haven't seen any sort -- listen, if he's going to get the money from TARP, he's got a better shot, you know.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. This is -- oh, this is -- but it's a fascinating story.</p><p>PAYNE: It is.</p><p>GLICK: All right, guys, we're going to leave it here. You guys are going to come back in just about 10 minutes. We're going to talk more about some important economic numbers coming out.</p><p>PAYNE: OK.</p><p>GLICK: Well, the big three of Detroit, they have made their second bids for a loan. And now it has risen to $34 billion. General Motors is looking for up to $18 billion. Chrysler wants 7. And Ford is looking for $9 billion, although it says it may not need to use the funds. For a glimpse into how congressional leaders are reacting to these survival plans is Republican Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Senator, good morning. Great to see you.</p><p>SEN. ARLEN SPECTER, (D) PENNSYLVANIA: Good morning. Nice to have a chance to talk to you. Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: So, senator, I don't know, I'm a little skeptical here, I've got to be honest with you. I saw the proposals yesterday. They finally did what they needed to do. They cleaned it up a little bit. They brought a proposal. But they asked now for more money. When is enough enough?</p><p>SPECTER: Well, there is good reason to be skeptical. We know that the big three, they haven't performed in the past. They haven't kept up with the times on fuel efficiency and cars that will sell. But we're facing a situation here where the consequences of their going under could be very, very devastating for the entire economy.</p><p>So the issue is, will their plans provide a realistic opportunity for success? And in our free enterprise system, we let the market determine winners and losers. But where you have a situation where there could be a very serious impact on the entire economy, I think we ought to consider the specifics as to what they've proposed.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. I mean my concern, senator, is, look, believe me, I'm worried about the job losses, I'm worried about the industry and the implications it could have for the greater economy. What bothers me about the story is it has not been clearly demonstrated to me what the sustainability is of the industry. And perhaps what we need to consider is, maybe it shouldn't be the big three. I mean maybe it should be the big seven or a combination, you know. I just haven't heard enough of a justification as to how the industry is going to change. We're built for 16 million cars. We're selling 10 million cars. And I imagine that number's not going to get much better over the next couple of years.</p><p>SPECTER: Well, you haven't heard enough justification. And, frankly, neither have I. But I'm prepared to look. That's my pedigree. My job as a senator is to take a look at the specifics as to what they have proposed. I want to see where their efficiencies are. I want to see the economists and the experts in the field make an evaluation which is objective. And then I want to make the determination as to whether there's a realistic chance that they can succeed. Because if we can avoid having them go under and having a lot of people lose their jobs and having the ripple effect go through suppliers and automobile dealers across the economy, that's something what we want to do. But we're not going to do it blindly. Only if they make a solid case.</p><p>GLICK: Great point. A solid case.</p><p>Now, let me ask you, there are two members who are going to be sitting on the panel. I know you had Peter Morici from the University of Maryland sitting on the panel last time. This time you're going to have comptroller Mr. Gene Didarro (ph), who's a Moody's chief economist. Tell me why you're adding these two names to the panel and what you hope to get out of them in addition to talking to the executives.</p><p>SPECTER: Well, the economists have been added to the panel to get some independent evaluation as to what the consequences would be. Look here, when you talk about what's going to happen in the future on the economy, it is very, very hard to judge. And we want to have the best experts we can find to give us some insights. And then there's examination and cross- examination.</p><p>You must watch C-Span occasionally, as well as your own network, and you see the way the senators probe and get more information. And we'll be doing that. It's our judgment. It's not their judgment. We're elected to make these judgments. And that's why I convened a meeting yesterday in Philadelphia, why my staff and I have been pouring over the details of the semicolons (ph) so that when we go back to Washington on Monday, we're in a position to make an informed judgment.</p><p>GLICK: You know, you were speaking of Philadelphia, senator. Tell me, how do the people in Pennsylvania feel about the bailout of the auto industry?</p><p>SPECTER: Well, people in Pennsylvania haven't spoken about the bailout of the auto industry. But let me tell you how they felt about the $700 billion which we legislated all last October. They didn't like it.</p><p>I spent the month of October doing town meetings, which is my practice, to touch all of Pennsylvania's 67 counties. The temperature was 212. They wanted to know why the regulators hadn't done their job. They wanted to know what was going to be done with the $700 billion. And I told them that it was a very bitter decision that I faced and that the others faced because of what we were informed would be the consequences.</p><p>So the issue now to help the big three is something that I'm prepared to do only if they really make, as I said before, the solid case. I know that the public opinion is against the bailouts, but sometimes, in my position, you have to make decisions which may not be the most popular if that really is my judgment or our collective judgment about what is in the public interest.</p><p>GLICK: You know, senator, I am so glad that you brought up the TARP program because there are reports that Treasury Secretary Paulson may go as early as next week to members of Congress to ask for the other $350 billion. If he stands in front of the Senate, what will you tell him if he asks for the money?</p><p>SPECTER: Well, the first thing I will ask him is what he has done with the first $350 billion. We have a problem which was created because of the mortgage situation, defaults on mortgages, and the Treasury Department has done precious little on that subject.</p><p>Then we took a look at the credit freeze, and there were a lot of highly sophisticated fandangos that they were undertaking to try to put money in the banks and nothing has happened there. Before we're going to consider giving him $350 billion more, he is going to have to have some really good explanations as to what he has done with the first $350 billion.</p><p>And I've had a chance to meet with Treasury Secretary Paulson, and very bluntly, I haven't been impressed with what he has had to say.</p><p>GLICK: Finally, before I let you go, in Philadelphia yesterday, in addition to the meetings that you said you had about the auto manufacturers and the plans they laid out, President-elect Obama met with many current governors and former governors about this proposed stimulus plan.</p><p>We are now hearing to the tune of $500 billion, maybe more, how do you feel about it, and do you believe that infrastructure, rebuilding, job creation are essential parts of a fiscal stimulus plan if in fact we have the money to pay for it?</p><p>SPECTER: There's no doubt that our highways and our bridges are crumbling. What I'm going to be looking for are parts of a stimulus plan which are pro-growth. For example, the stimulus package we passed last summer, I had a proposal which had been pending for a long time to authorize expensing or deductibility of 50 percent in the first year of capital advances.</p><p>For example, if a steel company built a big hearth, they had it depreciated 20 years, 5 percent a year, my legislation, which is put into the plan, is able to take 50 percent in the first year. And that's the kind of a pro-growth proposal which sticks to the regs, which is more than giving several hundred dollars to people to spend, which doesn't have any lasting effect.</p><p>It may feel good for a short period of time. So when we talk about highways and bridges and items which will enable us to be pro-growth in the future, those are the proposals which will draw my support.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Well, Senator Specter, great pleasure speaking with you this morning. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us.</p><p>SPECTER: Thank you. I have enjoyed it.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Let's go upstairs to Connell McShane, because, Connell, I know we saw those third-quarter productivity numbers just came out. And a little bit more analysis on those ADP numbers as well.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Yes, we see the productivity at the bottom of your screen has actually been revised higher in the third quarter which is a surprise. The expectation was it would be revised lower. So 1.3 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter compared to the prior quarter. That is an upward revision compared to the first number. And it was expected to be downward.</p><p>So that is a bit of a surprise to the market. The futures have actually come off their lows, for what it is worth, they're down 142, and the Dow futures have been about 20 points more than that there a moment ago.</p><p>So that's the economic data this morning that has just been released. There are your futures. We are going to give you, as we go to break here, two quick stocks to watch in the day ahead, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Merrill Lynch has just come out and significantly cut its fourth- quarter earnings estimates or lack thereof for both Goldman and Morgan.</p><p>Instead of a profit, they are expecting losses of both of these firms. And they've -- the downward revision could affect both of those stocks. Keep an eye on them today. Our panel is going to weigh in on all of the economic numbers, and a FOX Business exclusive, the CEO of Blockbuster coming up, explaining how they are competing in a crowded market. So don't go away. \"Money for Breakfast\" continues here in just a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: All right. As Connell just mentioned, the productivity numbers, the revision to the third quarter just came out. In addition we saw the second announcement of jobs reports this morning coming out of ADP on private sectors, a decline of 250,000. That did exceed estimates. And Q3 productivity was slightly better than anticipated, coming in at 1.3 percent.</p><p>This on the heels of a Challenger Gray &amp; Christmas jobs number that came out earlier this morning that showed a job loss of 181,000 in the month of November. To break down all three of those numbers, Leo Tilman is the former chief strategist for Bear Stearns; Mark Lieberman is our FOX Business senior economist; and our FOX Business contributor Charles Payne is here.</p><p>All right, guys. Mark, you got an opportunity to look at the Q3 productivity number. I know unit labor costs is something you are concerned about. What did you find and how does it look?</p><p>MARK LIEBERMAN, FOX BUSINESS SR. ECONOMIST: Unit labor costs went up 3.1 percent in the final report...</p><p>GLICK: What does that mean?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: It means it is actually the cost of producing each specific item. It is an index that tracks that. It tells us something about where inflation is going and this is obviously tracking what we have seen in other inflation indicators.</p><p>Similarly, as we look at the overall productivity number, a strong productivity gain is probably more important in a good economy because it keeps prices down and it keeps a standard of living up.</p><p>What's happening now is, and it's tracking what we see in the rest of the economy, output is down, we see that from GDP, but employment and jobs are down further. So when you do simple arithmetic...</p><p>GLICK: Workers are becoming more productive.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Exactly.</p><p>GLICK: Charles, what do you make of these numbers? Also the ADP number -- which let's keep in mind, the ADP number saw a loss of 250,000 jobs, there's usually not the best of correlations between the private sector number and the non-farm payrolls that we see from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday. But we've been looking for a loss of 300,000.</p><p>I wonder whether or not those estimates are going to go higher since the private sector number was so depressing.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely. And to that point, ADP numbers always seem to be a lot rosier, if you will, than the Bureau of Labor statistics. So for them to come out with 250,000, you have got to be nervous.</p><p>I mean, if you weren't nervous already, to be quite frank, you are right now. As far as productivity, Alexis, I mean, this is something that was really more important in a different sort of economy where the Fed didn't know if it wanted to lower rates or raise rates and they needed cover. You know, I know Greenspan was able to use that productivity boom to keep rates low, much to everyone's chagrin...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK: Yes, but what we really care about is jobs today.</p><p>PAYNE: At this point, yes. It doesn't seem like it matters.</p><p>GLICK: So, Leo, you have two pieces of data that came out this morning, both worse than anticipated, what do you now think the non-farm payrolls numbers is going to look like on Friday?</p><p>LEO TILMAN, FMR. CHIEF STRATEGIST, BEAR STEARNS: I think it is going to be weak. And all indications point to that. And to that point I think the inflation story is less important today. It is interesting that early in the year we were all concerned about systemic inflation pressures. Then we went into deflation worries. And now I think it's just not an issue for any foreseeable future.</p><p>It is conceivable that down the road the stimuli, the monetary policy are going to reignite inflation, but it is not in any foreseeable future.</p><p>GLICK: Mark?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: I think that's right. I mean, you know, deflation became more and more of a concern. And when you think about it, I mean, what can the Fed do if we were in an inflationary environment? Well, the Fed can raise interest rates. One of the ways you would combat deflation is to reduce interest rates. Well, there's a floor on how far you can go down on deflation. </p><p>GLICK: But if deflation becomes, as some suspect it might, a really big problem, let's just say for the sake of argument over the next six months, I know everybody is talking about inflation longer term being the bigger issue because we're -- the printing presses have not shut down since we arrived on television a year ago, but what if deflation becomes a real issue? How do we address it knowing that real interest rates are actually negative?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: A couple of things are going to work on this. Number one, as income improves, as the economy does recover, and this may shock some of the people who I work with regularly, it will recover. The...</p><p>GLICK: Oh, so that was the rose-colored glasses, the question, Mark...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK: ... which we get like once every three months.</p><p>PAYNE: He has a rose-colored monocle somewhere.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Exactly. No, the economy clearly will recover. It's going to take some time. And what's going to happen at the recovery, there will be pent up demand, and demand is the furor (ph) for deflation. You have to do whatever you can to pump up demand.</p><p>We have to put people back to work. We talk about that ad nauseam. Although it's obviously...</p><p>GLICK: Investments, all that kind of stuff.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: ... investments and things like that. And people -- you know, there's going to be -- if you deprive yourself of that big screen TV, at some point you are going to want to buy it, even though it's not made here.</p><p>TILMAN: On that note, bringing down long-term rates is going to play to that as well. So all the purchases of Treasury securities and agency securities by the Fed are an additional stimulus that should...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK: ... mortgage applications explode. And I understand you say it is only applications, it is not necessarily full refinance activity. But, look, Charles and I have been talking about it, I'm like -- the minute I started seeing rates come down, I'm like, let's get on it. And I think a lot of people across this country are. So hopefully that's one good piece of...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Let's think about that for a second, because what that is saying is that homeowners who are refi-ing -- it is not purchases, it is homeowners who are refi-ing, if they are doing that, why are they doing it? They desperately need cash.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. I'd like a little extra cash. Hey, it is a good thing.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE: Since the National Bureau of Economic Research gave this time stamp to the recession, we have got to give Mark props. Because Mark did call this.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, he did say fourth quarter last year.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: You did call it, yes.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK: Yes, there he is. We love Mark Lieberman, even when he's depressed, we always try to cheer him up though.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: For depression you take a pill. Otherwise for recession...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK: A pill. A cocktail. I was thinking these should be Bloody Mary conversations from now on. What do you think? I mean, we could propose that.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Mimosas, whatever.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. See, look, there he is, mimosas. All right, guys, thank you very much. And I do want to mention by the way that Leo Tilman has a book, and I haven't even mentioned it, it's \"Financial Darwinism.\" This is a very brilliant guy. So you want to pick that up. All right, guys.</p><p>Coming up, we're going to talk to Blockbuster video because they are making some huge changes. The CEO of the movie rental chain is going to be with us in a FOX Business exclusive when we return. They've got some very exciting things up their sleeves that I'm not sure you have heard about. We will talk about that coming up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: Blockbuster the leading brand for video rentals has seen its original business model attacked by technology, but now it's hitting the fast forward button to reinvent itself. The company is teaming up with Microsoft to develop new digital services that will let you watch movies on your phone. And it has entered into a partnership with Live Nation to sell concert tickets. This morning we welcome James Keyes, he's the chairman and CEO of Blockbuster.</p><p>Good to see you.</p><p>JAMES KEYES, CHMN. &amp; CEO, BLOCKBUSTER: Great to be here, thanks.</p><p>GLICK: So you are doing a lot of inventive things because there's always this tug-of-war between Netflix and Blockbuster, each trying to move one step ahead of each other. Tell me about some of these -- this new technological road map, particularly as it relates to cell phones or mobile devices.</p><p>KEYES: Well, mobile devices, eventually portability is going to be king. We all like the convenience of being able to watch content when we want, where we want. And that really is the legacy of Blockbuster. Blockbuster was never really about video rentals. It was always about convenient access to media entertainment.</p><p>So the key is for us to transcend all of the various channels to keep up with technology and to provide our customers with the most convenient access wherever it is, even on your mobile phone.</p><p>GLICK: So I understand you are working on a deal here with Microsoft in terms of how to get the technology and the software so that we can get it on our mobile devices, and one of the things you are doing right now is testing it on kiosks and the ability for us perhaps to travel in an airport and upload it at some point in the future. Where is that going?</p><p>KEYES: Well, the key with the digital technology is that it's a wonderful thing. It allows so much flexibility with content, and yet, it seems that everyone is trying to get content on their big screen TV. Bandwidth in the United States is going to take some time to catch up to this demand because the file size for movies is actually very large.</p><p>So in the interim, in the next five years or 10 years, there are many other ways to deliver digital content. We are trying out some kiosks in stores, for example, so instead of taking an hour, hour-and-a-half to load a movie, you can load it in 30 seconds or 60 seconds right directly onto a portable device and have the convenience and flexibility of digital content in a portable fashion.</p><p>GLICK: You know, there are a lot of people who look at the video game industry, as I said to you yesterday, I spoke to an executive at Xbox, and I know they have a relationship with Netflix, but they look at that industry as a place which is experiencing unusual growth in a very difficult economy, and they are experiencing it year-over-year.</p><p>What kind of things are you trying to do perhaps to maybe address that audience, that demo which is a tremendous demo by doing partnerships like what Netflix and Xbox are doing together?</p><p>KEYES: We are -- again, it is very early, the idea of digital content directly to the home through game consoles or set-top boxes, very, very early in its development. Yes, we just released just a week ago a deal with a company called 2Wire, that's a large provider of these boxes and this technology to deliver content directly to the television, so now you can get Blockbuster on demand.</p><p>We have several thousand movies, new releases available from the ease of pulling up video-on-demand from your couch. And this is just another step. Again, very early.</p><p>GLICK: So who will sell those boxes? I mean, if 2Wire is a company that makes them, like, would I be able to get them on my set-top cable box? I mean, where will I see that come to me, the consumer?</p><p>KEYES: Today you can actually buy Blockbuster on demand online at blockbuster.com. We are selling it in a few stores just trying to test the consumer demand. That's really our objective right now. It is very early in the developmental stage.</p><p>But eventually you will find that this capability is baked not only into your cable box, but directly into your television set. In fact, we announced a deal with Intel not too long ago where their new chip for their Internet-ready television set in the next couple of years will include a widget that allows you to pull up the Blockbuster icon right there on your television set and have immediate access to all of your favorite movies.</p><p>GLICK: OK. So let's just take that example and let's just assume that for the sake of argument you live here in a place like New York City, you have Time Warner Cable. So I have Time Warner Cable and I have now just purchased this Internet television. Time Warner offers pay-per-view events, on demand events, how is it that I'm going to go to you as opposed to going to my cable operator who has been wired into my home?</p><p>KEYES: Well, today Blockbuster really owns that entertainment customer, particularly the customer for movies. And so our job is to make it a nice smooth transition for that customer to move over to these other services. And that's why we're leading now with Blockbuster on demand.</p><p>Eventually the cable companies will want to offer their customers various services. We will all have unique content. We will all have proprietary and exclusive content, and that will keep Blockbuster, the brand, relevant for the consumer.</p><p>GLICK: You know, one of the things I said yesterday to this executive at Xbox is I said, listen, you know, when we're on that console and they show the list of Netflix movies, they tend to be outdated, frankly. They're not the kind of movies, I'm sorry to say, that I want to see in today's world.</p><p>How do you make sure that you are delivering the newest, most credible content on any device right now so that it makes me want to do it? And if iPhone is doing something similar, why would I go with one of the devices that you have in a relationship with Microsoft as opposed to everybody carrying around that iPhone or that iPod?</p><p>KEYES: Well, first of all, you won't have that problem with Blockbuster. People have come to know and trust Blockbuster for the newest releases, the latest releases. Our Blockbuster on demand will have new releases. It is very different from the Netflix offering, as an example, which is a unique product, a very good product, but it is a subscription product.</p><p>And by nature, subscription content delivered digitally will be a little bit older content. It will be more in the pay TV window or two or three years older on average than the new releases that you can find available on Blockbuster.</p><p>So this is an opportunity for us. And as we go forward, our key competitive advantage will be to make it easy, convenient for the customer, and to have the best content available, the newest releases, exclusive content only available at Blockbuster. </p><p>GLICK: All right. James Keyes, sounds terrific. Come back, join us again, particularly as you put some of these plans in place. I want to see some of these devices and learn a little bit more about it.</p><p>KEYES: Well, thanks, great to be here.</p><p>GLICK: Great to have you.</p><p>All right, guys. We will be right back in just a moment with the \"1 Thing You Should Know.\" Unfortunately, the one thing you should know right now is the market is pretty much at the low of the day. We are down 140 -- 156 points right now. The S&amp;P down 2 percent, the Nasdaq down 2.25 percent. Some of this of course on the heels of those jobs numbers this morning. We will be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>GLICK: All right. Now it is time for the \"1 Thing You Should Know. We get started with Ashley Webster in London.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know what, Alexis? I was looking at all this miserable news that's coming about in the U.K. and the Eurozone, I thought, well, I will do this story. It's kind of interesting.</p><p>But there is quite a lot of snow around the U.K. and there's some blizzards forecast for tonight in the northern part of the country. So that means the odds of it snowing in London on Christmas Day now down to 11 to 4. It was 7 to 1.</p><p>You know, we bet on anything in the U.K. The odds are now down that a snow flake will fall on the London weather center on Christmas Day is now down to 11 to 4. I may take that bet.</p><p>GLICK: Wow, yes. Wouldn't it be great to have a white Christmas? We don't have enough white Christmases, at least here in New York. I'm sure for you in California it rarely ever happens. When you were growing up, did they do -- like I heard some families would bring in like the fake snow?</p><p>JENNA LEE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Oh, they do that, yes, absolutely. They will have like places that the kids can sled, but it will be sunny. So it never really felt like Christmas. It was always sunny.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, but now you are here.</p><p>LEE: Now I can freeze and feel...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK: OK. So what's your \"1 Thing\"?</p><p>LEE: You know, we (INAUDIBLE) talk so much about mortgage applications and refinances being way up. And I think that after the program that was announced last week, that can't be a bad sign. And we have to take it in relative terms from the weeks before, but it can't be a bad thing.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, I like that. I actually think it is a good sign. I understand Lieberman is like, Alexis, it is only applications, but you know what? The fact that we can make homeownership more affordable or that we'll go out and refinance, personally I'm hoping to take advantage of it.</p><p>PAYNE: I think it is fantastic. My \"1 Thing\" though is, by the way, I think automakers, the CEOs should go on horseback to Capitol Hill.</p><p>GLICK: Maybe they should do the Clydesdales.</p><p>PAYNE: They should ride horses because, you know what, you bring back the thought of Paul Revere and how important it is for America. And also you suggest to America, you don't bail us out, everybody is going to be riding one of these.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, that's a great point. What about that \"made in America.\" You know, we need to like be excited about \"made in America\" again. We need to work on them. Give them some tips.</p><p>All right, guys. We are going to go to commercial break. We are going to come back. We are going to have \"The Opening Bell\" coming up next. We are going to talk to a top executive in the power and energy world who can talk to us a little bit about all of this electricity grid, infrastructure building, some of the things that we have been talking about in terms of fiscal stimulus.</p><p>Stay with us. \"The Opening Bell\" is next. Thanks, guys.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2008 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

And in Germany the DAX 30 index also off close to two percent now.</p><p>Talking of Germany, shares in a big German semiconductor company are short circuiting this morning; Infineon, reporting its seventh straight quarterly loss. The company says the fourth quarter loss came in at a whopping $970 million more than expected. The company blaming weakness in the sector, restructuring costs and write-downs associated with its stake in chipmaker Qimonda, Infineon's stock now down 25 percent.</p><p>Sacre bleu, Warren Buffett is facing a fight now with a French utility. Electricity de France is making a $4.5 billion bid for 50 percent of Constellation Energy's nuclear assets now Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway already made a $4.7 billion bid for this company for all of the company; it is a U.S. power company. Shareholders will vote on Buffett's offer later this month. But EBS says it undervalues Constellations true worth, it is a battle royale no doubt.</p><p>Let's go to Connell McShane for today's three market movers. Good morning, Connell.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Good morning Ashley.</p><p>The Blackberry maker Research in Motion making a list this morning cutting its third quarter forecast. The company saying earnings per share are going to come in somewhere between 81 and 83 cents. The problem with that is that Wall Street is looking for 91 cents. So RIM saying a stronger dollar as well as the general economic slowdown have hurt its business and had hurt its stock plunging more than 67 percent so far this year.</p><p>Google is bracing for very difficult times. The Internet search engine giant is cutting back spending and cutting back on projects; a lot of the perks that go into being an employee at Google are apparently going by the wayside. So we'll keep an eye on Google stock down from the 700s into the 275 range on that stock here over the last year or so.</p><p>Now, we do have some breaking news this morning that we want to bring to you on mortgage applications. We don't always give you this number as it comes out but it is just being released now and what a gain in mortgage applications as mortgage rates come down.</p><p>In fact, according to the Mortgage Banker's Association, this is the biggest gain they have ever seen, in record. It is just in this morning. An increase has been reported in refinancing activity; that is a very, very big increase. Overall we're talking about re-fi's being up percentage terms at least by 200 percent here over the same -- over the last week and the overall market index increasing 112 percent according to the MBA which is just out with these numbers.</p><p>Again, it's their largest rise on record Alexis, the mortgage applications with the drop we've seen in mortgage rates apparently more people going out and refinancing their mortgages and getting new mortgages all together. So that's an interesting stat that's just in.</p><p>Those are the three market movers and it's back over to you in the studio.</p><p>GLICK: All right, I love that stat. I'm trying to refinance my mortgage too, Connell, just not getting the phone call back.</p><p>MCSHANE: Get in there.</p><p>GLICK: But we'll talk about that later.</p><p>All right, Detroit's big three automakers presented recovery plans to Congress late yesterday, and the pitch has become more dramatic as General Motors and Chrysler now say they are on the verge of a collapse by month's end unless they get the money from the government they need right now.</p><p>For more on what the plans say, Fox Business's Rich Edson joins us this morning from Washington, D.C. with more of the details. Good morning Rich.</p><p>RICH EDSON, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hi good morning, Alexis. When these guys were up on Capitol Hill a couple of weeks ago and they were asking for $25 billion, it wasn't all that convincing that $25 billion was all that they needed especially when Congressmen were asking them to basically add up and individually separate how much they would need out of that $25 billion.</p><p>Two car companies went first and when the third went, they really couldn't answer to bring to that $25 billion number. Eventually they got there. And then they said ok we do need only 25 billion. But today that number has been just blown out of the water; $34 billion is potentially what these guys say they are going to need over the next year from the federal government.</p><p>The biggest coming from GM, $18 billion they say they are going to need at least $12 billion to operate next year, $4 billion immediately of that $12 billion, and if the economy gets worse, they say they are going to need an extra $6 billion. That goes to $18 billion for next year.</p><p>Ford is asking for $9 billion. Though it says it does not need it right away, it would like a $9 billion line of credit from the government.</p><p>And Chrysler is saying that it wants $7 billion in loans from the federal government.</p><p>So the proposals are in. They are on Capitol Hill. And one analyst said it's time to get to legislative work. Here's what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEAN WEST, GROUP ANALYST: The last round was a nice bit of political theater. The Democrats got that out of the way. They don't look like they are soft on automakers anymore. They played tough. They wouldn't have continued to keep the session open if they weren't planning on actually funding something.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON: All right, here the concessions all three CEOs say they will take only a dollar in compensation if they get the loans. Chrysler is talking about an electric drive model in 2010. Ford says its 2015 fleet will be 36 percent more efficient than the models it offered in 2005. GM is giving corporate jets, they're giving them up. Ford is selling its jets and they are all driving to Washington, D.C. this time around; big difference from last time.</p><p>They're asking for billions of dollars, and they're also offering warrants in exchange for those billions. As far as the differences are concerned, Ford says it can turn a profit by 2011 or at least break even by that year. Chrysler is in merger talks. That really separates them. They are still looking for a partner.</p><p>And GM will focus its U.S. branding to Chevy, Buick, GMC and Cadillac. Pontiac is going to stay more of a niche brand. Rick Wagoner says GM is looking hard at all its other names and they can possibly contract them.</p><p>But Alexis as you know, when GM got rid of Oldsmobile a couple of years ago, it was a lengthy process, it was an expensive process. It cost them more than a million bucks, a billion bucks excuse me, back to you.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, I was going to say, it was a little bit more than that. All right, Rich Edson thank you so much, for bringing us up to date on all of that because wow it is complicated.</p><p>Well, as lawmakers debate that total of $34 billion that Rich Edson just talked about, automakers say they need the money to speed up production of new energy saving vehicles.</p><p>Now, based on yesterday's sales figures, no one is buying their current crop of cars. Get this, Chrysler sales were down 47 percent. GM was down 41. Ford down 31. Now, if GM survives it is betting big on the Volt, an electric car that has been rushed into production and will hit show rooms ideally within 18 months.</p><p>Here to discuss if the $40,000 Volt can save GM is Michael Duoba, he is the mechanical engineer at the Center for Transportation Research Energy Systems Division. And John Grisma is the chief insights officer for Young and Rubican Brands. He is also the author of \"The Brand Bubble: The looming crisis in brand value and how to avoid it.\"</p><p>Welcome, gentlemen, thanks for being here.</p><p>MICHAEL DUOBA, CENTER FOR TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH: Thanks, Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: Michael, let me start with you. GM has been talking about this Volt. In fact the vice chairman sort of staked his career on it. He's been incredibly well known in the industry for the kind of cars he's developed. What do you make of whether or not GM could be successful with this car?</p><p>DUOBA: Well, I think that the Chevy Volt is a pretty exciting car. I think Bob Lutz is kind of the John F. Kennedy saying that he's going to go to the moon and end of the decade. And I think GM is kind of staking their brand on taking this car to the next level and perhaps dethroning the Prius as being the ultimate environmental car.</p><p>GLICK: John, there's some big differences between how people look at a car like the Toyota Prius and how they're trying to market this GM's Volt car here. Tell me what the differences are and why this is so important in their ability to sell this car.</p><p>JOHN GRISMA, CHIEF INSIGHTS OFFICER FOR YOUNG AND RUBICAN BRANDS: Absolutely. I think first and most importantly you have to look at GM is looking at this strategy clearly to improve its overall corporate image. And if you look back at some of the studies we've got actually seen there was a halo effect on the Toyota Prius meaning that there was actually moving across the board. You saw the SUVs and the trucks actually improving their perceptions of fuel efficiency just on the basis of having this one product in the line.</p><p>So clearly that's important from a perspective. But I think we have to slow down a little bit and really focus on what is the essence of this car? Will it really make an impact in the marketplace?</p><p>I think you've got to look at the fact that it is essentially they are talking 10,000 cars in what 2011. You're talking $30,000 at a price point a lot of questions it just loses with consumers.</p><p>GLICK: Yes and right now the price tag we're hearing is more like $40,000 but there's some vagary around it because it's still a long ways away.</p><p>But John, part of the issue here, you are a brand expert, and you've been watching what's been happening to the quality and the franchise behind the GM name. What has been happening and why is that contributing sort to the lack of, I guess, belief that this company can turn the story around?</p><p>GRISMA: You know, one of the things we wrote about in our book was the concept that consumers are actually acting more and more like shareholders, like investors. They are actually looking into the future for their expectations of brands.</p><p>And when we look at GM in the context of brand asset value which is our consumer brand database we have seen decline in trust, decline in differentiation, a decline in sort of perceived quality. This isn't necessarily fair because they are making some great products and the critics have actually -- the car critic really praised recent brands like the Cadillac, GTS, as well as the Saturn Aura.</p><p>So in that context I think what GM is trying to do is clearly get on board with green. I think all the big three automakers were behind a little bit in this in the 90s. They're trying to practice the sense of humility as well as sustainability. I mean I think if also if you step back and you look at GM, they pulled out of the Super Bowl this year, a very high- profile venue, $three million for a 30 second spot. They have ended their relationship with Tiger Woods which was a long time spokesperson. So I think they're trying to kind of be a little bit less flashy, a little bit more demure and try to get aligned with the administration's priorities.</p><p>GLICK: Michael, when you talk about the quality of this car or what it might do to turn GM's business around, they are sort of staking their future on it, who is going to buy this car?</p><p>DOUBA: That's a very good question. And I think that anyone can buy the car if you have a place to plug in. So there is a concern about the infrastructure involved you have to plug the car in every night as you would plug in your cell phone. So it is kind of a new paradigm of what we do with our car and how we use it.</p><p>But I think you know people who live in the suburbs who can drive enough miles to displace all the fuel that the vehicle promises to displace can buy the car.</p><p>GLICK: And are you concerned at all Michael about the price point? I mean I know we're looking out a couple of years from now, but on the other hand, you know, they are kind of staking their future on it, so it is kind of important.</p><p>DUOBA: Yes, I mean the price is -- it might be a little bit out of the reach of the average buyer, but it's -- they're not going to make money -- GM's is not going to make money on this product, so it is matter of just having enough, enough sales that they can show it's a strong product.</p><p>GLICK: John, what do you think?</p><p>GRISMA: I think that's the real key issue. I think you have to look at the infrastructure issues. You're talking about a $30,000 car. You're talking about perhaps urban environments because it's got a 40 miles range. How do you set up the infrastructure to basically plug in cars? How do you deal with that in New York? How do you deal with that in Boston?</p><p>Now, I think that these technologies will follow this car and it is an exciting thing but I think GM has to step back and think this isn't necessarily the one single silver bullet. They were successful in the past with the Corvette but let's look at this in the long-term plans for what they are going to do to roll out more sustainable vehicles.</p><p>GLICK: The one thing that you mentioned earlier is you said humility and sustainability. I presume that the combination of those two things is what they need to demonstrate to Congress later this week that they have both of those things.</p><p>You mentioned pulling back from the Super Bowl and a couple other moves that they've made but how do they bring about sustainability if they've now come to the well and said we need an additional $6 billion this after just testifying two weeks ago?</p><p>GRISMA: Yes, I mean first of all you've seen them out of their corporate jets and into their hybrids going to Capitol Hill. But I also think it's important to really look at how do they align with the administration's priorities? How do they align now with the Uber shareholders which is the taxpayers right? If GM is dealing with taxpayer money?</p><p>So I think in that context, what they have to do is prove their long-term sustainability, their ability to actually get in line with where Americans want to go, lessen their dependence on foreign oil and focus on really marketing this car in the context of where GM and Ford and Chrysler where are they're going in the future.</p><p>GLICK: It's interesting because we're going to talk to one of the top executives at Anheuser-Busch this morning and there used to be a concept here called made in America and we used to be excited about that and somehow we've got to turn this philosophy around because we're not very excited about it right now when it concerns the automakers.</p><p>All right, John and Michael, thank you guys so much. I appreciate it.</p><p>All right, coming up the newly formed Anheuser-Busch Inbev brought the largest European and American brewers together. After the break we're going to have an exclusive interview with the president of the Anheuser- Busch division to talk about the transition.</p><p>And then for all you Victoria's Secret lovers out there, Victoria's Secret angels are hitting the runway to revive sales this holiday season. We're going to have another exclusive interview with their CEO in just a little bit. You won't want to miss it. I promise.</p><p>GLICK: Newly formed Anheuser-Busch Inbev brought the largest European and American brewers together. Here to talk about the transition and the future of the famous Anheuser-Busch Clydesdale Horses, Anheuser-Busch President, David Peacock joins us now in a Fox Business Exclusive.</p><p>Good morning, great to see you.</p><p>DAVID PEACOCK, ANHEUSER-BUSCH PRESIDENT: Good to see you again Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: It is the first time that I'm talking to you live in person.</p><p>PEACOCK: That's right.</p><p>GLICK: Since the deal, walk me through, how has the transition been?</p><p>PEACOCK: It's been good. You know I tell you, we've been very impressed with the people from Inbev. And I think there's a lot of commonality on how we approach the business and just how we work. And I've got to say it's been a very collaborative effort.</p><p>GLICK: And I said to you when you walked in, I imagine that this has required a lot of traveling, a lot of getting to know each other and also a lot of calming people's fears because the transition, a change of this magnitude is pretty big for one of the largest independent private companies -- I mean public but owned by a family.</p><p>PEACOCK: Right.</p><p>GLICK: What has that been like addressing their concerns?</p><p>PEACOCK: I think you just have to be honest with people and be up front and just make sure they understand that the best interests of the organization are always top of mind. And that we are committed to treating everybody with great respect. And the organization, our performance has been great so I give them the big thumbs up on the effort that they have shown during all these uncertainty.</p><p>GLICK: Anheuser-Busch obviously is an iconic brand and a lot of people were concerned about the concept that an iconic brand going to a European company. How will the brand change or will we not see a lot of changes at least here in the United States?</p><p>PEACOCK: I think the things that work and the things that matter won't change. You know the heirs of our company will never change, the brand Budweiser is such a part of our company. And saw it when you came to see us, we don't have Anheuser-Busch on the top of our building, we have Budweiser. And that's what people buy and that's what people believe in. And that's what not going to change.</p><p>And the Clydesdales, the book you're holding, the Clydesdales aren't going to change. They are going to continue to graze in the pastures in mid- Missouri where their new farm is where we moved them a couple weeks ago. And they are going to be continued to be housed on the campus.</p><p>GLICK: We just showed a copy of this, and I have it in my hand it's called \"The Great American Tradition.\" As a matter of fact, when I went down to St. Louis to visit you guys, I was there for the 75th anniversary of the Clydesdales.</p><p>PEACOCK: Right.</p><p>GLICK: And what's the meaning behind this? Tell people about this. This is part of the tradition of the company.</p><p>PEACOCK: The story was back in when prohibition was repealed 1933, August Busch Jr. wanted to show his father some respect and commemorate the moment. And they offered an eight horse hitch to deliver the first beer to the governor Al Smith, I think governor or mayor of New York and then FDR in Washington, D.C.</p><p>And they've just been a part of our heritage ever since then. And they represent strength, power, quality, beauty, all the great things that we think are synonymous with America and are synonymous with our brand Budweiser.</p><p>GLICK: One of the things that's also synonymous with your brand is huge advertising in the Super Bowl. And you are going ahead with some huge spots. Tell me a little bit about that, and why you've continued along with the investment because as you and I both know Inbev is known for cost- cutting.</p><p>PEACOCK: Yes, but it is a knock they don't deserve. I mean, if you look at their third quarter, they actually had an increase in marketing and selling up about 12 percent. So they will invest behind brands. We're going to have actually nine commercials in the Super Bowl this year, and about half of them will be dedicated to the Clydesdales.</p><p>And we've got some really nice spots on the horizon and one I think especially that just wrapped up last week that I think could be the winner hopefully.</p><p>GLICK: Oh, I like that.</p><p>Now, one of the things you guys have done is you've always invested a lot in sports, sports across the globe.</p><p>PEACOCK: Right.</p><p>GLICK: And had some huge partnerships with some of the biggest sports in the industry. Will you continue to have those partnerships? Will you, you know, readdress them? You know, where does that stand?</p><p>PEACOCK: Sports is a big part of our DNA. Last night we had an event where we invited a lot of the New York media and sports community in for a happy hour and told all those folks from ESPN and the different teams, we're still there. We are still a big part of what you do, and you are still a big part of reaching our consumers in the proper way.</p><p>GLICK: Let's talk a little bit about financials because the stock has been very turbulent, and it's been a difficult economy. One of the things I said to you in the very beginning that I didn't realize about the deal and I was pretty much in the know about this I didn't necessarily understand that there was a six-month bridge loan that Inbev used which was part of financing this deal.</p><p>PEACOCK: Right.</p><p>GLICK: They have now announced this they are going to go -- that they are going to go out there through a rights offering and raise funds in the marketplace. It really hurt the stock. First day it was announced, the stock was down 13 percent. Why are you doing this and what do you want shareholders to know?</p><p>PEACOCK: I think most important is the intrinsic value of the deal is still there. It is a tough market, but combining these two great companies and the growth opportunities and the expansion of the brand Budweiser, which is a big part of this globally still have merit. And I think at the end of the day, from what we have seen, if you've got a combination that makes sense, and there's opportunity for growth, you're going to see the financials fall into place.</p><p>So we're not too worried about what we have seen out in the marketplace. It's like anything else, when you have a good idea and two companies should come together, then I think at the end of the day the financial community and the markets will respond positively.</p><p>GLICK: Even though it is dilutive to shareholders right now because this rights offerings is going to be in existence now for a two-week period, over the long haul you think you will make up for it with growth and opportunities?</p><p>PEACOCK: Yes, the synergies we talked about are still there. We still have visibility to them. All the reasons why it made sense for these companies to come together are still there.</p><p>GLICK: you and I have talked in the past about beverage sales here in the United States. And the numbers have been very small increases, low single digit percentage gains, but that there are tremendous opportunities still in emerging economies. How much of those opportunities have changed because we are now in a much more difficult global environment, or will you still look to get more penetration?</p><p>PEACOCK: Oh, definitely. I think brand Budweiser has a lot of opportunity in the emerging markets. The beer industry so far in the U.S. has been very good. It probably will come in just under one percent growth which for us is good, and it is very resilient in this kind of time.</p><p>Recessions are short-term. This is a long-term deal. We are going to be in business a long time. We have been in business a long time. And I think that's the long-term view we are going to continue to take.</p><p>GLICK: One last question, China. China has said you guys have a big stake in a Chinese brewer as does Inbev. They have capped the stake. They have said no more acquisitions of any other brewers in China, no percentage stakes. What does that mean to your business model, are you concerned about that?</p><p>PEACOCK: No, I think we have got a very good model in China, and we have really created the premium segment with Budweiser years ago. And recently just this year we rolled out to over 100 markets where we hadn't sold before.</p><p>What's interesting about China is you have constant geographic expansion opportunities because it's just so vast. And it is amazing to me still when you can see a city in China that may be 20th in size and there's still six million people, and you may not have even really penetrated that market. So we have a lot of growth opportunities there and in combining the two companies that we've got now with some of the brands like Harbin and some of the brands that Inbev has.</p><p>GLICK: The book is \"The Great American Tradition: the 75th anniversary of the Budweiser Clydesdales.\" It is a good gift for the family. I like it.</p><p>PEACOCK: I was going to say I gave you a horse shoe the last time I saw you. This time you get you a book. Boys around Clydesdales.</p><p>GLICK: So this time I get a book. I love that horse shoe. David Peacock as always so great seeing you. Congratulations and best of luck happy holidays.</p><p>PEACOCK: Thank you. You too.</p><p>GLICK: We're going to take a quick break and we'll right back with much more \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST\" including Victoria's Secret, the ladies on the runway, you won't want to miss this coming up in just a moment.</p><p>LEE: Welcome back everyone to \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.\" I am Jenna Lee and here's this morning's top news stories.</p><p>We're going to begin with a look at President elect Barack Obama's up coming cabinet. Fox News confirming that Mr. Obama will name New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson as his commerce secretary today. You might remember that just a few weeks ago the governor's name was also tossed out for potentially the secretary of state position. That didn't happen of course. But Richardson has a long history in Washington serving as energy secretary under President Clinton. He was also the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.</p><p>Secretary of state Condoleezza Rice arriving in New Delhi, India today one of her last trips abroad as the top U.S. diplomat. Rice is in India to urge a fast response to the Mumbai attacks and to ease tensions between India and neighboring Pakistan. Rice also saying that officials in Islamabad need to cooperate with India's request.</p><p>You are up-to-date on the Fox Business Network. Much more ahead. The latest report on job cut activity. And Victoria's Secret, can't beat that. We will be right back.</p><p>GLICK: Welcome back to \"MONEY FOR BREAKFAST.\" I'm Alexis Glick.</p><p>We are waiting for the Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas jobs report. It is due out in just about ten seconds. We will also get the ADP private sector job report. That number comes out in just about 45 minutes.</p><p>Let's go upstairs to the Fox Business Desk to Connell McShane to see if we can get the Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas numbers.</p><p>MCSHANE: Yes, we have them, Alexis, and the layoffs are going up. No surprise there. Actually the highest since back in 2002. Up 46 percent from the same time a year ago.</p><p>Layoff announcements for the month of November, according to Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas coming in at more than 181,000. Want to be exact, 181,671. That's the most number of layoffs, the highest number of layoffs monthly since January of 2002. We're up in the 250 range there.</p><p>And it is up from the same time -- from a month ago by almost -- by more than 60 percent, and from a year ago by 46 percent. A couple of notable factors here. Number one, year to date this brings the number of layoffs according to this particular metric above a million.</p><p>It's a million and 57,000 give or take, it was 875,000, you added that on, you're over a million now year-to-date in layoffs.</p><p>What's leading the way? Well, again, no surprise. Financial and retail sectors are really leading the way when we come to -- to job cuts there. Year to date in the financial sector, you're talking about 220,000 plus layoffs, 21 percent of the total so far this year.</p><p>So the financial sector is really getting hit hard. We have the Citigroup plan that was announced in this month with the 50,000 employees being let go.</p><p>So a quick recap for you, Alexis, layoffs, according to the firm -- the outplacement firm, Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, are going up, 46 percent above the level they were at a year ago, above 181,000 and above a million so far this year.</p><p>It's back to you in the studios.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Not the best of news. Connell, thank you so much.</p><p>Well, let's get the latest and break down the numbers on this jobs number and ask our guests here to break it down and see what they think about it.</p><p>Mark Lieberman is our FOX Business senior economist, FOX Business contributor Charles Payne, and Leo Tilman is the former chief strategist for Bear Stearns.</p><p>Leo, I'll start with you. I would assume no great surprise here, but the trend is not our friend.</p><p>LEO TILMAN, L.M. TILMAN PRESIDENT: Absolutely, Alexis. And I think the employment numbers today are the most important ones of all because we're still trying to ascertain to which extent this credit crisis continues to hurt the economy and obviously it is, and it means that the bailout is not working fast enough.</p><p>GLICK: Charles?</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, yes -- you know, listen, I agree with that, and I also think this whole thing underscores the notion that perhaps we need to give corporate America lower taxes, you know, much lower tax rate.</p><p>GLICK: You're here.</p><p>PAYNE: I know that -- you know that President Obama is against that, and, you know, the whole mandate was sticking to the corporations and the rich, but you know what, at this point, you know, they're getting their just desserts, you know, you can call it karma, whatever you want.</p><p>The bottom line is when you see these types of numbers and at the end of the day, if it takes jobs -- and I think Mark will agree with me -- it takes jobs to turn this economy around. One of the good things is to incentivize corporations or even make it possible for them to do some hiring in this environment.</p><p>MARK LIEBERMAN, FOX BUSINESS SENIOR ECONOMIST: Charles, I agree with you in part. Yes, we have to incent corporations to do something but just to say across the board tax cut doesn't necessarily do it.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, no. We got...</p><p>LIEBERMAN: If you're talking ...</p><p>GLICK: ... strings attached.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: If you're talking about job tax credits or something for job creation, that's a better plan than just saying we've got to reduce corporate tax rates. Just to say that doesn't necessarily put more...</p><p>PAYNE: No, you know what it is, though, Mark? Put strings attached to it, it's like...</p><p>LIEBERMAN: It is not a question of putting strings. It's a question of -- use a tax code to incentivize a particular type of behavior.</p><p>PAYNE: Like for instance, you'll -- we'll give you a tax break but the jobs have to be in -- you know, in North Dakota.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Something like that. Yes.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, I mean, but you see, my concern, Charles, if is we -- like Mark said, if we did -- we're totally getting off...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK: But let me -- I was just going to say...</p><p>PAYNE: But it does circle back to jobs, though.</p><p>GLICK: Well, what -- to me, what I worry about, though, is if you give a blanket cut without some kind of strings attached that we have the same thing that we got with this TARP program, which is you're giving all this money to these banks, there were zero strings attached and now they're not doing anything to make lending any better.</p><p>They are not necessarily doing anything to really increase or improve the foreclosure situation and I think that's why, frankly, when Treasury Secretary Paulson goes there next week and ask the other 350, I don't think they're going to give it to him.</p><p>But that's a whole other topic.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Yes, let's go back to these job numbers if we -- this Challenger announcement and put it into context. It is scary when you look at a number like 181,000 and huge increases year to date and huge increases year over year.</p><p>This is the first time that full year announcements have topped a million in -- since 2000 -- by November in 2003, but A, these are just announcements. They may not be followed through. Employment is a lagging indicator in any economic situation.</p><p>GLICK: Everybody says to me employment is a lagging indicator, but who on this planet doesn't think that employment is going to get worse?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: It will get worse. It will get worse because the economy is continuing to deteriorate. It's -- we saw the corporate profits report in the last week when we got -- a couple weeks ago when we got GDP numbers. That showed corporate profits declining and the response to that is to trim expenses.</p><p>GLICK: OK. Guys, I hate to do this, I'm sorry, but we're going to have to wrap it up right now. You guys are going to come back for the ADP.</p><p>I'm sorry, Leo, I didn't get a chance to talk to you more about it just because we have somebody standing by. So we're going to come back to those ADP, as I said, the private sector numbers, in just a moment.</p><p>But President elect Barack Obama met with governors from across the country yesterday in Philadelphia. They were tackling state's growing financial and economic problems. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA (D), PRESIDENT ELECT: To solve this crisis and to ease the burden on our states, we're going to need action and we're going to need actions swiftly. We intend to help save or create 2.5 million jobs. We intend to put tax cuts into the pockets of hard-pressed middle class families in your states. And we are not, as a nation, going to be able to just keep on printing money.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GLICK: Now the country's mayors are turning to the president elect for help, too. The U.S. conference of mayors has released a list of more than 4600 infrastructure projects that would add more than 261,000 jobs in 154 cities.</p><p>Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter met with the president elect yesterday and he joins us this morning.</p><p>Good morning, Mayor.</p><p>MAYOR MICHAEL NUTTER (D), PHILADELPHIA: Good morning, Alexis. How are you?</p><p>GLICK: Great, good to see you.</p><p>NUTTER: Good.</p><p>GLICK: Well, you spoke yesterday...</p><p>NUTTER: Always good to be with you.</p><p>GLICK: Well, thanks for being here. You spoke yesterday, as I mentioned, to President-elect Obama. What was on the agenda?</p><p>NUTTER: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: What did you guys discuss?</p><p>NUTTER: We discussed three things after, again, congratulating him and he thanked us for the great electoral victory here in Philadelphia, talked about infrastructure, talked about mortgage foreclosure, and talked about pension systems.</p><p>All three key issues and certainly I'm very supportive of Mayor Manny Diaz, our great president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the larger agenda that was put out, but we need access to credit markets for borrowing purposes, and that's all I wanted to talk with president-elect about.</p><p>Our pension systems are all taking massive losses because of a third to a half loss in the overall stock market. Access to capital, to borrow for infrastructure projects, which is a big topic of conversation between the president-elect and the governors yesterday, and then the mortgage foreclosure crisis.</p><p>You mentioned in the earlier segment that the financial institutions and the banks have been helped tremendously by treasury. But they are doing virtually nothing to help homeowners on the ground stay in their homes. Banks don't want to own houses. They want to service mortgages.</p><p>We have a unique program, our Mortgage Foreclosure Reduction Program here in Philadelphia. We'd like to see that replicated across the country to keep people in their homes and stabilize neighborhoods.</p><p>So those were a few of the things that I talked to the president-elect about yesterday. It was a very good conversation.</p><p>GLICK: You know, I don't know about your mortgage foreclosure reduction plan. Can you tell me about it, Mayor, because a lot of people are talking about...</p><p>NUTTER: Sure.</p><p>GLICK: ... what FDIC chair Sheila Bair is doing particularly with Indymac, but -- but how is your plan different?</p><p>NUTTER: Yes. Our plan is different -- earlier this year through a tremendously cooperative effort between our court system, our judges, the legal community, as well as the banking industry, we first put a hold on -- a moratorium on mortgage foreclosures in Philadelphia for three to four months, just stopped them dead cold, and then brought the homeowners, the bankers, legal team together and the courts and the sheriff to create reconciliation conferences so that we can sit down with these homeowners and figure out how to restructure their payments so they can stay in their home.</p><p>We have saved hundreds of people from foreclosure and literally possibly being thrown out on the streets, and it's -- the program has worked very well. We have a hotline, outreach workers, literally people out on the street knocking on doors in targeted neighborhoods throughout Philadelphia to get people to the help they need, did PSAs for this effort.</p><p>It's worked very, very well. And we've had a lot of support from some local banks and a couple foundations. But certainly the federal government has a role to play. This is a national program in the makings, and the federal government really could step up and help us out.</p><p>GLICK: Well, that's pretty impressive. I'm glad to hear more about that...</p><p>NUTTER: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: ... because I think we need to...</p><p>NUTTER: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: We need to be doing a lot more about it, obviously, on a state by state basis.</p><p>You know, Mayor, you -- we're all talking about everybody's fiscal house, and the fiscal house in Pennsylvania...</p><p>NUTTER: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: ... is feeling some heat, too. You are right now...</p><p>NUTTER: It's tough.</p><p>GLICK: ... facing a budget shortfall as you know better than I do, the number I've heard reported is up to 2 billion by the middle of next year and that you're facing $1 billion...</p><p>NUTTER: For the state.</p><p>GLICK: For the state, for the state.</p><p>NUTTER: For the state. I don't want to give my citizen...</p><p>GLICK: Not for Philadelphia.</p><p>NUTTER: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: Well, when you say access to capital or access to credit...</p><p>NUTTER: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: ... for some of these infrastructure, how do you address those budget gaps? I mean are you talking about the Federal Reserve Bank, perhaps, stepping up and purchasing municipal funding?</p><p>NUTTER: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: I mean, walk me through what you would like to see happen.</p><p>NUTTER: There are a couple things. A couple weeks ago I was down in -- I was in Washington, delivered a letter to -- for Treasury Secretary Paulson and specifically I talked to big and medium sized city mayors about this issue.</p><p>We'd like to borrow directly from the treasury for infrastructure projects that are ready to go. You can put a shovel in the ground in just a couple of months and put people back to work, but we've not had great access to the capital markets to borrow money from.</p><p>So we'd like to borrow directly from treasury, repay at 50 basis points over treasury so the Feds are actually going to make money off of this deal, and allow us to get our crucial infrastructure projects under way, bridges, roads, telecommunications lines, underground infrastructure as well, put people to work quickly, but we need access to capital markets.</p><p>Virtually, no one could borrow anything from anybody regardless of your credit rating for months, and that has had a serious impact on cash flow as well as the ability to put shovels in the ground, so that was a big topic of conversation with the governors yesterday.</p><p>GLICK: OK, so -- so Mayor, because, you know, I know you have $180 million in what was recently rated as triple B status paper for the...</p><p>NUTTER: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: ... for the city of Philadelphia.</p><p>NUTTER: For the city, yes, just last week.</p><p>GLICK: In essence what you're suggesting that if you were to get some kind of deal like that through treasury, 50 basis points above current rates.</p><p>NUTTER: Right.</p><p>GLICK: That that would save your funding costs, I mean, what do you expect your funding rates to be going forward, and how big a difference will it make? And then -- and then, finally, one other thing, Mayor, that Governor Tim Pawlenty talked to me about yesterday, he says, look, we've also got to make some hard choices.</p><p>NUTTER: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: What hard choices are you willing to make to offset...</p><p>NUTTER: Well...</p><p>GLICK: ... access to capital?</p><p>NUTTER: Yes. Well, we've made the hard choices already. I made an announcement, a pretty big announcement two days after the election, I'm laying off upwards of 220 people, not filling 600 positions, closing 11 libraries, only reopening 12 of our 70 plus swimming pools, and so we've cut back significantly.</p><p>This is a very, very painful time between the layoffs and impact to some very important programs. I have never asked for a bailout. We're not asking for handouts. Access to capital has been the big request by cities all across America because we've been shut out of the credit markets, but all these big city mayors -- you look at what Mayor Bloomberg has done in New York, Mayor Daley in Chicago, Gavin Newsom in San Francisco, Shirley Franklin in Atlanta, Phil Gordon in Phoenix.</p><p>All of these mayors are making drastic cuts in programs and services, but the federal government -- we need your help in accessing the capital markets. We're willing to take out loans, we will repay. We're good credits. We're not going anywhere. We don't go out of business. And so we're stable and secure, unlike, you know, some of the others who are lining up.</p><p>GLICK: All right, well, Mayor Nutter, as always, fantastic pleasure talking to you.</p><p>NUTTER: Thanks, Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: Best of luck in your endeavor.</p><p>NUTTER: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: And you and I haven't talked since your Phillies won so I do need to tell you congratulations.</p><p>NUTTER: Thank you, go Phillies.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Did Governor Crist...</p><p>NUTTER: It's been a wonderful time. And we're going to -- we're going to turn things around in all these cities across America. President-elect Obama understands these issues, talked with the governors yesterday, and I know he is interested in talking to, to the mayors as well.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Well, we certainly hope things turn around very soon. Thank you so much, great pleasure seeing you.</p><p>NUTTER: They will. Thank you. You, too.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Coming up Charles Payne is chasing after Chuck E. Cheese. He says the pizza stock is cooking. Details just ahead.</p><p>And later strutting for sales. We're going to talk to the CEO of Victoria's Secret when MONEY FOR BREAKFAST returns.</p><p>GLICK: In his Wall Street strategy's hotline Charles Payne says he longs for the days of the bologna sandwiches and when people were just in a better mood all around. So do I.</p><p>He says seeing the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile on his way into work bring a smile to his face and it reminds him that we just aren't happy as we used to be.</p><p>He says, \"I believe there is a feeling of self-loathing that has been creeping into the psyche of America for a long time. It seems like we find it harder to be happy. We find it harder to smile.\"</p><p>Here he is, smiley himself, FOX Business contributor, Charles Payne. Oh my god, you know, I love bologna.</p><p>PAYNE: Do you?</p><p>GLICK: I hate to admit it.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, fried, regular, any kind.</p><p>GLICK: Oh yes.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, I do.</p><p>PAYNE: Have you seen the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile?</p><p>GLICK: Of course, and I -- I have the little keychain. But they were here with us, remember?</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, I loved it. You know, it was created in 1936, the Depression, and I went through a list last night of all the great things that were simple and created during difficult economic times.</p><p>GLICK: OK, tell me what they are.</p><p>PAYNE: Pet rock. Rock and Roll. The lava land. The CD player. The list goes on and on so we can be happy with very simple things in very depressed times.</p><p>GLICK: You need to give me that list as if you report it.</p><p>PAYNE: Here's the list right there. Look at that list right there.</p><p>GLICK: I want to look at this list.</p><p>PAYNE: Here it is.</p><p>GLICK: This needs to go -- I'm going to put this on my blog even though you have your -- all your huge fan base.</p><p>OK. So, so yes, we need to smile a little bit. We need to sort of, you know, move past this, but let's talk about some picks.</p><p>PAYNE: OK.</p><p>GLICK: What are you looking at today?</p><p>PAYNE: The one that intrigues me the most this morning is a company called Cyberonics. And it's been around for a long time. It gets a lot of hype. They make an implantable device that controls nerve stimulation.</p><p>Now the first -- the first approval was for epilepsy seizures but they think they can use this thing to fight depression, to control hunger, a lot of different things. The stock has been acting great this week. Piper Jaffrey has had some positive comments recently. I love this. It's come down a lot, I like the risk reward.</p><p>GLICK: OK. What's next?</p><p>PAYNE: Chuck E. Cheese, which is the last time I mentioned it on the show it came down a lot since then. But I think it's oversold here. I do believe that, you know what, it's going to do pretty well in this sort of economy.</p><p>You can see where at one point -- if we even had a longer term chart, it really was on a great tear. I will say those September quarter they missed. However, I would wait for a breakout and buy the stock north to 17 1/2.</p><p>GLICK: And where are Chuck E. Cheeses?</p><p>PAYNE: There's not one next door.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GLICK: Yes, I heard the -- oh my goodness. Did you guys -- you guys scared for me, right? I got a little scared myself because Charles...</p><p>PAYNE: There's a lot of them out in Jersey, though.</p><p>GLICK: ... says that I don't walk around the neighborhood -- OK, what's the last one?</p><p>PAYNE: Cree Research. You know, it's interesting because I interviewed the CEO of OSRAM SYLVANIA yesterday and he talked about light emitting diodes.</p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>PAYNE: I've always liked this place -- this space. It's very sexy. You know the NASDAQ building, all those lights, those are light emitting diodes. Eventually we'll have them in our home so we'll replace every single thing.</p><p>This is a stock that's been in a rumor mill for a long time, bad management, nevertheless, think -- I would buy it north of 16. That's the caveat.</p><p>GLICK: OK.</p><p>PAYNE: Traders look to get out at 19. If you're willing to hold through the gyrations a year from now it could be 24.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Charles Payne.</p><p>PAYNE: All right.</p><p>GLICK: Very good.</p><p>PAYNE: All of these use a 15 percent stop loss.</p><p>GLICK: Stop loss on the down side.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: Great point.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Let's quickly go over to Ashley Webster in London, get an update from him.</p><p>Ashley, you should look at this list of the things that have been created in difficult periods, Pacman, CD players, hula hoops.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS OVERSEAS MARKETS EDITOR: Yes, they're all good.</p><p>GLICK: Ashley, you missed it. Keep going.</p><p>WEBSTER: I missed it. I'm going, I'm going. All right. Let's go to the markets. I still have the (INAUDIBLE) 3000 models away.</p><p>OK, let's talk about the markets. London down 0.5 percent. France down 1 1/3 percent. As we speak Germany down 1.5, despite the gains in Asia, we are losing ground here in Europe so far.</p><p>We're keeping an eye on the airline sector after the big merger talks were revealed yesterday between British Airways and Qantas of Australia. BA, though, down 1 percent.</p><p>The big story of the morning, though, in the European tech sector. German semiconductor company Infineon reporting its 7th straight quarterly loss. That means that the company is saying today that it is continuing to struggle. Sales don't look good. The loss for the fourth quarter -- oh by the way $970 million dollars.</p><p>Also very quickly Anglo Irish Bank in the banking sector reporting full profit loss in the four-year profit loss of 33 percent. Also says it's putting aside $635 million for bad loans. Ouch.</p><p>Anglo Irish down 17 percent. The only good news is that the dollar is slightly higher today against both the euro and the British pound.</p><p>All right time to take a break. Coming up the Victoria's Secrets angels will be strutting their stuff and sales tonight. So what is the retail outlook for Victoria's Secret? We'll ask the CEO. An exclusive interview after the break.</p><p>And yes, we have video, and I have seen it and Victoria doesn't have many secrets left. We will be right back.</p><p>GLICK: Intimate apparel giant Victoria's Secret is one of the biggest money makers for its parent company Limited Brands and the models are strutting their stuff tonight on CBS to hit holiday sales.</p><p>I sat down with the CEO of the company. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SHAREN TURNEY, VICTORIA' SECRET CEO: This year's show we shot at the Fontainebleau which has a lot of history to it. The Rat Pack used to hang out there. Elvis Presley would sing there. So it's really about return to glamour. And that's what our assortments are for holiday.</p><p>We all know we're in a little bit of a downturn in terms of our economy so we're really trying to offer our customers this year a real credible promise of value in all that we do.</p><p>GLICK: One of the things that we have seen for Victoria's Secret and the parent company of Limited Brands is that it's been a difficult climate. I mean everybody has sort of been facing the new heat, the new environment, and that we've heard reports that Black Friday wasn't quite up to expectations.</p><p>You tell me, what are your projections this holiday season and how are you doing thus far if you were to give yourself a report card?</p><p>TURNEY: Well, I think we went into this fall and holiday season with a very conservative plan. We saw that the downside of the economy was happening, not to the degree that it has happened. We've been really controlling inventories, our inventory -- put it down almost 17 percent.</p><p>As we entered the fourth quarter really looking at our capex spending, and we were investing our dollars and to make sure that we're investing into the stores that are coming to the end of their lease line.</p><p>What we've done is try to be prepared and that's what we're trying to do for our customers as well. And I think that we're meeting our expectations as we talked about in our third quarter on our call is the fact that we made more money than the year before, as well as our (INAUDIBLE) doors were down about 9, our direct business was at double digits.</p><p>GLICK: One of the things, I'm glad you brought up direct business, because that's something that you are very well known for and very famous in the industry for is what you have created in direct business not only in your past positions but here at Victoria's Secret.</p><p>Why is that so crucial and how do you succeed even more in this kind of environment on direct business?</p><p>TURNEY: Well, I think that today the consumer has many venues of which they want to shop. And they might want to go to a store, they might want to use online to see what's happening, and then go into the store. They might have gone to the store and said, I wish I would have bought that, and it gives them an opportunity to go online.</p><p>And it's really not one way, but it's what is the preference of the customer and being able to offer that to them no matter how they want to shop.</p><p>GLICK: You know, it's interesting because a lot of people suggest that the bricks and mortar model several years ago was going to die. And now you're hearing that commercial real estate and strip malls are feeling the pain because people are not going into the malls to the degree that one would hope or expect given what's happened with the economy.</p><p>Will you look to downsize the amount of stores that you have as you look into 2009 and direct more of that energy and attention toward the Internet?</p><p>TURNEY: I think you're going to see us do both. We have some stores that are coming up to their end -- end of their lease line, but we'll also in -- when we start building stores, there are only 4,000 square feet.</p><p>Today we've added on the pink line. We've extended the beauty assortments. We have the new VSX sports line. We're adding swim wear to our stores so a 5,000 square foot store for us today is really too small. So where we can get the real estate, you'll see bigger stores from us that house all of these different opportunities for Victoria's Secret.</p><p>GLICK: I said to you in the very beginning, you know, I look at people like Heidi Klum and some of the other faces of Victoria's Secret, and we all sort of want to be that person but of course, you know, part of the beauty is the imagination or dreaming up how we can look like that person, but can we do that affordably?</p><p>TURNEY: Well, there is that $5 million diamond bra but also within the assortments today you can buy a bra for $20 from Victoria's Secret. You can buy a bra for $32 to $42 to $68 to $120.</p><p>So we really do have a breath of price range for women today to come in and buy a bra from Victoria's Secret.</p><p>GLICK: One last question for you. Limited Brands was recently downgraded. The debt was downgraded technically to junk status. A lot of businesses have said that they're having a very difficult time either getting access to the credit markets or raising funds in this kind of climate.</p><p>How are you guys doing? How concerned about that are you? And what do you project that will mean for you in your ability to continue to either grow or evolve as a business?</p><p>TURNEY: You know, we are very fortunate that we have over a billion dollars in cash in the bank. We have over a billion and a half credit line today. We've never had to go out and get into that credit line. We are a high margin, fast-turning business, and I think with the right prudent and conservativism going into 2009 I don't believe at all that Limited Brands will have any issues.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GLICK: In fact she also told me that they plan to expand as many as four stores in Canada. They are looking at some other options. They have a thousand stores across the country.</p><p>And if you're wondering about that runway show this evening, 500 hours worth of fittings for the models to prepare for this evening's show.</p><p>All right, well, my thanks again to the CEO, of course, of Victoria's Secret for joining me yesterday.</p><p>Coming up, we're going to continue our look at the bailout for automakers. Senator Arlen Specter is going to join us live. And the bailout could be felt hundreds of miles away from Detroit.</p><p>We're going to fill you in when the second hour of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST returns.</p><p>GLICK: Good morning and welcome to hour number two of MONEY FOR BREAKFAST. I'm Alexis Glick.</p><p>We're going to have the latest on the auto bailout coming up and Senator Arlen Specter will join us to tell us what he is expecting of the automakers.</p><p>Also we'll get the latest numbers from the ADP jobs report. That is due out in 15 minutes. This on the heels of a weaker than expected Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas numbers that came out just moments ago of a loss of 181,000 jobs in the month of November.</p><p>Also coming up the CEO of Blockbuster Videos is going to join us as well.</p><p>But first let's get a quick check of the futures as we stand right now. We've been in negative territory throughout the morning, but right now we are close back to the lows of the morning. We're down 116 points. We're down 1.38 percent. The S&amp;P is down 1.5 percent. And NASDAQ is now down 2 1/4 percent.</p><p>We've been jockeying all around this morning and after those employment numbers this morning, we've moved lower.</p><p>All right. Congressional leaders are set to begin hearings Thursday on the U.S. automakers' plan for survival and their request for as much as $34 billion in government loans. For a look at what the plans say, here's Fox Business Washington correspondent, Rich Edson, who's going to break down all the details.</p><p>Good morning, Rich.</p><p>RICH EDSON, FBN CORRESPONDENT: And good morning, Alexis.</p><p>And all three automakers say they will make smaller, more fuel efficient cars. All three are willing to exchange warrants for government loans. GM says it will cut as many as 31,000 additional jobs. Ford says it will at least break even by 2011. And Chrysler says it could start repaying the government by 2012.</p><p>The price tag for all of that and more is $34 billion worth of federal loans. GM wants $4 billion this month and up to $18 billion overall if the economy gets worse. Ford says it doesn't need the money now, but would like a $9 billion line of credit. Chrysler is asking for $7 billion. And Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson says the Bush administration supports helping the automakers as long as the assistance comes from somewhere other than the rescue package.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HENRY PAULSON, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: So we have been very much for -- we need a solution that avoids bankruptcy, but it's got to be leading to a viable industry.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON: The administration still supports using $25 billion already set aside to help the automakers reach fuel efficiency standards. It is all up to Democratic leadership. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid says no decisions have been made yet, including whether the Senate or the House will go first. And none will be made, at least until the hearings, later this week.</p><p>GM's COO Fritz Henderson is briefing lawmakers here this afternoon. Reps from the other two automakers will also work The Hill today. The United Auto Workers Union meets in the motor city today to perhaps discuss concessions. And GM's CEO Rick Wagoner says he and UAW President Ron Gettlefinger agree that the union can be part of the solution, but not all of it.</p><p>Alexis, back to you.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, and, Rich, I imagine that the rhetoric is going to get tougher and tougher, particularly given the fact that now -- particularly General Motors is asking for an additional $6 billion. Even Ford, who said they may not need the $9 billion line, are talking about the need perhaps for an additional $4 billion if the recession gets worse. I mean, at what point can we believe that enough is enough?</p><p>EDSON: Yes. Well, that, and also look at the way that they're getting here. Now they're driving and giving up the corporate jets. What you're hearing in D.C. is, why didn't you come to us with this plan and this type of approach the first time around? We almost had to draw you in to doing it the right way the second time.</p><p>GLICK: Great point. All right, Rich, we're going to leave it there. Thank you so much. And I will check in with you in a little while.</p><p>Well, while much of the U.S. carmakers' bailout discussion focuses on the impact the big three are having on Detroit, the auto industry's reach extends far beyond Michigan's borders. Take, for example, Chattanooga, Tennessee. Now despite the economic downturn, Volkswagen is putting $1 billion into a new plant in Chattanooga that will help create about 2,000 jobs. For a look at how the possible bailout will affect the economy, both in and out of Detroit, I'm joined by Trevor Hamilton. He's the vice president of economic development for the Chattanooga Chamber of Commerce, and Republican Congressman Thaddeus McCotter of Michigan.</p><p>Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for being here.</p><p>REP. THADDEUS MCCOTTER, (R) MICHIGAN: Thanks for having me.</p><p>TREVOR HAMILTON, CHATTANOOGA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE VP: Good morning, Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: All right, Trevor, let me start with you. How has that Chattanooga billion dollar project affected your local economy? And why do you think it is that Volkswagen has decided to invest in the U.S., particularly at a time when we're all struggling?</p><p>HAMILTON: Well, for Chattanooga, this is really the culmination of a long- term vision for our community to recruit an automobile manufacturer to our region. Chattanooga has had a long history with manufacturing. We believe that manufacturing is still important to the economic base of this nation's economy. And so this is really a culmination of a long-term vision for our community and our state here in Tennessee.</p><p>Volkswagen carries less than a 3 percent market share in the United States currently. And their hope is that by the time this facility is operational in 2011, that our economy will be again on the rebound and that they'll have the right vehicle at the right price for the American consumer at that time.</p><p>GLICK: Congressman McCotter, I know that you understand more than anybody how crucial this talk about a rescue plan is for the big three automakers. You've had an opportunity to see the plans they put in place yesterday. Did they make enough progress?</p><p>MCCOTTER: Well, I hope that they did. It's going to be difficult because much of what we've seen occur through the cost of restructuring to date in flesh and blood we finally saw in black and white in a report issued to Congress. It's going to be a very tough haul. It's going to be a tough argument to make. But I think members of Congress are going to realize that the auto industry has been moving in the direction they wanted and that there will be a viable plan for the future that protects taxpayers as well because they're intrinsically, concomitivly (ph) mutually beneficial.</p><p>GLICK: You know, congressman, we talk a lot about the big three and the impact that it has on Detroit. But here it is. You and I both know, this is a lot more than what's going on in Detroit or in the state of Michigan. It's much grander than that. Walk me through why some kind of plan is so essential.</p><p>MCCOTTER: I think it's important for the prosperity and the security of the United States to have a domestic auto industry and a manufacturing industry. The auto industry is the heart of it. If you look at what's happening, especially in the foreclosure crisis, as Secretary Paulson has admitted, if foreclosures continue to rise, you're going to have a very difficult time stabilizing credit markets. If people who are employed in the auto industry now go into bankruptcy and are potentially losing hundreds of thousands of their homes, they're going to exacerbate the foreclosure crisis and our credit markets won't stabilize and we will remain in the recession, if not find ourselves in a more dire position.</p><p>GLICK: Trevor, let me switch back to you. Your state is the fifth largest auto manufacturer in the country. How much are you watching these bailout hearings, or these rescue plan hearings, and how important do you think it is to support the big three manufacturers?</p><p>HAMILTON: Well, here in Tennessee, as you say, we're the fifth largest auto producing state in the country. And over 160,000 Tennesseeans are employed in that industry. So we are watching the issue very closely.</p><p>And while it's difficult to say how it specifically will impact our community, certainly our state is affected by the big three. And we're hopeful for a full economic recovery of the big three.</p><p>Here in Tennessee, we have a Saturn plant in the Nashville area. And even closer to Chattanooga, less than two hours from here, Ford recently shuttered a plant in Atlanta. And GM is slated to close their facility there as well. So I won't venture to guess what the solution is, but certainly we hope for a full economic recovery of our domestic big three.</p><p>GLICK: Congressman, one of the things that is on the table right now is a discussion that's going on in Washington, D.C., and away from Washington, D.C., and that is the concept of allowing some sort of government sort of sponsored bailout plan where whereby the likes of GM and Chrysler do file Chapter 11 bankruptcy but the government backstops any of the debt thereafter, including the warranties. How do you feel about that?</p><p>MCCOTTER: The auto companies and the UAW and everyone in the Michigan delegation knows that bankruptcy is not an option. What we want to see is a bridge loan to the auto industry that can be repaid over time to the taxpayers with the appropriate interest and, again, with the appropriate taxpayer protection. The ultimate one of which will be a viable plan for the future. We believe that those have been presented and we will be making our case to our colleagues to approve one.</p><p>GLICK: All right. We're going to leave it there. Congressman, thank you very much. And Trevor Hamilton, thank you both very much. I'll be looking forward to much more of this over the next couple of days. Thank you, gentlemen.</p><p>And now let's send it over to Charles.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Thanks, Alexis.</p><p>Well, you know, banks have seen better days in recent months. But an unlikely company, Microsoft, is showing banks how to attract and keep new customers. And not just any new customers. The company group known as millennials goes between ages of 18 and 30. Bill Hartnett, Microsoft's U.S. industry solutions director of insurance, joins us to discuss the new strategy.</p><p>Bill, you just finished your survey on the banking preferences of this coveted group. Tell us what you found.</p><p>BILL HARTNETT, MICROSOFT FINANCIAL SERVICES: You bet, Charles.</p><p>What we found is a real crisis of confidence and trust that's going on right now. And the group that's most affected by this are the millennials. There are 80 million people in that group. It's a really an amazing group of people and there's a land grab out there for what will be the next generation of high net worth individuals. And we think technology and the use of technology is going to be the key to attracting them.</p><p>PAYNE: Bill, how specifically can Microsoft take this sort of information and help banks to understand this group of folks?</p><p>HARTNETT: Well, one of the things you can do with technology is really change the experience people have of dealing with a financial institution. And if you look at the preferences of that millennial group, most of them use technology in very interesting ways. And we like to say they've been marinading in technology since birth, right? They don't know a world without the PC or the Internet. So they use social networking sites like FaceBook and MySpace. They instant message all the time. In fact, they prefer instant messaging over e-mail. They use wickies (ph) and blogs all the time. When I was growing up, we didn't know what those things were, right?</p><p>PAYNE: Right.</p><p>HARTNETT: So if you really want to attract that customer base, and you really want to reach them in a way where they start to build a trust relationship with you, using technology in a way they want to use it will be very key.</p><p>PAYNE: Now even since the Internet boom, we heard about online banking and Internet banking. And it seems like a lot of companies came around, they fell apart. Which banks are now positioned, do you think right now, to take advantage of this?</p><p>HARTNETT: Well, I think it's the banks that don't think like banks, frankly. If you think like a bank or a banker . . .</p><p>PAYNE: Is there one that you can tell -- is there someone . . .</p><p>HARTNETT: There are many. I can give you a great example of a small bank, a regional bank out on the West Coast we've done a lot of work with. Umqua Bank (ph). They have a CEO who is just an amazing guy who focuses on that customer experience and the employee experience, frankly, how does he attract employees into</p><p>(AUDIO GAP)</p><p>GLICK: The Fox 50 makes up some lost ground, gaining 28 points. Its biggest one day advance since November 24th. Forty-eight of the 50 components were up. The biggest percentage gainers were Sprint, CBS and General Electric. Today, some big tech stocks in the index are in the news. Here now with a closer look is Fox Business contributor Charles Payne and Leo Tilman, president of L.M. Tilman and former chief strategist for Bear Stearns.</p><p>Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for being back.</p><p>PAYNE: Good morning.</p><p>GLICK: Leo, let's start with you. Google out today waving a cautious flag about future investments. Tell me about this.</p><p>LEO TILMAN, L.M. TILMAN PRESIDENT: Not particularly surprising, right? The economy continues to deteriorate. Consumers are in trouble. The housing continues to deteriorate. So Google's not immune to these problems.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, well, you know, Alexis.</p><p>GLICK: Look at this stock price. I mean, I need people to take a look at this because look at how high this stock was. This stock was about $730 at the beginning of the year.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes.</p><p>GLICK: It's $275, Charles.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes, year over year it's down well over 50 percent. And it's absolutely mind boggling. You know, Wall Street was -- Wall Street and Google have always been somewhat at odds. Google wanted to do it their way from an unconventional IPO and since then and you always get the vision of Google as being on one of those typical Silicon Valley -- they've got this skate board ramping guys walking around, you know, brainstorming in the conference room but no real obligations. Wall Street never liked that. They were always really upset with that aspect of the business. You know, it's one thing to be an intelligent company, but . . .</p><p>GLICK: But Wall Street loved the amount of cash that they had sitting on the books. And I would imagine what they didn't like was it looked like it was excess. And the day that a Google comes out and says, we're going to lay off 10 percent of our workforce, then we begin to panic.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, yes. Go ahead.</p><p>TILMAN: And I'm not sure if it's about Wall Street sort of causing this sell-off. I think it's an objective way that advertising revenues are declining.</p><p>GLICK: Yes.</p><p>TILMAN: Consumer spending is declining. So I think it's more of the fundamentals that are affecting Google rather than . . .</p><p>PAYNE: Right. And another point too. The run-up in that stock, every time they announced that they were doing a new initiative, the stock would run up as if they were going to be completely successful in everything they touched, you know. And investors gave them the benefit of the doubt and, of course, they have not been successful in everything they've tried.</p><p>GLICK: OK. There's another big story today. I like this. This is juicy. The former AOL CEO may actually -- Jonathan Miller -- he is apparently talking to a group of private equity investors, some sovereign wealth funds, about perhaps trying to make a bid for all or part of Yahoo!'s business for the tune of perhaps $20 to $22 a share. Leo, what do you make of this?</p><p>TILMAN: Will, I think it's interesting on many different counts. And I'm sure Charles will pitch in. But one of them is that there's a fair amount of private equity in sovereign wealth funds available to step in and buy attractive stocks. And that's a duality. Nobody is lending. That's what we keep hearing. But at the same time, a lot of money is available (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>GLICK: You still think there is money on the sidelines?</p><p>TILMAN: Definitely.</p><p>PAYNE: Well, there's money on the sidelines. But you talk about a group of people that have been burnt. Sovereign wealth guys have been scorched.</p><p>GLICK: I was going to say, they've lost so much.</p><p>PAYNE: Yes. And also, a $40 billion deal right now. I haven't seen any sort -- listen, if he's going to get the money from TARP, he's got a better shot, you know.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. This is -- oh, this is -- but it's a fascinating story.</p><p>PAYNE: It is.</p><p>GLICK: All right, guys, we're going to leave it here. You guys are going to come back in just about 10 minutes. We're going to talk more about some important economic numbers coming out.</p><p>PAYNE: OK.</p><p>GLICK: Well, the big three of Detroit, they have made their second bids for a loan. And now it has risen to $34 billion. General Motors is looking for up to $18 billion. Chrysler wants 7. And Ford is looking for $9 billion, although it says it may not need to use the funds. For a glimpse into how congressional leaders are reacting to these survival plans is Republican Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Senator, good morning. Great to see you.</p><p>SEN. ARLEN SPECTER, (D) PENNSYLVANIA: Good morning. Nice to have a chance to talk to you. Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: So, senator, I don't know, I'm a little skeptical here, I've got to be honest with you. I saw the proposals yesterday. They finally did what they needed to do. They cleaned it up a little bit. They brought a proposal. But they asked now for more money. When is enough enough?</p><p>SPECTER: Well, there is good reason to be skeptical. We know that the big three, they haven't performed in the past. They haven't kept up with the times on fuel efficiency and cars that will sell. But we're facing a situation here where the consequences of their going under could be very, very devastating for the entire economy.</p><p>So the issue is, will their plans provide a realistic opportunity for success? And in our free enterprise system, we let the market determine winners and losers. But where you have a situation where there could be a very serious impact on the entire economy, I think we ought to consider the specifics as to what they've proposed.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. I mean my concern, senator, is, look, believe me, I'm worried about the job losses, I'm worried about the industry and the implications it could have for the greater economy. What bothers me about the story is it has not been clearly demonstrated to me what the sustainability is of the industry. And perhaps what we need to consider is, maybe it shouldn't be the big three. I mean maybe it should be the big seven or a combination, you know. I just haven't heard enough of a justification as to how the industry is going to change. We're built for 16 million cars. We're selling 10 million cars. And I imagine that number's not going to get much better over the next couple of years.</p><p>SPECTER: Well, you haven't heard enough justification. And, frankly, neither have I. But I'm prepared to look. That's my pedigree. My job as a senator is to take a look at the specifics as to what they have proposed. I want to see where their efficiencies are. I want to see the economists and the experts in the field make an evaluation which is objective. And then I want to make the determination as to whether there's a realistic chance that they can succeed. Because if we can avoid having them go under and having a lot of people lose their jobs and having the ripple effect go through suppliers and automobile dealers across the economy, that's something what we want to do. But we're not going to do it blindly. Only if they make a solid case.</p><p>GLICK: Great point. A solid case.</p><p>Now, let me ask you, there are two members who are going to be sitting on the panel. I know you had Peter Morici from the University of Maryland sitting on the panel last time. This time you're going to have comptroller Mr. Gene Didarro (ph), who's a Moody's chief economist. Tell me why you're adding these two names to the panel and what you hope to get out of them in addition to talking to the executives.</p><p>SPECTER: Well, the economists have been added to the panel to get some independent evaluation as to what the consequences would be. Look here, when you talk about what's going to happen in the future on the economy, it is very, very hard to judge. And we want to have the best experts we can find to give us some insights. And then there's examination and cross- examination.</p><p>You must watch C-Span occasionally, as well as your own network, and you see the way the senators probe and get more information. And we'll be doing that. It's our judgment. It's not their judgment. We're elected to make these judgments. And that's why I convened a meeting yesterday in Philadelphia, why my staff and I have been pouring over the details of the semicolons (ph) so that when we go back to Washington on Monday, we're in a position to make an informed judgment.</p><p>GLICK: You know, you were speaking of Philadelphia, senator. Tell me, how do the people in Pennsylvania feel about the bailout of the auto industry?</p><p>SPECTER: Well, people in Pennsylvania haven't spoken about the bailout of the auto industry. But let me tell you how they felt about the $700 billion which we legislated all last October. They didn't like it.</p><p>I spent the month of October doing town meetings, which is my practice, to touch all of Pennsylvania's 67 counties. The temperature was 212. They wanted to know why the regulators hadn't done their job. They wanted to know what was going to be done with the $700 billion. And I told them that it was a very bitter decision that I faced and that the others faced because of what we were informed would be the consequences.</p><p>So the issue now to help the big three is something that I'm prepared to do only if they really make, as I said before, the solid case. I know that the public opinion is against the bailouts, but sometimes, in my position, you have to make decisions which may not be the most popular if that really is my judgment or our collective judgment about what is in the public interest.</p><p>GLICK: You know, senator, I am so glad that you brought up the TARP program because there are reports that Treasury Secretary Paulson may go as early as next week to members of Congress to ask for the other $350 billion. If he stands in front of the Senate, what will you tell him if he asks for the money?</p><p>SPECTER: Well, the first thing I will ask him is what he has done with the first $350 billion. We have a problem which was created because of the mortgage situation, defaults on mortgages, and the Treasury Department has done precious little on that subject.</p><p>Then we took a look at the credit freeze, and there were a lot of highly sophisticated fandangos that they were undertaking to try to put money in the banks and nothing has happened there. Before we're going to consider giving him $350 billion more, he is going to have to have some really good explanations as to what he has done with the first $350 billion.</p><p>And I've had a chance to meet with Treasury Secretary Paulson, and very bluntly, I haven't been impressed with what he has had to say.</p><p>GLICK: Finally, before I let you go, in Philadelphia yesterday, in addition to the meetings that you said you had about the auto manufacturers and the plans they laid out, President-elect Obama met with many current governors and former governors about this proposed stimulus plan.</p><p>We are now hearing to the tune of $500 billion, maybe more, how do you feel about it, and do you believe that infrastructure, rebuilding, job creation are essential parts of a fiscal stimulus plan if in fact we have the money to pay for it?</p><p>SPECTER: There's no doubt that our highways and our bridges are crumbling. What I'm going to be looking for are parts of a stimulus plan which are pro-growth. For example, the stimulus package we passed last summer, I had a proposal which had been pending for a long time to authorize expensing or deductibility of 50 percent in the first year of capital advances.</p><p>For example, if a steel company built a big hearth, they had it depreciated 20 years, 5 percent a year, my legislation, which is put into the plan, is able to take 50 percent in the first year. And that's the kind of a pro-growth proposal which sticks to the regs, which is more than giving several hundred dollars to people to spend, which doesn't have any lasting effect.</p><p>It may feel good for a short period of time. So when we talk about highways and bridges and items which will enable us to be pro-growth in the future, those are the proposals which will draw my support.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Well, Senator Specter, great pleasure speaking with you this morning. Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with us.</p><p>SPECTER: Thank you. I have enjoyed it.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Let's go upstairs to Connell McShane, because, Connell, I know we saw those third-quarter productivity numbers just came out. And a little bit more analysis on those ADP numbers as well.</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Yes, we see the productivity at the bottom of your screen has actually been revised higher in the third quarter which is a surprise. The expectation was it would be revised lower. So 1.3 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter compared to the prior quarter. That is an upward revision compared to the first number. And it was expected to be downward.</p><p>So that is a bit of a surprise to the market. The futures have actually come off their lows, for what it is worth, they're down 142, and the Dow futures have been about 20 points more than that there a moment ago.</p><p>So that's the economic data this morning that has just been released. There are your futures. We are going to give you, as we go to break here, two quick stocks to watch in the day ahead, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Merrill Lynch has just come out and significantly cut its fourth- quarter earnings estimates or lack thereof for both Goldman and Morgan.</p><p>Instead of a profit, they are expecting losses of both of these firms. And they've -- the downward revision could affect both of those stocks. Keep an eye on them today. Our panel is going to weigh in on all of the economic numbers, and a FOX Business exclusive, the CEO of Blockbuster coming up, explaining how they are competing in a crowded market. So don't go away. \"Money for Breakfast\" continues here in just a moment.</p><p>GLICK: All right. As Connell just mentioned, the productivity numbers, the revision to the third quarter just came out. In addition we saw the second announcement of jobs reports this morning coming out of ADP on private sectors, a decline of 250,000. That did exceed estimates. And Q3 productivity was slightly better than anticipated, coming in at 1.3 percent.</p><p>This on the heels of a Challenger Gray &amp; Christmas jobs number that came out earlier this morning that showed a job loss of 181,000 in the month of November. To break down all three of those numbers, Leo Tilman is the former chief strategist for Bear Stearns; Mark Lieberman is our FOX Business senior economist; and our FOX Business contributor Charles Payne is here.</p><p>All right, guys. Mark, you got an opportunity to look at the Q3 productivity number. I know unit labor costs is something you are concerned about. What did you find and how does it look?</p><p>MARK LIEBERMAN, FOX BUSINESS SR. ECONOMIST: Unit labor costs went up 3.1 percent in the final report...</p><p>GLICK: What does that mean?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: It means it is actually the cost of producing each specific item. It is an index that tracks that. It tells us something about where inflation is going and this is obviously tracking what we have seen in other inflation indicators.</p><p>Similarly, as we look at the overall productivity number, a strong productivity gain is probably more important in a good economy because it keeps prices down and it keeps a standard of living up.</p><p>What's happening now is, and it's tracking what we see in the rest of the economy, output is down, we see that from GDP, but employment and jobs are down further. So when you do simple arithmetic.</p><p>GLICK: Workers are becoming more productive.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Exactly.</p><p>GLICK: Charles, what do you make of these numbers? Also the ADP number -- which let's keep in mind, the ADP number saw a loss of 250,000 jobs, there's usually not the best of correlations between the private sector number and the non-farm payrolls that we see from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday. But we've been looking for a loss of 300,000.</p><p>I wonder whether or not those estimates are going to go higher since the private sector number was so depressing.</p><p>CHARLES PAYNE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely. And to that point, ADP numbers always seem to be a lot rosier, if you will, than the Bureau of Labor statistics. So for them to come out with 250,000, you have got to be nervous.</p><p>I mean, if you weren't nervous already, to be quite frank, you are right now. As far as productivity, Alexis, I mean, this is something that was really more important in a different sort of economy where the Fed didn't know if it wanted to lower rates or raise rates and they needed cover. You know, I know Greenspan was able to use that productivity boom to keep rates low, much to everyone's chagrin.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK: Yes, but what we really care about is jobs today.</p><p>PAYNE: At this point, yes. It doesn't seem like it matters.</p><p>GLICK: So, Leo, you have two pieces of data that came out this morning, both worse than anticipated, what do you now think the non-farm payrolls numbers is going to look like on Friday?</p><p>LEO TILMAN, FMR. CHIEF STRATEGIST, BEAR STEARNS: I think it is going to be weak. And all indications point to that. And to that point I think the inflation story is less important today. It is interesting that early in the year we were all concerned about systemic inflation pressures. Then we went into deflation worries. And now I think it's just not an issue for any foreseeable future.</p><p>It is conceivable that down the road the stimuli, the monetary policy are going to reignite inflation, but it is not in any foreseeable future.</p><p>GLICK: Mark?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: I think that's right. I mean, you know, deflation became more and more of a concern. And when you think about it, I mean, what can the Fed do if we were in an inflationary environment? Well, the Fed can raise interest rates. One of the ways you would combat deflation is to reduce interest rates. Well, there's a floor on how far you can go down on deflation.</p><p>GLICK: But if deflation becomes, as some suspect it might, a really big problem, let's just say for the sake of argument over the next six months, I know everybody is talking about inflation longer term being the bigger issue because we're -- the printing presses have not shut down since we arrived on television a year ago, but what if deflation becomes a real issue? How do we address it knowing that real interest rates are actually negative?</p><p>LIEBERMAN: A couple of things are going to work on this. Number one, as income improves, as the economy does recover, and this may shock some of the people who I work with regularly, it will recover. The.</p><p>GLICK: Oh, so that was the rose-colored glasses, the question, Mark.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK: . which we get like once every three months.</p><p>PAYNE: He has a rose-colored monocle somewhere.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Exactly. No, the economy clearly will recover. It's going to take some time. And what's going to happen at the recovery, there will be pent up demand, and demand is the furor (ph) for deflation. You have to do whatever you can to pump up demand.</p><p>We have to put people back to work. We talk about that ad nauseam. Although it's obviously.</p><p>GLICK: Investments, all that kind of stuff.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: . investments and things like that. And people -- you know, there's going to be -- if you deprive yourself of that big screen TV, at some point you are going to want to buy it, even though it's not made here.</p><p>TILMAN: On that note, bringing down long-term rates is going to play to that as well. So all the purchases of Treasury securities and agency securities by the Fed are an additional stimulus that should.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK: . mortgage applications explode. And I understand you say it is only applications, it is not necessarily full refinance activity. But, look, Charles and I have been talking about it, I'm like -- the minute I started seeing rates come down, I'm like, let's get on it. And I think a lot of people across this country are. So hopefully that's one good piece of...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Let's think about that for a second, because what that is saying is that homeowners who are refi-ing -- it is not purchases, it is homeowners who are refi-ing, if they are doing that, why are they doing it? They desperately need cash.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. I'd like a little extra cash. Hey, it is a good thing.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PAYNE: Since the National Bureau of Economic Research gave this time stamp to the recession, we have got to give Mark props. Because Mark did call this.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, he did say fourth quarter last year.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Thank you.</p><p>GLICK: You did call it, yes.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK: Yes, there he is. We love Mark Lieberman, even when he's depressed, we always try to cheer him up though.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: For depression you take a pill. Otherwise for recession.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK: A pill. A cocktail. I was thinking these should be Bloody Mary conversations from now on. What do you think? I mean, we could propose that.</p><p>LIEBERMAN: Mimosas, whatever.</p><p>GLICK: Yes. See, look, there he is, mimosas. All right, guys, thank you very much. And I do want to mention by the way that Leo Tilman has a book, and I haven't even mentioned it, it's \"Financial Darwinism.\" This is a very brilliant guy. So you want to pick that up. All right, guys.</p><p>Coming up, we're going to talk to Blockbuster video because they are making some huge changes. The CEO of the movie rental chain is going to be with us in a FOX Business exclusive when we return. They've got some very exciting things up their sleeves that I'm not sure you have heard about. We will talk about that coming up next.</p><p>GLICK: Blockbuster the leading brand for video rentals has seen its original business model attacked by technology, but now it's hitting the fast forward button to reinvent itself. The company is teaming up with Microsoft to develop new digital services that will let you watch movies on your phone. And it has entered into a partnership with Live Nation to sell concert tickets. This morning we welcome James Keyes, he's the chairman and CEO of Blockbuster.</p><p>Good to see you.</p><p>JAMES KEYES, CHMN. &amp; CEO, BLOCKBUSTER: Great to be here, thanks.</p><p>GLICK: So you are doing a lot of inventive things because there's always this tug-of-war between Netflix and Blockbuster, each trying to move one step ahead of each other. Tell me about some of these -- this new technological road map, particularly as it relates to cell phones or mobile devices.</p><p>KEYES: Well, mobile devices, eventually portability is going to be king. We all like the convenience of being able to watch content when we want, where we want. And that really is the legacy of Blockbuster. Blockbuster was never really about video rentals. It was always about convenient access to media entertainment.</p><p>So the key is for us to transcend all of the various channels to keep up with technology and to provide our customers with the most convenient access wherever it is, even on your mobile phone.</p><p>GLICK: So I understand you are working on a deal here with Microsoft in terms of how to get the technology and the software so that we can get it on our mobile devices, and one of the things you are doing right now is testing it on kiosks and the ability for us perhaps to travel in an airport and upload it at some point in the future. Where is that going?</p><p>KEYES: Well, the key with the digital technology is that it's a wonderful thing. It allows so much flexibility with content, and yet, it seems that everyone is trying to get content on their big screen TV. Bandwidth in the United States is going to take some time to catch up to this demand because the file size for movies is actually very large.</p><p>So in the interim, in the next five years or 10 years, there are many other ways to deliver digital content. We are trying out some kiosks in stores, for example, so instead of taking an hour, hour-and-a-half to load a movie, you can load it in 30 seconds or 60 seconds right directly onto a portable device and have the convenience and flexibility of digital content in a portable fashion.</p><p>GLICK: You know, there are a lot of people who look at the video game industry, as I said to you yesterday, I spoke to an executive at Xbox, and I know they have a relationship with Netflix, but they look at that industry as a place which is experiencing unusual growth in a very difficult economy, and they are experiencing it year-over-year.</p><p>What kind of things are you trying to do perhaps to maybe address that audience, that demo which is a tremendous demo by doing partnerships like what Netflix and Xbox are doing together?</p><p>KEYES: We are -- again, it is very early, the idea of digital content directly to the home through game consoles or set-top boxes, very, very early in its development. Yes, we just released just a week ago a deal with a company called 2Wire, that's a large provider of these boxes and this technology to deliver content directly to the television, so now you can get Blockbuster on demand.</p><p>We have several thousand movies, new releases available from the ease of pulling up video-on-demand from your couch. And this is just another step. Again, very early.</p><p>GLICK: So who will sell those boxes? I mean, if 2Wire is a company that makes them, like, would I be able to get them on my set-top cable box? I mean, where will I see that come to me, the consumer?</p><p>KEYES: Today you can actually buy Blockbuster on demand online at blockbuster.com. We are selling it in a few stores just trying to test the consumer demand. That's really our objective right now. It is very early in the developmental stage.</p><p>But eventually you will find that this capability is baked not only into your cable box, but directly into your television set. In fact, we announced a deal with Intel not too long ago where their new chip for their Internet-ready television set in the next couple of years will include a widget that allows you to pull up the Blockbuster icon right there on your television set and have immediate access to all of your favorite movies.</p><p>GLICK: OK. So let's just take that example and let's just assume that for the sake of argument you live here in a place like New York City, you have Time Warner Cable. So I have Time Warner Cable and I have now just purchased this Internet television. Time Warner offers pay-per-view events, on demand events, how is it that I'm going to go to you as opposed to going to my cable operator who has been wired into my home?</p><p>KEYES: Well, today Blockbuster really owns that entertainment customer, particularly the customer for movies. And so our job is to make it a nice smooth transition for that customer to move over to these other services. And that's why we're leading now with Blockbuster on demand.</p><p>Eventually the cable companies will want to offer their customers various services. We will all have unique content. We will all have proprietary and exclusive content, and that will keep Blockbuster, the brand, relevant for the consumer.</p><p>GLICK: You know, one of the things I said yesterday to this executive at Xbox is I said, listen, you know, when we're on that console and they show the list of Netflix movies, they tend to be outdated, frankly. They're not the kind of movies, I'm sorry to say, that I want to see in today's world.</p><p>How do you make sure that you are delivering the newest, most credible content on any device right now so that it makes me want to do it? And if iPhone is doing something similar, why would I go with one of the devices that you have in a relationship with Microsoft as opposed to everybody carrying around that iPhone or that iPod?</p><p>KEYES: Well, first of all, you won't have that problem with Blockbuster. People have come to know and trust Blockbuster for the newest releases, the latest releases. Our Blockbuster on demand will have new releases. It is very different from the Netflix offering, as an example, which is a unique product, a very good product, but it is a subscription product.</p><p>And by nature, subscription content delivered digitally will be a little bit older content. It will be more in the pay TV window or two or three years older on average than the new releases that you can find available on Blockbuster.</p><p>So this is an opportunity for us. And as we go forward, our key competitive advantage will be to make it easy, convenient for the customer, and to have the best content available, the newest releases, exclusive content only available at Blockbuster.</p><p>GLICK: All right. James Keyes, sounds terrific. Come back, join us again, particularly as you put some of these plans in place. I want to see some of these devices and learn a little bit more about it.</p><p>KEYES: Well, thanks, great to be here.</p><p>GLICK: Great to have you.</p><p>All right, guys. We will be right back in just a moment with the \"1 Thing You Should Know.\" Unfortunately, the one thing you should know right now is the market is pretty much at the low of the day. We are down 140 -- 156 points right now. The S&amp;P down 2 percent, the Nasdaq down 2.25 percent. Some of this of course on the heels of those jobs numbers this morning. We will be right back.</p><p>GLICK: All right. Now it is time for the \"1 Thing You Should Know. We get started with Ashley Webster in London.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, you know what, Alexis? I was looking at all this miserable news that's coming about in the U.K. and the Eurozone, I thought, well, I will do this story. It's kind of interesting.</p><p>But there is quite a lot of snow around the U.K. and there's some blizzards forecast for tonight in the northern part of the country. So that means the odds of it snowing in London on Christmas Day now down to 11 to 4. It was 7 to 1.</p><p>You know, we bet on anything in the U.K. The odds are now down that a snow flake will fall on the London weather center on Christmas Day is now down to 11 to 4. I may take that bet.</p><p>GLICK: Wow, yes. Wouldn't it be great to have a white Christmas? We don't have enough white Christmases, at least here in New York. I'm sure for you in California it rarely ever happens. When you were growing up, did they do -- like I heard some families would bring in like the fake snow?</p><p>JENNA LEE, FOX BUSINESS ANCHOR: Oh, they do that, yes, absolutely. They will have like places that the kids can sled, but it will be sunny. So it never really felt like Christmas. It was always sunny.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, but now you are here.</p><p>LEE: Now I can freeze and feel...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GLICK: OK. So what's your \"1 Thing\"?</p><p>LEE: You know, we (INAUDIBLE) talk so much about mortgage applications and refinances being way up. And I think that after the program that was announced last week, that can't be a bad sign. And we have to take it in relative terms from the weeks before, but it can't be a bad thing.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, I like that. I actually think it is a good sign. I understand Lieberman is like, Alexis, it is only applications, but you know what? The fact that we can make homeownership more affordable or that we'll go out and refinance, personally I'm hoping to take advantage of it.</p><p>PAYNE: I think it is fantastic. My \"1 Thing\" though is, by the way, I think automakers, the CEOs should go on horseback to Capitol Hill.</p><p>GLICK: Maybe they should do the Clydesdales.</p><p>PAYNE: They should ride horses because, you know what, you bring back the thought of Paul Revere and how important it is for America. And also you suggest to America, you don't bail us out, everybody is going to be riding one of these.</p><p>GLICK: Yes, that's a great point. What about that \"made in America.\" You know, we need to like be excited about \"made in America\" again. We need to work on them. Give them some tips.</p><p>All right, guys. We are going to go to commercial break. We are going to come back. We are going to have \"The Opening Bell\" coming up next. We are going to talk to a top executive in the power and energy world who can talk to us a little bit about all of this electricity grid, infrastructure building, some of the things that we have been talking about in terms of fiscal stimulus.</p><p>Stay with us. \"The Opening Bell\" is next. Thanks, guys.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MFB-2008120301cb220</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MFB2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7W77-4H01-2PFY-H0VJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">347456</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"16803\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved. </copyright><publicationName>MONEY FOR BREAKFAST</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"12\" year=\"2008\"><dateText>December 3, 2008 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002IVU</classCode><className>ANHEUSER-BUSCH COS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000984V</classCode><className>ANHEUSER-BUSCH INBEV NV/SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0007YLT</classCode><className>VICTORIA'S SECRET CATALOG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>BUD (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>ABI (BRU)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Automakers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Bailout</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Chevy Volt</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Anheuser-Busch</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Clydesdales</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tennessee</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Chattanooga</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Volkswagen</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Banking</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Procedure</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzUxNjJDMEQ5N0YwNDMzM0JDMjEzM0UzOTYzMzI3OTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"68\"><className>General Releases</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDNDMzBDQjQxRDEzNDlENUEyQTNEMUU1MUIzNjlGNTM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjgyNjdFNTExREIwNDRFRUIyQTBENkQ3RUY0MDNDODI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"75\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OUQ4OUEwREY0NzU2NDIwQTlDQ0VDMjJDNTJERjA3QTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Media agencies control most of the media budgets for large brand owners.</p><p>According to SMI, blue-chip advertisers increased their online spending through media agencies at half the growth rate (5.8 per cent) of the 11.6 per cent increase in the IAB-PwC report. Large advertisers spent $2.07 billion in online channels in 2018 but their 5.8 per cent increase last year is a near halving of their online spending through media agencies in 2017 (up 10.1 per cent).</p><p>SMI says blue-chip advertisers are allocating 28.5 per cent of their total advertising budgets to online channels, compared with online's 54 per cent marketshare in the IAB-PwC figures.</p><p>SMI managing director Jane Ratcliffe said the vast difference in figures was due to the IAB-PwC figures capturing spending across the SME sector. \"Clearly national marketers have very different objectives to their small business counterparts,\" Ms Ratcliffe said. \"Agencies continue to allocate the bulk of their client ad spend to television (41.3 per cent) with digital representing 28.5 per cent of all national marketer media spend.\"</p><p>Still, many local online publishers large and small, are not witnessing the 11.6 per cent online advertising growth rate outlined in the IAB-PwC report for 2018.</p><p>They argue the growth is going primarily to the advertising duopoly of Facebook and Google, which the World Advertising Research Centre (WARC) forecast last month would snatch 61.4 per cent of the $287.4 billion global online ad market in 2019 between them.</p><p>WARC forecasts the worldwide online advertising sector will decline 7.2 per cent in 2019, excluding Google and Facebook, but the two online giants will collectively grow 22 per cent globally this year to account for $176 billion in advertising revenues.</p><p>\"If you dig deeper into the IAB numbers, you'll see all the upside is in Google and Facebook,\" said Bohemia Group managing director, Brett Dawson. \"That's just the lay of the land now. We've got two big players with all the data, they're really easy to buy and they're bloody cheap. Others simply don't stand a chance in the current environment. Regulation might help but I don't see that happening in the near term.\"</p><p>Mr Dawson said more mergers and acquisitions in the Australian media sector could also help local media companies and smaller publishers compete with Google and Facebook's dominance. \"We've seen News Corp and Seven get together to have a run at data and Nine's takeover of Fairfax,\" he said. \"It doesn't get you around [lower] pricing or ease of transacting though.\"</p><p>IAB CEO Gai Le Roy said there were bright spots for local media in online video and editorial-style \"native content\" but acknowledged many local and international media groups - digital \"pureplay\" publishers included - had not experienced the headline 11.6 per cent online advertising growth in the IAB's report.</p><p>\"It is tough for many in the market and we hear that regularly,\" she said. \"We're trying to find new ways for diversity and sustainability in our market. It is very important a range of players survive for the future of media and the industry.\"</p><p>Ms Le Roy said the online advertising industry's double-digit growth was \"definitely favouring players\" that could \"easily service a wide range of advertisers\". She said the online ad market was also favouring those with \"strong video offerings.\"</p><p>Ms Le Roy pointed to the TV industry's fast-growing broadcast video on demand (BVOD) category as an example of a growth hot spot although some TV executives said BVOD was at about half the $250 million category it should be. Overall, online video advertising grew 26.2 per cent last year to $1.4 billion, according to the IAB and PwC.</p><p>However, short-form video advertising, once predicted to be a boom for local publishers, had proven a false hope as Facebook and Google gained marketshare in the fast-growing category.</p><p>\"Short-form video is completely commoditised,\" said one publisher who did not want to be named. \"It's been gouged by Facebook and YouTube as a complete substitute. The market is overlooking the effectiveness of video advertising in professionally created content environments for price and questionable metrics. Facebook secondary crediting for a video view is zero seconds but people are still throwing money on social.\"</p><p>The IAB's Australian board is a challenging one for industry policy development and measurement standards. Facebook and Google both sit on the IAB board along with local publishers such as Nine, News Corp, REA, Seven West Media and Verizon Media.</p><p>Ms Le Roy said a two-speed online advertising economy, in which human-free, self-service advertising platforms offered by the big tech players had proven hugely popular with SMEs, was challenging for Australian media companies. She said the market was seeing some counter offensives from large media groups like News Corp and Nine.</p><p>\"Definitely small businesses without agencies are going to self-service platforms, which is a challenge and an opportunity for media companies,\" she said. \"We're seeing developments like Nine's Galaxy service come into play where smaller advertisers can access [advertising] inventory.\"</p><p>For CMO Brief's weekly newsletter edition on global and local conversations, perspectives and trends for the chief marketing officer, sign up at your.afr.com/cmo-brief/</p><p>Key pointsThe online advertising sector grew 11.6 per cent to $8.8 billion in calendar 2018.</p><p>Online spending growth rate for blue-chip advertisers nearly halved in that period.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc74ik7iy5dx33y8h0a0e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNF-RFX1-F0J6-J1SR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1013\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

There's Big Pharma. There's Big Tech and Big Coal and Big Banks and Big Oil. Now comes the latest major lobbying organization to throw its weight around and demonstrate the astounding hold that corporate conservatives have on all three branches of the U.S. government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Say hello to Big Baby.</p><p>The New York Times reported that during this year's World Health Assembly in May, the U.S. delegation tried to undermine a resolution encouraging women around the world to breastfeed their babies. The assembly is the annual meeting of delegates from 194 nations to the United Nations-affiliated World Health Organization.</p><p>For decades, health experts have agreed that mother's milk is better for infants than commercial baby formulas. The resolution urged member countries to regulate the misleading marketing claims of formula manufacturers. The resolution was in no way controversial until the U.S. delegation, representing the interests of Big Baby, started stirring up trouble.</p><p>Ecuador, which was scheduled to introduce the resolution, was threatened with trade retaliation and the possible withdrawal of U.S. military aid. Other nations, fearing similar threats, backed down. Eventually the Russians, of all people, agreed to introduce the resolution, and it passed mostly unchanged.</p><p>If there's any nation the Trump administration won't mess with, it's Russia.</p><p>\"We're not trying to be a hero here,\" a Russian delegate told the Times, \"but we feel that it is wrong when a big country tries to push around some very small countries, especially on an issue that is really important for the rest of the world.\"</p><p>This is the sort of thing that U.S. officials used to be able to say. Today they do the bidding of corporate interests. More than three-fourths of the U.S. baby food market is controlled by three companies: Nestle USA (Gerber), Abbott Inc. (Similac) and Mead Johnson (Enfamil). All three are part of Big Baby's $47 billion a year global market, which is expected to grow 50 percent in the next three years no matter what the World Health Assembly says.</p><p>With Donald Trump in the White House, Republicans in control of Congress and a corporate majority on the Supreme Court, business has done spectacularly. But trying to persuade mothers in the Third World to mix up baby formula -- despite having no reliable supply of clean water to mix it with -- is truly perverse.</p><p>It's the apotheosis for a movement that lay dormant during the years of the New Deal and the Great Society but began to emerge in the 1970s. Movement conservatives appropriated the word \"freedom\" as a substitute for untrammeled greed. It was truly brilliant how they did it.</p><p>They decided that the Gilded Age had it right, and that a nation's greatness should not be measured, as Gandhi said, by how it treats its weakest members, but by how much wealth its strongest members could amass. In support of this, they interpreted the U.S. Constitution's insistence on the primacy of property rights as fixed and unchanging.</p><p>The key moment came in 1976 when the Supreme Court decided that money, a measure of property, was a protected form of free speech when spent on political contributions. The loudest voices in the public square now belong to those with the most money.</p><p>Ronald Reagan became the movement's charismatic figurehead. Social issues like guns, gays and abortion (secondary concerns to most corporate conservatives) were used to divide the old Roosevelt coalition. Dog-whistle racist appeals fomented a backlash to the civil rights movement. Conservative intellectuals -- to the extent that sophistic arguments on behalf of the privileged constitute intellectualism -- were planted in universities and courtrooms. Unions, with a big assist from certain corrupt union leaders, became a bad thing -- even though collective wealth is the only counterbalance to individual wealth.</p><p>The stock market boomed. Executive compensation exploded. Blue-collar wages flatlined. A man named Leonard Leo built an obscure organization of conservative lawyers called the Federalist Society into a powerful force for the protection of corporate interests and wedge social issues. He is chiefly responsible for picking the conservative majority on the Supreme Court -- including Brett Kavanaugh, the man Trump nominated as Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's replacement.</p><p>\"Leonard Leo was a visionary,\" Tom Carter, who worked as a public relations man for Leo, told The Daily Beast. \"He figured out 20 years ago that conservatives had lost the culture war. Abortion, gay rights, contraception -- conservatives didn't have a chance if public opinion prevailed. So they needed to stack the courts.\"</p><p>Yes! Public opinion be damned. Just load up the courts with Federalist Society members and wait for the fun to begin. Steal a Supreme Court nomination. Ignore Trump's abuses as long as he supports the plutocratic agenda.</p><p>It's like taking candy from a baby. Or worse, mother's milk.</p><p>Tribune Content Agency</p><p>Kevin Horrigan, a retired member of the Post-Dispatch editorial board, is a St. Louis freelance writer. ct18 0067 180719 N S 0000000000 00001811</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHTRIB-180718349372522</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHTRIB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SV2-7651-JBG7-410F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8119</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"851\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Chicago Tribune Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Chicago Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 19, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002H8Y</classCode><className>NESTLE USA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0008GOO</classCode><className>MEAD JOHNSON NUTRITION CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>MJN (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001042</classCode><className>LOBBYING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CMP5</classCode><className>INFANTS &amp;

Now comes the latest major lobbying organization to throw its weight around and demonstrate the astounding hold that corporate conservatives have on all three branches of the U.S. government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Say hello to Big Baby.</p><p>The New York Times reported that during this year's World Health Assembly in May, the U.S. delegation tried to undermine a resolution encouraging women around the world to breastfeed their babies. The assembly is the annual meeting of delegates from 194 nations to the United Nations-affiliated World Health Organization.</p><p>For decades, health experts have agreed mother's milk is better for infants than commercial baby formulas. The resolution urged member countries to regulate the misleading marketing claims of formula manufacturers. The resolution was in no way controversial until the U.S. delegation, representing the interests of Big Baby, started stirring up trouble.</p><p>Ecuador, which was scheduled to introduce the resolution, was threatened with trade retaliation and the possible withdrawal of U.S. military aid. Other nations, fearing similar threats, backed down. Eventually the Russians, of all people, agreed to introduce the resolution and it passed mostly unchanged.</p><p>If there's any nation the Trump administration won't mess with, it's Russia.</p><p>\"We're not trying to be a hero here,\" a Russian delegate told the Times, \"but we feel that it is wrong when a big country tries to push around some very small countries, especially on an issue that is really important for the rest of the world.\"</p><p>This is the sort of thing U.S. officials used to be able to say. Today they do the bidding of corporate interests. More than three-fourths of the U.S. baby food market is controlled by just three companies: Nestle USA (Gerber), Abbott Inc. (Similac) and Mead Johnson (Enfamil). All three are part of Big Baby's $47 billion a year global market, which is expected to grow 50 percent in the next three years no matter what the World Health Assembly says.</p><p>With Donald Trump in the White House, Republicans in control of Congress and a corporate majority on the Supreme Court, business has done spectacularly. But trying to persuade mothers in the Third World to mix up baby formula - despite having no reliable supply of clean water to mix it with - is truly perverse.</p><p>It's the apotheosis for a movement that lay dormant during the years of the New Deal and the Great Society but began to emerge in the 1970s. Movement conservatives appropriated the word \"freedom\" as a substitute for untrammeled greed. It was truly brilliant how they did it.</p><p>They decided the Gilded Age had it right and a nation's greatness should not be measured, as Gandhi said, by how it treats its weakest members, but by how much wealth its strongest members could amass. In support of this, they interpreted the Constitution's insistence on the primacy of property rights as fixed and unchanging.</p><p>The key moment came in 1976 when the Supreme Court decided that money, a measure of property, was a protected form of free speech when spent on political contributions. The loudest voices in the public square now belong to those with the most money.</p><p>Ronald Reagan became the movement's charismatic figurehead. Social issues like guns, gays and abortion (secondary concerns to most corporate conservatives) were used to divide the old Roosevelt coalition. Dog- whistle racist appeals fomented a backlash to the civil rights movement. Conservative intellectuals - to the extent that sophistic arguments on behalf of the privileged constitute intellectualism - were planted in universities and courtrooms. Unions, with a big assist from certain corrupt union leaders, became a bad thing - even though collective wealth is the only counterbalance to individual wealth.</p><p>The stock market boomed. Executive compensation exploded. Blue- collar wages flatlined. A man named Leonard Leo built an obscure organization of conservative lawyers called the Federalist Society into a powerful force for the protection of corporate interests and wedge social issues. He is chiefly responsible for picking the conservative majority on the Supreme Court - including Brett Kavanaugh, the man Trump nominated as Justice Anthony Kennedy's replacement.</p><p>\"Leonard Leo was a visionary,\" Tom Carter, who worked as a public relations man for Leo, told the Daily Beast. \"He figured out 20 years ago that conservatives had lost the culture war. Abortion, gay rights, contraception - conservatives didn't have a chance if public opinion prevailed. So they needed to stack the courts.\"</p><p>Yes. Public opinion be damned. Just load up the courts with Federalist Society members and wait for the fun to begin. Steal a Supreme Court nomination. Ignore Trump's abuses as long as he supports the plutocratic agenda.</p><p>It's like taking candy from a baby. Or worse, mother's milk.</p><p>Horrigan, a retired member of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial board, is a freelance writer. He wrote this for the Post-Dispatch.</p><p>Distributed by Tribune Content Agency.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCT-07191805art2xml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289793532C3DD9 NWBKCT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SV3-V4Y1-DXVP-V4CB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399541</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"850\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Chronicle Printing Company<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

There are some deeply dystopian concerns occupying Mr Soros and other like-minded critics, including the prospect that \"IT monopolies\" could facilitate \"totalitarian control the likes of which not even Aldous Huxley or George Orwell could have imagined\". But from an investment perspective, perhaps the most tangible part of Mr Soros's Davos tirade was his argument that big technology companies are bad for competition and consumers, and \"undermine the efficiency of the market economy\".</p><p>Because \"Facebook and Google effectively control over half of all internet advertising revenue\", content providers have to use their platforms and \"accept whatever terms they are offered\" helping these big tech firms generate \"exceptional profitability\". In Mr Soros' view they are \"near-monopoly distributors\" and should be regulated as though they were public utilities with the objective of \"preserving competition, innovation, and fair and open universal access\".</p><p>What's more, the tech titans' control of data and their ability to use it to manipulate users for \"their own commercial purposes\" allows them to \"use discriminatory pricing to keep for themselves more of the benefits that otherwise they would have to share with consumers\".</p><p>The mounting concern about tech giants that exploit \"network effects\", such as the so-called FANGs - Facebook (US:FB), Amazon (US:AMZN), Netflix (US:NFLX) and Google parent Alphabet (US:GOOGL) - comes at a time when a broader rethink about the role of anti-trust law appears to be under way. A recent Brookings Institute paper provides some stark numbers to illustrate the growing concentration in many industries, including IT. Indeed, the share of US GDP accounted for by Fortune 500 companies has increased from 58 per cent to 73 per cent since 1980, and whereas the top 60 companies accounted for less than a fifth of GDP in 1954, now the top 20 alone account for over a fifth.</p><p>The problem with this, according to the Brookings paper, is that increased concentration may have benefited corporate profits at the expense of wages, consumer welfare and business investment. Indeed, the paper points out that \"labour and capital share have been declining simultaneously between 1984 and 2014, offset by rising profits in the non-financial corporate sector\".</p><p>While the enforcement of antitrust laws experienced a shift away from broader consumer welfare and political considerations from the 1970s, the Brookings paper sees a brewing populist backlash and \"recent developments on Capitol Hill [that] suggest a serious re-evaluation of the purposes and powers of antitrust law and enforcement has begun\".</p><p>A key reason this debate is relevant to investors is that the rise in monopolistic corporate power may be an important factor behind elevated levels of profitability in the US and other developed markets. That means changes in antitrust laws could have a real, albeit slow and grinding, impact on equity market returns. Arguably of more immediate significance, though, is the fact the FANGs now appear clearly in many influential people's sights. Given their popularity as investments and their weighting in key US and global indices, that's significant. The issue is succinctly summed up by Jonathan Ruffer in the latest investment view from his eponymous firm.</p><p>\"Two thousand years ago, stability was threatened by marauders who could overpower the local authority of a distant power. Today, those marauders take a different form: they are the corporate 'disruptors' - the Amazons, Facebooks, Twitters, Ubers which have discountenanced governments, who are unable to stop them conversing across borders, changing the way business is done, how conversations are constructed, all the while avoiding tax. In many investment climates, they would trade at low ratings - the judgement being the speed at which they could grow while conditions remain favourable, counterbalanced by the danger of their business model being de-railed by nonmarket forces. Today's market looks only at the element which is benign for the disruptors - but there will be a fight back. We are already seeing one against Uber where the authorities are increasingly imaginative in their resistance to their business model. They remain dangerous investments - remember Minister Fouquet, who overreached himself on seventeenth century France's milch cows, and who hosted a dinner for Louis XIV, and 7,000 others. Too lavish, thought the king, and Fouquet spent the next 19 years in prison, no doubt on a modest price/earnings ratio.\"</p><p>WHERE TO FIND THE PIECES MENTIONED \u00a6 George Soros Davos speech transcript, 25 January 2018: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.georgesoros.com/2018/01/25/remarks-delivered-atthe-world-economic-forum/\">https://www.georgesoros.com/2018/01/25/remarks-delivered-atthe-world-economic-forum/</url>\u00a6 A policy at peace with itself: Antitrust remedies for our concentrated, uncompetitive economy, William A Galston and Clara Hendrickson, 5 January 2018:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brookings.edu/research/a-policy-at-peace-with-itselfantitrust-remedies-for-our-concentrated-uncompetitive-economy/\">https://www.brookings.edu/research/a-policy-at-peace-with-itselfantitrust-remedies-for-our-concentrated-uncompetitive-economy/</url>\u00a6 Ruffer investment review, Jonathan Ruffer, January 2018:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ruffer.co.uk/about/investment-review\">https://www.ruffer.co.uk/about/investment-review</url></p><p>\"IT monopolies\" could facilitate \"totalitarian control the likes of which not even Aldous Huxley or George Orwell could have imagined\" ;</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVSTR-134404537</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVSTR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RKX-7801-JBVM-Y4B5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"944\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investors Chronicle - magazine and web content</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59206\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 9, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Amazon and Alibaba will do a lot of bank-like activities, but they will never move into full-service banking, as in offering deposit accounts. Why won't they?</p><p> Because that's full banking activity which has all of the audit and compliance overhead that Big tech giants don't want. The average technology firm in America has five times less regulation than the average American bank, and that's a key point. Another key point is that most of the Big Tech giants have a major chunk of market focused upon banks as customers. A huge chunk of Amazon and Alibaba's cloud-based services are used by banks, and a massive amount of Google and Facebook advertising comes from financial firms. Why would you bite the hand that feeds you? But then there's another nuance that I've been thinking about and haven't seen played out until now. If I were a bank, why wouldn't I partner with the Big Tech giants and help them offer banking? If I were a bank and did that, then such a partnership would sidestep the competition and put them on the back foot. After all, if Amazon partnered with my bank to offer banking then they wouldn't need my competition. I would have the upper hand and my competition would be left for dust. Well, finally, that's happened. If you didn't see it last week, JPMorgan announced[1] that they had forged partnerships with Amazon and Airbnb to help them offer bank services. It's basically an ewallet that technology companies can give to their customers to use as virtual bank accounts. The JPMorgan product gives 'tech companies the ability to provide millions of customers virtual bank accounts and to offer perks such as car loans or discounts on home rentals to those who keep money stashed there. The more customers use their virtual accounts to pay for services, the less the companies would have to spend on payment-processing fees to third parties such as JPMorgan.' Fantastic. However, that's not the end of the game as JPMorgan has not yet gained all the partners they hope. It's targeting the biggest e-commerce and gig economy companies such as Amazon, Uber, Airbnb and eBay, but it has not yet signed them all up and, even if they did, there may be wiggle room to see these companies choose alternative providers over time. So, is this how it all plays out? Does this mean that the battle for the future of banking will be between Big Banks vying for the best partnerships with Big Tech? In short, yes. That's exactly what I see happening. Big banks need to have the biggest platforms as partners. The platforms don't want to be big banks. They need to stick to their knitting. But Big Tech needs to offer payments, loans, credit, savings and financial services and the best way for them to do that is to find a big bank partner whose products they can white label. That is happening folks. JPMorgan's ewallet announcement is exactly this. Therefore, expect lots of moves amongst the big bank crowd to forge partnerships with the Big Tech giants over the next decade. That's where the battleground for the consumer lies and exactly where banks will focus.Postnote: this is kind of a follow-up to last week's Big Banks versus Big Tech[2] post Posted on: November 11, 2019 [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-06/jpmorgan-has-a-plan-to-help-amazon-airbnb-look-more-like-banks\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-06/jpmorgan-has-a-plan-to-help-amazon-airbnb-look-more-like-banks</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://thefinanser.com/2019/11/big-banks-versus-big-tech-its-all-about-the-money.html/\">https://thefinanser.com/2019/11/big-banks-versus-big-tech-its-all-about-the-money.html/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-FSCB107998157345773694575776100119</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FSCB-6705</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGD-PGJ1-F03R-N1BJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"597\"/><timeReceived>7:35 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>The Finanser by Chris Skinner</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 11, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

And joining me to break it all down: Fox Business Networks' Jackie DeAngelis, Real Clear Politics co-founder and president Tom Bevin; and PWC partner Mitch Roschelle. Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good MORNING. Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're waiting on Morgan Stanley earnings. Your take on what the banking sector has looked like so far? It's been a mixed story, I guess. But what's your take in terms of what you're seeing? Bank of America yesterday.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: I think very strong from an economic perspective because the consumers have been driving the earnings of all the banks that have been reporting. And the consumer is anywhere from two- thirds to 75 percent of the economic expansion that we're seeing in the U.S.</p><p>So I think that bodes well for the economy. May not bode well for the banks because some of the pieces of their business are falling because the yield curve is not exactly cooperative for the banking industry. But I think it's good for the economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then what happens when the fed cuts rates in two weeks. We're going to talk with Tom Brown really -- a student of the banks for many, many years coming up this morning.</p><p>And joining us this morning, my exclusive interview coming up with Kentucky Senator and Senate Majority Leader, Mitch McConnell. Home Depot co-founder and NYU Ken Langone Health board of trustees member Ken Langone is here on healthcare in America. And the Senator from Oklahoma James Lankford.</p><p>Don't miss a moment of it. We've got a big program coming up here.</p><p>Joining us right now is Second Curve Capital CEO Tom Brown. And Tom -- it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks for being here.</p><p>TOM BROWN, CEO, SECOND CURVE CAPITAL: Nice to see you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How would you characterize the banks so far in this quarter?</p><p>BROWN: I think it's a pretty good characterization. So very strong results. If you think about you're talking about 15 to 18 percent returns on equity.</p><p>Bank of America yesterday, 17 percent earnings per share growth. So I think the industry and the big banks in particular are doing very well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You called B of A a long time ago. You've been liking that stock, I know that. It's a big week for all the banks obviously we had JP Morgan Chase, you mentioned Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup -- all helping to lift the sector after beating the estimates on the top and the bottom line.</p><p>What about the second half? We've got the Federal Reserve going to cut rates in two weeks. What does that do to all of this?</p><p>BROWN: Earnings go down. Not down on an absolute basis but certainly the flatter yield curve and lower interest rates on an absolute basis are going to be tougher for net interest margins and for them to grow their earnings per share.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: If you're running one of those banks and you know that the yield curve is flat, if not slightly inverted, and rates are going to come down potentially, how do you adjust the business model a little bit for the rest of the year to try to pick up revenue or earnings in other parts of the business?</p><p>BROWN: You do what bank of New York did yesterday and what Brian Moynihan said yesterday which is we're going to be tighter on expenses. But there really are no options.</p><p>Now, a negative inverted yield curve is not normal. So it will too change and that's what I think they have to do is just wait it out until we get back to a more normal environment.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Tom -- you look at some of the big banks, the stock prices year-to-date: Citigroup 36 percent increase, Goldman Sachs 27 percent, B of A 18 percent -- I'm just wondering if you feel like these stocks are a little overdone here even though we're seeing strong earnings.</p><p>BROWN: Heck no.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bring it on. You want more.</p><p>They had the worst December that they've ever experienced. So you know, the book ends are very important. So we're coming off of a period where the stocks peaked in about May of last year relative to the market on an absolute basis. So we're just beginning to recover.</p><p>On average, you're paying 17 times earnings for a company in the S&amp;P 500. And for a large bank, you're paying 8 to 11 times earnings. So still looks to me like --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Why? Why are they trading at such a discount to the rest of the market then?</p><p>BROWN: I think -- there's so much concern about an inverted yield curve and a recession. So a recession brings higher losses. And that's the biggest swing factor for bank earnings is a higher loan loss provision. Just don't see that. No signs on my radar screen.</p><p>MITCHELLE: Right. No one talks about it in any of the earnings releases. In fact, delinquencies and some of the banks were better than expected.</p><p>BROWN: Right, right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you saying you don't expect a recession?</p><p>BROWN: No. I think the only thing that shows you or would scare you about a possible recession is the inverted yield curve. But besides that, I mean again, you mentioned the strength of the consumer, it's incredible with employment being as strong as it is and incomes being -- going up and the balance sheets are better than we've ever seen. So it's a strong environment for the consumer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: When you look at a company like Morgan Stanley which we're waiting on coming out with earnings any second here, wealth management has been real important. They've done a great job in terms of gathering assets. Is that where the growth in the business is, wealth management? How do you characterize this move?</p><p>I mean UBS was really the first to really bone up on wealth management and gain assets.</p><p>BROWN: Yes. If you think about it, Maria -- 10 years ago and how much Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have changed, it's really incredible. Goldman Sachs spending a $1.3 billion to become a retail bank. And Morgan Stanley really converting the company into more of an asset manager than an investment bank. It's really been remarkable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And he's done a great job with that, certainly when you compare to where the CEO was in the throes of the recession, the worst financial crisis we've seen.</p><p>So do you expect a good number from Morgan? What are you expecting in terms of the most important issues to look at once the number hits the tape.</p><p>BROWN: I think what most people will be focused on is that revenue number that you mentioned, just under $10 billion. I think it would be nice to see it over $10 billion. But there's a lot of just -- the short-term swing factors are going to take that one way or the other.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So any stocks that you want to own right here? I know you like Bank of -- you still like B of A.</p><p>BROWN: Still like b of a. Still like Citi. There's an incredible number, there's eight large banks where the combination of their trailing 12-month dividend yield, plus the amount that they're reducing their capital stock is over 9 percent and they're trading at less than one and-a-half times tangible book value. So it's an industry that is generating a lot of excess capital. They're using it to return to shareholders and the valuations of the companies overall are low and particularly relative to the market.</p><p>MITCHELLE: Tom, we were talking about the big banks but how about the regional banks. They sort of get lost in the headlines during earnings season. Is there anything in the regional banks that's really interesting to you?</p><p>BROWN: Sure. I love what I would call niche regional banks. We had one last night that reported their earnings called -- a company called Tri- State Capital. And what they do is they have no branches. They're just a business lender on one side and they make personal loans on the other side. A company that's growing 15 to 25 percent a year on the bottom line.</p><p>So there are, you know, still 5,200 banks in this country and what I love about being an analyst for 30 years is that there's always a great story out there. You can always find a good, well-managed company that's doing something different.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And there could be a deal in a lot of those regionals, right? I mean, you know, these companies are not facing the cap that the largest are in terms of acquiring more deposits.</p><p>BROWN: Well, you were talking about that yesterday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I was, with Anton Schutz. And Anton thinks that we're going to see a lot of deals in the small and regional banks. Do you think that?</p><p>BROWN: You can always say yes because there's always 200 deals a year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go.</p><p>BROWN: I'm going to go yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Tom -- well, we hope you'll stick around. Morgan Stanley numbers are coming out. We want to get your reaction when they do. Tom -- thank you.</p><p>Tom Brown joining us there.</p><p>Coming up -- Securing the border, 2,100 troops headed to the U.S./Mexico border. Senate Homeland Security Committee member Senator James Lankford will weigh in coming up.</p><p>Then buy now, pay later -- American Eagle rolls out a lay-away plantar plan targeting its top shoppers, including millennials and young people. Details right after this. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>A deadly fire at a Japanese animation studio. Cheryl Casone with the details this morning -- Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: At least 13 people are confirmed dead, Maria. Ten others presumed dead in the suspected case of arson. About 35 others were injured. Some of them critically. Police in japan say the man that -- the suspect that started the fire is being treated at one of the hospitals there. But there's no word yet on a motive for this attack, they feel like.</p><p>2020 election day more than a year away but Microsoft says it has already detected nearly 750 attempts to infiltrate U.S. political parties' campaigns and think tanks. Microsoft won't name the targets but they say all of them are protected by the company's service that identifies cyber threats.</p><p>There's Microsoft, a little lower in the premarket of course. That's a company that's on earnings watch for us this week.</p><p>American Eagle is helping cash-strapped consumers. The outfitter planning to offer a buy now, pay later service. Shoppers are going to be able to make a purchase, pay for it in installments. Analysts say buy now, pay later encourages shoppers to spend more money, appealing to those younger shoppers who have less of that disposable income.</p><p>Back in the day, they called it lay-away -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Or use your credit card.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. You could pay that one in installments. But ok.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's funny. Anything to give the younger shopper to spend money -- Jackie.</p><p>DEANGELIS: It's sort of a reinvention of an old concept. But what was so interesting especially as we talk about the consumer and the bank earnings is that consumers are out there and they're spending. And they're using and swiping those credit cards and that's what's so important right now.</p><p>And I think the fed will look at that also because he's watching the inflation target very closely and it will say, you know, things don't seem as bad as they did, say, two or three months ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. You're right. Happy to have Tom Brown this morning with us. And Tom -- when you look at the housing market as through the eyes of perhaps Bank of America or Wells -- what is happening with the consumer in terms of housing.</p><p>BROWN: So the single family housing starts came out yesterday and the single family starts were strong, multifamily was weak and I do think we had over-building nationally in the multifamily sector. But the single family sector with these mortgage rates doing pretty well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. (INAUDIBLE) had the same sentiment yesterday when he joined us.</p><p>All right. Quick break. We're waiting on Morgan Stanley earnings and we're also zeroing in on the budget battle. The House Speaker facing off against Trump administration over government spending.</p><p>Then this, Oklahoma Senator James Lankford will join me next on the shutdown showdown coming up.</p><p>Plus Netflix nail biter, the company loses subscribers in the U.S. -- what's behind that decline. we'll talk about it as the stock is down 11.5 percent right now. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>That buildup at the border, the Pentagon is announcing it is sending more than 2,000 national guard troops to the southern border. The additional troops will bring the number to nearly 6,000 at the border.</p><p>During his rally in North Carolina last night, the president doubled down on the need for tighter border security and that wall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Unemployment among Hispanic Americans where we're doing really well, you know why, because they want a strong border. They want it because they understand the border better than anybody. They want that strong border. They want that wall that's being built right now.</p><p>They want that wall. And they really do. They understand the border better than anybody. And they don't want criminals coming in. They don't want crime coming in. They don't want to lose their jobs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: This as a new political Morning Consult poll is showing a majority of voters, 51 percent, support the president's plan for deportations and ICE raids.</p><p>Joining me right now is senate finance and homeland security and appropriations committee member, Oklahoma Senator James Lankford. Senator -- it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>SENATOR JAMES LANKFORD (R), OKLAHOMA: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are you expecting in terms of these troops going to the border? Do you expect that we're going to see a change in this crisis situation any time soon?</p><p>LANKFORD: No, it's continued support for what's happening there. The troops that are going to the border are not going there for actual law enforcement activities. We have Customs and Border Patrol, we have law enforcement there.</p><p>They're going for humanitarian relief. They're going for additional assistance. They're going to do some of the next layer behind all the law enforcement.</p><p>So we still have to have additional law enforcement individuals to be able to help us through this process. But with this many thousands and thousands, upwards of 4,000 a day that are crossing the border illegally, we've got to have places to be able to help manage all these folks, ways to be able to process them in the best way possible.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's just incredible. We're showing pictures now of me in El Paso. I took the show to the border a couple of months ago. And it was incredible to see these kids put in these dangerous positions. What are you going to do as your colleagues on the left seem to not see this as the urgent situation that it appears to be and are not in any hurry to change those loopholes.</p><p>LANKFORD: That's the painful part of this journey. For months the Trump administration said over and over again this is a humanitarian crisis. We're having children trafficked.</p><p>Months ago Democrats were saying it's all manufactured. This is all because of President Trump and his rhetoric. But now they're finally turning around and seeing the humanitarian issues, finally voting for additional support that we've been asking for for months.</p><p>But they still won't acknowledge the human trafficking that's going on where we have thousands of kids that are being repeated in the border, where they'll come across with one adult, then be sent back across to the trafficker and bring another adult across.</p><p>Some of these children, we don't know where they are. We have some children that the border patrol has reported they were actually purchased in other villages and brought across and they have no relation and no idea where to return these kids.</p><p>The loophole in our system is if you cross the border with a child, you get into the country. So that encourages adults that want to get into the country to get their hands on a child and to be able to bring them across so they can get in the country.</p><p>We've got to close that loophole. And so far Democrats have said they want to leave the border open, they want to leave that exposed. Over half of the adults that are coming now are bringing a child with them and the vast majority of minors that are coming across now that are males claim to be 17 years old.</p><p>We don't know if they're 25 or if they're 17. They have no documentation. When they walk across the border, they say I'm 17 because they know if they say that, they're going to get in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, somebody is training them to say what they're saying, right. So what are you going to do about it? I mean how does this play out when there's so much infighting going on within Washington. I mean you look at the Democratic Party, they can't even get together. They're divided with the progressives turning up the heat and then the moderates are fighting with Republicans.</p><p>So do you just need to win another election in 2020 to -- in order to get the wherewithal to change these loopholes?</p><p>LANKFORD: So there are several things that have got to happen. One is the Democrats have obviously got to figure if they're for open borders or not. They said for years they're not for open borders but their new progressives clearly are. They want to abolish ICE. They don't want to do enforcement interior/exterior.</p><p>There's a couple things that have to happen that will slow this down. One is the administration is already working with Guatemala and Mexico to allow that to be a third country for asylum seekers. So if you're coming from anywhere but Mexico, as you come through Guatemala and you come to Mexico you have to request asylum in those locations. That's the international norm. That's not anything different.</p><p>That's the same thing that happened all over the world that when you're seeking asylum, you go to the next country that will accept you. That will make an enormous difference on this. Doing ICE enforcement, what the President is asking to do is just enforcing deportations where an individual has gone through the entire due process system in a court of law and said no, you don't qualify to be here.</p><p>If you want to come to the United States you have to do it legally. Enforcing interior is the other way to be able to get this going.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we let in, what, a million people legally that go through the process, getting the green card, et cetera, every year. Is that right.</p><p>LANKFORD: That's right. It's about 1.1 million people -- that's been processed to get legal permits -- that's about 700,000 actually go through citizenship every single year which are amazing ceremonies. We're wide up in the country for immigration if you do it legally.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Right. And now you're talking about a million apprehensions on the illegal side. It's just extraordinary.</p><p>LANKFORD: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look, I have to turn to the clock is ticking and the potential shutdown showdown. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi setting a deadline for tomorrow for a deal on spending and the debt ceiling. Congress and President hoping to avoid a government shutdown before the Congress recesses on August 5th.</p><p>Last month the Homeland Security Committee advanced the Prevent Government Shutdown Act. Tell me about that and what you're expecting in term of budget deal.</p><p>LANKFORD: So we've been trying to be able to get a budget deal, just the top-line number. It doesn't get all the details on it. We can't get the first number though, agree most with everybody. If we can get that done in the next week then we get on to the 12 appropriation bills. We still have to get 12 appropriation bills done by September 30th or we're facing another government shutdown.</p><p>We've got 21 government shutdowns in 40 years. This is not new. It continues to happen. What I propose is simple proposal. If we get to the end of the fiscal year, we shouldn't hold federal workers hostage basically in this process. They don't know what their job prospect is. The American people shouldn't be able to feel it. Congress should.</p><p>So what I pushed is a simple criteria. Get to the end of the fiscal year, Congress has to stay in continuous session until we actually get the budget done. At the same time, we have what's called a continuing resolution that keeps budget spending the exact same as last year but Congress can't leave. Weekends, weekdays, we're in session, no one can travel until the budget negotiations are done.</p><p>It's pretty straightforward. Most people can't leave work until the work is done. Congress for some reason leaves on weekends even when they're shutdowns. If we stay here, we'll keep negotiations done and get it done better.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. So you think that will be enough to keep people in town to work on this. It's a spending problem, largely. So is it once again the pushback on military spending?</p><p>LANKFORD: It is. Democrats want to spend as much on nonmilitary as we spend on military. We as republicans have pushed back and said we should spend on what is strategic, what we need to spend on, that just some arbitrary number that if we need to spend more on Defense then we should spend more on every other single line item. That doesn't make sense.</p><p>And so Democrats continue to push what they call dollar for dollar increases. If you want to do more defense spending, you've got to do more increase and everything else. I think we should be more strategic. That has been the big fight.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And in terms of the defense spending, what's the argument to continue to raise the number on Defense spending? I recognize we've got more issues today in terms of foreign affairs than we ever have when you look at Iran and you look at China and the other threats out there.</p><p>But make the case for keeping the spending levels where you want them on defense.</p><p>LANKFORD: So on defense, we're still trying to recover from the time of the Obama administration where they did drastic cuts in defense. And that was their focus is where they can push dollars away from Defense. So we're still recapitalizing. We still have to get to our troop levels to be correct.</p><p>We're facing very different threats now as we have a rising China, we have a rising Iran. So we need to make sure that we are prepared to be defensive in that to say don't attack us, don't come at us because we're fully ready to defend ourselves and our country.</p><p>A stronger defense in those areas that people know that we can respond deters people from actually engaging in war in the first place. So if we show our selves weak and not ready for the battle, that encourages people to bring the battle to us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Senator real quick before you go -- is the fight on the left between AOC and Pelosi or the squad and Pelosi is that just noise or is this underlining a fundamental difference in governing.</p><p>LANKFORD: No, it's a fundamental difference in governing. The total grip of progressives that have come into the House, they're not only trying to take over the House. They are really the leaders of the House at this point. The House doesn't move unless they give permission to everyone else to be able to move.</p><p>All the presidential candidates on the Democratic side have come to them for support. They are also fund raising to be able to primary most Democrats in the country. So they've not only taken on the position in the House, they're trying to take out every other Democrat and bring in people that agree with them.</p><p>So this is a fundamental shift that we're watching in the Democratic Party towards a more socialist left. Left of even where they are. In fact I had a Democrat House member to me the other day said Nancy Pelosi is now the moderate in our conference because so many of the new Democrats are so far left and they're really running the conference.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And Nancy Pelosi is really not a moderate.</p><p>M2; She is certainly not a moderate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Senator -- it's good to have you on the program this morning. Thanks so much.</p><p>LANKFORD: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: James Lankford joining us.</p><p>Be sure to stick around for my exclusive interview with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. He's coming up live this morning at 8:00 a.m. Eastern. Join us for that.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Breaking news, Morgan Stanley out with its second quarter numbers. Let's get right to Lauren Simonetti with the numbers, Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: OK, this is a double beat, earnings per share, $1.23 versus the estimate, Maria, which was $1.14. Revenue was a beat, coming in at $10.24 billion in the second quarter versus the expectation of $9.99 billion. The stock is down one percent. Trading revenue in the quarter, down 17 percent at $2.73 billion. Investment banking revenue big for Morgan Stanley, coming in at $1.59 billion. And asset management net revenue, $3.22 billion.</p><p>Most of the business that Morgan Stanley gets, most of the revenue from those businesses comes from fees. So I'm looking also to see if we get anything on fees just yet. But this is the last of the major banks to report and it looks like the numbers, although the stock reaction is a little better now, still negative. The numbers on the top and bottom line did beat, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, maybe the reaction is because of the decline in trading revenue, Lauren. Thank you. Lauren Simonetti. Tom Brown is with us this morning from Second Curve Capital, really an expert on this sector, your reaction.</p><p>TOM BROWN, FOUNDER AND CEO, SECOND CURVE CAPITAL: My first reaction is that that's a much better mix with an earnings beat than you would expect, just hearing the revenue side of things. So that it was a tough trading quarter, so that's not to be -- to be -- and we're not surprised about that. But the fees were impressive.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's interesting to see trading under such pressure. You got a market that is at record levels, right? I mean, this market continues to go higher, an economy that's doing well and yet trading has been dogged for the last several quarters.</p><p>BROWN: Well, I'd say the last several years, the coming out of the great recession and the passing of the new regulations, the banks have been put much less capital, low proprietary capital at risk on the trading desk.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: So, the retail side of the business is an also competition, people flocking to discount trading firms as opposed to the bigger firms, is that impacting the revenue (INAUDIBLE)?</p><p>BROWN: Well, there's so many factors impacting. You know, we've got movement from active to passive. There's just a lot of changes going on in the asset management business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Morgan is going back and forth. The investor reaction was positive a second ago, now it's negative again. We'll keep watching this. Is this a stock that you would -- you would buy right here, Tom?</p><p>BROWN: It would be, because, you know, I like all the big banks in this environment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But it's not your fave?</p><p>BROWN: No, it's not my favorite.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's not your top 10? Tom, it's good to have you.</p><p>BROWN: Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. Tom Brown from Second Curve Capital.</p><p>We want to turn to the president's fiery campaign rally last night in North Carolina. He covered a lot of topics. At one point blasting the 2020 Democratic candidates. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Sleepy Joe's not looking too good. Pocahontas is gaining a little bit because we probably used the Pocahontas a little bit too early but that's OK. We'll bring it out of retirement very soon.</p><p>Bernie, let me save you s lot of time and effort, Bernie. You missed your time. It got taken from you four years ago, Bernie. Not doing too well. He's not doing too well but that's OK. I've got to hand it to him, he's up there ranting and raving and going like a lunatic.</p><p>And then you have got a young guy, Buttigieg. They're saying how to say his name boot, edge, edge. He's a beauty. He runs a failed city.</p><p>A vote for any Democrat in 2020 is a vote for the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tom Bevan is here for RealClearPolitics. Say now, you got -- you got to give him some credit in terms of pointing out some truths in terms some of these policies on the left but he's funny.</p><p>TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Trump is the ultimate showman, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BEVAN: He goes there and he puts on a show and the crowd loves it. You can see them reacting to the name calling and the nicknames and all that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But what about the fundamentals of what he's saying?</p><p>BEVAN: The fundamentals is exactly, I mean, that's -- that is -- that is the core of his argument, right? And we saw this just in your interview with Senator Lankford in terms of these radical socialists are running the House of Representatives, right. Nancy Pelosi is considered the moderate and she's no longer even driving the bus. And so, that's the core that this election is going to be fought around.</p><p>And again, Trump is -- Trump is betting it all. He's putting all the chips in on the idea that this was a winner for him again, particularly in those rust belt states where this election is going to be decided among the sort of middle class voters propelled them to election.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Even Tom Friedman in the New York Times yesterday said, look, stop, stop to the squad. Do you think they understand what they're doing to the Democratic Party? Do you think they understand that, you know, it shouldn't be all about them? I mean, it feels like they want more attention on T.V., Jackie, than actual policies.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I know. I don't think they really do and I think they're making it so extreme in terms of what happens in the election, it's going to end up hurting them. I think it's as you said before, it's really all about them, it's all about the headlines.</p><p>You know, for AOC it's all about getting herself out there and thinking about what her next move is and unfortunately that's going to be a problem for the party.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you agree with that?</p><p>BEVAN: I do. These are folks that are not interested in compromise or pragmatism. They're interested in revolution, they're interested in moving the party to the left.</p><p>And meanwhile, you've got Nancy Pelosi is trying to protect her majority. You've got 34 House Democrats who won in Trump districts that are up for re-election again. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the squad don't really seem to care about those folks. They care about driving the party to the left.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And Tom, forget about Trump's base but just the middle of the road Democrats and the middle of the road Republicans, does this not activate them to get out there and support candidates who speak to them as opposed to what they're speaking to, which is not them?</p><p>BEVAN: Sure. I mean, Trump is such a unique figure. You see those clips on T.V. He fires up his base but he fires up the Democrats, you know, incredibly. I mean, they watch the stuff and they can't wait to go to the polls.</p><p>And the question is how do -- how do the folks who really don't pay attention to elections, they don't get engaged until the final, you know, 10 weeks or 12 weeks, how are they going to react to the economy if it stays good? I mean, his policies but also his style and whether that stuff that makes people cringe when he uses nicknames or they hear these chance of senator back, whether that's going to keep those folks at home or whether remove them in one direction or another.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look, we've got to talk about former late-night host Jon Stewart, he is slamming GOP senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee for delaying the vote on the 9/11 victims fund of Fox News last night. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JON STEWART, 9/11 FIRST RESPONDERS ADVOCATE, FORMER LATE-NIGHT HOST: Pardon me if I'm not impressed in anyway by Rand Paul's fiscal responsibility virtue signaling. And now he stands up at the last minute after 15 years of blood, sweat and tears from the 9/11 community, to say that it's all over now, now we're going to balance the budget on the backs of the 9/11 first responder community.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Does anybody here disagree with that? It's hard to --</p><p>DEANGELIS: It's hard to.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- it's hard to disagree with him. What do you think?</p><p>BEVAN: Yes, I mean, fiscal restraint is not in vogue in Washington right now. And although in Rand Paul's defense, Rand Paul --</p><p>BARTIROMO: But with the 9/11 compensation fund, I mean, come on.</p><p>BEVAN: Exactly. Not at all, I mean, we're spending tons of money on tons of other things that are probably less important than that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>BEVAN: So why not go ahead and fund that. But in Rand Paul's defense, he had -- you know, and Jon Stewart makes fun of him, but Rand Paul has been - - this has been an issue that he's been brought into Congress and he's been -- he's been consistent on overtime.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I feel like he's been the only one.</p><p>BEVAN: Yes, one of the only ones in Congress. So, it's a principle thing for him.</p><p>DEANGELIS: That's a broader conversation we certainly need to have. But this isn't the place to make the point though, I mean, you could argue that for sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, not the place now to start talking about pulling in spending when in fact this 9/11 compensation fund is important and there are people out there suffering.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I can't find any of the tea party folks who were put on this planet to bring fiscal responsibility and trying to balance the budget, they all voted ways differently than they campaigned for originally, so.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll take a quick break. When we come back, Netflix stock is plunging this morning, the company hit by a loss of subscribers in the U.S., what the company is saying about that now.</p><p>And then hot diggity Airbnb, the company on a roll celebrating the frankfurter with some top dog recommendations and accommodations, stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Drug overdose deaths appear to be falling in the United States. Cheryl Casone on headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right, Maria. Preliminary data from the CDC shows that overdose deaths for last year fell for the first time in nearly three decades. About 68,000 overdose deaths were reported last year. but for context, the number topped 70,000 back in 2017. The improvement in part driven by a drop in deaths from heroin and prescription pain killers.</p><p>Instagram is expanding its hidden like test. As in when you hit the heart on an Instagram post, if you don't know. The company confirmed on Twitter, it wants to find out if hiding the like counts that people get can help users in Brazil, Ireland, Australia, Italy, New Zealand and Japan. Instagram says they want followers to pay attention to users' photos and videos and not the number of likes that they get. So yes, folks, it's not all about you. It's about other people. OK, I had to throw that.</p><p>And here's an idea that you can relish. If you love hot dogs, why not spend the night in one. Yes, Oscar Mayer is offering fans a chance to sleep in a 27-foot long Wienermobile. The offer is only for a limited time by Airbnb. The hot dog hotel open from August first to the fourth in Chicago. $136 a night. I hope it has air conditioning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So funny.</p><p>CASONE: I dare somebody on the show or maybe I'll just go do it, go check it out for show.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, why not? Just for fun.</p><p>CASONE: All by myself, I'll go sleep in it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks, Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Would you do it?</p><p>DEANGELIS: It's a bargain.</p><p>BEVAN: Yes.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: 100 percent, I would do that.</p><p>BEVAN: A fun fact.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, give us some fun fact.</p><p>BEVAN: Paul Ryan is one of his first jobs that he got in college, he drove the Wienermobile around the country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's hilarious.</p><p>BEVAN: I know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>DEANGELIS: On the Instagram story, just to switch gears --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Only to become speaker of the House.</p><p>DEANGELIS: -- if you take the like feature away, I think you kill the whole purpose of the app. So, I'm glad they're testing it but I'm not sure it's so wise.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I don't know why they came up with that idea.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Without the like, have you no Instagram.</p><p>DEANGELIS: You're right, I mean, that's the whole point.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: These people post pictures because they want people to like them.</p><p>DEANGELIS: People would be stroked. That's what it's for.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>BEVAN: I think the most important story that Cheryl just talked about, that was the opioid --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, sure.</p><p>BEVAN: -- overdose deaths. We're maybe getting -- finally getting a handle on the opioid crisis in this country because it's been raging for decades.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's definitely in a priority of this administration, haven't it? All right, we'll take a break. When we come back, content concerns, Netflix losing customers, the reasons behind the slowdown next and why the stock is down 11 percent this morning. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Netflix earnings, the stock is down 10 percent after reporting underwhelming growth the number of people subscribing to Netflix in the United States. Down for the first time in nearly a decade.</p><p>Joining us right now is the Wall Street Journal's technology and autos reporter, Tim Higgins. Tim, good to see you. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>TIM HIGGINS, TECHNOLOGY AND AUTOS REPORTER, WALL STREET JOURNAL: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, what do you think is going on at Netflix?</p><p>HIGGINS: Well, it's a content issue, right. The second quarter just didn't have anything as exciting as what you're seeing right now. \"Stranger Things\" just dropped, right. So second quarter, maybe people just weren't as excited.</p><p>And really, this is worrisome to some investors as they look towards the future when there's going to be greater competition from HBO Max or Disney Plus. These competitors who have in the past have been selling some of their greatest hits to Netflix, giving them the content they need to bring in customers. Now they're pulling it back. \"Friends\", \"The Office\", these things are leaving the service in coming years.</p><p>BEVAN: Tim, this is Tom Bevan. Netflix has spent billions on producing original content. How much of an investment are they making in that? Is that something that's going to continue? Does it have to accelerate so they come up with more hits to survive? Or is that -- is that a drag on their business?</p><p>HIGGINS: Yes, absolutely. I mean, they've been funding this a lot through debt, billions of dollars are going into it. But one of the things Netflix is saying, is now that these shows that they've been spending big on \"Office\" and \"Friends\", they're going elsewhere. Then now they'll have money that they can invest in their own programming.</p><p>And they're confident if you look at the numbers in this current quarter, if you look at \"Stranger Things\" which dropped 40 million households and already looked at it the last time I looked at the numbers, so they're confident that they'll rebound in the third quarter, predicting a seven million new subscribers will join.</p><p>So, they think it's going to even out, but the concern is that the second quarter is kind of a sign of things to come in the -- in the years to come as more competition arrives and that content is harder to get from its previous suppliers.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Tim, good morning, Mitch Roschelle. One of the things we talked about at the top of the show was the fact that we're sort of feeling like we're at the saturation point with all of the subscriptions and that subscribers just don't want to subscribe to that many things. Is it inevitable that we're going to see some sort of a consolidation where the content providers and the access points start consolidating?</p><p>HIGGINS: Well, you're hitting on this big point, right. There's only so much time in the day and how many of these services can you subscribe to and Netflix has even talked about who it sees as subscriber, its competition and its people sleeping.</p><p>And so, you know, this is -- this is definitely going to be an issue going forward, right?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, that's fun.</p><p>DEANGELIS: Tim, Netflix doesn't have a live component to its offerings, it's all about sort of picking those programming options on demand. I actually canceled Netflix and got a service that gives me the streaming news so I can watch while I'm on the go. How important is that to its success ultimately?</p><p>HIGGINS: Yes, they're experimenting with all sorts of different kind of content. You're seeing that across all of these kind of new players, trying to figure out what is the right way to reach customers, whether it's format or content or trying to repackage. So it's an interesting time for the creative types because everybody's trying something.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about cryptocurrency? Let me switch gears, ask you about Facebook on Capitol Hill yesterday, facing questions from the House Financial Services Committee, several members of Congress are warning Facebook of issues with its plan, the level of trust, public trust. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MAXINE WATERS (D-CA): I have serious concerns with Facebook's plans to create a digital currency and digital wallet and its efforts to enlist partners that expand its reach like Mastercard, PayPal, Visa, Uber, Lyft and Spotify. Facebook is apparently trying to create a new global financial system that is intended to rival the U.S. dollar.</p><p>REP. BRAD SHERMAN (D-CA): People call this the Libra. It's not the Libra, nobody -- if it finally happens, nobody's going to call it Libra. They're going to call it Zuck Buck. This is Zuckerberg's baby.</p><p>Keep in mind as to Bitcoin, 46 percent of the transactions according to one academic study are for drug dealers and other nefarious operations.</p><p>REP. ANTHONY GONZALES (R-OH): What today's discussion is really about is trust and whether we can trust your company. I think you're pretty low on the trust spectrum currently for very good reason.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ouch. Tim, what do you think?</p><p>HIGGINS: Well, I've spent time on the Hill and there's not a lot of subjects that can unite both sides, you know, quite like this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true.</p><p>HIGGINS: And that's going to be a challenge for Facebook as they move forward here. You don't just have the politicians but you also have regulatory agencies raising concerns about this. So, a tough couple of days for Facebook in D.C., no doubt.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, so would you expect this to have legs long term, or no?</p><p>HIGGINS: Well, one of the things here that we see is clearly going into the presidential elections, Trump has signaled that the social media companies are going to be in the crosshairs and this is just Facebook waving a flag and inviting more opportunities for criticism and kind of picking at them. And it wasn't just Facebook on the Hill this week, as you know. Really big tech in general is under the microscope, whether it's Amazon or it's Google, Facebook.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>HIGGINS: These companies are raising a lot of concerns among Democrats and Republicans for various different reasons, but uniting them in this idea of has big tech become too big.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, for sure. Well, there's a lot of scrutiny there. Tim, good to see you, thanks so much.</p><p>HIGGINS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tim Higgins from the Journal.</p><p>Still ahead my exclusive interview with Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell, that's next on MORNINGS WITH MARIA. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.

After years of foot-dragging, many have been abandoning their cautious approach to cloud-based services and signing up with gusto to outsource their storage of data and other activities that demand high-intensity computing power.</p><p>In the past few days alone, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/6699593c-1780-11ea-9ee4-11f260415385\">Amazon Web Services</url> struck a big new deal with HSBC while Google announced partnerships with Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank.<br/><br/>Why now? Some of the reasons are obvious. As banks come under pressure from the financial costs of lockdown \u2014 a decline in economic activity, an explosion of loan losses \u2014 they are seizing any opportunity to cut costs. Cloud services tend to be priced in ways that mean you pay for what you use, rather than committing to billions of dollars of investment upfront.</p><p>But the enthusiasm for cloud computing is not just about scrimping. Banks have been among the most enthusiastic adopters of cloud-based software and video conferencing services to facilitate <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/reports/working-from-home\"> working from home</url>. Just as the pandemic hit, Microsoft completed the rollout of its Teams video service to 100,000 staff across Santander\u2019s global banking operations, building on a cloud contract struck with the Spanish bank last year.</p><p>The pandemic is also accelerating the trend towards digital banking. Dutch group ING said this month it would close a quarter of its branches. Cloud providers are increasingly casting themselves as \u201cdigitisation partners\u201d for the banks.</p><p>Pre-pandemic, the banking sector was more reluctant than most to move to the cloud. A Bank of England report on digital finance last year \u2014\u00a0authored by Huw van Steenis, an adviser to former governor Mark Carney \u2014 estimated that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/report/2019/future-of-finance-report\"> only a quarter</url> of the activities of the largest global banks were cloud-based.\u00a0</p><p>That tally is far lower than in other sectors, though McKinsey has forecast that between 40 and 90 per cent of banks\u2019 workloads globally could move to the cloud in a decade. Bankers believe coronavirus will accelerate that shift dramatically. An executive at one big cloud provider says: \u201cSo far it\u2019s been high-compute intensity areas, such as risk management modelling, that have moved on to the cloud. Personally sensitive data and trading data have not moved. But we\u2019re starting to see that change.\u201d</p><p>Banks\u2019 historic reluctance stems in part from their nervousness about security and privacy. But it also reflects longstanding regulatory concerns about the robustness of cloud-based services and concentration risk in the sector.</p><p>Thirty of the world\u2019s biggest banks, deemed systemically important, are subject to regulatory capital surcharges in the name of safety. If 90 per cent of bank data moves to the cloud, how much more risky is it that three or four largely unregulated companies dominate that space?\u00a0</p><p>Over the past couple of years, though, the mood has gradually brightened. Tech giants have engaged with regulators. Their pitch to win bank business has been helped by a broader trend in cloud computing towards so-called \u201ccontainer technology\u201d. This allows companies to use multiple cloud providers as back-up, switching between them in case of problems. Banks and their supervisors have also been persuaded that cloud systems, backed by vast well-financed tech companies with the most sophisticated cyber security, should be especially secure.</p><p>A step change in attitudes was evidenced by that 2019 Bank of England report. It concluded that the BoE \u201cshould embrace cloud technologies, which have matured to the point they can meet the high expectations of regulators and financial services\u201d.</p><p>If it all sounds too good to be true, it may be. Capital One, the US bank and credit card operator, still declares in a case study advertised by Amazon Web Services: \u201cThe most important benefit of working with AWS is that we don't have to worry about building and operating the infrastructure.\u201d But that insouciance backfired last year when it suffered a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5b3046ca-b2d4-11e9-bec9-fdcab53d6959\"> vast cloud breach</url> exposing the personal details of more than 100m credit card customers and applicants and access to 80,000 bank accounts. An ex-AWS employee was blamed, accused of using the bank\u2019s own web application and a firewall misconfiguration to access its data in the cloud.\u00a0Legal wrangling ensued.</p><p>A different kind of privacy threat emerged in Hong Kong last week, with the big cloud companies <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/77702487-0cec-4d88-990e-ffbcc69bf9df\"> fighting off</url> regulatory attempts to gain access to the underlying customer data of bank clients. It remains to be seen whether hostile regulators have more or less leverage over big tech than over big banks. But given that the dominant global cloud companies are all American, mounting geopolitical tensions between the US and China, and other parts of the world, will not be helpful.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This article has been revised since original publication to clarify the alleged cause of Capital One\u2019s data breach.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-ac12f5b646a140feb26227ec505126e5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60D4-XM21-DXP9-92J3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"856\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 20, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001YMR</classCode><className>DEUTSCHE BANK AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002F2B</classCode><className>BANK OF ENGLAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS523920 PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, January 13th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories at 7:00 a.m. Eastern.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Protests erupting in Iran, now turning violent. Reports now say Iranian police are shooting ammunition and tear gas into crowds on the street. Iran denying the claims. A live report from the Middle East ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We kick off a busy week on Wall Street. Investors waiting for the start of earnings season and the signing of the phase one trade deal with China. Futures are looking to the plus side to start the week higher. A 63 point gain on the Dow futures. This after stocks closed to the downside on Friday. The Dow did cross 29,000 before reversing course.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the week, all three major market gauges were higher. The Nasdaq the standout, look at that, gaining 1.75 percent.</p><p>In Europe, markets are hovering near the flat line. We have a slight gain on the FTSE 100 in England. A little bit of red in France and Germany. And the U.K. unexpectedly shrinking the U.K. economy ahead of the key general election.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets mostly higher. The Nikkei in Japan closed for a holiday.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi expected to deliver the articles of impeachment finally. What to expect from the Senate hearing, the Senate trial, what it means for the Democrats who will have to come off the campaign trail.</p><p>And skipping dating websites and apps. One billionaire wants to use a trip to the moon to find his perfect match. That story later in the hour.</p><p>And here to break it all down with me this morning, pollster and Maslansky and Partners and president, author of \"Persuasion,\" Lee Carter, CFRA director of equity research, Ken Leon, and PWC Partner Mitch Roschelle.</p><p>It's been a hot hour. We've got two more. Buckle up.</p><p>And let's talk about, really quickly, we were looking at the futures here. Earnings season, Mitch, what are you guys watching?</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: Well, we start with the banks tomorrow. And I think it's actually going to be surprising to the upside for the banks. They did see in the fourth quarter the yield curve steepen a little bit, which is important. A lot of M&amp;A activity, a lot of trading volume because the market was so hot. So I think the banks probably had a good fourth quarter.</p><p>KEN LEON, DIRECTOR OF EQUITY RESEARCH, CFRA: Yes, the banks are a barometer for the U.S. economy. And it is really about the key driver, the U.S. economy. Banks also are benefiting as well. Finally interest rates are not going down. That's going to help earnings.</p><p>But it's also about the sentiment. What do these CEOs from JP Morgan, from Citigroup and Wells Fargo have to say about the outlook for 2020? We think it's going to be good, especially coming off last week with the strong jobs report.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And speaking of that, Maria Bartiromo is going to be interviewing Jamie Dimon of -- JP Morgan's CEO at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference. It's the healthcare conference. So you'll get some insight into how healthcare and particularly pharmaceutical companies are doing.</p><p>But corporate profits are still expected to drop for the second quarter in a row. It will be the annual earnings growth will come down to the smallest in three years. But investors are still betting on what? Because you still had the S&amp;P hitting a new all-time high on Thursday.</p><p>LEON: So I -- my take on this, you know, the Fed, at worse, is on the sidelines, but also we're seeing that it's an expansion with a low inflation. We don't have -- inflation -- if we have inflation below 2 percent, it's the expansion of the multiples. The valuations. Banks are cheap relative to the market, to the S&amp;P 500. That's getting the attention of investors. The biggest part of the financial sector is the banks.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Right, although the banks did do better last year than the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>LEON: Just the fourth quarter -- and the fourth quarter was the momentum that started.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes.</p><p>So I -- I actually think that guidance coming from this entire earnings season is going to be the most important thing, to listen to the words of CEOs about the future, about their plans for investment and, most important, their plans for hiring because I think that the continuation of creating jobs is going to be important for 2020 going into an election cycle.</p><p>CARTER: I agree.</p><p>LEON: And and -- and also especially when you look at the quality the -- you know, of -- of the jobs numbers. And also, the middle class is growing and we're seeing an increase of households that are off subsidies from the government because of a the strong economy. That's benefiting really the consumer markets overall. This is going to be a terrific --</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I've said this, that the wage gains for the bottom earners are growing faster than even for the middle tier of Americans and even the richest Americans. And wages have risen at a 6.1 percent annual clip for workers over 25 without high school degrees. Three -- that's -- that is much, much faster than those with a college degree. It's really incredible what's happening in this country in terms of the inequality gap shrinking.</p><p>But I want to move on to our top story this hour, erupting -- protests erupting in Iran, now turning violent. Hundreds taking to the streets of Tehran over the weekend following the country's announcement it had accidentally shot down a Ukrainian aircraft last week killing all 176 people on board.</p><p>President Trump weighing in yesterday on the protests, saying this, to the leaders of Iran, do not kill your protesters. Thousands have already been killed or imprisoned by you and the world is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching. Turn your Internet back on and let reporters roam free. Stop the killing of your great Iranian people.</p><p>This as a rocket attack targeting northern Baghdad Air Base wounded four Iraqi service men. The U.S. blaming the attack on Iran-supported militias but no group has claimed responsibility.</p><p>Joining us now, Tennessee Congressman, House Appropriations Committee member, Chuck Fleischmann.</p><p>Congressman, good to see you.</p><p>REP. CHUCK FLEISCHMANN (R-TN): Good morning.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What should the U.S. do now and in the days and weeks to come?</p><p>FLEISCHMANN: Well, I think, first of all, the president and the United States are doing exactly what we need to do, monitor the situation very closely, make sure that we communicate effectively.</p><p>There's an olive branch right now out there to the Iranian people who, for decades, have lived under a radical, oppressive theocracy, which has been detrimental to Iran, detrimental to the region, detrimental to the world. And freedom always wins. And I think the people of Iran ultimately will want to be free again under a new type of government. So messaging, encouragement, and a monitoring of a very dangerous situation.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Congressman, good morning. Mitch Roschelle.</p><p>One of the things that was a little disturbing though was some of your colleagues on the left sort of politicizing what's going on in Iran and trying to place the blame on the administration's doorstep. What's your take on that and do you think that that sentiment's going to continue or will people come to their senses and realize that this is a bad regime that the world would be better off without?</p><p>FLEISCHMANN: It's a great point you raise, Mitch.</p><p>Some of my colleagues to the left have politicized everything from impeachment, to Iran, to the kitchen stink, to the detriment, I think, of the country and to their party right now.</p><p>So, yes, I was in that briefing. I thought the government did a good job. The president's folks did a very good job. But at a time when they jumped on this and tried to politicize it, the very next day we saw the horrific outpouring of international support, as it should have been, for the people who were killed on that airliner.</p><p>Think about this, they knew they shot it down in Iran. They denied it until they could no longer deny it under the sheer facts and international pressure.</p><p>So it's time for our friends on the left to stand up and say, we need to be Americans first, have one cohesive foreign policy and get behind the home team, the United States of America.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressman, I want to turn to the impeachment battle.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is expected to finally hand over the articles of impeachment to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell this week.</p><p>Here's what former White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon said to Maria on \"SUNDAY MORNING FUTURES.\" Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FAN ANCHOR: So you're -- you're calling on President Trump to do what? Tell Nancy Pelosi what about the State of the Union?</p><p>STEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: Tell Nancy Pelosi -- hey, tell Nancy Pelosi, when you deliver it and we have a trial and after I'm acquitted I'm going to come and have the State of the Union, and not until then. I'm not -- President Trump's got a great saying, no games, OK. This is all game playing by the Democrats. It's got to be brought to an end, OK.</p><p>Now, they forced her this week to deliver them. That's why he's -- and I think this trial, he ought to go big. He ought to demand witnesses. I think President Trump ought to make -- there's no witness on the other side of Bolton and Mulvaney. There's nothing they can say that's going to be that big a deal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Congressman, your reaction to Steve Bannon?</p><p>FLEISCHMANN: Well, I would say this, I saw Speaker Pelosi on one of the other Sunday talk shows give a very exhaustive interview and I was so disappointed. Let's face it, when you're speaker of the House, you represent the entire House of Representatives, not just Democrats, not Republicans, but the entire people's house.</p><p>The partisan debacle that became the impeachment fiasco, and afterwards she held onto this, has really hurt the very fabric of our republic. I worry about our future based on what she did.</p><p>So I would say this, all she kept coming back to under questioning was, he will be impeached, he will be impeached for history. Well, I think she feels that she got a notch on her gun. She really hurt our great republic. She hurt a great president who's doing a great job. I think she hurt her party in the process.</p><p>So I think when President Trump comes to that State of the Union, and I will be there cheering for him, but more importantly cheering for America and the American people, a great, robust economy, all of the promises kept and promises made that we've seen from this administration. I think the Democrats have taken a decidedly wrong turn to the left, as Mitch has said, and it's going to hurt them and hurt our party and hurt -- and hurt their party, rather.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>Lee, real quick, though, I watch the polls regularly. The Real Clear Politics average, yes, on impeachment and removal, 47.2 percent, no is actually higher, it's 47.4.</p><p>CARTER: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So it's almost dead even. But in terms of the polls, less than 10 percent of Republicans back impeachment.</p><p>CARTER: Yes. I mean it's completely divided on where we are. But the problem that the Democrats are having right now is they don't have the support. After all of this time, all that they've put forward, all of the effort, all of the drip, they still haven't moved the needle on impeachment.</p><p>And polling really hasn't changed. In fact, support has decreased for the Democrats. And so I think that's going to be a real problem for them. Then now you're layering on Iran, you're layering on the economy, you're layering on these issues and you've got a weak field of candidates right now without a message except that we can't afford to have four more years of the president.</p><p>MCDOWELL: A message weakened by Nancy Pelosi sitting on the articles of impeachment with no, well, legitimate explanation for many Americans.</p><p>Congressman, good to see you. Thank you for being here.</p><p>Congressman Chuck Fleischmann.</p><p>FLEISCHMANN: Thank you. It's a pleasure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We move back to Iran seeing violent protests after the government admitted to accidentally shooting down a passenger jet leaving Tehran last week.</p><p>Rick Leventhal is live from Jerusalem, covering this story.</p><p>Good morning, Rick.</p><p>RICK LEVENTHAL, FOX NEWS SENIOR CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Dagen.</p><p>And let's remember, these demonstrations started as candlelight vigils but things got heated over admissions from the government that it shot down that Ukrainian passenger plane and then the regime responded with force. The police in riot gear sent these demonstrators running from tear gas canisters and bullet at Tehran University and Freedom Square and beyond. There are reports some civilians were shot with pools of blood on the ground.</p><p>Remember, there were 16 Iranian students among the 176 innocent civilians on board that 737, knocked out of the sky by a surface to air missile Wednesday. The chants of death to the dictator and death to liars and calls for the ayatollah to step down met with a violent response.</p><p>President Trump tweeting at Iran's leaders in Farsi and English, the national security adviser said today that the sanctions and protests have put Iran under great pressure and forced them to negotiate. In fact, I don't care if they are negotiating. It's up to them. But don't have nuclear weapons and don't kill your protesters. The president did not say what he might do if they do.</p><p>Also yesterday, remarkable images of most demonstrators in a large crowd avoiding stepping on American and Israeli flags on the street, walking on the colors has been celebrated by the Iranian regime since 1979 as a sign of disrespect, but yesterday the people chanted \"the U.S. is not our enemy.\"</p><p>And we just got video of damages at Al-Assad Air Base, which was hit by Iranian ballistic missiles last week, just hours before they shot down that plane. No one was hurt in those strikes. U.S. officials, Dagen, say they are open to talks with Iranian leadership in hopes of finding a peaceful way forward.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Rick, thank you for that reporting.</p><p>Rick Leventhal.</p><p>You be safe, my friend.</p><p>LEVENTHAL: Sure.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up on MORNINGS WITH MARIA, we've got the Oscar nominations out at the bottom of the next hour.</p><p>And looking for a girlfriend for space. One billionaire's eccentric proposal ahead.</p><p>And Target surging. The retail giant trying a new strategy that seems to be working. Details ahead. You don't want to miss any of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: CNN making a deal concerning back pay.</p><p>Cheryl Casone has the details.</p><p>Hey, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Dagen.</p><p>So the Cable News Network has agreed to pay a record $76 million in back pay. That's according to the National Labor Relations Board. The network terminated the contracts of unionized camera operators back in 2003. Well, the NLRB says CNN didn't try to bargain with employee unions before replacing those workers. At least 300 people are expected to benefit from the settlement.</p><p>Goldman Sachs staffing up big-time in China. The bank reportedly planning to double its staffing to 600 in five years. But Goldman under CEO David Solomon is going to not pursue expansion in China unless the communist government opens up its financial markets. Goldman reportedly -- is, excuse me, going to report their latest earnings on Wednesday of this week. They're under pressure to find new ways to boost their revenue. Maybe that is in China.</p><p>And Louisiana State University giving students a pass to ditch class. It's football. The LSU Board of Supervisors has voted to cancel classes at the main campus in Baton Rouge ahead of the national championship game after they faced backlash and, well, student complaints about having to go to class when they've got a game they want to go to. The LSU Tigers are set to face Clemson at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in Atlanta. That's going to be Monday. This, of course, an attempt for their fourth national title.</p><p>You know, I love the NFL, but, man, college football can be so much fun to watch sometimes. That's where the spirit of most kids. Should be a good game.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I know. Who you got?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: I like LSU.</p><p>CASONE: Yes. LSU. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You like LSU?</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes, I do.</p><p>CARTER: I'm just going to go -- I'm going to go a little rogue and I'm going to say Clemson, only because I went to college in South Carolina.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Oh.</p><p>CASONE: Clemson's a good team.</p><p>LEON: I'm going to stay with LSU. It's a terrific quarterback.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You will stay on Sandra Smith's good side, because Sandra Smith went to LSU. So, go Tigers and spill that, what it is it, not g-o, is how they spell it down in Louisiana.</p><p>Coming up, crime in focus. Bail reform in New York sparking concerns about an increase in criminal activity. You heard it here first. Maria's been talking about this for more than a year. And now the crime wave.</p><p>Plus, a heart-warming moment. One young cancer patient getting cheered on. We'll show you, ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back.</p><p>Focus on the new bail reform law in New York State. Just this weekend, two repeat offenders, both out on the street, making headlines here in New York City. One man allegedly pulled four heists at Chase Bank branches in Manhattan between December 30th and January the 8th and then was cheering that he was out. And then another man arrested Friday for aggressive pan handling had been previously released despite allegedly attacking two women last week, including slugging one victim in the face and kicking another woman in the head.</p><p>Joining me now, Fox News senior judicial analyst, Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>Maria Bartiromo has been warning people about this.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And it's not just New York.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: So I have probably done thousands of bails. Typically when you're assigned bail, you sit on the bench and the police will bring in hundreds of people. You've got about five or six minutes per person. And you're basically trying to decide -- they're innocent until proven guilty. What is their criminal record? Who have they harmed? What is the evidence against them? What is the likelihood of conviction? What is the likelihood they're going to come back if -- if you -- if you give them a reasonable bail? These are all the things you have to decide on the spur of the moment.</p><p>In New York, if the crime is not one of violence, you may not give them bail, meaning, they walk out of your courtroom without anything to induce them to return.</p><p>So this bank robbery, you say to yourself, well how could a bank robber possibly be bailed out? The guy robbed four banks in one day. He didn't use a gun. And he didn't threaten violence. He used a note. And because he handed the tellers a note, it's considered a non-violent crime and, therefore, he's entitled to be set free irrespective of his -- of his record.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The governor, Governor Cuomo, is so gutless, he didn't have -- he didn't even mention this in his State of the State Address.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, they're -- the -- the law is horrific.</p><p>Now, New Jersey has a bail law. There is a presumption that the person being arrested should be freed, but the judge can override the presumption on the basis of, was there violence, is there a criminal record, is the person likely to return if I don't give them bail? In New York, there is no presumption and the judges have no opportunity to override the bail.</p><p>Now, in the case of this guy who punched people in the nose, that's not because of the bail law, that's because of poor judgment on the part of the judge. You do not let a homeless person who is attacking people and has been arrested for the attack and caused injury, knocked two teeth out of this woman's mouth, you do not let that person free without bail.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Here's my prediction. You are going to see -- and we saw that police officers were directed by the Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance - -</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the mayor of New York City to stop arresting people last year for simple assaults and things like shoplifting ahead of this bail reform. You are going to see, unless they make changes to this, a rise of vigilante justice like Bernie Geatz (ph) with a gun on a subway.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And the rise of organized crime because shop keepers and merchants in this city are going to have to pay for protection because people are coming in -- you go into a drugstore, you go into a pharmacy, you see the prices are already much higher for things like bottles of water because shoplifting is so rampant.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They literally are not arresting people. Kick you in the head, don't get arrested. Kick you in the head, if you get arrested you get a ticket and you get released. It's repugnant.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: So we -- we may -- we may return to an era that hasn't existed in any of our lives in New York City where the mob or groups of mobsters are providing more protection than the police. It's not that the police are unwilling or unable, it's just that the law --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: But they do it.</p><p>CARTER: Wow.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: It's so wrong and it's -- and their oath is to uphold the law. It's preventing them from doing their jobs.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Can they change it? Can they change this law though, Judge, because it's --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes. Yes. I think the pressure on --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because it's been such a disaster.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: The pressure on Governor Cuomo right now is extraordinary to adopt the New Jersey model, which presumes no bail, but as I said, gives the judge discretion to do the right thing.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: But to your point about mobs, it comes at a price. It's not like the mobs are gratuitously --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: They're not going to do it for free.</p><p>CARTER: Right.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: As Dagen says, the price of the water went up.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Let's say it goes up 10 cents or 25 cents a bottle. Theoretically that's used to pay for paying the protection.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Protection.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: And this is not exactly a contract for the protection. They're going to show up and say, you want protection, it's going to cost you more this week than it did last week.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Right.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: So this is going to create an illegal cottage industry of thugs who are doing what we pay tax dollars to have the police do.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There's one job of government. It's to protect people.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Keep us safe. Right. Correct.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's to keep the people of your city, of your state, of your country safe.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: I think you're going to see a significant change in this law before -- before Easter because the public has had enough already. It's only the middle of January. The law has only been in effect for two weeks and these -- these are horror stories --</p><p>CARTER: Wow.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: That have been visited -- been visited on people.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Not to mention the closing of Rikers Island in New York City.</p><p>CARTER: Yes. And there's a series of things that are happening that are leading to the rise.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>LEON: Is there a political angle to this or is this just black and white, that something that was --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: You know, there -- there -- there was a political angle, but the people pushing it are suddenly hiding under pillows now. The people pushing it were hard lefties who felt that judges weren't compassionate enough to the people before them, so they were going to force judges' hands. So a judge has to be one part compassion but one part do the right thing under the Constitution and under the laws.</p><p>MCDOWELL: \"The Wall Street Journal\" writes and editorial about it and the - - the subhead is, New York's reform is freeing violent offenders who will harm again.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: \"The Wall Street Journal\" is -- is correct. And some of the terminology in the statute, like what is violent and what isn't, did the skin break, did a bone break, did a tooth break?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Short of that, the violence is not considered violence.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You kick someone --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Slap me in the face, that's not -- that's an act of violence. But under this statute, it's not.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And some of the --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Don't slap me.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: At least not on the air, but some of the folks behind some of these repugnant anti-Semitic attacks in New York had been folks who had been released on -- on -- without bail as well.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, there were the -- the woman who attacked the Jewish woman --</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In an anti-Semitic attack --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Was released and then she turned around and did it again.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes. Well, this is the slap.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Within a matter of days.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: This is the slap example. The statute defines that type of behavior, believe it or not, as non-violent. Now that is contrary to all reason.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. I -- again, you mark my words, the rise of vigilante justice and the rise of organized crime, because people have to pay to protect -- for protection because the police department and your mayor and your governor don't care about your safety.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: This is --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Judge Napolitano.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Thank you. It's primarily the governor because this is a state- wide law. The legislature needs to change it quickly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>Great to see you.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: A pleasure, guys.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Always.</p><p>We'll take a break.</p><p>A look at the big week ahead. Check it out.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FBN ANCHOR: This week on MORNINGS WITH MARIA, tomorrow we are live in San Francisco with the biggest banker in the nation.

Senator James Lankford on the path forward.</p><p>And, Friday, it is time to \"Ask Maria.\" I'm asking the questions that matter to you.</p><p>That's all right here on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell, in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, January 13th. Here is a look at markets at 7:30 a.m. Eastern time.</p><p>We're kicking off a busy week on Wall Street. We have gains across the board on U.S. Futures, 81 point gain on the Dow Futures at the moment. This after stocks hit new records on Friday, ended up closing lower but it was a big week to the plus side for the three major market gauges, higher, all up, but the NASDAQ, the outstanding winner there, up 1-3/4 percent on -- for the week.</p><p>In Europe, markets hovering near the flat line. The economy in the United Kingdom unexpectedly shrinking in November ahead of the key general election. We have gains in England and France at the moment.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets higher. The Nikkei in Japan however closed for a holiday.</p><p>The Trump administration grounding drones. Cheryl Casone has the details, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: That's right, Dagen. The Department of the Interior planning to halt the use of nearly a thousand drones after determining there was too high risk they could be used by China. That move expected to be put into action soon, but the final details still being determined.</p><p>Chinese made civilian drones have recently become a security concern and the U.S. Army has already banned drones from certain manufacturers that can be used at all.</p><p>Well, Amazon has fired several workers who leaked customer information to a third party. The data included e-mail addresses and phone numbers. This is the second time in a week customer information has been improperly accessed. Amazon says it's working with law enforcement to prosecute the suspects.</p><p>Finally, you are going to need a tissue because watch this.</p><p>These kids are cheering on their classmate, John Oliver Zippay. The 6-year- old from Ohio received his final round of chemotherapy just two days after Christmas. His parents say he is now cancer-free.</p><p>Get this, despite that disease, Dagen, he never fell behind in school. Way to go, John. Cancer-free.</p><p>MCDOWELL: There's nothing more devastating than pediatric cancer, Cheryl. Thank you for that.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thank you for the tears and the smiles, Cheryl Casone.</p><p>Let's move on to jobs, in focus. The Labor Department announcing a deregulation taking on the Obama era joint employer rule.</p><p>Joint employment occurs when workers have two employers like a franchise and then the overarching company or a company using contractors.</p><p>The Obama administration had moved to dramatically expand joint employment which some estimate cost over $5 billion a year for businesses.</p><p>My next guest is out with a new op-ed in the Wall Street Journal this morning with acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, making labor rules rational again, writing this.</p><p>By removing uncertainty for these businesses and their workers, this rule also benefits the economy more broadly. Every dollar lost by business to vague or unnecessary regulation is a dollar less for creating jobs, increasing wages, funding retirement plans or lowering prices. Smart deregulation is good for the American worker, business, families and the economy.</p><p>The co-author of that right here, U.S. Secretary of Labor, son of former U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Eugene Scalia.</p><p>Mr. Secretary, good to see you.</p><p>EUGENE SCALIA, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF LABOR: Great to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I took -- I stepped on your words but tell the viewers why this rule change? Explain it and why this rule change would benefit potentially everybody in this country?</p><p>SCALIA: Yes, it's an important rule. And as you said, the joint employment is the idea that a worker can actually have two different companies that are responsible for paying minimum wage, paying overtime, keeping the records.</p><p>And that -- you know, that sometimes happens, if somebody's working at a particular worksite and the company there is closely supervising what that worker does.</p><p>But then there's another company that hired that person that determines the pay, and that oversees them too, then you have two employees that they both have to make sure everything's done right, but that's costly.</p><p>And what the Obama administration did was tried to really push out how many different circumstances. Two different companies were on the hook for all those employment responsibilities and it has to do with wage hour obligations, that's what we focus on. But during Obama administration, they were looking at union rights and that circumstance too and that can be costly.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Why did you need to do this now because there was already a National Labor Relations board action that's similar to this?</p><p>Also, that the Labor Department very early on in the Trump administration issued guidance on the joint employer rules. Why do you need to do this now?</p><p>SCALIA: Well, couple reasons. First, we administer different statutes than the National Labor Relations board which has to do with overseeing union organizing rights.</p><p>Second, we really felt we needed to bring some clarity and rationality to this area in the wake of the confusion that had risen during the last administration.</p><p>You know, the Obama administration had put out what it called a bulletin which suggested that if a company is just responsible for overseeing payroll for somebody, just processing payroll, that could be an employer too. Or if a worker does work on the premises of a company, then that company with the premises, they're the employer, just based on that.</p><p>And that's very broad and costly. So we wanted to bring clarity and roll that back so it's more sensible and less burdensome on employees.</p><p>MCDOWELL: An employer, a franchise, operator, how soon would they see the benefits of this? How soon would the broad economy see the benefits of this change?</p><p>SCALIA: Soon. March 6th is when we expect this to go into effect. It will be the law, people can -- people can rely on it.</p><p>You mentioned franchisers. You know, what this says is that you're a franchiser or -- and you want your franchisees to -- for example, have a sexual harassment policy or had other, you know, sound, fair practices, that doesn't make you an employer.</p><p>Well, if you're a contractor and you want your suppliers to be responsible stewards, just imposing that in the agreement, that doesn't make you an employer. So those companies are going to be more comfortable urging best practices by their suppliers which is going to help workers.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Let's talk about workers. On Friday, the Labor Department released its December jobs numbers and showing 145,000 jobs were created in the month of December with a 3-1/2 percent unemployment rate, that's the lowest certainly in my lifetime, in 50 years.</p><p>The jobs report also showed that women overtook men in holding the majority of U.S. jobs for the first time in a decade. Women held 50.04 percent of all U.S. jobs.</p><p>We women represent more than 77 percent of jobs in education and health services, but we're almost up to 14 percent of mining and logging jobs in this country.</p><p>What can you do as the Secretary of Labor to continue this trend and making sure women are better represented in some fields outside of maybe education and healthcare?</p><p>SCALIA: You know, part of what we can do is rules like this. You know, we've got this just extraordinary economy right now, as you say. The best we've seen in 50 years are by some measures more.</p><p>And one of the fabulous things about it is that the beneficiaries -- you know, we're seeing the lowest unemployment rate ever for African Americans, for Hispanic Americans, for adult women. So these are great outcomes, continued deregulation is one important part of that.</p><p>You know, in terms of women's participation, helping simply by enforcing the discrimination laws but also through programs like apprenticeships which can help train women to enter into professions that historically maybe they didn't, either because they didn't think it's something they could do, or they were excluded. That's been a focus of ours.</p><p>MCDOWELL: In income inequality, that gap is shrinking, that gap is narrowing because lower earners in this country, say wages for the bottom 10 percent. The Wall Street Journal editorial page wrote about this over the weekend, are rising faster than middle income Americans and faster than the highest earners in this country. So those wages are growing so much faster and even particularly for people who don't have even high school diplomas.</p><p>SCALIA: Exactly. It was a really good editorial over the weekend, you know, laying it all out. And just -- you know, one data point is during the Obama administration, the faster wage gains were among the top 10 percent of earners. We've flipped that now. The fastest wage gains are among the bottom 10 percent.</p><p>And when you look at a number of different measures of how the economy is doing, it's some people who had less opportunity historically who are some of the really big beneficiaries right now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Great to see you.</p><p>SCALIA: Pleasure to be here.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Secretary of Labor Department, Eugene Scalia, please come back.</p><p>SCALIA: Love to.</p><p>MCDOWELL: OK. Coming up, jobs for America's heroes, my next guest's company helps military spouses and pays tribute to a World War II icon.</p><p>Plus, the year's best movies, we've got the winners from last night's Critics' Choice Awards and we're waiting on the Oscar nominations out in less than an hour.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Thinking of the military and those in service. R. Riveter is a handbag company providing military spouses with mobile careers named after the Rosie the Riveter icon and from World War II. The company has grown into a network of so-called Riveters who hand make bags nationwide.</p><p>Joining us now again, military wives and R. Riveter founders, Cameron Cruz and Lisa Bradley.</p><p>Lisa, tell me -- you've been on with me before and I've got my bag. And I've -- it's still in great shape. I think I need to invest in another one. But just tell me how business is going.</p><p>LISA BRADLEY, FOUNDER, R. RIVETER: Great. You know, we're doubling Riveters this year. We're growing like crazy and there's no better time to be able to support military families with everything that's going on and that's our mission is mobile, flexible income for military spouses.</p><p>MCDOWELL: These are spouses who work from home and help assemble the parts of these bags, that's how it works and then you put them together in one -- in one factory?</p><p>CAMERON CRUZ, FOUNDER, R. RIVETER: Exactly. So the beauty of it is that military spouses get to take their work with them no matter where the military takes them. And then we put everything together right now in North Carolina. We have some very exciting news coming up.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Show me.</p><p>CRUZ: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>BRADLEY: We were just the recipient of a economic grant to be able to provide jobs in Florida. So we started with a different work from home opportunity but now we're launching a second facility down in Florida to really increase our capacity and keep jobs here in America.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Was that from the state that you got it or --</p><p>BRADLEY: State.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's fantastic. How did you know? And again, it's a no income - - no state income tax state, so some huge benefits there. How did you even know to apply for that grant?</p><p>BRADLEY: Well, we have an advisor down there that was in Florida and talked to us about knowing that we wanted to create manufacturing jobs in the United States and it's a great partnership between that county and our Riveter to be able to work together to create rural jobs in manufacturing for their county.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Have you -- what about stores, opening stores (INAUDIBLE)? I know you have one in North Carolina but is that a plan?</p><p>BRADLEY: Another really big news --</p><p>CRUZ: Yes. So 2020 is a big year for us. So we're actually opening a pop-up shop in Columbus, Ohio, which is where Lisa is based.</p><p>BRADLEY: Yes, so --</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's fantastic. What about hiring? How many people are you planning to hire in the coming year?</p><p>BRADLEY: We're doubling our Riveters. We have 35 Riveters that work from home now in the manufacturing aspect. On the employee side, we have almost 40 employees and we are expecting to double that this year.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's fantastic. Congratulations, please come back. I've got to get online and buy -- since I'm not -- North Carolina or Columbus (INAUDIBLE). I've got to get online and buy a new one. But again, people are supporting military families.</p><p>BRADLEY: Thank you for supporting. We actually have a coupon code for viewers, Fox 20. And so, head on over to our website at RRiveter.com and check out the handbags and the military spouses making them.</p><p>MCDOWELL: That's awesome. Lisa Bradley, Cameron Cruz, please come back. Thank you for everything, for the awesome bags.</p><p>Coming up, seeking a space girlfriend, one billionaire's eccentric proposal, next.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Critics' Choice Awards making buzz this morning, \"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\" a Quentin Tarantino film going home with Best Picture. Other winners include Joaquin Phoenix for Best Actor for \"Joker\" and Renee Zellweger, Best Actress for \"Judy\". Well, how the Golden Globes lined up? And \"The Irishman\" taking home the award for Best Ensemble Cast.</p><p>Oscar nominations coming out at bottom of the next hour. Mitch, I hated \"The Irishman\" but I've said that like a hundred time.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER, PWC: Yes, I mean, we're not quite sure how you feel about that one. But I did love \"Once Upon A Time In Hollywood\". I love most Quentin Tarantino film. But the great thing about that movie is it has the Charles Manson story buried in it.</p><p>I don't want to spoil it if you haven't seen it. But that's sort of the story within the story. The beginning's a little slow but it's a great movie.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think this is how it's going to line up though for the Oscar nominations. I would love to see Adam Driver for \"Marriage Story\". He will get nominated for an Academy Award. I would love to see him win because it is that incredible.</p><p>So this guy wants to take you out of this world. A Japanese billionaire is promising the date of a lifetime, searching for a girlfriend to join him on an unforgettable voyage around the moon. His quest the subject of a new documentary program and the latest stunt by the attention grabbing entrepreneur.</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT, MASLANSKY + PARTNERS: I just -- I love this story. I mean, it is like \"The Bachelor\" meets something, I don't even know what he's trying to accomplish here. But I guess he's trying to get fame. He's trying to get a girlfriend. Good luck with that because he sounds like he can't get a girlfriend.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Is that where we are? If you're already a multimillionaire or a billionaire but that's not enough that you need fame?</p><p>CARTER: Yes, I think that's --</p><p>MCDOWELL: You need attention. You need the hot -- the hot glow of the spotlight?</p><p>CARTER: Look, I mean, we grew up where there wasn't \"The Bachelor\", there wasn't reality television show. I think for now, for most people they see the opportunity, they can get out there and they can be anything.</p><p>But it doesn't matter unless people hear it, unless people see it, unless they're famous somehow, unless it's on Instagram, unless they get likes.</p><p>And so, this is of course is the next out of world version of it. And I don't think it's a good thing but that's where we're living.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think you're also speaking to what's going on with Prince Harry and a Meghan Markle, about them wanting to get away from the royal family and then they want more attention or a different kind of attention. Like the kind that the Kardashian family gets.</p><p>CARTER: Attention they can control.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Then they should move to L.A.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes but you also have to deal with paparazzi and the press in a way that you're not protected by the confines of the royal family.</p><p>KEN LEON, DIRECTOR OF EQUITY RESEARCH, CFRA: Grow your brand, it's all about brand.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Oh, gosh. Lee, brand. What brand do they have? I don't know.</p><p>And speaking of out of this world, a teenager interning at NASA discovered an unknown planet, his third day on the job. It has two stars, it is 1300 light years from Earth. Wolf Cukier, I mispronounced that, found the planet, looking through NASA's orbiting Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. Ken?</p><p>LEON: This is an amazing story. This is a junior in high school who's able to discover something NASA couldn't. He's either a genius, but the ability to find something bigger than the sun to stars, enormously bigger with the powerful telescopes that NASA has. This is a nice story.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This is why I miss the space pro -- I miss the space program, when we were not sending astronauts into space and we're hitching rides with Russia to the International Space Station. I just think that it is so -- I encourage people, I've said this before, to watch \"Apollo 11\", the -- it's a documentary about the moon launch and moon landing.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Is it Netflix?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's -- no, I had to pay for it. I had to rent it. But it's never before seen footage from NASA and it's just inspirational, even to this day. And I think that's kind of what's been missing a little bit.</p><p>CARTER: It's a lot.</p><p>LEON: It's heroism. You know, heroism -- you know, like \"Apollo 13\", even when it doesn't work, Jim Lovell who --</p><p>CARTER: Well, it also gave us all a point to gather together.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Correct.</p><p>CARTER: And support something together and watch and wonder together and we don't have that anymore.</p><p>LEON: Together and it's aspirational.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: And the Olympics don't do what the -- what the space program used to do which was to get every American to be patriotic for that moment around that event.</p><p>MCDOWELL: See, I looked up. I watched the \"Apollo 11\" documentary and I looked up the names of the flight directors during that mission and let me say who they are.

It was therefore not possible to estimate potential remediation costs, and no provision had been raised.</p><p>Apart from ANZ, exposure to aligned dealer groups is the big unknown in the fees-for-no-service debacle, with Westpac chief financial officer Peter King commenting in November last year that there was \"no industry approach as to how you deal with that at the moment\".</p><p>\"That's probably the one that we need to bottom out next year,\" King said. New and old in fintech After an ANZ board trip to Silicon Valley in 2013, Phil Chronican said the opaque nature of the threat from financial technology made it fundamentally different to previous waves of competition and disruption.</p><p>Chronican, who was then CEO Australia for ANZ and is now acting CEO at National Australia Bank, said fintech was not a clear and present danger, but the threat could unfold quickly in ways that \"we can't yet predict\".</p><p>Six years later, the risk to incumbent institutions is taking shape, with the vanguard overwhelmingly occupied by established technology companies, or \"big tech\".</p><p>So there we were, convinced for many years that it was the emerging, niche players in peer-to-peer lending, crowd-funding and cross-border payments that were sowing the seeds for the sector's creative destruction.</p><p>The fintech model that has evolved - with some clear exceptions in payments and credit - is a co-operative relationship between the new and the old.</p><p>This has been driven by some cold market realities, including an inability to tap low-cost funding or build the customer base that would make them a serious competitive threat to incumbents.</p><p>The truce works both ways - fintechs can operate viably without scale and unburdened by regulation, depending on their business models, while traditional players can modernise clunky processes through innovation.</p><p>That's not to say the threat has receded - far from it.</p><p>Just as Chronican warned, it's unfolded in a way that wasn't predicted, with big tech's footprint already large in financial services (see table) and its impact potentially much greater than fintech.</p><p>Companies such as Amazon, Google and Facebook, or the Chinese behemoths Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu, have a huge competitive advantage in enormous customer bases and strong brand recognition and trust.</p><p>A Financial Stability Board report also noted they can use advanced analytics and big data generated through other services such as social media.</p><p>\"Combined with strong financial positions and access to low-cost capital, big-tech firms could achieve scale very quickly in fin-ancial services,\" the report said.</p><p>\"This would be particularly true where network effects are present, such as in payments and settlements and lending.\" The FSB's concern is clear.</p><p>While greater competition and diversity in lending, payments, insurance, trading and other areas of financial services could create a more efficient and resilient financial system, more intense competition could also erode the profitability of incumbents.</p><p>This could have spillover effects on the stability of the system by leading to greater risk-taking in order to preserve profit <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:margins.gluyasr@theaustralian.com.auTwitter\">margins.gluyasr@theaustralian.com.auTwitter</email>: @Gluyasr</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-e8c0e864331311e98a488d3a90c7e5419b7aae8e998b65adf2f86a9bf8ff268b</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFR-5F41-F0JP-W3V4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"894\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian2 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 19, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>CC0005NBT</classCode><className>BANK OF QUEENSLAND LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0004TGM</classCode><className>BENDIGO &amp;

In China, Big Tech is pretty much working hand-in-hand with government to solve society's issues and police them. People in the West may not like it or understand it, but Big Brotherly Love works in China for the majority. </p><p>It's just the marginalised few, like the ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims that it doesn't work for. That's something that needs to change but, generally, China's Big Tech policy is one where government and enterprise are joined at the hip. The USA is very different. In America, Big Tech does what Big Tech wants as long as the Big Tech lobbyists can cover the cost[1]. The land of the free and home of the brave is also the maison of the millionaires. If you have money, anything can be achieved in America. Or so it seems just look at the NRA if you wonder what this means. Anyways, there's now a funding fight taking place between Big Tech and Big Banks in America, which should be fun to watch. We all know how worried banks are about Amazon, Google and Facebook moving into their space and, according to Politico[2],Facebook's launch of Libra currency has just tipped the scales. Lawmakers 'were caught off guard by Facebook's plans, and thesocial media giant has been recruiting lobbyists[3]with deep experience in financial services to help bolster its case. 'Concerns over Libra spurred the Independent Community Bankers of America, which represents smaller lenders, to join forces with Waters, a California Democrat, in calling for a moratorium on the project. Waters' House Financial Services Committee staff promoted the group's position in a briefing memo circulated to members before an Oct. 23 hearing with Zuckerberg. ''It's Big Tech trying to get into banking and the possibility of disintermediation of the whole banking system itself,' said Chris Cole, executive vice president at the community bankers group. 'It's not just small banks undermining Facebook's invention. The project initially had the support of Visa, MasterCard and other big payments industry players, but they backed out of joining the Switzerland-based association that will manage Libra as regulatory and political scrutiny reached a fever pitch. In the wake of the departures, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon knocked Libra as 'a neat idea that will never happen.'' Yep, regulators and policymakers don't like Libra as it's a threat to national governance as represented by national banks who work closely with government, in the same way as Big Tech does in China. Neat. But, however much lobbying banks make of Washington's corridors, Facebook has a lot of capital to spend on winning the arguments and isn't finished yet. At Money 2020 last week David Marcus, the man who leads the Facebook currency initiative, took to the stage and highlighted that, when looking at history, 'the most meaningful innovations that have changed the lives of millions across the world in a profound way have always been met with damning headlines.' Using examples such as electricity, the Internet, mobile phones and smartphones, he believes that the Libra network has the potential to 'change the direction of the world' in the same way as these innovations. 'These headlines are a preamble to more hard times ahead and we must govern the network into a place where it will meet regulatory standards, then we will see the network come to life. People deserve much better than they have,' he asserts. Reporting on Finextra[4] provides more detail: Marcus disagrees with the fundamental notion that stablecoins pose a threat to national monetary policy. He explores how there would be a threat if Libra prevented the government from having a national monetary policy, which today is done with interest rates. In addition to this, he says that stablecoins would be a threat if the process involved money creation. 'With Libra, there is no money creation; we have a full one to one back reserve, there is no money creation whatsoever,' Marcus reiterates. Marcus says that in hindsight, he wishes Libra had spoken more about 'what we were actually building, which are new payments rails on the internet, the way it should be.' Libra is a payment network and it not a consumer facing product that people will use every day. 'We also designed Libra in such a way so that any wallet can participate as long as KYC and AML requirements are met. It was designed to be competitive, but we still need to earn people's trust over time to use Calibra.' Marcus clarifies that there is a 'data separation between Facebook and Libra' and data will not be used for ad targeting but will bring distribution. 'Moving money around the world with WhatsApp and Messenger is what will bring real value on a day to day basis.' Neat. Whatever happens, Libra has woken up the markets to new ideas and new opportunities and maybe even a digital dollar[5],which would be no bad thing. Let's see what happens in this space.

Risky assets like subprime mortgages led to large losses and many crisis-stricken banks, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/04/09/facebook-notify-87-million-userswho-might-have-had-data-shared/\">including the Royal Bank of Scotland</url>,\u00a0had to be\u00a0bailed out by governments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Speaking at a benefit event at the weekend in New York for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, the former economic\u00a0adviser to Donald Trump\u00a0referred to the other controversy plaguing Facebook:\u00a0the spread of misinformation and fake news.</p><p>\"It's very interesting how the world turns,\" Mr Cohn was quoted by Bloomberg as saying. \"In '08 Facebook was one of those companies that was a big platform to criticise banks, they were very out front of criticising banks for not being responsible citizens. I think banks were more responsible citizens in '08 than some of the social media companies are today. And it affects everyone in the world.

But now it seems he's happy to let the big tech companies be the whipping boy.</p><p>\"Neither the banks nor social media platforms deserve to be let off the hook for their actions.

They were not clear-eyed about how malign actors could use it for bad ends,\" he said.</p><p>Professor Holden agreed that Facebook was more naive than the banks, who \"knew they were selling stuff that was, if not worthless, were worth vastly less than what they were selling them for\".</p><p>He said companies such as Facebook should learn from the anger caused by the banks, who have yet to regain the public's trust in the decade following the crisis. \"Getting out in front of it is really important,\" he said.\u00a0</p><p>\"The public just hate the banks, the public are willing to tolerate all kinds of punitive behaviour ...

As if that would make them more trustworthy....\", said David Kinley, who\u00a0holds the Chair in Human Rights Law at the University of Sydney.</p><p>Professor Kinley, author of \"Necessary Evil: How to Fix Finance by Saving Human Rights\", said there were some big similarities between the two industries.</p><p>\"Banks and financiers are now huge IT employers .... They also do mess with our privacy.</p><p>\"There is no doubt that the details that are held by banks are used in a way that will benefit them and indeed their clients to whom they choose to share the details, and of course that's the same as the social media platforms.\"</p><p>                   Banks 'have been screwing with out privacy'                   </p><p>However, there is one big difference.\u00a0</p><p>\"[The banks] have the temptation, and have yielded to the temptation, of\u00a0screwing with\u00a0our details, with our privacy. The banks have not only screwed with our details but they've financially benefited from that at our expense.</p><p>\"They've been using what details they have on us to enrich themselves whereas I think the social media have done less to thieve financially from us.

They should have known that things would end badly for a lot of innocent people.</p><p>\"In 2008 when Facebook was criticising the banks I don't think Zuckerberg and others knew, or could have known, how some people would later use this platform.</p><p>\"The relationship between them and their creation is rather like the relationship between Frankenstein and his monster.

It is privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In the past two weeks, the chief executives of Google and Facebook - two tech companies that frequently track our digital habits - have made protecting user data the central theme in their conference speeches.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But experts believe there is more that tech firms can do. Similarly, consumers want an easier way to monitor if the tech firms are actually walking the talk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> At Google's annual gathering of software developers in the United States last week, its chief executive Sundar Pichai said: \"We strongly believe that privacy and security are for everyone, not just a few.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> At the event, called Google I/O, the company said its new mobile operating system Android Q and existing products such as YouTube and Google Maps will have new privacy features so users can be in control of their data. The bulk of such data will also remain in the users' devices rather than being collected and stored in the cloud at the firm's end.</p><p> At Facebook's annual F8 developer conference two weeks ago in the US, company chief executive Mark Zuckerberg declared that \"the future is private\".</p><p> He vowed to do more, including extending popular messaging app WhatsApp's end-to-end encryption to other Facebook-owned private messaging platforms Messenger and Instagram Direct.</p><p> This spotlight on privacy and security comes as big tech firms suffer public backlash over how they handle users' personal information.</p><p> In January, Google was fined (EURO)50 million (S$76.7 million) in France for breaching European Union online privacy rules. The French regulator said Google lacked transparency and clarity in how it informs users about its handling of personal data and failed to properly obtain their consent for personalised ads.</p><p>Facebook went under intense fire after it reported, early last year, sharing the private information of as many as 87 million users with political consultancy firm Cambridge Analytica. The third-party firm had used users' personal data to design advertising and content to influence their votes during the 2016 United States presidential election.</p><p>  Experts say tighter regulatory scrutiny and heightened consumer awareness are two key drivers in protecting user privacy among big tech firms.</p><p> For instance, the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in May last year, is the biggest shake-up of data privacy laws in more than two decades. It allows users to better control their personal data and gives regulators the power to impose fines of up to 4 per cent of global revenue for violations.</p><p> The impact of the GDPR extends beyond Europe, said Ms Charmian Aw, a lawyer who specialises in information technology, privacy and data security at Reed Smith in alliance with Resource Law.</p><p> She noted that countries in the region, such as India and Thailand, are looking to adopt in their laws features that are similar to those in the GDPR. Singapore, too, has considered the GDPR to see what can be ported over to its existing law, she said.</p><p> In addition, consumers are getting more aware of issues related to data sharing and cybersecurity with the proliferation of digitalisation and all things tech, including topics such as artificial intelligence and blockchain.</p><p> \"Media coverage on privacy topics is also becoming more and more prevalent,\" she added.</p><p>  But critics have pointed out that some of the changes pledged by the tech firms are not enough to address the central issue of privacy related to data sharing.</p><p> NUS computer science professors Liang Zhenkai, Xiao Xiaokui and Reza Shokri said what is needed is a fundamental change in how user data is collected, shared and used.</p><p> \"To better safeguard user privacy, it is important that user data should be carefully sanitised before leaving their devices,\" they said in an e-mail response.</p><p> So far, only Google and Apple have applied an advanced privacy preservation mechanism, and only some of their data collection processes.</p><p> \"Not all data collected by all vendors are protected by such a mechanism,\" they added.</p><p> Mr Claus Mortensen, principal analyst of Ecosystm, a technology research and advisory firm, pointed out that Facebook had talked only about the encryption of its private messaging services - Messenger and Instagram Direct. It had skirted the central issue of data sharing.</p><p> \"Facebook's chequered history with regard to privacy has been its liberal use and sharing of user data... on the main Facebook platform.</p><p> \"It is this data that was shared with Cambridge Analytica, with leading handset manufacturers and a number of other Internet companies without the users' knowledge or explicit consent,\" he said.</p><p> He did not think Facebook would walk the talk and put new privacy safeguards into effect until it comes up with a clear business strategy to wean itself off data sharing as the main revenue-generating tool.</p><p> But he said that Google, on the other hand, has taken some real steps that would help protect user privacy, including stopping the scanning of Gmail users' e-mails for ad targeting and rolling out an auto-delete feature that erases Web and app activity after three or 18 months.</p><p> Ms Aw said such actions lean towards a privacy by design approach, which is to embed user privacy in product or service features. This is what tech firms need to do on top of the usual consent clauses that they present to users.</p><p> \"Ultimately, the burden lies on these tech firms to demonstrate that they are accountable and compliant with the law,\" she added.</p><p>  Consumers tell The Straits Times they welcome such moves by tech giants to protect their data, but it is hard for them to know if these firms are actually walking the talk.</p><p> \"They tell you they are implementing new rules, but there is no oversight. How do you know what actually flows out of your computer'\" said Mr Dennis Chu, 38, a business development manager at an engineering firm.</p><p> Dr Kua Shin Yii, 41, a doctor in private practice, thinks these new privacy measures are a step in the right direction, but much of her data could have been collected anyway prior to these new pledges.</p><p> \"I feel Google and Facebook are feeding me information based on what I surf. And we don't know how much data has been collected already,\" she said.</p><p> Indeed, Mr Mortensen thinks this hints at the motivation behind these two tech giants' current initiatives.</p><p> \"Google probably hasn't stopped scanning Gmail users' messages because they really want to provide them with greater levels of privacy - they have stopped because they don't need to anymore.</p><p> \"They now have the capability to target ads effectively without the need for scanning the content of e-mails,\" he noted.</p><p> \"Similarly, they don't need to know a user's app and Web history for the last several years - more current behaviour is enough and often more relevant for ad targeting.\"</p><p> As for Facebook, it is simply not ready to cut off access yet.</p><p> \"They still haven't worked out how to target and contextualise ad content without giving (advertisers) access to extensive user data. Once they figure it out, we will probably see very public announcements from Facebook about it,\" Mr Mortensen added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-586291</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W3W-RGM1-JCF2-8038-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1190\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 15, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002WML</classCode><className>REED SMITH LLP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

This also increases the danger of abuse.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">   GABRIEL KNUPFER</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Those who often take pictures with the iPhone have been able to follow the rapid development of automatic face recognition. While a few years ago, the assignment of people in the photo collection on the device was almost done on a whim, glasses, make-up and haircuts have long since ceased to be a problem for identification. The smartphone also reliably recognizes its owner and their family members - so reliably that you can unlock the screen with your face.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Behind this is a technological achievement, with many other applications. In law enforcement, computers already match images of suspects with stored photos in a database, thus facilitating the work of the police. In the course of the current protests against racism and police violence in the USA, however, this has been strongly criticized. Due to public pressure, several tech companies terminated their cooperation with the American police authorities, at least temporarily. This is remarkable because it is a lucrative and promising business. During the pandemic there are also new opportunities for use.</p><p>The market research company Grand View Research estimated the global market for facial recognition software at $3.4 billion in 2019, with an expected annual growth rate of around 15 percent between 2020 and 2027. However, such figures are speculative and vary depending on the study's design and scope. On the other hand, it is undisputed that facial recognition is gaining in importance and is being used in more and more areas. But what is it all about and what are the problems? Five questions and answers on the controversial future technology.</p><p>1 How does the technology work?</p><p>Automatic facial recognition is a biometric method of identification and is therefore similar to a fingerprint scan. The software proceeds in three steps: First, a face is recognized as such. Second, this face is compared with a database and third, it is identified. The aim is to uniquely assign it to a name.</p><p>Originally, the positions of features such as eyes, nose and mouth were measured. Today, more complex calculations are behind them. Nevertheless, the technology is still more error-prone than other biometric methods. The hit rate depends on the facial expression, the illumination, the angle of the shot and the resolution of the image. This can be seen, for example, in the fact that for identity card photos you still have to have as neutral a facial expression as possible. More recent developments include 3D processes, which are supposed to enable greater accuracy, and programs that recognize and evaluate feelings.</p><p>The fact that face recognition is contactless has advantages. The risk of infection - for example with the corona virus - is reduced and in the security area, cooperation of the target person is unnecessary. But exactly this also raises questions regarding privacy and data protection.</p><p>2 What are the applications?</p><p>Face recognition is used in many areas - and new possibilities are constantly being added. The future of the technology is particularly interesting, says Christian Fehrlin, who offers facial recognition software through Deep Impact in Winterthur. \"Starting with the biometric boarding pass, through entrance controls and surveillance, to hotel check-in, we see enormous potential,\" says the entrepreneur. Then there are payment solutions and ticketing in the event area. The forecast of the study mentioned at the beginning is therefore \"very conservative \", Fehrlin believes.</p><p>In China, where the technology is already much more widespread than in the West, you can already shop with your face, withdraw money and check in at the airport. In schools, the presence and even the attention of students is monitored. And if you go to the zoo or museum, you have to have your face scanned as well. For access control in offices, facial recognition replaces secret codes and fingerprint scanners; at national borders it complements older biometric methods.</p><p>The technology is also being used against Covid-19. In Russia, facial-recognition cameras monitor whether people comply with the quarantine - and in China they identify people who have a fever. This works in both countries, even if people wear a protective mask.</p><p>In a test, the police in the Canadian capital Ottawa reduced the average time to identify a suspect using a picture from thirty days to three minutes, according to the Economist. Instead of manually comparing the image with the 50,000 police photos stored in the system or sending it to various branches and asking for information, a quick search on the computer was sufficient. The Chinese police are casting the net even further, searching for suspects using surveillance cameras and data glasses in combination with face recognition.</p><p>Another application is the search for missing persons. When Amazon announced a one-year moratorium on the use of its face recognition system by the police authorities, it explicitly excluded the search for victims of human trafficking and missing children. In 2018, Delhi police found nearly 3,000 missing children in just four days by using such software.</p><p>3 Which companies and countries are involved?</p><p>The big tech companies are involved as well as start-ups and armament companies. A study by the Carnegie Foundation for International Peace examined the largest suppliers of smart surveillance technology in 2019. According to the study, the Chinese companies Huawei, Hikvision, Dahua and ZTE are the leaders. Japan's NEC is the first non-Chinese company to follow suit, having reportedly installed over a thousand larger face recognition systems in more than seventy countries and regions.</p><p>The US tech giants are also among the big players in the industry, even if not all of them deliver to the surveillance sector. Google, for example, does not offer the technology for sale. IBM ended its cooperation with the security authorities in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests. Microsoft and Amazon followed suit and temporarily suspended their deliveries (see point 4).</p><p>Apart from numerous companies that need facial recognition for their products, services or locations, states purchase such systems for surveillance or crime prevention. Liberal democracies are leading users of surveillance technology such as facial recognition cameras, writes the Carnegie Foundation. More than half of these countries use them, \"but that doesn't necessarily mean that democracies abuse these systems.\"</p><p>4 What is criticized?</p><p>Almost as long as the list of applications is the list of criticisms. IBM technology must no longer be used for mass surveillance, racial profiling or the violation of basic human rights and freedoms, wrote CEO Arvind Krishna to the US Congress. \"Vendors and users of AI systems have a responsibility to check AI for bias, especially when used in law enforcement.\" The problem is that technology is less reliable at recognizing black people's faces than white people's. Moreover, the fact that more black people are listed in police databases further increases the risk of members of this population group being falsely identified. This is why the city of San Francisco banned the use of facial recognition by the police even before the current wave of protests.</p><p>The way companies and government agencies create their databases is also problematic. The US start-up Clearview collected three billion portrait photos from the Internet by scanning websites and social networks like Facebook. Among the users were numerous US authorities and companies, official bodies in Europe - including Switzerland - and organizations in totalitarian states such as Saudi Arabia, reported \"Buzz Feed News\" in February. The US civil rights organization Aclu sued Clearview for illegal data collection and accused the company of \"destroying privacy \".</p><p>On top of all this, there is a danger that government agencies or criminals could misuse facial recognition. Dictatorships use it to pursue their opponents or control the population to an unprecedented extent (see box). There are also opportunities for hackers, although the technology has so far been considered relatively secure in this respect. However, if ever larger amounts of personal data are stored, the risk of identity theft naturally increases. Experts from the Chinese company Tencent, for example, have shown that systems such as Apple's Face ID can be deceived, even though the method is still virtually impossible to use in practice.</p><p>5 What happens next?</p><p>In the USA, face recognition is currently in a difficult state. But for the technology as a whole this is only a minor setback. First, its use by the police is only one of many applications. And secondly, there is no common line in the industry - even in this area. There are enough companies that can fill the gap that IBM and Co. would leave behind.</p><p>Future use in law enforcement will have to be regulated politically and legally in the different countries. In commercial use, however, the genie is probably already out of the bottle. \"It will prevail because the convenience is very high,\" says Fehrlin.</p><p>In the end, consumers will decide for which purposes they will make their face available.</p><p>Digital surveillance in China</p><p>Control While the pros and cons of automatic face recognition are still being discussed in North America and Europe, the use of the technology is already widespread in China and is being continuously expanded. According to IHS Markit, about half of the 770 million surveillance cameras worldwide are installed in China. Combined with facial recognition software, this enables the authorities to exercise unprecedented control over the country's 1.4 billion inhabitants. Meanwhile, a genuine public debate on data protection and surveillance is preventing censorship in China.</p><p>Uyghurs Since December 2019, mobile phone users have had to undergo a face scan when they register a new SIM card. This allows the state to create a database of the faces of its inhabitants. Critics fear that this will bring the whole of China into line with the autonomous region of Xinjiang, where people in public places have been under constant surveillance for some time. This surveillance has been accompanied by the arrest of hundreds of thousands to millions of Muslim Uyghurs who are being held in re-education camps because of their religion.</p><p>Pillory Everywhere in the country, police are upgrading with data glasses with which suspects can be identified in real time. The software is so advanced that it can recognize and evaluate emotions. Facial recognition is not only used against alleged separatism and extremism: in some cities, people who had crossed the street at red lights were identified and pilloried on huge screens. \"Face recognition protects human rights,\" according to the Global Times, the government's international mouthpiece.</p><p>Social credit The expansion of automatic face recognition is part of a larger campaign under ruler Xi Jinping to strengthen social stability in the party's interests. Based on surveillance, artificial intelligence and Big Data, the Communist Party wants to secure its power in the long term. This includes the social credit system, which classifies the population by awarding and withdrawing points for their behavior and rewards or punishes them depending on their score. Those with a low score must expect restrictions in everyday life.</p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Document original</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"ASVHANZ20200716004TEXT\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"14993\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Document original</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"ASVHANZ20200716005TEXT\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"14993\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Video surveillance: The combination with face recognition is becoming more popular.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HANDEN-172051637</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HANDEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60C8-4P01-JBK9-240K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465481</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1899\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Ringier Axel Springer Schweiz AG All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Handelszeitung (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12657\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>No. 28</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000184</classCode><className>BIOMETRICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp;

The law, known as Section 230, makes it nearly impossible to sue platforms like Facebook or Google for the words, images and videos posted by their users.</p><p>  The companies' motivations vary somewhat. Hollywood is concerned about copyright abuse, especially abroad, while Marriott would like to make it harder for Airbnb to fight local hotel laws. IBM wants consumer online services to be more responsible for the content on their sites.</p><p>  But they all see an opening as both Democrats and Republicans increasingly raise their own concerns about the power of the tech industry and the law. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 has helped Facebook, Google and YouTube grow into giants by holding only the people who post the billions of pieces of content on their services responsible for libel or other legal issues.</p><p>  Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said in a recent interview that Section 230 should be immediately ''revoked.'' Senators Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, and Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat, are drafting bills that could increase the tech companies' liability. The Justice Department is conducting a review of the law.</p><p>  ''People are either mad at tech companies and, legitimately in some cases, want to constrain their power for a lot of reasons,'' said Daphne Keller, a professor at Stanford Law School who used to be a lawyer for Google. ''Or companies are competing with tech companies and want to constrain their power for competitive reasons.</p><p>  ''And a lot of those reasons are really complicated, but the easiest lever to hurt tech companies that a lot of people see is 230.''</p><p>  So far, the companies critical of the law have had mixed success with their lobbying. In 2018, Congress gave victims and prosecutors more power to sue websites that knowingly aided sex trafficking. The law passed with support from companies like Disney, Oracle and IBM.</p><p>  But the recent trade pact with Canada and Mexico contained Section 230-like protections, potentially locking in tech-friendly rules abroad.</p><p>  Now critics of Section 230 are focused on pushing to keep similar language out of future trade pacts. A handout distributed by Disney's lobbyists last year warned Congress that trade deals with the provision would make it difficult for Congress to change the law in a way that improved the internet.</p><p>  ''On an almost weekly basis,'' the handout said, ''additional concerns are being raised: illegal opioid sales, spread of terrorist propaganda, foreign government election meddling, spread of material and tools that help pedophiles connect.''</p><p>  Companies like Google and Facebook say that without Section 230 protections, building a business that gives individuals a platform for their content online would be impossible. They say it also shields online platforms from lawsuits when they police criminal or distasteful content.</p><p>  Silicon Valley can employ significant resources to make its case. Google and Facebook spend millions a year on federal lobbying and are regular donors to outside policy groups. Their allies on Capitol Hill, like Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, have defended the law.</p><p>  Michael Beckerman, the president of the Internet Association, an industry group whose members include Google and Facebook, said Section 230 was ''foundational to almost everything people do online.''</p><p>  ''It enables products and services that consumers love and rely upon every day,'' Mr. Beckerman said in a statement.</p><p>  While criticism of Section 230 had mounted for years, the coalition of corporate interests questioning the value of the protections took root in late 2017 when Disney and 21st Century Fox backed the bill allowing lawsuits against web platforms for knowingly facilitating sex trafficking.</p><p>  ''I had never seen them getting involved in any Section 230 issues before,'' said Jeff Kosseff, a lawyer who wrote a book about the law.</p><p>  Now, hotel companies worry about Airbnb's use of Section 230 in lawsuits seeking to block local ordinances regulating home-sharing platforms. Judges have ruled against the company in many of those cases.</p><p>  The Washington lobbying group that represents companies like Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt has backed a bill that would amend Section 230 so it didn't apply to home-rental services in many cases.</p><p>  Airbnb declined to comment.</p><p>IBM, which like other enterprise software providers is trying to distance itself from businesses like Facebook, has supported adjusting Section 230 so that companies must take ''reasonable care'' to keep unlawful uses of their platforms in check. The proposal would apply to companies that not only hosted information but also made it available to the public. That means it would cover a consumer service like Instagram but not to a cloud computing provider like IBM.</p><p>  The Motion Picture Association and the News Media Alliance, a group that lobbies for news organizations, have urged the Trump administration not to allow the protections in a future trade deal with Britain. The film group's concern is that it could make copyright enforcement more difficult. (The New York Times is a member of the News Media Alliance.)</p><p>  Many of the consumer groups that have been critical of Section 230 don't share the companies' motivations. But they welcome the help from the companies, which have vast lobbying networks and the ability to get a meeting with the right aide at just the right time.</p><p>  Gretchen Peters, who leads the Alliance to Counter Crime Online, a group critical of Section 230, said her small organization was spread thin. If ''somebody else, like the Disney folks or the hotel folks,'' set up a meeting, she said, ''I'll come along.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Joseph R.

The law, known as Section 230, makes it nearly impossible to sue platforms like Facebook or Google for the words, images and videos posted by their users.</p><p>The companies' motivations vary somewhat. Hollywood is concerned about copyright abuse, especially abroad, while Marriott would like to make it harder for Airbnb to fight local hotel laws. IBM wants consumer online services to be more responsible for the content on their sites.</p><p>But they all see an opening as Democrats and Republicans increasingly raise their own concerns about the power of the tech industry and the law. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 has helped Facebook, Google and YouTube grow into giants by holding only the people who post the billions of pieces of content on their services responsible for libel or other legal issues.</p><p>Former Vice President Joe Biden said in a recent interview that Section 230 should be immediately \"revoked.\" Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, are drafting bills that could increase the tech companies' liability. The Justice Department is conducting a review of the law.</p><p>\"People are either mad at tech companies and, legitimately in some cases, want to constrain their power for a lot of reasons,\" said Daphne Keller, a professor at Stanford Law School who used to be a lawyer for Google. </p><p>\"Or companies are competing with tech companies and want to constrain their power for competitive reasons. And a lot of those reasons are really complicated, but the easiest lever to hurt tech companies that a lot of people see is 230,\" Keller said.</p><p>So far, the companies critical of the law have had mixed success with their lobbying. In 2018, Congress gave victims and prosecutors more power to sue websites that knowingly aided sex trafficking. The law passed with support from companies like Disney, Oracle and IBM.</p><p>But the recent trade deal with Canada and Mexico contained Section 230-like protections, potentially locking in tech-friendly rules abroad.</p><p>Now critics of Section 230 are focused on pushing to keep similar language out of future trade pacts.

The film group's concern is that it could make copyright enforcement more difficult. (The New York Times is a member of the News Media Alliance.)</p><p>Many of the consumer groups that have been critical of Section 230 do not share the companies' motivations. But they welcome the help from the companies, which have vast lobbying networks and the ability to get a meeting with the right aide at the right time.</p><p>Gretchen Peters, who leads the Alliance to Counter Crime Online, a group critical of Section 230, said her small organization was spread thin.

Marriott has asked Congress to amend the law. IBM has a plan to slim it down.</p><p>An unusual constellation of powerful companies and industries are fighting to weaken Big Tech by limiting the reach of one of its most sacred laws. The law, known as Section 230, makes it nearly impossible to sue platforms like Facebook or Google for the words, images and videos posted by their users.</p><p>The companies' motivations vary. Hollywood is concerned about copyright abuse, especially abroad, while Marriott would like to make it harder for Airbnb to fight local hotel laws. But they all see an opening as Democrats and Republicans increasingly raise their own concerns about the power of the tech industry and the law. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 has helped Facebook, Google and YouTube grow into giants by holding only the people who post the billions of pieces of content on their services responsible for libel or other legal issues.</p><p>The Justice Department is conducting a review of the law.</p><p>\"People are either mad at tech companies and, legitimately in some cases, want to constrain their power for a lot of reasons,\" said Daphne Keller, a professor at Stanford Law School who used to be a lawyer for Google. \"Or companies are competing with tech companies and want to constrain their power for competitive reasons. And a lot of those reasons are really complicated, but the easiest lever to hurt tech companies that a lot of people see is 230.\"</p><p>In 2018, Congress gave victims and prosecutors more power to sue websites that knowingly aided sex trafficking. The law passed with support from companies like Disney, Oracle and IBM. But the recent trade deal with Canada and Mexico contained Section 230-like protections, potentially locking in tech-friendly rules abroad.</p><p>Now, critics of Section 230 are focused on pushing to keep similar language out of future trade pacts.</p><p>Companies like Google and Facebook say without Section 230 protections, building a business that gives individuals a platform for their content would be impossible. They say it also shields online platforms from lawsuits when they police criminal or distasteful content.</p><p>Now, hotel companies worry about Airbnb's use of Section 230 in lawsuits seeking to block local ordinances regulating home-sharing platforms.</p><p>The Washington lobbying group that represents companies like Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt has backed a bill that would amend Section 230 so it did not apply to home-rental services in many cases. Airbnb declined to comment.</p><p>IBM has supported adjusting Section 230 so companies must take \"reasonable care\" to keep unlawful uses of their platforms in check. The proposal would apply to companies that not only hosted information but also made it available to the public. That means it would cover a consumer service like Instagram but not to a cloud computing provider like IBM.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2020020557111860</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4R-R231-JBTY-W4GP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"492\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 5, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002HH3</classCode><className>ORACLE CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS541511 CUSTOM COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC7379 COMPUTER RELATED SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC7371 COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Marriott has asked Congress to amend the law. IBM has a plan to slim it down.</p><p>An unusual constellation of powerful companies and industries are fighting to weaken Big Tech by limiting the reach of one of its most sacred laws. The law, known as Section 230, makes it nearly impossible to sue platforms like Facebook or Google for the words, images and videos posted by their users.</p><p>The companies' motivations vary. Hollywood is concerned about copyright abuse, especially abroad, while Marriott would like to make it harder for Airbnb to fight local hotel laws. But they all see an opening as Democrats and Republicans increasingly raise their own concerns about the power of the tech industry and the law. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 has helped Facebook, Google and YouTube grow into giants by holding only the people who post the billions of pieces of content on their services responsible for libel or other legal issues.</p><p>The Justice Department is conducting a review of the law.</p><p>\"People are either mad at tech companies and, legitimately in some cases, want to constrain their power for a lot of reasons,\" said Daphne Keller, a professor at Stanford Law School who used to be a lawyer for Google. \"Or companies are competing with tech companies and want to constrain their power for competitive reasons. And a lot of those reasons are really complicated, but the easiest lever to hurt tech companies that a lot of people see is 230.\"</p><p>In 2018, Congress gave victims and prosecutors more power to sue websites that knowingly aided sex trafficking. The law passed with support from companies like Disney, Oracle and IBM. But the recent trade deal with Canada and Mexico contained Section 230-like protections, potentially locking in tech-friendly rules abroad.</p><p>Now, critics of Section 230 are focused on pushing to keep similar language out of future trade pacts.</p><p>Companies like Google and Facebook say without Section 230 protections, building a business that gives individuals a platform for their content would be impossible. They say it also shields online platforms from lawsuits when they police criminal or distasteful content.</p><p>Now, hotel companies worry about Airbnb's use of Section 230 in lawsuits seeking to block local ordinances regulating home-sharing platforms.</p><p>The Washington lobbying group that represents companies like Marriott, Hilton and Hyatt has backed a bill that would amend Section 230 so it did not apply to home-rental services in many cases. Airbnb declined to comment.</p><p>IBM has supported adjusting Section 230 so companies must take \"reasonable care\" to keep unlawful uses of their platforms in check. The proposal would apply to companies that not only hosted information but also made it available to the public. That means it would cover a consumer service like Instagram but not to a cloud computing provider like IBM.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KWREC-2020020557109635</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KWREC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4R-S3S1-F103-34KJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247362</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"492\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Metroland Media Group Ltd.

The debate ...</p><p>with Brent D. Griffiths   If President Trump secures confirmation of his third pick for the Supreme Court, the institution would become a font of business-friendly decisions for years to come, many corporate and public interest lawyers alike say.    The debate around the consequences of the coming confirmation fight is reaching full tilt before Trump has even announced his nominee. It is primarily centering on what a 6-to-3 conservative majority will mean for hot-button social issues, namely, abortion rights , the future of the Affordable Care Act and the role the Supreme Court could play in a potential post-election legal battle over a contested result.    Yet the court is also primed to rule on a slate of issues pitting big-business interests against consumers and workers \u2013 with sweeping consequences for the balance of power between them.    This court already treats business interests more favorably than any in nearly a century, some scholars argue . In its 2017 term, the court returned pro-business decisions in more than 80 percent of the cases in which they were at stake, according to an  by Adam Feldman, author of the Empirical SCOTUS blog.   That was before Brett Kavanaugh replaced Anthony Kennedy on the court, advancing the court\u2019s rightward shift. Trump\u2019s pick is primed to cement that evolution. Per Feldman\u2019s analysis, the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the least business-friendly justice from 2015 through 2017:   Adding another justice likely to side with the corporate agenda, public-interest lawyers who argue before the court say, will make it harder for consumer and worker advocates to convert a swing vote to their side or narrow the scope of business-friendly decisions.   \u201cWith a 5-4 court, where there\u2019s more balance, a lot of issues are just one vote away. That becomes less true with a 6-3 court,\u201d says appellate lawyer Deepak Gupta, founder of Gupta Wessler. The dynamic enabled by that close division played out in May 2019, when the court  a defeat to Apple in a case that enabled a major antitrust class action against the tech giant to advance. Justice Kavanaugh cited precedent in joining the four more-liberal justices to forge a majority.   There are several areas of the law where business interests could see breakthrough victories under the new margin. Here are some to watch:   1. Corporations want to limit plaintiffs' right to challenge them by cracking down on where they sue.  The court is set to hear a case on the matter that will most likely be argued before a ninth justice is confirmed. It turns on two deadly car crashes involving malfunctioning Fords. The accidents occurred in Montana and Minnesota, and the plaintiffs want to sue the auto giant in those states; Ford contends because the cars were neither made nor sold in either place, it can\u2019t be held liable in their courts.   \u201cThe main thing corporations seek from the Supreme Court is limitations on the ability to sue them,\u201d says Allison Zieve, director of Public Citizen\u2019s litigation group. \u201cThere have been significant limitations imposed or recognized over the last couple of decades, and they\u2019ll continue to do that.\u201d   Sidley Austin partner Jonathan Cohn agrees a 6-3 court is more likely to narrow a practice he calls \u201clitigation tourism\u201d \u2014 a particularly high priority for the pharmaceutical industry.   2. Industry is looking to keep lawsuits against them out of the courts, forcing them into private arbitration.   Another way corporations seek to limit their exposure to lawsuits is by keeping disputes out of the courts through private arbitration. The court will hear arguments this fall over the scope of those agreements in a case that involves an antitrust suit against dental equipment wholesaler Henry Schein. But public interest advocates say many more related cases are probably coming. \u201cThese cases have tended to produce 5-4 splits, with enormous implications for the ability of consumers to hold businesses accountable,\u201d Gupta says.  3. Big business also wants to scale back the ability independent federal agencies to regulate industry.  Industry is seeking to circumscribe regulators\u2019 authority, in part by challenging the constitutionality of agencies insulated from oversight by elected officials. The court in a 5-to-4 decision this summer struck down the single-director structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. But that ruling was a \u201csheep that comes in wolf\u2019s clothing,\u201d as former CFPB director Richard Cordray wrote , because it otherwise preserved the agency.   A similar challenge to the Federal Housing Finance Agency is pending , and more are probably on the way. \u201cThis is a long-term project: Justice Kavanaugh believes pretty strongly that the Constitution limits the arrangements for administrative agencies,\u201d Gupta says. At stake, he says, is the government\u2019s ability \u201cto take important issues and delegate them to experts who won\u2019t be captured by powerful industries and get the results they want.\u201d  4. Companies are increasingly invoking the First Amendment to challenge regulations.   Companies are increasingly invoking the First Amendment to challenge costly or burdensome regulations.   The strategy has met with a mixed record. Last year, for example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit  e-cigarette makers made a meritless argument when they contended a ban on the distribution of free samples violated their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court declined to take up a challenge Spirit Airlines launched on free-speech grounds to federal rules governing how it advertises ticket prices and taxes to passengers. And the court rejected an appeal by the CTIA, the wireless communications industry group, aimed at striking down a Berkeley, Calif., ordinance that requires cellphone retailers to warn buyers of radiation risks.   Others have found success. Trade groups including the American Beverage Association convinced a federal appeals court last year that a San Francisco ordinance mandating warnings on sugary drinks violated the First Amendment.    Most significantly, big business won a landmark victory in 2018 when the high court ruled \u201cit was unconstitutional to allow public employee unions to require collective-bargaining fees from workers who choose not to join the union, a major blow for the U.S. labor movement,\u201d Robert Barnes and Ann Marimow  at the time. \u201cThe court, in a 5-to-4 decision, overturned a 40-year-old precedent, arguing that the rule could require workers to give financial support to public policy positions they oppose.\u201d Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, said the rule violated workers\u2019 free-speech rights.   Court watchers say business interests may seek to bring more such cases, in which the argument would be more likely to find favor with a 6-to-3 conservative majority.  Some corporate lawyers warn against overstating the impact of a new justice.  And they say a conservative majority doesn't equate in all cases to a business-friendly one. \u201cI don\u2019t think the court is either business-friendly or not business-friendly,\u201d says Helgi Walker, chair of Gibson Dunn\u2019s administrative law and regulatory practice group. \u201cIf a Trump nominee is confirmed, you\u2019ll have a court that is perhaps that much more likely to follow the law that Congress writes and let Congress make the policy decisions, which is how the separation of powers is supposed to work.\u201d   But Cohn says it\u2019s a reasonable conclusion. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to oversimplify it. But on balance, you could probably expect more of a reception to business-oriented arguments.\u201d  Market movers Dow drops more than 500 points.  Tech pressure continues to mount: \u201cThe Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 525.05 points lower, or 1.9 percent, at 26,763.13. Earlier in the session, the Dow was up 176 points. The S&amp;P 500 slid 2.4 percent to 3,236.92 and the Nasdaq Composite pulled back by 3 percent to close at 10,632.99,\u201d CNBC's Fred Imbert and Maggie Fitzgerald report .   \u201cShares of Amazon and Netflix dropped 4.1 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively, to lead Big Tech lower. Facebook slid 2.3 percent. Alphabet closed 3.5 percent lower. Apple ended the day down 4.2 percent and Microsoft dipped 3.3 percent.\u201d (Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)  The S&amp;P 500 is approaching correction territory . \u201c The benchmark gauge of U.S. equities is poised for its first monthly slide since March,\u201d Bloomberg's Rita Nazareth and Sarah Ponczek note .  Latest on the federal pandemic response Top CEOs call for \u201cmajor\u201d stimulus as relief talks remain stalled.  Executives say the economy is getting better but that the nation can't afford to backslide: \u201cRoughly 1 in 4 chief executives of some of the nation\u2019s largest companies say their businesses have recovered or will have by year end, despite the lingering ill effects of the coronavirus recession, according to a survey,\u201d Hannah Denham reports .   \u201cBusiness Roundtable surveyed 149 members about projected sales, capital spending and hiring for the next six months. The CEO Economic Outlook Survey rose to 64.0 in the third quarter, the headline index\u2019s first quarterly increase in nine quarters, according to a report released Wednesday. The index is up 29.7 points since last quarter but remains well below the historical average of 81.7, which dates to 2002.\u201d  Key quote : \"Further major support from the federal government is necessary to prevent economic recovery from being derailed,\u201d Joshua Bolten, president and chief executive of Business Roundtable said in a statement. \u201cFailure to act, along with the lack of comprehensive and coordinated efforts to stop the spread of covid-19, would impose long term damage on the U.S. economy, hurting most the workers and small businesses least able to absorb the blow.\u201d  Unemployment claims expected to remain high . \u201c The number of workers in the U.S. applying for jobless benefits likely held at historically high levels last week as the labor market slowly recovers from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d WSJ's Sarah Chaney reports . \u201cEconomists expect applications for jobless benefits ticked down to 850,000 last week from 860,000 a week earlier. Jobless claims are down significantly from a peak of near seven million in March but have stagnated at just over 800,000 in recent weeks.\u201d   Fed officials are also maintaining calls for more spending: \u201cThe recovery would move along faster \u2018if there is support coming both from Congress and from the Fed,\u2019 Chairman Jerome Powell said during the second of three days of congressional testimony Wednesday,\u201d the Wall Street Journal's Nick Timiraos reports .   \u201cChicago Fed President Charles Evans told reporters that his projection that the unemployment rate would fall below 6 percent by the end of next year had been premised on around $1 trillion in additional fiscal relief \u2026 Powell and his colleagues said Congress and the White House, more than the Fed, had the power to hasten a faster recovery.\u201d    Fed policymakers vow to keep interest rates near zero: \u201cFederal Reserve officials on doubled down on efforts to convince investors they will keep monetary policy easy for years to allow unemployment to fall, emphasizing that interest rates will stay near zero until inflation gets to 2 percent and stays there,\u201d Reuters's Howard Schneider, Ann Saphir, Jonnelle Marte report . \u201cBoth Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida and [Evans] were adamant on Wednesday: Rates will not increase until labor markets recover fully from the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus, and prices hit the Fed\u2019s target.\u201d Goldman Sachs now says more stimulus isn't coming this year . \u201c We think it is now clear that Congress will not attach additional fiscal stimulus to the continuing resolution,\u201d firm economists wrote in a note. They estimate \u201cthe withdrawal of fiscal support will reduce disposable income in Q4 to roughly the pre-pandemic level.\u201d And as a consequence, they are cutting their fourth-quarter growth forecast in half, from 6 percent to 3 percent, on a quarterly annualized basis.  Coronavirus fallout More from the United States: Feared outbreaks in schools yet to arrive, early data shows: \u201cThousands of students and teachers have become sick with the coronavirus since schools began opening last month, but public health experts have found little evidence that the virus is spreading inside buildings, and the rates of infection are far below what is found in the surrounding communities,\" Laura Meckler and Valerie Strauss report . Trump attacks FDA plan for tougher standards on emergency vaccine approval: \u201cThe president said he had \u2018tremendous trust in these massive companies\u2019 developing prospective vaccines and suggested that they, not federal regulators, could best determine when a vaccine should be made available to the American people,\u201d Amy Goldstein and Laurie McGinley report . Fauci chides Sen. Rand Paul over herd immunity claims: \u201cWhite House coronavirus advisor Anthony S. Fauci pushed back against Paul's claim that New York has overcome the pandemic because it achieved herd immunity, telling the Kentucky Republican he\u2019s \u2018not listening,\u2019\u201d CNBC's Noah Higgins-Dunn reports . See the exchange here:  From the corporate front: United Airlines, pilots union agree  to delay furloughs until Oct. 30: \u201cHowever, pilots will not be paid during the month of October if that deal does not pass, according to a memorandum of understanding between United and the union representing its 13,000 pilots that was seen by Reuters,\u201d Tracy Rucinski reports . Disney pushes some of its biggest blockbusters well into 2021: \u201cThe studio, which is the driver of a large share of theatrical moviegoing around the world, is postponing its biggest films to at least May, with one being postponed until December 2021,\u201d Steven Zeitchik reports . The delays also mean that for the first time since 2009 there will be no new movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the highest-grossing film franchise of all-time. The world's largest hedgefund is operating out of tents in a Connecticut forest: \u201cOut among the pine trees across from Bridgewater Associates\u2019 headquarters in Westport, Conn., sit as many as 50 employees who help manage the $140 billion in assets of the world\u2019s largest hedge fund,\u201d Fortune's Jen Wieczner reports . Trump insists protesters are throwing Bumble Bee tuna cans, in the midst of pandemic tuna shortage: \u201cThere have been no media reports about police being hit by cans of tuna. Since the start of the pandemic, tuna fish has been in high demand,\u201d Laura Reiley reports . Pocket change California to phase out sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035.  This is a historic shift for a state that helped create car culture: \u201cFacing a record-breaking wildfire season as well as years of heat waves and droughts exacerbated by climate change, the Golden State is seeking to accelerate the shift away from combustion engines on its roads, which account for more greenhouse gas emissions than any other source,\u201d Dino Grandoni, Faiz Siddiqui and Brady Dennis report .   \u201cThe plan would give industry until 2045 to make sure medium- and heavy-duty vehicles are zero-emissions when feasible. Transportation currently accounts for the largest source of emissions in the state, outpacing the industrial, agricultural and residential sectors combined \u2026 Because of its market muscle, California\u2019s move could have ripple effects across the country and propel automakers to ramp up production of electric vehicles. Thirteen other states and the District of Columbia already follow California\u2019s fuel efficiency standards, and auto manufacturers have long built cars to meet its more stringent specifications.\u201d   Wells Fargo CEO apologizes after blaming shortage of Black talent for the bank's lack of diversity: \u201cCharlie Scharf apologized in a memo to the entire company \u2018for making an insensitive comment reflecting my own unconscious bias,\u2019 \u201d Hamza Shaban reports .   \u201cThe Wells Fargo controversy comes as protests of police brutality and racism have swept across the country, drawing pledges from corporate America to fight racial inequality. It also comes as Wells Fargo, one of the country\u2019s largest banks, continues to struggle to repair its image after a series of consumer abuse scandals, including admitting that it had opened millions of fake accounts customers didn\u2019t want.\u201d   JPMorgan set to pay  nearly $1 billion in spoofing penalty: \u201cThe bank is set to pay nearly $1 billion to resolve market manipulation investigations by U.S. authorities into its trading of metals futures and Treasury securities,\u201d Reuters's Lawrence Delevingne and Abhishek Manikandan report .   \u201cThe large fine would lift a regulatory shadow that has hung over the bank for several years and mark a signature victory for the government\u2019s efforts to clamp down on illegal trading techniques, such as spoofing, especially in the precious metals markets.\u201d  Trump tracker Judge orders Eric Trump to meet with N.Y. attorney general before the election.  Eric Trump had claimed he's too busy for a deposition:  \"A state judge ordered Eric Trump to be deposed no later than Oct. 7 in the New York attorney general's examination of the Trump Organization's financial practices, rejecting a protest by Trump's son, who has said he is too busy to meet with investigators until after November's election,\u201d Shayna Jacobs reports from New York.   \u201cThe judge also ordered that the Trump Organization and related business entities that were withholding documents and claiming attorney-client privilege proceed with producing records to the attorney general. The probe is a civil matter, not a criminal one. James\u2019s office has said the Trump Organization potentially misled lenders and duped tax authorities.\u201d  The regulators SEC raises bar for shareholder resolutions.  The changes address one of SEC Chairman Jay Clayton\u2019s top priorities: \u201cCommissioners voted 3-2 to pass a final rule requiring shareholders to hold $25,000 of stock for a year, up from $2,000 currently, in order to submit such proposals. That threshold will fall to $15,000 after two years of ownership and to $2,000 after three years, setting a sliding scale that gives priority to longer-term shareholders,\u201d WSJ's Paul Kiernan reports .   \u201cClayton and the two Republican commissioners who supported the change said it would discourage so-called gadfly investors from buying stocks simply to pressure companies to advance their personal beliefs \u2026 Critics of the move said it was the Trump administration\u2019s latest effort to stymie Wall Street\u2019s growing focus on environmental, social and governance\u2014or ESG\u2014issues, which are the subject of most shareholder proposals.\u201d  Money on the Hill DOJ to seek congressional action to reduce internet companies' immunity.  Such a bill is extremely unlikely to pass before the election: \u201cThe proposal advances two main goals the Trump administration and the department outlined in June: encouraging online platforms to actively address illicit conduct and manage content on their sites in fair and consistent ways,\u201d WSJ's Ryan Tracy and Brent Kendall report .   \u201cThe department refined its proposal in the intervening months based on feedback from market participants and other stakeholders such as victims\u2019 rights groups. As a result of that process, the department made some changes, including clarifying that internet companies would have immunity when they take down material that promotes violent extremism or self-harm \u2026\u201d  \u201cSen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.), who helped write the legal protections targeted by the administration\u2019s proposal, said Republicans are trying to \u2018work the refs ahead of the election\u2019 by threatening social media companies with retribution if they censor or fact-check content.\u201d Campaign 2020  Trump won't commit to a peaceful transfer of power:   University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers calls the statement \u201cterrible for the economy.\u201d   As we noted here last week, stock market investors are growing increasingly nervous about the prospect that an extended and contested result will inject more volatility into the market.    Trump's remarks also drew a rebuke from Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah):  Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin testify before the Senate Banking Committee for the quarterly Cares Act update. The Labor Department reports the latest weekly jobless claims. A House small-business subcommittee holds a hearing on the Paycheck Protection Program. Costco, Darden Restaurants, CarMax, Rite Aid and BlackBerry are among the notable companies reporting their earnings.

There is concern that large tech companies are amassing vast amounts of data and will use that data to entrench their dominant positions. With this emerging view, more data may be viewed as anticompetitive.Yet, recent transactions such as CVS-Aetna (in which Dechert represented CVS) and AT&amp;T-Time Warner show how the use of data can be procompetitive, reducing costs and benefitting consumers in the process. Under the right circumstances, big data can drive substantial merger efficiencies, a key showing in obtaining merger clearance. </p><p>What Is Big Data? As a threshold matter, what is big data? There is no consensus definition, but big data is often described as having four key characteristics (the #8216;four Vs#8217;): Volume (i.e. size and scale), Velocity (i.e. rate at which it is generated), Variety (i.e. different types and forms), and Value.1 Big data may be comprised of information that is provided by consumers or generated from such consumer information. It may be used to identify consumer preferences or to predict consumer behavior.Big data, when combined with evolving data analytics, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, can lead to substantial and wide-ranging benefits for consumers. Yet, certain uses of big data have raised concerns implicating consumer privacy, state surveillance, and other potentially undesirable economic and societal outcomes. Antitrust and Big Data In the antitrust sphere, enforcers and policymakers are grappling with whether big data raises new competitive issues and whether existing antitrust laws are able to address these potential issues. For example, big data is sometimes described as a barrier to entry for firms lacking comparable datasets. Another competitive concern is that a dominant firm with access to more and better data about customers or suppliers than its rivals will use that data to maintain or extend its market power by excluding potential competitors.The head of the Department of Justice Antitrust Division (DOJ) recently commented on the role of data in the agency's ongoing investigation of large tech companies: #8216;We are examining the role of data. There's no question that is part of our review. . . . In and of itself it's not anticompetitive, but just like any other asset, data can give you market power and its abuse would be a violation of antitrust law.#8217;2The antitrust agencies have investigated and even challenged several mergers involving large datasets. In some cases, the data is the market implicated by the merger itself, such as the real property data at issue in the 2014 CoreLogic-DataQuick merger, which the Federal Trade Commission cleared with a database divestiture.3 In other cases, data is a key input for delivery of a digital product, such as the national audience measurement data implicated in the 2013 Nielsen-Arbitron merger, which involved an FTC-imposed data divestiture.4 In still other cases, data is viewed as an entry barrier, as in Google's 2011 acquisition of ITA, which the DOJ cleared with a prohibition against Google denying competitors access to ITA's online flight pricing data.5Still, the antitrust agencies have found that access to greater amounts of data can actually increase competition. In Microsoft-Yahoo!, the DOJ investigated and did not challenge the companies' agreement to combine their back-end search and paid search advertising technology. The agency concluded that the transaction would #8216;enhance Microsoft's competitive performance because it will have access to a larger set of [search] queries, which should accelerate the automated learning of Microsoft's search and paid search algorithms.#8217;6 The transaction would thereby create a more viable competitive alternative to Google.Data-related efficiencies also played a role in the DOJ's clearance of eBay's acquisition of PayPal. The merging companies both provided person-to-person payment systems used to complete transactions in connection with eBay auctions. The DOJ concluded that the integration of the two companies #8216;would make transactions more convenient for eBay buyers and also improve the detection of fraud by combining the information that had been separately amassed by the two companies.#8217;7 Recent Transactions: Big Data as a Merger Efficiency AT&amp;T-Time WarnerMore recently, AT&amp;T and Time Warner succeeded in rebuffing the DOJ's challenge to their merger in part by pointing to the benefits of combining the companies' complementary data and other assets. A key industry trend prompting the merger was the growing popularity of streaming video and other online content providers. As a traditional programmer, Time Warner lacked direct relationships with its viewers (i.e., customers of video distributors such as cable companies) and therefore information about the content preferences of those viewers. That put Time Warner at a competitive disadvantage relative to streaming video services such as Netflix and Hulu and online platforms such as Google and Facebook in catering its content and advertising to viewers.The district court hearing the AT&amp;T-Time Warner merger challenge noted the benefits from the vertical integration of the companies' complementary data, including: #8216;Time Warner's popular content and significant advertising inventory, and AT&amp;T's consumer relationships, customer data, and large wireless business.#8217;8 Through the merger, the court found, the combined company can use information from AT&amp;T's mobile and video customers to better tailor Time Warner's content and advertising to better compete with online platforms.9CVS Health-AetnaThe CVS Health-Aetna merger offered substantial efficiencies, including efficiencies driven by data integration. One of the major problems plaguing our healthcare system is that information is siloed. For example, physicians and hospitals may lack access to pharmacy claims data. Pharmacies may lack access to medical records. These inefficiencies can harm patients and lead to higher-cost, lower-quality care.10The CVS Health-Aetna merger combined large quantities of medical and pharmacy data from the companies' respective patients and customers. To obtain government approvals, Dechert turned big data from a potential problem to a solution. We were able to show that the combination of CVS Health and Aetna would lead to better-integrated medical and pharmacy data. As a result of that integration, providers will be able to intervene earlier and more often to help patients before complications develop, improve patient care, and reduce healthcare costs.As shown in the public records,11 the merger positioned the combined firm to improve patient care and lower costs, including in the following ways: Using better information and through earlier interventions, the combined firm will be able to improve medication adherence for patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes.12 Similarly, a pharmacist will know about a patient's recent hospitalization and be able to counsel the patient to avoid any drug complications that could lead to readmission.13 With better access to medical records, a pharmacist will know that a patient has not received a recommended immunization and can encourage the patient to get it at either a MinuteClinic or from the patient's physician.14 Finally, using analytical tools and medical claims data, providers can identify members at high risk of avoidable ER visits and\u2014through pharmacist and other interactions\u2014educate them about the availability of retail clinics, urgent care centers, and other less-expensive sites of care as appropriate.15Importantly, we were able to demonstrate that these data-driven efficiencies are merger-specific\u2014that is, they can only be achieved through the merger. In particular, the efficiencies were unlikely to be achieved through a mere contractual relationship between independently-owned companies, where allocating the costs and risks associated with the joint investment needed to reduce medical costs is particularly challenging.As the DOJ recognized in concluding its investigation of the CVS Health-Aetna merger, the resulting #8216;integrated pharmacy and health benefits company . . . has the potential to generate benefits by improving the quality and lowering the costs of the healthcare services that American consumers can obtain.#8217;16 Conclusion Offensive use of big data has helped clear the path to government approvals of the CVS Health-Aetna and other mergers. By understanding current, inefficient data limitations and ways to overcome them, companies can show that mergers will facilitate the use of data to improve products and lower costs, ultimately to the benefit of consumers.Footnotes1) See American Bar Association Section of Antitrust Law, Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning: Emerging Legal and Self-Regulatory Considerations (Part One), at 2 (Sept. 30, 2019), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/antitrust_law\">https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/antitrust_law</url>[1]/comments/october-2019/clean-antitrust-ai-report-pt1-093019.pdf[2].2) Richard Vandeford, Tech Players Extensively Meeting with DOJ as Big Tech Probe Continues, MLex, Nov. 6, 2019.3) See Decision &amp; Order at 5-8, In re CoreLogic, Inc., FTC Docket No. C-4458 (May 21, 2014),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/140521corelogicdo.pdf\">https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/140521corelogicdo.pdf</url>[3].4) See Decision &amp; Order at 5-7, In re Nielsen Holdings N.V., FTC Docket No. C-4439 (Feb. 28, 2014),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/140228nielsenholdingsdo.pdf\">https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/cases/140228nielsenholdingsdo.pdf</url>[4].5) See Final Judgment at 13-21, United States v.

The offense struggled to run the ball. Sartell seemed in control.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then came the second half.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Our coaches gave us a kick in the butt,\" Tech senior defensive lineman Cody Hennek said. \"They got us motivated.\"</p><p>It helped Tech to a 32-31 overtime win over Sartell before a large, overflow crowd on a beautifully mild Friday night.</p><p>\"That was a probably a pretty exciting high school football game to watch,\" Sabres head coach Scott Hentges said. \"I'm very proud of how are kids competed and we have to tip our hats to Tech.</p><p>\"They made the plays at the end.\"</p><p>Tech (1-1) turned a 25-14 halftime deficit into a 25-25 tie in regulation. The keys were a revived running game after some blocking adjustments. The Tigers cut it to 25-22 on an 11-play, 75-yard drive culminated by quarterback Chris Backes' two-yard touchdown run and Devin Vouk's two-point conversion run.</p><p>They tied it with 4:51 to play on a 37-yard field goal.</p><p>The field goal attempt to tie the game left Kaleb Woodman shaking in his extremely athletic boots.</p><p>\"My heart was racing at 5,000 miles an hour,\" said Woodman, who is primarily a Tech soccer player. \"I hit them from that distance in practice quite a bit. But an actual game is a whole different story.\"</p><p>The point-after touchdown attempt in overtime? \"No sweat,\" Woodman said. \"That was a little more routine.</p><p>\"I guess I was still a little nervous. For sure, it was nice to win it for the seniors out there.\"</p><p>After the field goal, both teams had opportunities to score in regulation after that, but didn't.</p><p>Tech drove the ball down the field, but after Brevyn Spann-Ford caught a ball in Sartell territory, defensive back Andrew Grant stripped him of the ball and recovered the fumble with 1:17 to go.</p><p>\"It was a nice play,\" Hentges said.</p><p>A delay of game penalty prevented the Sabres from getting a first down and Tech got it back with 54 seconds to play. The Tigers' drive ran out of time at midfield.</p><p>In overtime, Tech won the coin toss and deferred.</p><p>Sartell scored on a fourth-down pass. Chris Belling, under heavy pressure, rolled left and found Brandan Walz for the score. The PAT kick failed. Sartell led 31-25.</p><p>Tech got the ball and Vouk went to work. He gained five yards up the middle. Then, he got the ball again and went five yards for the score. Both were audibles by Backes.</p><p>Then came Woodman's kick.</p><p>\"It was a hard-fought game, very physical,\" Vouk said. \"Sartell's a good opponent and very physical.</p><p>\"I know a few of the guys over there. It's nice to win.\"</p><p>Sartell (0-2) led 12-0 early. Belling found Walz on a 59-yard touchdown pass on the Sabres' third play from scrimmage to make it 6-0. They then made it 12-0 after getting the ball on the Tech 21.</p><p>Tech had tried to punt, but a bad snap had punter Ethan Gray going to his knees to get the ball and having it downed at the 21. After two nice runs by Devin Douvier, John Schmidt scored from one yard out.</p><p>The Tigers grabbed the lead at 14-12. Backes found Spann-Ford on a 19-yard touchdown pass in which Backes was pummeled by the Sartell rush after a couple of missed blocks.</p><p>\"I got crushed on that one,\" Backes admitted. \"I had Devin (Vouk) and a lineman apologizing while I was running into the end zone to congratulate Brevyn.</p><p>\"I told them: 'We just scored a touchown. I don't care.'\"</p><p>Vouk then scored on a six-yard run early in the second quarter. But, Sartell punched in two touchdowns in the final 4:50, first on a 2-yard run by Schmidt and then on a 1-yard quarterback keeper by Belling. That made it 25-14.</p><p>Then came the adjustments. Linebacker Caleb Peterson suffered a serious ankle injury. Riley Peterson also was out for a while. The Tigers already were without Nick Schmitt, who was out with a knee injury and Drew Amundson, who had a serious contusion.</p><p>\"It was big,\" Tech head coach Gregg Martig said of the win. \"It's a big confidence boost for us.\"</p><p>First quarter</p><p>S -- Brandan Walz 59 pass from Chris Belling (kick failed)</p><p>S -- John Schmidt 1 run (pass failed)</p><p>T -- Brevyn Spann-Ford 19 pass from Chris Backes (Kaleb Woodman kick)</p><p>Second quarter</p><p>T -- Devin Vouk 6 run (Woodman kick)</p><p>S -- Schmidt 2 run (run railed)</p><p>S -- Chris Belling 1 run (Schmidt kick)</p><p>Third quarter</p><p>T -- Backes 2 run (Vouk run)</p><p>Fourth quarter</p><p>T -- Woodman 37 field goal</p><p>Overtime</p><p>S -- Walz 2 pass from Belling (pass failed)</p><p>T -- Vouk 5 run (Woodman kick)</p><p>Individual statistics</p><p>Rushing: T -- Vouk 19-84, Backes 16-51, James Kaczor 1-(-2), Spann-Ford 1-(-7), Ethan Gray 1-(-11).

Sartell seemed in control.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then came the second half.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Our coaches gave us a kick in the butt,\" Tech senior defensive lineman Cody Hennek said. \"They got us motivated.\"</p><p>It helped Tech to a 32-31 overtime win over Sartell before a large, overflow crowd on a beautifully mild Friday night.</p><p>\"That was a probably a pretty exciting high school football game to watch,\" Sabres head coach Scott Hentges said. \"I'm very proud of how are kids competed and we have to tip our hats to Tech.</p><p>\"They made the plays at the end.\"</p><p>Tech (1-1) turned a 25-14 halftime deficit into a 25-25 tie in regulation. The keys were a revived running game after some blocking adjustments. The Tigers cut it to 25-22 on an 11-play, 75-yard drive culminated by quarterback Chris Backes' two-yard touchdown run and Devin Vouk's two-point conversion run.</p><p>They tied it with 4:51 to play on a 37-yard field goal.</p><p>The field goal attempt to tie the game left Kaleb Woodman shaking in his extremely athletic boots.</p><p>\"My heart was racing at 5,000 miles an hour,\" said Woodman, who is primarily a Tech soccer player. \"I hit them from that distance in practice quite a bit. But an actual game is a whole different story.\"</p><p>The point-after touchdown attempt in overtime? \"No sweat,\" Woodman said. \"That was a little more routine.</p><p>\"I guess I was still a little nervous. For sure, it was nice to win it for the seniors out there.\"</p><p>After the field goal, both teams had opportunities to score in regulation after that, but didn't.</p><p>Tech drove the ball down the field, but after Brevyn Spann-Ford caught a ball in Sartell territory, defensive back Andrew Grant stripped him of the ball and recovered the fumble with 1:17 to go.</p><p>\"It was a nice play,\" Hentges said.</p><p>A delay of game penalty prevented the Sabres from getting a first down and Tech got it back with 54 seconds to play. The Tigers' drive ran out of time at midfield.</p><p>In overtime, Tech won the coin toss and deferred.</p><p>Sartell scored on a fourth-down pass. Chris Belling, under heavy pressure, rolled left and found Brandan Walz for the score. The PAT kick failed. Sartell led 31-25.</p><p>Tech got the ball and Vouk went to work. He gained five yards up the middle. Then, he got the ball again and went five yards for the score. Both were audibles by Backes.</p><p>Then came Woodman's kick.</p><p>\"It was a hard-fought game, very physical,\" Vouk said. \"Sartell's a good opponent and very physical.</p><p>\"I know a few of the guys over there. It's nice to win.\"</p><p>Sartell (0-2) led 12-0 early. Belling found Walz on a 59-yard touchdown pass on the Sabres' third play from scrimmage to make it 6-0. They then made it 12-0 after getting the ball on the Tech 21.</p><p>Tech had tried to punt, but a bad snap had punter Ethan Gray going to his knees to get the ball and having it downed at the 21. After two nice runs by Devin Douvier, John Schmidt scored from one yard out.</p><p>The Tigers grabbed the lead at 14-12. Backes found Spann-Ford on a 19-yard touchdown pass in which Backes was pummeled by the Sartell rush after a couple of missed blocks.</p><p>\"I got crushed on that one,\" Backes admitted. \"I had Devin (Vouk) and a lineman apologizing while I was running into the end zone to congratulate Brevyn.</p><p>\"I told them: 'We just scored a touchown. I don't care.'\"</p><p>Vouk then scored on a six-yard run early in the second quarter. But, Sartell punched in two touchdowns in the final 4:50, first on a 2-yard run by Schmidt and then on a 1-yard quarterback keeper by Belling. That made it 25-14.</p><p>Then came the adjustments. Linebacker Caleb Peterson suffered a serious ankle injury. Riley Peterson also was out for a while. The Tigers already were without Nick Schmitt, who was out with a knee injury and Drew Amundson, who had a serious contusion.</p><p>\"It was big,\" Tech head coach Gregg Martig said of the win. \"It's a big confidence boost for us.\"</p><p>First quarter</p><p>S -- Brandan Walz 59 pass from Chris Belling (kick failed)</p><p>S -- John Schmidt 1 run (pass failed)</p><p>T -- Brevyn Spann-Ford 19 pass from Chris Backes (Kaleb Woodman kick)</p><p>Second quarter</p><p>T -- Devin Vouk 6 run (Woodman kick)</p><p>S -- Schmidt 2 run (run railed)</p><p>S -- Chris Belling 1 run (Schmidt kick)</p><p>Third quarter</p><p>T -- Backes 2 run (Vouk run)</p><p>Fourth quarter</p><p>T -- Woodman 37 field goal</p><p>Overtime</p><p>S -- Walz 2 pass from Belling (pass failed)</p><p>T -- Vouk 5 run (Woodman kick)</p><p>Individual statistics</p><p>Rushing: T -- Vouk 19-84, Backes 16-51, James Kaczor 1-(-2), Spann-Ford 1-(-7), Ethan Gray 1-(-11).

Herbert Smith Freehills has release...</p><p>As developments continue to progress in data analytics and artificial intelligence, the face of regulatory compliance, government investigations and enforcement are changing, according to analysis from a global law firm.   Herbert Smith Freehills has released its series The Byte of Big Data: Investigations and Enforcement, which shines a spotlight on how misconduct is monitored in the age of big data and explores how businesses need to prepare for this new era.   HSF partner Jeremy Birch said advances in data analytics and machine learning offer significant potential for businesses in terms of monitoring supply chains, business partners, employees and customer transactions for suspicious activity and misconduct.    But the advancements have also led to complexities for businesses across jurisdictions.   \u201cWe know that big data has changed the way business is done, but it\u2019s also changing the face of [white-collar] crime and, as a result, how misconduct is detected, investigated and prosecuted,\u201d Mr Birch said.   \u201cThese advancements in data analytics will create growing pressure from regulators on businesses to enhance their abilities to monitor, detect and report misconduct.   \u201cCompanies now face more complexities in meeting compliance expectations, conducting internal investigations and managing government agencies during enforcement.\u201d   Herbert Smith Freehils surveyed a number of clients in general counsel, senior legal, compliance and risk roles in organisations spanning multiple sectors and jurisdictions.    The report revealed for nearly 80 per cent of respondents, data plays a role in their organisations\u2019 commercial strategy, and over 66 per cent have a data governance strategy in place.   The research found that data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) are being used primarily to improve efficiency and operations as well as corporate strategy.    However, there was less of a focus on how data could be used to proactively monitor compliance or more efficiently meet regulatory requests and expectations.   For instance, only 8 per cent of organisations are relying on internally generated data to monitor or supervise their employees.    \u201cThis may indicate that the private sector is at risk of failing to prioritise modernising compliance and investigations functions at a time when regulators are becoming increasingly technologically sophisticated,\u201d the report stated.    Mr Birch analysed that there is a lot of excitement around the automation of monitoring activities.    \u201cWhat used to be a manual, and a very [labour-intensive] process, is becoming less so,\u201d Mr Birch said.   \u201cHowever, while the introduction of technology is changing the playing field, data quality, for some organisations, may still be preventing advancement.   \u201cOne in five respondents [reports] having concerns over the quality of the organisation\u2019s data. While respondents didn\u2019t note this as their main concern, it still demonstrates that not all organisations have the right data sources to implement monitoring for misconduct in a meaningful way.\u201d   The report showed that an increase in resources may help manage this, however, businesses ultimately need to consider what they\u2019re trying to achieve from gathering data so they can implement the appropriate IT infrastructure to attain the data pool they need and use it in a valuable way.   HSF senior consultant Tess Lumsdaine agrees that the sophistication of monitoring systems and issues around how data is collected and used, is part of the problem.    This means corporate goliaths such as big tech, as well as many governments, may have the resources to collect and analyse massive amounts of data.    \u201cWe are not seeing that kind of sophistication in the private sector in relation to employee monitoring,\u201d Ms Lumsdaine said.   \u201cIf a business is looking to monitor a certain type of misconduct or within a market, they may wish to focus their efforts around that, which in turn will allow them to manage the risks of complying with privacy legislation, together with considerations [underemployment] and discrimination law.\u201d Tony Zhang   Last Updated: 22 July 2020 Published: 23 July 2020</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42659850419</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DR-8451-F07F-8544-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"738\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Lawyers Weekly Australia</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC0002F08</classCode><className>HERBERT SMITH FREEHILLS LLP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS541110 OFFICES OF LAWYERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>SIC8111 LEGAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Oceania</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia and New Zealand</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Suspicious Activity Reports (SAR)</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTlBNjc3QjY0QjA1NEM4NEI0NURBMjdEMzA2NjlFNjU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTAxNTNFMEY2QjBBNEY3NDhCOTNFOEE4NUM4MzFBQjU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>N541110GM</classCode><className>LAWYERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CMJ5</classCode><className>BUSINESS ANALYTICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

Equifax reported the cyber-intrusion on Sept. 7, yet the crime occurred from mid-May through July this summer. The \"epic breach was discovered on July 29,\" USAToday.com reported.</p><p>The magnitude of unauthorized access to personal data is almost incomprehensible. Equifax's website touts its \"more than 820 million consumers and more than 91 million businesses worldwide, and its database includes employee data contributed from more than 7,100 employers.\" The database includes information with no shelf-life, meaning the information stolen doesn't expire or is so rarely changed.</p><p>Social Security numbers, birthdates and addresses for more than 143 Americans were stolen.

TV ratings. Say what you will about the reliability of entertainment consumption metrics, but for decades, what people watched was hardly hush-hush. Then subscription video streamers came along. Now, massive data is collected about viewing habits but is disclosed only at the discretion of the companies sucking it up. Netflix says it will become more transparent in 2020. But will it? And who knows if the numbers it releases are inaccurate or misleading? How much should the rest of Hollywood care about transparency?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, consider that less than two years ago, Time Warner's then-CEO Jeff Bewkes took the witness stand during a trial where the U.S. government attempted to block his company's merger with AT&amp;T. Bewkes pointed to Amazon, Netflix, YouTube and Facebook before explaining that these companies \"know more about our consumers than we do.\" The merger was justified, he explained, because digital giants possessed something that one of Hollywood's biggest media companies sorely needed \u2014 data. \"The more you know about viewers, the more it informs your programming,\" he said. \"It helps you understand how to optimize.\"</p><p>Hollywood is catching up. Disney has launched its data-sucking streaming service Disney+ while others including AT&amp;T's HBO Max will be running soon enough. With a 21st century operation, though, comes a 21st century problem: the potential for regulation. Government intervention could drop a bomb on the so-called streaming wars.</p><p>Only in the past few years have academics begun discussing whether Big Data presents antitrust issues, and if so, what to do about it. Spurred by frustration at the might of companies like Google and Facebook, lawmakers and regulators on both sides of the political aisle have in recent months openly endorsed the scrutinizing of companies that are leveraging their inside knowledge about consumer habits to the disadvantage of third parties.</p><p>Illustration by: Jiaqi Wang</p><p>On Nov. 8, Department of Justice antitrust chief Makan Delrahim sounded his own alarm in a speech at Harvard. Delrahim said that the aggregation of data can create avenues for abuse - especially for companies in the business of predicting human behavior (for advertising, yes, but perhaps also what entertainment programming you might want to see if you just watched <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Irishman</emphasis>). He also responded to those who see such concerns as overstated because data collection has been happening for decades. (His example was grocery stores collecting information about consumer purchasing patterns through loyalty cards. Nielsen ratings would have worked just as well.) Something has changed, Delrahim warned.</p><p>\"Antitrust enforcers must examine carefully whether greater competitive harms are threatened given today's market realities,\" he said. \"For example, enforcers might consider whether the scale of the data collected has increased by several magnitudes; the type of data collected; and what it means when companies collect usage data, which cannot be easily replicated, in addition to user data. Most notably, enforcers must confront the reality that data insights in the digital economy are combined across the ecosystem of the internet sometimes in ways that transcend product improvement and impact consumer choice altogether.\"</p><p>It's happening slowly, but antitrust regulators like Delrahim are now being urged to look beyond Google and Facebook and review how data is being leveraged as a competitive weapon in the digital entertainment space. And the expressed openness by conservative legal thinkers (including Attorney General William Barr in a Dec. 10 speech) to analyze the non-price effects of competition is a remarkable development that bears watching.</p><p>While some privacy advocates have expressed concern about allowing data collection to happen in the first place, there are others who seem frustrated by the inequality presented by data collection and the potential for marketplace exclusion. For example, during the recent DOJ review of the Paramount Consent Decrees, the decades-old rules governing the relationship between movie studios and theater chains, Michigan State University law professor Adam Candeub submitted a comment critical of Netflix to the antitrust office. \"Netflix does everything in its power to prevent third parties from learning its viewing data,\" he wrote. \"Netflix encrypts its data to prevent ISPs and web browsers from tracking the use, and it does not share any data with third parties, even the studios whose material it licenses and who naturally want information on [their] own show[s]. While Netflix has a right to its own data ... Netflix goes a step too far by using its market power in the [online video] market to require that connected devices not use available data.\"</p><p>Similarly, in a July 31 letter from the Artist Rights Alliance to the DOJ and the House Judiciary Committee, the musicians' group laid out a number of concerns about specific tech companies, including Amazon. \"The antitrust problems created by Amazon's role as both a distributor in its own right and a platform for other sellers and services are well understood,\" stated the letter. \"The company's massive data stockpiles and ability to monitor its competitors from 'inside' their own transactions and operations threaten genuine competition in virtually every sector of the U.S. economy. Amazon's ongoing efforts to launch a streaming music service as part of its Prime family of products should be carefully scrutinized as part of your review. While more competition is always welcome and Amazon Music is a royalty-paying service, we are concerned about the dangers of predatory/sub-market pricing in a service that Amazon operates as a 'loss leader.' \"</p><p>If regulators decide to crack down, a side squabble would erupt over how to remedy the competitive harms arising from data collection. Among the possibilities is that data aggregation could become a significant issue when companies seek approval for mergers. Reuters reported Dec. 10 that the DOJ is examining whether to block Google's proposed acquisition of Fitbit on the grounds that it would give Google too much data about American consumers. Regulators also could look to force data-sharing in some instances. A separate Reuters story reported that the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, would soon recommend that big tech firms be required to promote sharing of data.</p><p>Now imagine if the DOJ ever dared to stop two streaming video companies from merging on grounds of having too much information about what Americans watched. Or picture a scenario in which Netflix and Disney+ were forced to share audited consumption data with the creative talents that produce and star in their shows.</p><p>Some observers, noting a lack of legal precedent and any empirical evidence about the competitive harms from data hoarding, are urging regulators to be cautious. A recent law review article by University of Florida professor D. Daniel Sokol addressed the debate over whether antitrust law has a role to play, with the conclusion that \"antitrust intervention over market forces threatens consumer welfare, especially in fast-moving markets, and proposed remedies, such as limiting the collection and use of Big Data or forcing large firms to share with rivals, are likely to harm competition and innovation, and in fact may raise privacy concerns.\"</p><p>Truth be told, there's no indication yet that regulators are prepared to do anything more than conduct a review of data collection. Time will tell whether the talk about getting tough is really just frustration at not being able to do more to punish tech companies for other perceived sins (i.e., an indifference to privacy, ideological biases or sheer chutzpah).</p><p>But as Hollywood launches new digital platforms amid an appetite to police data collection, comments like those from Candeub and the Artist Rights Alliance may best be viewed as demonstrating the types of complaints that could become more commonplace in the years ahead for the streaming economy. As such, the industry is advised to think hard about the answer to these two questions: When it comes to measuring how individuals are consuming entertainment, would the data collection be less likely to occur if such data wasn't a secret and could be used by business partners and corporate rivals? If transparency presents a problem, why is that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This story first appeared in the Jan. 3 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

In order to analyse this power dynamic, I argue that we must reconsider the scale, scope, and the various meanings and enactments of both indigenous and settler ecological thinking, and mediated ecologies, to better understand Big Tech in a rapidly changing environment. I propose the concept of 'Big Data Ecologies' to situate infrastructure at the centre of the discussion of neoliberalism within the rapid and global environmental transformations with which they are intertwined.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Introduction</p><p> Snippet 1: The severe drought and forest fires of the last few years in California have now been widely headlined, visualized, and extrapolated by the news media as a case study of the early ravages of climate change on a global scale. As a result, water has been ushered back into conversation with local conservation practices, desalination proposals, and various other assessments, including the socio-political impacts of farm job losses. Meanwhile, California is also home to the largest cloud computing facilities in the US - with upward of 800 data centers - yet the drought is rarely discussed in relation to internet infrastructures, the electricity they consume, or the tremendous water required by data centers to cool their servers. (The California Energy Code, 2013)</p><p> Snippet 2: As Hurricane Harvey devastated Houston with catastrophic flooding in October 2017, displacing its citizens and causing ongoing power outages for thousands of them, data centers in the area remained operational. Diesel generators allowed the lights to stay on and kept servers running. One data center in the area was stocked with food, water and cots, showers and washing machines. It provided a safe harbour for its workers, their family members, and even United States marshals (Dawn-Hiscox, 2017; Glantz, 2017). This data center was built to withstand a hurricane, tornado, or ice storm, to keep internet services going - and, because it is in Houston, to safeguard the data of 'practically every single large oil and gas company in the world.' (Glantz, 2017)</p><p> I begin with these two snippets from (US-based) news stories because they highlight the internet's reliance on nature (water, electricity, land, etc.), the industry's need to protect itself against it (natural disasters), as well as the requirement for storage of Big Data by various companies involved in ecosystems management (oil, gas, etc.). In other words, these snippets show how our recent turn to Big Data requires a material infrastructure to support it, as well as an industry discourse to rationalize its ongoing expansions. It is this complex relationship that I return to time and again as a way to understand how Big Tech is increasingly encroaching on ecosystems management to, ultimately, grow its own operations. As I explain below, Big Tech has made great strides in rendering various aspects of its industry more self-sustaining; but, and as a result, has carved out a more important (and direct) role for itself as custodian and manager of natural resources. This is a part of the neoliberalizing logics that dominate today's understanding of nature.</p><p> Big Tech is a main driver of sustainable development worldwide - especially when it comes to harnessing alternative sources of power - while also, and invariably, upholding the idea that perpetual growth is possible and economically desirable within these conditions. As such, the biggest internet companies - Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Google/Alphabet - are becoming environmentalists by their own definition, and grabbing at land, water, and power infrastructures to make their case as the industry best suited to manage natural resources, on which Big Tech is dependent (and on which the rest of the economy is also increasingly dependent). As a concept that accounts for all of this, I propose 'Big Data Ecologies' to expose that these sites are not only multiplying, but are increasingly at the behest of investors in Big Data infrastructure, and run by Big Data logics. Big Data thereby becomes the underlying currency that funds material developments, and thus formative in our new ecologies.</p><p> In the US in particular, data centers are the largest and fastest growing consumers of electricity, and in turn, of water (Sverdlik, 2016). Big Tech supports the stock market, Big Data for insurance companies, genome mapping, financial transactions, mass surveillance and monitoring, the 'internet of things' and 'smart city' sensors and grids, and mobile communications for phone users writ large. By most industry accounts, data centers, and the cloud infrastructure that undergirds it, has become the most important sociotechnical system of our time. Because of this, the continuous expansion of server farms is encouraged, supported politically and financially, and celebrated as progress by the industry and most governments, which is most evident in urban and rural areas in search of economic revival. This is how the industry comes to be known as 'Big Tech', a conglomerate of internet companies that is increasingly outsizing all other forms of institutional power. Big Tech is considered to be an industry grouping with important economic, political and social influence and is adopting and adapting both public infrastructures and the environment for the internet. In turn, the accumulation of user data, as Big Data, is the main motivation of companies that offer online shopping, social networking, internet indexing, location services, and so on. In this sense, Big Tech are the new farmers - companies toiling matter as memory, companies using large swaths of land and water, working toward future storage and the storage of the future.</p><p> Most Big Tech companies (Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Google/Alphabet) own and manage their data centers. They carefully curate their online representations of their data centers by blending marketing discourse to reinforce their various problem-solving impetuses while downplaying this hypervisibility in terms of the cloud's materiality and its potential impacts (Vonderau and Holt, 2015). In these representations, the glaring paradox of Big Tech is that it uses tremendous natural resources to develop technologies that fight environmental degradation. Part of that mandate has been to become more environmentally sustainable as a global industry. Big Tech accomplishes this by showing its mastery over the environment by, on one hand, creating data centers that can sustain hurricanes and other environmental disasters, and, on the other hand, by enabling Big Data science to flourish as seemingly 'clean' information production in service to industry and, presumably, humanity, even while consuming energy resources. These are the two interlocking components of Big Tech - they uphold the material infrastructure that upholds the logics, discourses, and new forms of socialities, that, in turn, uphold the material infrastructure - and so on, and so forth.</p><p> Given this relationship between ideas and instantiations, we may wonder how climate change can even coexist with Big Tech. If, as all indices seem to point to, Big Tech already epitomize the technological fix, how can we be living in times of such environmental unrest and, simultaneously, of such incredible computational power? There are a few options that help explore this connection: the first is that the ultimate technological fix in fact requires a global environmental catastrophe; the second is that there has long been a false symbiosis in the relationship between nature (the untouched) and computing (as human progress) - and it has reached a tipping point; and the third is that we are in a moment of convergence, handing over not only nature to Big Tech (from the commons), but also the very concept of 'the natural' and what it might encompass.</p><p> (As a queer Canadian settler) I explore these three options by drawing mainly from the work of indigenous and queer/feminist thinkers, and others influenced by them (directly, or indirectly drawing on similar concepts). Stacy Alaimo, Wendy Brown, Keller Easterling, Donna Haraway, Sara Hunt, Ruth Irwin, Lisa Parks, Juanita Sundberg, Kim TallBear, Zoe Todd, Vanessa Watts, and Sheena Wilson, among others, have each greatly shaped the possibilities for reconsidering the entanglements of nature, science, technology, and culture. With them, I propose a conceptual repositioning of Big Tech that complicates the existing environmental framing and ecosystem logics that supports the industry and largely function to justify the perpetual growth of digital communications. Big Tech upholds the idea of shifting its mode of energy production to alternative, sustainable, and renewable sources without implementing radical changes at the level of labour, resource ownership or conceptions of the environment, which have become more pressing matters at this time of global climatic transformations but remain at odds with capitalist endeavours. It is this particular material entanglement - of public and private infrastructure - that is explored in this paper and which serves as my contribution to the growing literature about internet materialities and their various political, social and environmental impacts (Burrington, 2014; Cubitt, 2013; Fish, 2014; Gabrys, 2011; LeBel, 2012; Maxwell, 2014; Miller, 2015; Taffel, 2012; Vonderau and Holt, 2015).</p><p> Increasingly, Big Tech has mandated itself to be responsible and to manage natural resources sustainably, premised on the logic of natural balance - i.e. that as long as nature returns to a state of homeostasis, and as long as companies work to replenish what they use, it follows that the development of communications infrastructure is a (two-fold) sign of progress. Despite the US's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change, Big Tech remains committed to a shift to renewable energy to power the internet economy. As Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg put it:</p><p> Withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement is bad for the environment, bad for the economy, ... we've committed that every new data center we build will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy. Stopping climate change is something we can only do as a global community, and we have to act together before it's too late. (Miller, 2017)</p><p> Similarly, Joe Kava, Google Vice President of Data Centers, claims that</p><p> huge cloud operators have a responsibility to use their buying power to drive changes in the US. utility industry, which should boost its mix of renewables and make clean energy available to more customers. (Miller 2017)</p><p>Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft have made similar promises and have indicated that this helps them meet their corporate social responsibility goals. On the surface, it looks like Big Tech is taking on the task of making global energy more sustainable for the environment's sake, to fight climate change. Outside of Big Tech's main corporations it becomes much more difficult to generate one's own power or to find alternative (green) providers but the motivation is there. Fighting climate change is said to be the driver of Big Tech's sustainable turn, yet, as I point out in this article, this is premised on faulty logics that frames nature more as software than as an agentic organism (Alaimo, 2011; Todd, 2016). This is important because it speaks to long held colonial ideas about controlling nature, managing it as interconnected nodes in a system, and foremost, as requiring human intervention to stay alive for the benefit of humans.</p><p> The impetus for Big Tech's Big Data collection is underscored also by the idea that the more data we collect, the more we can know about the world we live in. This pursuant positivist logic is that we will act according to objective and scientific knowledge that can be transferred to myriad social, commercial, and political ends. To do this, Big Tech unwittingly follows its own uneasy logic - one that situates the environment, technology, and humans within an a priori systems-based framework that is self-regulating and self-organizing. This is an idea that is perfect for our neoliberal times, that sees market rationality pervading all aspects of life, until nature and humans alike become merely instrumental (Brown, 2015; Moore, 2015; Watts, 2013; Curtis, 2011; Odum, 1994). Neoliberalism is the dominant ecological ideal of our era, too: when left alone, nature will maintain an equilibrium that can be restored if disrupted through both calculable and mappable market-driven assessments and interventions. This kind of ecological thinking, then, also means a highly controlled society where surveillance and monitoring are integral to communications infrastructure and where infrastructure is increasingly embedded in (if not disguised as) nature (Parks, 2010).</p><p> Big greening efforts</p><p> Data centers are being constructed around the world at a rate of a 15 percent increase every year, which will see an additional 33 million servers by 2020, all of which are supplied and powered by regional water and power sources (Marr, 2016). These data centers become fodder for how Big Tech manages to simultaneously acknowledge their role in depleting natural resources while also situating themselves as the safeguard and solution to society's ills. To be clear, the point here is not to critique greening efforts in and of themselves, but rather to situate those discourses and their applications within a wider neoliberal context, and the market-driven decision-making that inspires Big Tech expansions. Big Tech is a neoliberal project and as such is also a colonial one - enslaving nature under the guise of emancipation (Tobias-Coleman, 2015).</p><p> To show this, I present two examples of Big Tech enslaving nature, focusing firstly on Google's conversion of a wastewater facility to cool its servers (Google Green Blog, 2012), and secondly, on Apple's purchase of a forest to manage its own product packaging needs (Cushing, 2015). By presenting these examples (among so many others), I show how Big Tech sees itself as 'partnering' with nature in order to maintain and grow its operations at a time of severe social and political unrest and environmental instability. Ironically, in order to green their cycles of production, Big Tech is 'investing' in nature and in public infrastructure in ways that not only sustain but also unwittingly serve to encourage consumption. In these material expansions, there is tremendous infrastructural, financial, and political support for continued consumption, and its embedded values: progress, innovation, and social transformation. For these sites (which are only two examples among a growing number), I hone in on an instance of infrastructural transformation - such as water and forest - in order to make a point about the very inseparability of any one natural element from its system, while also demonstrating their specificity, as entangled and ecosystemic. This is the benefit and challenge of the ecosystemic approach: to break down the components in order to make an argument about the interconnectedness of all elements, both always already material-discursive (Haraway, 2003). Or, put in other words, the material-discursive conceptualization of nature by Big Tech is one that keeps in place a) the nature/culture binary, b) the idea of ecosystemic homeostasis or balance, and c) the idea of nature as inert and at the service of human 'progress' demonstrated foremost through technological deployments.</p><p>Google water</p><p> The portion of Google's website dedicated to the environment states that:</p><p> We're a data-driven company. The science of climate change tells us that building a carbon-free electrical grid is an urgent global priority1.</p><p>Google looked to power purchase agreements (PPAs), which are large-scale, long-term contracts (between one party that generates electricity and one that is looking to purchase it) to buy renewable energy at volumes required by the company. Of note, Google first entered into a 20-year agreement with a wind farm in Iowa in 2010 and has since signed 19 more agreements. Google is now the largest corporate renewable energy buyer on the planet, directly purchasing 2.6 gigawatts of renewable energy. In the company's view, 'additionality' is the idea that through its actions the world has more clean energy (not less, even given how much Google itself consumes).</p><p> In 2016, Google had plans to operate 14 data centers globally, with 7 in North America. These numbers, however, remain estimates given the relative secrecy of Big Tech with regards to its infrastructure's locations (Hardy, 2015). Like many data center developers, Google has looked to adapt existing buildings into server farms. It recently converted a defunct power plant in Alabama, which had been running since 1952, into a data center. Google also converted an old paper mill in Finland. Both of these conversions have been praised in the media for the ways the company is repurposing existing infrastructure, adapting old power grids and rekindling the community's economy (Hardy, 2015). This is also part of Google's strategic posturing, as an ecologically aware company, which like many others, does not see its profits as inherently antithetical to the ravages of capitalism in which it participates. But Google is also based there, at the old mill and power plant, because those sites provide steady power, are located near rail lines for easy fibre optic cable installation, and close to a water reservoir to use for cooling its servers.</p><p> The notion of an energy efficient and environmentally conscious company - what Google calls 'The Big Picture' on its website - somewhat ironically deflects attention from the incredible size and scale of their operations. Instead, the site focuses on Google's aim to have 'zero impact' on climate by having all its products and services be 'carbon neutral.' 'Renewable' energy has been the byword of Google for the past three years. They pay for reductions in emissions from landfills and claim that their data centers actually save energy. While the Google search engine - what the company is best known for - consistently uses the same amount of electricity as a city of approximately 200,000 people (in the US), it justifies itself in doing so by suggesting that this reduces the overall energy consumption. However, this has only been proven through an awkward comparison between Google searches with real-world searches (Glanz, 2011). Companies like Google use branding and PR jargon to downplay depletion; they draw attention to how much energy they are creating rather than the consumption encouraged at various levels by the industry. At its main campus, Google has its own bike-to-work program, and in certain locations, community gardens supply its cafeterias (Noble and Roberts, 2016). There are swimming pools, climbing walls, bowling alleys, and golf courses to keep employees happy at work (Wainwright, 2013). To further reinforce the intersecting ideals of well-being and efficiency, Google has built its own power networks and infrastructures, and has shifted from coal to wind and solar (Lawson, 2015). And, in one of its grandest gestures yet, Google has partnered with public water infrastructure to lock-in a permanent and reliable source to cool its servers.</p><p> Water is cheaper than electricity. This is why water is used to cool servers in most data centers today. Servers, which are essentially computer hard drives stacked in rows, generate a lot of heat. These servers are then stored in large windowless units, generally in a building the size of several football fields. A midsize center uses between 80 million and 130 million gallons of water a year for cooling, according to various industry estimates (FitzGerald, 2015). This is roughly as much water in a year as 158,000 Olympic sized swimming pools, which is equivalent also to the water used in three hospitals, or for planting 100 acres of almond trees, or to maintain two 18-hole golf courses - and this for computer chips alone (The Wall Street Journal, 2015). Google, however, has been exemplary in its attempt to green its cooling processes, by harvesting rainwater and other non-drinkable sources to reduce its footprint. In fact, it can now boast of using only recycled waters to cool its servers. But, data centers require highly treated water, unlike agriculture or electric utilities.</p><p> In 2012, Google headlined on its company blog that it was helping 'the Hooch' (Chattahoochee River) with water conservation at their Douglas County (Georgia) data center. Boasting their efficient energy consumption by using evaporative free cooling, as well as their recent shift from potable water to recycled/grey waters, Google is accounting for the environment and local communities that surround its data centers (Google Green Blog, 2012). Having partnered with the Douglasville-Douglas County Water and Sewer Authority (WSA) in 2007, Google was able to rely on recycled water from the The Hooch to cool its servers. The water is treated - filtered, sterilized and chlorinated - once more at a Google-built sidestream (effluent) treatment plant before it circulates through its evaporative cooling towers, and before 70 percent of it is returned to the river, with 30 percent diverted back to the data center (Myslewski, 2012). For the WSA, this has meant an increased capacity to save water in their reservoir for times of drought, as explained in detail also in a promotional Google Green's YouTube video on 'smart water' (Google Green, 2012b). This was Google's first water treatment plant in the United States and was constructed based on similar plans in Belgium, where it treats water from an industrial canal. In Belgium, Google built a 20,000 square foot water treatment plant, which removes solid materials and sludge, which is in turn repurposed for cement manufacturing and landfill. In terms of Big Data Ecologies, Google puts to work each displaced and repurposed material byproduct.</p><p> Overall, Google data center engineers working toward greening their 'smart water' technology assert that there is 'no impact on the availability of water in a given region' if every drop is 'returned to its origin' (Coors, 2015). Again, in a promotional context, no further insights emerge about what delimits 'impact' nor how such a thing might be measured. Since 2010, the nonprofit organization Carbon Disclosure Project has been pressuring companies to issue reports on their water consumption, but this request has been largely denied despite water's non-fungibility (Woody, 2010). The comments on Google's promotional 'smart water' video are divided and reflect some the general public's views, concerns and questions: some praise Google's efforts toward sustainability and others question its propagandistic tone. While the praise echoes the words of Google itself - to frame the environment as something to manage responsibly by working to always restore a sense of equilibrium - the skepticism points to more common and larger questions about multinational corporations becoming increasingly entangled with public infrastructure. As Big Tech is successfully making itself self-sustaining through renewable energies, these companies increasingly exist as islands and fortresses of data, where communities are effectively pushed out, and can only exist outside of this media ecosystem. In times of severe droughts (or floods), it is unclear who will be given priority - communities or Big Tech - and we don't know how this priority will be measured. Or we do - in Houston, the data centers stayed on while tens of thousands of individuals went without power.</p><p> Despite innovations, and perhaps in light of them, many questions remain about water treatment and about what 'clean' water means in these various contexts. With such an intensive treatment by Google, including chlorination - which is said to be more 'effective' than the Water and Sewer processes - could the water be too clean? The question came up for me in part because a newspaper clip suggested as much ten years ago: the August 9, 2007, The Quincy Valley Post-Register reported that the water generated from data centers came out 'too clean to run through the city's industrial wastewater treatment plant.' According to this brief report, the water killed off the bacteria needed to break down solids. In that sense, the water is 'dead' because it is absent of minerals and bacteria. However, while the question of natural resource management accountability about water in this case remains difficult to answer it's nevertheless pertinent as a rhetorical provocation.</p><p> From indigenous and queer-feminist perspectives, natural resources are always already agentic and political (Alaimo and Hekman, 2007; Todd, 2016). To engage the 'coloniality of power' as Juanita Sundberg (2014) proposes, for example, in the case of Big Tech, would mean to put into question patterns and dynamics emerging from longstanding and ongoing colonial pursuits that continue to normalize and naturalize labour, technology and the knowledge produced as a result. In a sense, this means that both Big Tech and its watchers (like Greenpeace) has only recognized its greening efforts within the current neoliberal framework. Similarly, Leanne Betasamosake Simpson (2014) argues that protecting the source of knowledge is in the protection of land, which, applied to Big Tech might mean considering that growing real estate deals, and the immense size of data centers (eg. a data center in Norway is planned to be the size of 84 football fields),2 means an expansion and anchoring of Eurocentric, colonial, positivist thinking (and usually at the expense of other modalities). And, as Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang (2012) remind us, 'decolonization is not a metaphor' (3), and as such, data centers play a hand at furthering settler futurity in at least two ways: they stake a claim to land and its proximity to water, and they further locate humanity outside of human bodies, and into machines. How different would our sense of progress be if we accounted for the material and architectural creep of settler technological imaginaries?</p><p> There seems to be no way to salvage what has been lost and no means by which to control the environment within our current global socio-political conditions. Given the vastly variant temporalities of capitalism and nature, the move to 'green' our communications infrastructure starts to more closely resemble a means of feeding and watering the machine, by privileging clean water and electricity for communication ends than for human ends, as we have already done with e-waste and toxic rare earth mining practices. Jason Moore's (2015) idea that humans have come to serve as 'cheap nature' for capitalism's expansion may hint at the future of ecology, where many bodies are further lodged into the media ecosystems, while fewer and fewer benefit from its product. Of course, this has huge political implications and becomes yet another way to demonstrate which bodies are valued and which are put to service of capitalism itself.</p><p>Apple trees</p><p> Corporate declarations about their 'eco-standings' are often in direct contrast to independent assessments. In 2011, Apple was rated with the worst score by Greenpeace for its fossil fuels emissions, relying heavily on coal and nuclear energy. Despite this, Apple's self-assessment that same year declared that it was dedicated to the careful lifecycle management of products, including 'controlling the quantity and type of materials used in their manufacture, improving their energy efficiency, and designing them for better recyclability' (Apple, 2011; Gross, 2011). In 2012, Greenpeace reported once again that Apple, along with Amazon and Microsoft, was rapidly expanding 'without adequate regard to source of electricity' and relied 'heavily on dirty energy to power their clouds' (Greenpeace, 2012). But in 2014, Greenpeace saw a change. In their report, they discussed Apple's commitment to power its data centers with 100% renewable energy. The report also presented the company as the 'most improved' and 'most innovative' and 'most aggressive' in its greening endeavours (Greenpeace, 2014). Over the course of a few years Apple went from loser to leader in Greenpeace's assessments of their environmental impacts and innovations, and this despite ongoing challenges to these claims made by journalists (Cole, 2015). Already by 2015, Apple was touted as a prime example of Big Tech purportedly powering itself exclusively from solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power (Green Energy Investing, 2015). By 2016, Apple is selling power into wholesale markets because of the investments it made in solar power for its data centers, as another foray by Big Tech into the energy business (Crawford, 2016). And, in 2017, as the latest Greenpeace reports suggest, Apple holds its title as leader in its global greening efforts for its data centers but gets a lesser grade on its ability to manage a 'closed-loop supply chain' (Greenpeace, 2017).</p><p> According to the Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics 2017 Company Report Card, Apple</p><p> has established an extensive take-back system through its stores and local partners across countries where it sells its products, though it does not make public which recycling partners it relies upon, or where that waste is sent. (Greenpeace, 2017: 17)</p><p>Apple currently maintains strict 'must shred' agreements with its recyclers thus forcing devices to be shredded instead of repaired or refurbished (Koebler, 2017), while also working with disassembly robots to eventually reuse all the materials in phones, such as tin and aluminum, to create new devices. This example serves to show how Big Tech can still, for now, easily silo off its data centers from the devices that power internet culture and generate the data that becomes the currency with which companies can expand. By not acknowledging that the mobile phone, and all data generated by internet traffic, is the true fuel of the data center, the company fails in making a truly believable argument for sustainability.</p><p> Despite advancements in greening their data centers, Apple remains a company dedicated foremost to profit - i.e., making a phone that costs $5 to assemble (in the Global South) and transforming it through marketing into a revered device costing upward of $600 (in the Global North). For operations to continue to function at this scale, Apple must rely on a precarious workforce whose collective agency has been eviscerated by market globalization and is therefore willing to put in long hours in almost always terrible working and living conditions (Cole, 2015). The technological glow of the West relies on the bleak working conditions of the East, where people have been more easily enslaved and disposed of by Big Tech and their promises of global prosperity (Moore, 2015). Furthermore, many of the educated and market-savvy customers that Apple relies on are aware of the appalling working conditions for assembly workers (The Passionate Eye, 2015). Apple's efforts to achieve a kind of Western sustainability, or sustaining the West itself, invite its customer to support its operations, to strive for a greener future, but without having to account for the nuances of 'cheap' versus 'costly' human bodies (or their labour) on a global scale.</p><p> In Apple's Environmental Responsibility 2015 Progress Report, they discuss recent accomplishments, of which one is to partner with The Conservation Fund to 'permanently protect more than 36,000 acres of working forest' located in Maine and North Carolina. This partnership was intended to ensure their packaging had a 'net-zero impact on the world's supply of sustainable virgin fiber.' (Apple Environmental Responsibility Report, 2015) This is a measure that remains in place into 2017, where the company boasts that its yearly production from its forest conservation projects is now 'greater than the amount of virgin fiber used in Apple's product packaging during fiscal year 2016.' (Apple Environmental Responsibility Report, 2017: 24) This signals that as sustainability endeavours increase, so too does Big Tech's control over 'its' environment.</p><p> In 2015, Apple partnered with the World Wildlife Fund on a new multi-year project focused on responsible forest management in China (Apple Environmental Responsibility, 2015). This turn to forest management and protection by Apple (and Big Tech more generally) is important in identifying neoliberal resources management. The very concept of 'working forests' speaks to Apple's market-based conservation approaches (The Conservation Fund, 2015). As per the report, this partnership was intended to 'transition up to one million acres of forest, across southern provinces of China, into responsible management by 2020' by, among other things, 'establishing long-term market incentives in China for responsibly sourced paper' (Apple Environmental Responsibility Report, 2017: 25). This serves as a good example of how ecosystems management fits nicely into the neoclassical liberal framework, if you can value the component parts and show people how they will benefit from their use (Thompson, 2011).</p><p> Launched in 1985, the Conservation Fund is an American environmental nonprofit with a dual mandate of environmental preservation and economic development. Since 1998, the Working Forest Fund (WFF) of the Conservation Fund has aimed to address and mitigate the loss of the US's privately-held forests, which account for more than half of all forest in the US, with 30 million acres of its forestland sold every year (The Conservation Fund, 2015b). They acquire endangered private forestland with the goal of ecological management and restoration, while also finding ways to be economically profitable. 'Working forests' are owned by large investors, like Apple, which means that they are intended to manage their products sustainably through fiber for pulp, paper, and wood products (Apple Environment Renewable Resources, 2015). Generally, this means allowing for 30% of the forest to be used, a threshold of tree density set to ensure biodiversity, and a fine-tuned balance maintained between naturally occurring forest floods and fires.</p><p> On their Environmental Sustainability website, Apple defines innovation as 'working with what's here to make something new' - a bizarre turn of phrase that reveals nothing about the link between managing finite resources, but rather equates the eternal promise of incremental innovation with the marketing stance that this makes it something 'new'. With its perfect Greenpeace scorecard, Apple epitomizes the ideal of renewability of Big Tech, while disconnected from issues of consumption and the Big Data Ecologies it inhabits.</p><p>Apple is a key player in shaping public perceptions of Big Tech. With Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon, it leads the way for product design, production, communication, distribution, consumption, engineering and architecture. While it remains the case that these companies constitute only a fraction of the 5% of total ownership of operational data centers in the world - as few companies own or run their own data centers - their cultural influence is vastly disproportionate.</p><p> The idea of maintaining 'appropriate thresholds' for ongoing exploitation or of 'calculated risk' in ecological management reinforces the cybernetic-ecosystemic dream. Ecosystems management is a field called to task for having been based on leaps from available evidence, where data was forced to fit the theory born of the logics of the time (from 1850 to 1950 in Europe and America). Hugely informed by the emergence of the supercomputer in the US in the 1960s, which was able to correlate data at a scale larger than ever before in the social sciences, the desire to frame and fit nature into a similar cybernetic model proved impossible to resist. As for the emergence of social sciences, where surveys and questionnaires were thought to reveal a deeper truth about human nature based on the conclusions that could be reached by sampling such large groups, more data meant more objectivity, and more objectivity meant more power to assert a particular order of things, including over nature (Ashby, 1956; Odum, 1994; Curtis, 2011).</p><p> When it emerged as a discipline, the dominant logic of Ecology was largely informed by Darwin's evolutionary theories, as well as the advent of Cybernetics as 'the scientific study of how people, animals, and machines control and communicate information.' (Merriam-Webster, 2006) In Ecology, nodes (plant, animal, water, etc.) in an ecosystem were increasingly understood to be disturbed by environmental factors, especially in relation to the extinction of certain species. This, in turn, reinforced the idea that these nodes needed to adapt to environmental factors for survival, otherwise they were succeeded by a more stable version of themselves. As a scientific logic, Ecology proved that stability - imposed or 'natural' - was not only the goal, but that with proper calculation and manipulation, a kind of beneficent order was possible because of this continuous adaptation.</p><p> However, recent research emerging from climate change studies forces us to confront the limits of Ecology as a discipline, concept, and theory of ongoing adaptability. Instead we are now forced to reconsider the many 'eco-logics' that have allowed neoliberal policies to dominate. We are now confronted with capitalism's antithetic relationship to the environment and recognize it for what it is: a means to maintain economically viable commodity production in our current era of mass communication, for the personal/private profit of relatively few under the guise of improving the lives of the masses. The only hope for the critical scholar at this juncture - or 'impasse' as Sheena Wilson (2014) frames it - is for a 'revolution of mentalities' (Guattari, 1995: 119) that relocates critical and heartfelt thought as central to the existential shift now needed, rather than looking to technology, media, policy, or Big Data as remedies (Taffel, 2012; Hunt, 2014; Easterling, 2014).</p><p> Thinking big</p><p> Ecology is the broadest but youngest of sciences. It was first conceived during the 18C as an 'economy of nature' by Swedish botanist Carolus Linnaeus who observed and documented the interactions of plants and animals. In 1866, 'Ecology' got its official name from German biologist, Ernst Haeckel, as the concept shifted from the lab to the field. Early ecology produced food chain diagrams and animal pyramids as means to interpret and explain the various support systems at play in specific contexts. In the 1920 and 1930s, ecological work became quantified and partitioned in order to be explored scientifically, where principles of physical chemistry could be applied to nature. However, the ideas that ended up most transforming the field were the recognition of organisms as part of a physical environment, and the observation of competition among species. Modern ecology emerged in the 1970s, developed as a utilitarian and serviced-based approach to generate public interest in environmental conservation. Through these reconfigurations, the field shifted again, from 'ecology' to 'ecosystems,' or 'systems ecology.' By the 1990s, ecosystems management became more overtly a method to estimate the economic value of natural resources: nature as commodity. As we see with Big Tech, land and water in particular have become incorporated into trade mechanisms.</p><p> Before ecosystems management became a utilitarian deployment of science, the environment was largely considered to be in 'natural production' offering 'non-appropriable gifts of nature' (Gomez-Baggethun et al., 2010). Nature was not something owned, and as such, had no inherent monetary value, nor was it perceived as serving humans in any useful way. But the mainstreaming through science and policy making of ecosystems management by the late 1990s saw the value of global natural capital and ecosystem services become interlinked. This approach: 'stressed human dependency not only on ecosystem services, but also on the underlying ecosystem functioning, contributing to make visible the role of biodiversity and ecological processes in human well-being.' (Gomez-Baggethun et al., 2010: 1214) Incentives for conservation became baked into the economy - monetized, appropriated and exchanged - coinciding with the expansion of neoliberalism. Now, the connection between neoliberalism and dataism becomes crucial to understanding this potentially new wave of ecosystems management.</p><p> This new wave will reinforce the idea of control - of a control society - or a society controlled by scientific logics, which is increasingly determined by Big Data and its push to quantify every aspect of existence as a way to be better managed. This is key. If we have Big Data determining our needs, we also need to create the Big Data Ecologies to maintain them. It becomes not only more difficult to opt out of this system, but also more difficult to see outside of this frame. However, the idea of an ecosystem was shaped early on according to a budding machine logic, where elements of the ecosystem were understood and manipulated as nodes in a complex system of interrelationships that can be 'datafied' - mapped, observed, intercepted and interpolated. Now the machine (and its logics) has changed - it is algorithmically larger and more powerful, and it is learning from 'itself' in a manner we term 'artificial' intelligence.</p><p> While Ecology as a discipline has long been focused on the interrelationships between living organisms and the environments in which they live, the concept of 'media ecology' has denoted different theoretical intentions, though arguably circling back to this always vexing concept of nature. Marshall McLuhan (1962, 1964) developed the concept of 'media ecology' in the late 1960s to explain the various eras of humanity according to the role of technology in social transformations. Neil Postman (1970) carried on this intellectual legacy and used the concept of media ecology to draw attention to processes and structures of media rather than to its content or to textual analysis. Matthew Fuller (2007) pluralised the concept, as 'media ecologies,' and invited readers to a kind of multiplicitous materiality, complicating perceptions about the physicality of information. Since then, numerous important interrelated concepts have emerged to reinstate more overtly the ideas of nature and materiality within a mediated ecological frame: Stacy Alaimo's desire to 'track' 'environmental traces' in texts (2011), Jussi Parikka's (2012) 'medianature' - borrowed from Donna Haraway's (2003) earlier idea of 'naturecultures,' - both pointing to the complex weaving of meaning and materiality. Serenella lovino and Serpil Oppermann's (2014) 'material ecocriticism,' further suggests that stories (are) matter, those generated by material agencies and phenomena and, most importantly to the argument, scholars who put into question the universality of the Anthropocene, such as Ruth Irwin (2013), Sheena Wilson (2014), Jason W. Moore (2015) or Zoe Todd (2016), who position the geological era in question as a neoliberal undoing, rather than generalisable human impact. These scholarly interventions come to represent a reformulation of media theory by complicating matter at the heart of both technology and the environment, as neither distinct nor separable. In particular, by suggesting that media objects (and their affects/effects) have agency this (new) materialist turn in media and communication studies allows for a rethinking of the traditional ecological framework in favour of 'Big Data Ecologies' that bear a particular pointedness - a responsibility and an accountability.</p><p> Who has power, who benefits, who suffers, and how those choices are justified by the meanings attributed to 'nature' and innovation vary according to conditions at different technological junctures. This task of deciphering those power dynamics is, in part, the work reserved for critical scholars. Communication infrastructures elicit something important about our shared cultural values, structures, and histories that cannot be measured by Big Data or science alone. Big Data becomes the site of justification for, rather than a byproduct of, the natural disasters and effects of global warming that we must now all endure despite our positionality, philosophical ideals, material access, or place of power in the world. As such, an expanded and more readily interdisciplinary adaptation of the concept of Big Data Ecologies can be employed to advance our understanding of Big Tech as a Western convenience, where waste and polluting processes are most often done in an unacknowledged 'elsewhere,' as a system that relies heavily on disjunctures and contradictions (for discursive/greenwashing purposes in particular), and on the public perception of communications infrastructure as cloud-like, as immaterial and ephemeral. Conversely, Big Tech's hypervisibility around their data centers and their greening efforts fail to consider the implications outside of the economic perspective that sets value, inclusive of human worth and/in relation to primary resources (Kaika and Swyngedouw, 2014). As Wilson explains, by imagining ways to salvage capitalism and the environment as though the survival of one is not reliant on the destruction of the other, we fail to see beyond the superficial offerings of greening initiatives by Big Tech. In line with Wilson my overall argument is about how the so-called 'greening' of Big Data Ecologies are thin narratives that deploy textual and visual rhetorical strategies intended to obfuscate and overwrite resource exploitation.</p><p> With the Google Water and Apple Forest examples, I have carefully accounted for the ways in which Big Tech, and their data centers in particular, have come to monumentalize consumption, and have set in motion a means by which expansion - especially of green energy alternatives - are a symbol of technological success and survival. And yet no matter how green data centers become, and no matter how innovative renewable energy is, there is a larger media ecosystem undergirding it - a world of limited natural resources, techno-trash, toxic bodies, and e-waste - driven by ideals of innovation based on the perpetual marketing of the new. Public relations and marketing need to go beyond common branding tactics, where greening mechanisms are themselves used to perpetuate a sustainable future. What is revealed in both examples is that the goals of Big Tech are fundamentally at odds with the business of these companies, whether it is device manufacture in East Asia, delivery of goods from warehouses across North America, or the cooling operations required of massive always-on server farms.</p><p> While more environmentally sound in the immediate sense, green alternatives situated in proximity to sites of consumption, but not of production, ultimately cannot inherently resolve questions of social accountability or enlightened governance that are crucial in terms of current policy debates. Indeed, it is extremely problematic to ask these companies to take on a central role in the debate of what constitutes the public good when they have other very real objectives, such as providing returns to stockholders. So part of the problem here - a big part - is the erosion of regional, national and international public policy that could set and attain 'good' energy goals through policy and legislation, rather than leave it to the good graces of a company, which is subject to the fickle winds of public perception. As the now widely used concept of the Anthropocene has suggested, human impact has become central to our notion and assessment of progress in relation to nature (Brown and Timmerman, 2015). We must, however, further consider how economic incentives have changed since the world was still largely unmapped (in the settler sense), imagined by many of its explorers as undepletable, offering abundant resources to all, for all times. At our current juncture, however, green alternatives further evade cause in that they allow us to stall and deflect on the question of both consumption and production, even at our breaking point (Zehner, 2012).</p><p> Instead of dealing with consumption at the site of production, Big Tech is investing in large swaths of land, public infrastructure and in the management and containment of natural resources primarily in its marketplaces, as discursively enclosed ecosystems. Just as Houston's sprawling housing and industrial developments on vulnerable waterways could not stand in the way of a so-called 100-year storm, Hurricane Harvey, Big Tech is building containment systems that will not achieve the same goals in data management. It does this in order to counter competition for the growing rarity of natural resources, to control its sources of energy, and to keep up with ever-growing consumption demands. It is grabbing at natural resources, water and land, and also the wind and sun, to seem self-sufficient and also, by way of a complex definition, self-contained. This pairing is not necessarily new nor specific to new media economies. However, these examples do demonstrate the ways in which Big Tech becomes a spawning species of its own doing: at once predatory, fungal, feral and invasive.</p><p> While Big Tech has always relied upon nature in the production of technologies and is increasingly attempting to manage itself as an ecosystem, that is, as a self-sustaining complex network of interdependent and interconnected nodes in a system, it nevertheless fails to reconsider the impact of the very demand on which its supply depends. While implementing material physical infrastructures toward ecosystemic ends, it deploys a capitalist modality of nature to assert itself as green and environmentally-friendly. Natural resources are necessary to the operations of Big Tech, even if, by any calculation, online consumption (McKeown, 2013) - as social media, surveillance, communication, and entertainment - simply cannot be materially supported at today's data-driven expansion rates (Nye, 1996). The problem, however, is that while the concept of a global ecosystem is necessary to make a case against greed and overconsumption, it is also a re-invocation of the same scientific regimes that have long rationalized the domination of machine logics over nature.</p><p> We entrust technology with the task to solve the problems it creates, even if water, forests, and rare earth minerals are inherently - and ultimately - counter-commercially sustainable. In other words, the planet can never replenish the raw materials that have been extruded, and once disused, returned as waste to the ecosystem. Forest, and ecosystems more generally, are said to have a tipping point after which they will not replenish on their own. The time lag of the effects and repercussions of hasty and greedy human interventions - causing animal extinction or forest depletion - take significantly longer to manifest than capitalism invests in managing those same resources. Natural resources are transformed for quick and immediate economic profit. As such, they require rationing policies and practices or they otherwise risk becoming (too quickly) overused and too carelessly dumped elsewhere, determined also by oversimplified economic calculations. In economic terms, value is independent of the resource itself. Nature comes to belong to the highest bidder. This, in turn, means the ecosystemic logic is one based on present and potential utility, with little to no concern for the long term, or for future generations. Big Tech must be repositioned within a Big Data ecosystemic framework to acknowledge technological progress and innovation as a complex player in the transformation of nature and its management, rather than simply either its abuser or its custodian.</p><p> What this paper has demonstrated is that the concept of the ecosystem created long ago, through dubious methods, has been updated and rearticulated, but not fundamentally rethought. It has managed to remain in the public imaginary as the most important way to conceive of the relationship between humans and nature. While the idea of human impact on nature propelled by neoliberal policies is now indisputable, the concept of the ecology and of managing ecosystems risks providing false hope. What we need to come to terms with as a culture is that there is no equilibrium to return to. That is a worldview rendered obsolete.</p><p>the author</p><p> M\u00e9l Hogan is an Assistant Professor of Environmental Media, CMF, University of Calgary.

The tech industry is under more antitrust scrutiny than ever; just a few weeks ago, the Federal Trade Commission announced a broad inquiry into the past decade of acquisitions by the five biggest tech giants, with a focus on mergers that kill off budding rivals. This deal certainly raises that prospect: Intuit and Credit Karma compete on various fronts, and Intuit s most recent federal filings named Credit Karma s free tax-preparation software as a threat to its dominant offering, TurboTax. Intuit has said it will keep Credit Karma s service free, and probably needs to promise as much to regulators to get the deal approved.</p><p>But antitrust enforcers, whose core responsibility is to keep markets competitive and protect consumers, are not just watching for mergers that kill off rivals. They re also starting to look more closely at how tech companies acquire and use data. And that seems to be the main event here. The companies themselves have suggested that a driving force behind the merger is Intuit wanting to get its hands on Credit Karma s stash of user data. Which raises an important question: do consumers benefit from deals where the key asset being sold is their own personal information?</p><p>We re talking about a lot of data here. Credit Karma, whose business is built around a free credit-monitoring app, boasts more than a hundred million users. While those people don t pay to use Credit Karma, they do turn over their financial information, as well as the kinds of behavioral and location data that other companies, like Facebook and Google, track. The platform s algorithms then help lenders micro target users with offers for credit cards, loans, and other financial products. Credit Karma gets a cut when users sign up.</p><p> There s no business person on the planet who doesn t want to get access to consumer financial transaction details that is a pot of gold,  said Kristin Johnson, a professor at Tulane Law School and an expert on financial technology.  The information regarding your purchases and sales, all credits and debits related to your account, really tell a full narrative about you and your life and the things you value and the things you have committed financial resources toward. </p><p>According to Intuit CEO Sasan Goodarzi, the merger will benefit not just the companies, but also consumers.  What you re now able to bring together with the two companies is the customers  complete financial identity so they can get the best loan and insurance products for them,  he said in a conference call announcing the merger Monday, as reported by American Banker. By combining the two companies  datasets, in other words, Intuit will be able to build more richly detailed dossiers of the financial backgrounds for millions of people. That, in turn, will allow lenders and Intuit itself to target offers even more efficiently. (When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Intuit pointed me to smartmoneydecisions.com, a website the companies created about their deal.)</p><h>Stop me if you ve heard this one before</h><p>Does this sound familiar? It should. It s the entire value proposition behind the ad-supported Internet. Facebook and Google, two of the most profitable companies in the world, make their billions by monitoring as much of our online (and, increasingly, offline) behavior as possible and selling ads against that data. They, and other websites and apps like them, justify the surveillance by arguing that consumers appreciate having ads that are more relevant to them. Read a privacy policy, and it will probably mention something about  sharing your data with advertising partners  in order to  present offers that might interest you.  It s not about extracting more money out of us, the story goes; it s about helping us find what we really want.</p><p>It s true that companies can use data to micro target users with better deals. If you ve got great credit, for example, your financial history might indeed lead to you getting better offers: cards with more points, loans with lower interest rates, and so on. But financial data has also been used to benefit corporate bottom lines at the expense of the consumer. This week, the tech publication The Markup published an investigation showing that the insurance giant Allstate has been trying to get Maryland regulators to approve a pricing algorithm for auto insurance that, according to the article, would squeeze more money out of the biggest spenders, rather than pricing strictly according to risk. (Maryland ultimately rejected its proposal.) Intuit itself has been documented steering customers to paid products when they qualified for free ones.</p><h>Bad is good</h><p>And companies don t just seek out people with good scores or lots of money. In fact, people with weaker credit scores can in some ways be more lucrative customers for credit products.  Being weaker is not bad to the industry,  said Martha Poon, a sociologist who studies credit scoring technology.  The weaker you are, the higher the interest rate they can charge you. That, for them, is good.  In the modern credit industry, she added,  what s at stake is not selecting borrowers who are so-called  worthy  of credit. It s extending as much credit as possible in a way that allows the lender to have an economically viable business. </p><p>On the one hand, this does mean that people with bad scores or no score can still get access to credit they might not otherwise have, even if it comes with punishing rates (think payday loans). On the other hand, the system can be predatory, trapping borrowers in a cycle of debt an argument made forcefully by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who led the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And the complexity of financial products makes the prospect of a truly efficient market, where consumers are able to rationally weigh all their options, a fantasy.</p><h>No interest in interest</h><p> I teach a consumer finance class to upper-level law students, and they struggle to understand things like shifting and compounding interest rates and the mathematical calculations for penalties and administrative fees,  said Christopher Odinet, a law professor at the University of Oklahoma. When that complexity is mixed with microtargeting, he argued, the potential for harm goes up. He pointed out that while federal law prohibits lenders from discriminating by protected categories like race and gender, the use of algorithms can make it impossible to know how decisions on credit offers are even being made. They may make use of other data points, like someone s neighborhood, to reach similarly discriminatory results as studies have already shown.</p><p> You should be assessed based on your individual ability to repay, not based on broad categories that have a ton of stereotyping and assumptions built into them,  Odinet said.  But that is what big data does, at least in the credit scoring context. </p><p>To be clear, this isn t to say that Intuit has any nefarious intentions with the Credit Karma data. What s undeniable, however, is that if the deal goes through, Intuit s big data is about to get a lot bigger. And that has big implications for consumers. An expert suggested to The New York Times that the company  could become a sort of Facebook for financial services.  That s why the deal poses an important test case for antitrust enforcers  budding interest in data-driven mergers. Imagine a world in which all the prices we see not just for loans, but for TVs, flights, breakfast cereal are based on an algorithmic determination of how much each individual person is willing and able to pay. If regulators accept the argument that being ever more precisely targeted by marketers is good for consumers, then we could be well on our way to living in that world. And we ll be expected to be grateful.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/ftc-special-order-review-big-tech-killer-acquisitions/\">https://www.wired.com/story/ftc-special-order-review-big-tech-killer-acquisitions/</url><br/>Contact Information:<br/>GILAD EDELMAN, WIRED.COM<br/><br/>Tags:<br/>, Artificial Intelligence Newswire, Wire, United States, English<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpsicrowdnewswirecomp2391253</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YB9-D8J1-JCTB-F02B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1443\"/><timeReceived>12:20 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 2, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
