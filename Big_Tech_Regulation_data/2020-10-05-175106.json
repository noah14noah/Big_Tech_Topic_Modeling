It was perverse: our information was sitting inside the bank's systems but we couldn't get it out in a way that made sense.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The experience helped him realise that, somewhere under the grunt work, a good business idea might be lurking. What was needed was some way of tapping into the customer account information locked away in the banks, leveraging the data in ways that could make everyday life a lot less complicated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As chief executive of Simpler, an online mortgage broker, Murphy has taken the first steps in this direction. Instead of the mountains of paperwork that are needed to support a typical loan application, first-time buyers can short-circuit the process with Simpler's app, which interfaces with mortgage providers behind the scenes.</p><p>Life should get easier for businesses such as Murphy's from September, when the EU's second Payment Services Directive (PSD2) comes into force. It will usher in a new era of open banking, forcing banks to allow third parties - retailers, fintech start-ups and rival lenders - to access the accounts of any customers who authorise it. A public awareness campaign about PSD2, billed by some as the biggest upheaval to hit retail or business banking in the past 50 years, has kicked off in recent days.</p><p>\"It's your data but it's trapped in the bank,\" said Murphy. \"Open banking will get the data out of the bank so that it can be used for useful applications.\"</p><p>By breaking the banks' stranglehold on customer data, the hope is that their monopoly on financial services might be loosened, if not broken.</p><p>For an idea of what to expect, most people are looking to Britain, which implemented PSD2 in January 2018. This has necessitated a \u00a31bn ((EURO)1.1bn) investment by the country's banks and spawned almost 200 third-party businesses eager to harvest data from bank customers for a wide range of services.</p><p>Credit Ladder, for example, lets tenants build a credit history based on their rental payments - data that was previously not available to lenders when making credit checks. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://nestlings.io/\">Nestlings.io</url></p><p> works like a mobile game that helps users make regular savings. Yet Britons have been predictably reluctant to throw their bank accounts open to third parties.</p><p>\"When you ask consumers to give away their data, their initial reaction is always no,\" said Garrett Cassidy, founder of Trezeo, an Irish company that has taken advantage of open banking in the UK. \"Their attitude changes, though, if you can demonstrate how sharing data can create value.\"</p><p>Trezeo has raised (EURO)750,000 from backers including Voxpro founders Dan and Linda Kiely. It uses open banking to access the accounts of those with irregular earnings, such as taxi drivers and gig-economy workers, helping to smooth out their cashflow by holding back some income in busy weeks to help tide them over when work is less plentiful.</p><p>Initial expectations that the tech giants might use open banking as a weapon to break into financial services have so far proved unfounded. This may be because their ambitions are much greater than anything envisaged by PSD2. With Facebook planning its own currency, for example, it probably believes it has nothing to learn from conventional banks. Big tech may also be wary of PSD2 because the price for accessing banks' customer data is that third parties must agree to strict regulatory supervision.</p><p>Stripe, the payments unicorn founded by Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison, has obtained authorisation from the Central Bank of Ireland to provide PSD2-type services. There are no signs yet that other tech groups will follow.</p><p>\"The open banking products that are out there are mostly good solutions for small problems,\" said Murphy. \"Many of the companies behind them are probably not large enough to attract the funding that's needed to get regulated. You'd need a minimum of (EURO)100,000 to show the regulator you have the resources to stay solvent for the first 18 months.\"</p><p>Yet a number of Irish fintechs have surmounted the challenges of scale by concentrating on the UK. Swoop Funding, with (EURO)1.2m of backing from Enterprise Ireland and other investors, interrogates the bank accounts of UK small businesses to help them link up with about 1,000 providers of debt and equity capital.</p><p>\"We condense the funding market for small businesses, which are generally knowledge- and time-poor,\" said founder and chief executive Andrea Reynolds.</p><p>Circit, whose backers include former Ulster Bank chief executive Jim Brown, has a tool that allows external auditors to obtain real-time confirmations from their clients' bankers. Luna Connect is a Galway start-up that uses open banking to gather information on businesses and individuals that are looking for credit.</p><p>\"In some ways there's nothing new about what we do,\" said Cassidy, whose career before Trezeo included an eight-year stint at Bank of Ireland.</p><p>\"Without open banking, however, it would be too laborious and expensive to go through people's statements manually to gauge what a reasonable level of income should be for each individual. The process is so much more efficient when we have direct access to people's electronic data.\"</p><p>Irish banks are well placed to roll out open banking, says Cassidy, because AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank have been through the process in the UK, including developing the application programming interfaces (APIs) that link customers' accounts with third-party providers. \"Using the same APIs as the UK lowers the barriers for UK third parties to come to Ireland,\" he said.</p><p>\"I don't think they'd be interested if Ireland used different APIs, because the market is too small.\"</p><p>Swoop is already working with Ulster Bank and other local lenders on introducing its business funding platform to Ireland. \"We're seeing a real shift in banks' mindsets,\" says Reynolds.</p><p>\"They've moved from viewing open banking as a compliance issue - something they have to do because of PSD2 - to being an opportunity. They're becoming more collaborative, realising that if they cannot meet their customers' needs, there is an opportunity in helping them find funding elsewhere by working with third parties such as Swoop.\"</p><p>Fears that banks might use this collaboration as a Trojan horse to steal the clever ideas of emerging companies are unfounded, according to Fergal Coburn, chief digital and innovation officer at AIB.</p><p>\"We're a bank,\" he said. \"Our business is not scalable to a level where we could absorb all the fintech ideas out there.\"</p><p>Coburn believes one of the main threat to banks from PSD2 will come from other banks. If customers agree to allow AIB to access their accounts at other banks, for example, it could have a much better view of their overall finances, allowing for speedier lending decisions.</p><p>AIB opened an open banking portal in November last year for fintechs gearing up to take advantage of open banking. Despite a lot of interest, only eight third parties are connected to the bank's API so far. They include Fire Financial Services, a payments company founded by the businessman Colm Lyon, who sold his Realex Payments for (EURO)115m in 2015.</p><p>\"We've made a big investment in this,\" says Coburn. \"Take-up has been disappointing but I expect open banking will be similar to our experience with contactless payment cards. They were a slow burn at first but usage has accelerated dramatically, to the point where half of card transactions are now contactless.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-54077020</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WFS-GPF1-JCJY-G4FV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1295\"/><timeReceived>11:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 29, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0004WPD</classCode><className>HOME CAPITAL GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS523991 TRUST, FIDUCIARY &amp;

They have varying degrees of legitimacy among the public, but all of them contribute to the stream of information that policymakers and their staffs interact with and consume. It's a constant low hum attempting to influence, shape, and control, and even by osmosis, it tends to work.Large corporations have long figured out that by laundering their self-interested views through these third parties, they can confer feigned legitimacy upon them. In rare moments when the political class actually seems roused enough to do something, corporations who fear legal or regulatory changes start collecting legitimizers more rapidly. </p><p>The more independent the communicator appears, the greater the victory for the corporate benefactor. And the biggest win of all is to get someone perceived as a critic into the fold.Which brings us to the case of Fiona Scott Morton, and me. Scott Morton is a Yale economist who served in the antitrust division of the Justice Department and now directs the Thurman Arnold Project[1], a collaborative research institution named after the famed antitrust enforcer. A year ago, I wrote a piece[2] for The New Republic about her, noting that her rhetoric on competition policy had sharpened, pushed forward by the incipient anti-monopoly movement. Given that Scott Morton may very well serve as a top antitrust official in a hypothetical Biden administration, her shift toward more aggression on monopoly seemed important enough to elevate.More from David Dayen[3]So it matters that Scott Morton has been taking money[4] advising Apple and Amazon, at a time when both firms face antitrust investigations in Congress and among state and federal law enforcement. Fiona self-disclosed the relationship[5] in a panel discussion last month. The Apple consulting is longstanding; she took on Amazon as a client within the past year.This is far more the norm than the exception; in fact, there's even a duopoly among consulting firms that outsource experts and academics to monopolies. Compass Lexecon and Charles River Associates, have 10 prior lead economists at the Justice Department's antitrust division[6] on their payroll. (Scott Morton, one such economist, works with Charles River[7].) When Gene Kimmelman worked on a series of reports building an antitrust case against the tech giants, he 'had to hire an outside lawyer,' according to Bloomberg, to detail the potential conflicts among those toiling on the project.The problem goes well beyond one researcher and one set of client relationships. Scott Morton contributed to two of those reports, making cases against Facebook and Google. The CEOs of those companies will appear before the House Antitrust Subcommittee next week, along with the CEOs of Amazon and Apple, Scott Morton's clients.She reconciles this by saying that those papers covered Facebook and Google exclusively, and that 'I work for companies that I'm comfortable are not breaking the law.' Personally, I don't see much daylight between, say, Google steering video search results to its YouTube subsidiary[8] and Amazon steering shopping searches to its house brands[9]. The lawsuit over tech companies using people's faces to test facial recognition software[10] without their permission implicates Google and Amazon. Your donation keeps this site free and open for all to read. Give what you can...SUPPORT THE PROSPECT[11]Similarly, Facebook's strategy of buying potential rivals[12] seems identical to Apple buying a company[13] every two to three weeks. Apple's domination of its App Store[14] seems to go well beyond Google's Android store for phone apps, requiring developers to seek Apple's approval to get access to its iPhone users.Maybe there are nuances here, and there are many ways to resolve these issues short of an antitrust violation. But it's common sense that, if policymakers are scrutinizing four Big Tech companies, and Fiona Scott Morton works for two of them, and she writes papers about how the other two are stone-cold lawbreakers, then she's by definition steering policymakers toward the companies she doesn't work for, to the benefit of those she does.Lack of disclosure on op-ed pages is ubiquitous; small business owners or experts put their names to arguments constructed by tech platforms, hiding behind the writer's presumed independence. In other cases, Scott Morton has written publicly about her clients. In a Washington Post op-ed published last July[15] titled 'Why 'Breaking Up' Big Tech Probably Won't Work,' Scott Morton dismisses breakups as 'sloganeering,' preferring other restraints that promote competition. The op-ed parrots a common theme of the tech platforms that market share could merely be a function of offering popular products. She didn't disclose her tech consulting in that piece.In response to a question from the Prospect, Scott Morton maintained that the op-ed was only about Facebook. 'I don't think a piece on Facebook required a disclosure about work for any other company, pharmaceutical, tech, or otherwise,' she said in an email. She added that she was not working for Amazon at the time, only Apple. But the piece mentions Apple twice and is clearly framed around the tech giants as a whole, not any one company. It even includes a disclaimer about the Post's owner, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, which would be odd on a piece solely about Facebook.Scott Morton has also drawn blood on Amazon in the past. A paper she wrote[16] citing Amazon forcing third-party sellers to not offer a lower price elsewhere on the web led to Amazon ending the practice[17]. Amazon had a strategy to prevent that from happening again; hire the expert who pointed it out. This is a win for Amazon even if they get no useful advice about navigating antitrust law out of the consulting relationship.Zephyr Teachout of Fordham Law, a prominent critic of monopolies, called for Scott Morton to step down[18] from the Thurman Arnold Project after the revelation. 'She cannot continue as the Director without undermining its integrity,' Teachout argued.But the problem goes well beyond one researcher and one set of client relationships. Lack of disclosure on op-ed pages is ubiquitous[19]; small business owners or experts put their names to arguments constructed by tech platforms, hiding behind the writer's presumed independence. Hal Singer detailed at the Prospect last week[20] the hundreds of congressional and regulatory staffers who have found their way to work for Amazon, Facebook, and Google. The open shilling[21] for Big Tech going on throughout academia and BigLaw and think tanks is so commonplace you can write a detailed article outlining who's on what side. Your donation keeps this site free and open for all to read. Give what you can...SUPPORT THE PROSPECT[22]This buzz in the ear of decision-makers all day long creates the monopolists' desired impression. Kamala Harris's frequent team-ups with tech giants[23] during her state attorney general career offers a window into how this works.It's very clear that monopolist purchases of experts who align with their self-serving claims threaten the functioning of democracy in the public interest. In fact, here's an article making exactly that case[24] with specific examples, co-authored by Austin Frerick, who is now the deputy director of the Thurman Arnold Project, working directly for Fiona Scott Morton.

As well as the day job at Fire1, which is developing a remote monitor for heart failure, he is chairman of the Irish Medtech Association (IMA); sits on the board of Enterprise Ireland; and lectures in enterprise at University College Dublin (UCD), his alma mater.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For good measure, Hanley has just started playing five-a-side football and is determined to learn how to surf. Unsurprisingly, the targets on the activity app on his Apple Watch are set to their maximum level. \"I try to keep busy,\" he says.</p><p>Fire1 alone is a big undertaking. The venture raised (EURO)40m last year from heavyweight investors, and has 30 staff between offices at Dublin City University's Alpha innovation campus and UCD's Nexus research centre.</p><p>The office walls carry quotes from heart failure patients, and Hanley is clearly highly motivated. \"We are trying to solve heart failure,\" he says.</p><p>\"It helps on a Monday morning commute to have a purpose to your work. Building a business is a long, hard journey, so it's important to keep that focus on why you're doing it.\"</p><p>Fire1 has developed its core technology and is \"moving into the clinical roadmap\", says Hanley. That will involve a lengthy period of testing and certification before Fire1 products are available.</p><p>With his IMA hat on, meanwhile, Hanley represents 450 medtech companies that employ a combined 38,000 people and account for exports worth more than (EURO)12.5bn a year. Not as sexy as big tech or as high-profile as pharma, it is an industry that prioritises \"substance over style\", he says.</p><p>Ahead of the 2020 budget, the IMA is calling on the government to improve tax incentives for entrepreneurs and co-fund a (EURO)42m advanced manufacturing centre in Limerick. Its pre-budget submission warns that, post-Brexit, the UK will surely try to use lower taxes and incentives to lure business from Ireland.</p><p>\"There is a phenomenal opportunity for Ireland to be one of the dominant centres for healthcare solutions,\" says Hanley, slipping slightly into jargon about the internet of things. \"A lot of the building blocks are here but we need to ensure we don't lose that opportunity.\"</p><p>Hanley's CV makes him a decent poster boy for the sector. He attributes his business inclinations partly to his father, who had his own business as a consultant engineer.</p><p>One of four children, Hanley grew up in Foxrock, south Dublin, and went to St Michael's College in Ballsbridge. He moved on to UCD to study chemical engineering, graduating in 1990.</p><p>He did well enough to score a scholarship to do a PhD at Pennsylvania University in Philadelphia, which claims the distinction of being the first higher-level institution in America to refer to itself as a university. Hanley specialised in nanotechnology and spent five years at the university.</p><p>\"I loved the meritocracy and the can-do attitude in America,\" he says. \"A lot of it was hard work but it gave me a foundation for what I do - tech and innovation with a really global focus.\"</p><p>He went to work at Air Products &amp; Chemicals, an industrial chemicals multinational based in Pennsylvania. One of the world's largest producers of industrial gases, it employs about 16,000 people and is valued at $50bn ((EURO)45bn) in New York.</p><p>Hanley got wide experience with Air Products in the US and Europe, including working on a project in Belgium to bring nitrogen into beer cans to keep the beer bubbly. In the late 1990s, he was involved in the launch of the first hydrogen fuel cell car in London.</p><p>His next step was a scholarship to do an MBA at Insead, the famed graduate business school at Fontainebleau in France. Hanley enjoyed the course and loved France.</p><p>\"It was quite a transformative experience. At Insead, you meet a huge diversity of people from different backgrounds, all with global ambitions.\"</p><p>By the time he graduated from Insead in the summer of 2001, Hanley had been out of Ireland for 11 years. He does not mind admitting he was motivated to come home in pursuit of his now wife, Grainne, who was in Ireland.</p><p>\"I believed Ireland had transformed in that time, and I wanted to come back and get involved in something,\" he says. \"I wanted to try to consolidate the various elements of my career up to then.\"</p><p>In Dublin, he joined Ntera, an early-stage nanotechnology company that had been spun out from UCD research. Founded by college professor Donald Fitzmaurice, Ntera raised about (EURO)40m in funding to develop hi-tech displays for electronics products but ultimately went into liquidation in 2011.</p><p>Hanley left in 2004 and still speaks highly of the experience. \"It was ahead of its time,\" he says. \"Donald is a great visionary. and Ntera's employees have gone on to do many other ventures.\"</p><p>He can count himself among them. With his multinational experience, MBA and start-up stint, Hanley had a desire to do something of his own and narrowed his focus to the healthcare sector.</p><p>\"I had an itch I still wanted to scratch,\" he says. \"There was a lot of talk at the time about technology transforming healthcare and helping people to live longer. I became obsessed.\"</p><p>With two academics from UCD's school of electronic and electrical engineering, Conor Heneghan and Philip de Chazal, he co-founded the medtech outfit BiancaMed. It developed a wire-free sensor for measuring sleep and breathing, with the potential to detect conditions from sleep apnoea to heart failure.</p><p>ResMed, a US specialist in medical products for sleep and respiratory disorders, was a seed investor. BiancaMed raised about (EURO)10m in total, with backers including DFJ ePlanet Ventures, Seventure Partners in France, Enterprise Ireland and Invest Northern Ireland.</p><p>The company licensed in some technology and did its own development in Dublin. Its product was manufactured in Shenzhen, China, and launched in Japan, and also sold through Apple stores.</p><p>In January 2011, ResMed bought out the other investors and took 100% ownership of BiancaMed for about (EURO)25m. Following the acquisition, Hanley joined ResMed, which invested in expanding the R&amp;D facility in Dublin. Over five years at the US group, he ran its chronic disease management solutions division, its cardiology business, and its ventures and initiatives business units. \"I was Dublin-based but spent 70%-80% of my time abroad, from San Diego to Sydney, to Tokyo,\" he says. \"That whole period was very helpful for me in terms of learning from peers in different business units and environments.\"</p><p>In 2016, he was hired to run Fire1, which had been launched two years earlier by the Foundry, a Californian medtech incubator. Fire1 was the 15th company from the Foundry but the first it located outside the US, says Hanley.</p><p>\"They liked the talent and the medtech base in Ireland,\" he says. \"It was very early-stage when I joined, but with a great investor base and core talent.\"</p><p>In tandem with Hanley's hiring, the company raised $7.5m from healthcare group Covidien and venture capitalists Lightstone Ventures and New Enterprise Associates. In January last year, it raised a further (EURO)40m, with Gilde Healthcare, Gimv and Seventure Partners joining the existing investors.</p><p>For many of the financial backers, it was their first deal in Ireland. Hanley knows it was an eye-catching amount for a company that few people knew existed. \"It is a big number for Ireland and even in a European context,\" he says. \"I would say the investors and I are equally ambitious about what we can achieve.\"</p><p>The company may raise more funding depending on its needs, he says.</p><p>\"It's the nature of this sector. We are continuing to grow the team, and thinking of second and third versions of our products.\"</p><p>Hanley still travels widely to keep on top of trends in medicine, technology and regulation. The US sucks up a lot of medtech investment and China is an emerging power, but Ireland holds its own, especially in talent, he says.</p><p>\"I interact a lot with universities, and with doctors and healthcare professionals. The calibre of our doctors and researchers is world-class. Ireland is a great place to innovate.\"</p><p>Hanley is doing his bit on the education front, as a part-time associate professor of electronic engineering at UCD, where he teaches a module in entrepreneurship in engineering. The class promises to explain what it is like to start a company, including \"all its chaos, uncertainty, impossible deadlines [and] conflicting input\".</p><p>Having been through all that in real life, Hanley has a confession, however.</p><p>\"I don't think of myself as an entrepreneur,\" he says. \"I'm just driven by whatever project I'm working on, by the team and the innovation we're doing.\"</p><p>With some help from those early-morning swims, of course.</p><p>                   The life of Conor Hanley                   Vital statistics                   Age:                   </p><p> 50</p><p>                   Home:                    </p><p>Monkstown, Dublin</p><p>                   Family:                   </p><p> Married to Grainne, a doctor, with two children: Louise, 9, and Michael, 7</p><p>                   Education:                   </p><p> Engineering degree from University College Dublin, PhD in chemical engineering from Pennsylvania University, and MBA from Insead, France</p><p>                   Favourite book:                   </p><p>Bruno, Chief of Police series, by Martin Walker</p><p>                   Favourite film:                   </p><p> Jiro Dreams of Sushi, a Netflix documentary about a top sushi chef</p><p>                   Working day                   </p><p>I go for a swim at 6.30am, have breakfast, then get in early to avoid the traffic.

Some thoughts  Bigtech has won before the hearing starts. Agreeing to let all four testify concurrently inhibits the committee's ability to go deep on any one issue, and will leave the American public with a sentiment instead of a viewpoint on big tech, much less any conclusions (such as, that the Obama DOJ was asleep at the switch, and Instagram and Whatsapp should be divested). The Covid-inspired remote format dramatically lessens the likelihood of an unscripted moment that reveals something the American public didn't previously know. Fabric softener for tough questioning is the deep pockets that keep members in power. </p><p>   When the show starts, Zuck will be the target of the most ire, as he's an oligarch minus the charm. Bezos, on the other hand, will receive the least ire, as his command of soft power is second only to China. Being on these committees must be just awesome, as every member clings to their office as if they were Puerto Rican rescue dogs clinging to lamb lung fillet. (I see this with my dog Gangster. It's a moment that gives you pause to see how much a living thing can love something else.)  Bezos has the power to take away the committee's lamb treats (he owns a powerful arbiter in theWaPo) and, maybe more important, they want invites to the best parties in DC (low bar) at the old textile museum\u2014 Bezos's man cave in Kalorama. I think Bezos lacks character and code (he gamifies the commonwealth for his own enrichment #HQ2), but I'd love to roll with him, and so would every first ballot hall of lame panelist questioning him at the hearings. Cook and Pichai will likely just try to stay out of the line of fire and fawning for Zuck and Bezos, respectively. Expect Zuck to use two words repeatedly in his defense (tik and tok[5]) as he attempts to wrap himself in the flag and convince the committee that he's our national champion, singularly able to repel the invading Chinese coming for our children.  But there is hope. By limiting the hearing to the antitrust subcommittee, the House gives more time to representatives who have domain expertise. The sharpest of these embers, if they take the right approach, may be able to move the needle from apathy towards outrage and build momentum for future change.  The key here is to recognize the mediumisthe message. Exploit the one attribute of the format that can be much improved: visuals. These always look awkward and very fifties during live testimony, though Representative Katie Porter does a great job with her mini white boards (note to self: get one). The 'share screen' function should be the weapon of choice here. Words will communicate themes (you're too big and abuse your monopoly power, which suppresses innovation, job growth, and the economy). Little is new here, but points can be communicated more effectively than before. The best opportunity to yield insight into why big tech should be broken up is to highlight the scale of the firms, and the problem. The winning cocktail is visuals and proportion.  The effective panelists at these hearings use the witness as a prop to stamp their passport on the way to the destination (you're a monopoly). The strategy is simple: ask a question, share screen/visual, unshare so public can see an awkward reaction by witness, allow 5 seconds max for answer, interrupt, and wash/rinse/repeat. So, as I'm hoping to be unanimously approved as US Ambassador to Australia in the Biden Administration (#itcouldhappen), here are my suggestions for visuals and questions:  All Four  Q: Messrs. Bezos, Cook, Pichai, Zuckerberg, your firms have added greater market capitalization in the last five years than the largest retailers and CPG firms have in total. This is a large portion of the entire consumer economy. If you were public servants, would you be concerned that too many of the spoils are being registered by increasingly fewer firms and people?    Q: Your market capitalization per employee is thousands of times higher than that of other companies in your sectors. Do you think your companies contribute to income inequality?    Q: Since the onset of the pandemic, nearly every sector, other than big tech and companies deemed too big to fail, has shed substantial value. Instead, since the beginning of the year, your firms and Microsoft have increased in value by an average of 35%, while the remaining 495 firms in the S&amp;#38;P 500 are down 5%. Every firm, sector, and economy appears to have incurred a transfer in value and power to your firms. Should we be concerned that your considerable advantage pre-Covid is now unassailable?    Q: Small business formation is at a multi-decadelow[6]. The fastest-growing sectors receive scant funding from investors. Why should someone invest in a search engine right now, or a music streaming business, or a social media platform, or an e-commerce firm, given the sizes of your companies?    Apple  Q: Mr. Cook,monopoly rentis when a monopoly producer lacks competition and thus can sell its goods and services at a price far above what the otherwise competitive market price would be, at the expense of consumers. Our information age is often called 'the app economy,' denoting how important apps have become to commerce and consumption. Your firm and Google dominate the app ecosystem, with62% and 38%[7]shares, respectively. This chart shows the rents you are able to extract from every streaming video app. Every media company that wants to reach a consumer online must pay you a toll or rent. Do you think any of these firms believe that paying you this rent is a choice?    Q: Apple TV+ is offering consumers $1 billion in original content for every .80c a month the consumer spends on your Apple TV+ streaming video service. Isn't it your opportunity to differentiate your $1,300 phones and fund Apple TV+ from the revenues of an unrelated product that allows you to offer a media product at well below cost? In sum, isn't Apple guilty of 'dumping,' that is, buying market share with unfeasibly low prices?    Q: Spotify is consistently rated as a superior music service to your Apple Music, yet Apple Music is growingfaster[8]than Spotify in the US. Isn't this a function of you owning the rails, and being able to levy a30%[9]tax on a competitor while illegallyreducing[10]their discoverability in the app store?    Amazon  Q: Mr. Bezos, you are the wealthiest person in the world. Your wealth exceeds the GDP of Kuwait and Luxembourg, combined. It exceeds the defense budgets of Israel, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, combined. A common feature among the other wealthiest Americans of the 20th century (Rockefeller, Morgan, Mellon, Carnegie, Gates) is that most/all of these men presided over firms that were eventually tried for monopoly abuse and deemed monopolies. Why should we believe your wealth accumulation is any different?    Q: Last year, Amazon paid $162 million in federal tax while your largest competitor, Walmart, paid almost $3 billion. Do you think this level of participation in our country's infrastructure and services is appropriate for a company worth $1.5 trillion?    Q: Due to Covid-19, US consumers are expected to spend an additional $41 billion on retail ecommerce in 2020. Since you control38%[11]of US e-commerce revenue, doesn't this mean that you've added at least $16 billion in topline revenue due to Covid while thousands of small businesses havefolded[12]?    Q: In a five-week period during the pandemic, your firm added the value of the world's largest firm by revenue \u2014Walmart[13]. If your firm can accrete the value of the largest firm in the world in five weeks, and money is power, then isn't your firm the most powerful private entity in history? Hasn't your firm reached a level of soft and economic power well beyond the point when the DOJ has historically taken antitrust action?    Q: Our understanding is your firm has more full-time lobbyists in Washington than there are sitting US senators. Are you aware of any retailer or tech firm, other than Google, that has this manylobbyists[14]attempting to suppress regulation or antitrust action?    Q: Mr. Bezos,82%[15]of American homes have Amazon Prime, more than voted in the 2016 election, have a pet, attend church, or decorate a Christmas tree. Can you name any other firm that has a recurring revenue relationship with 8 out of 10 households?    Q: Your video content, as registered by IMDB and the National Academy of Television Arts &amp;#38; Sciences, is far inferior to the content offered by AT&amp;#38;T's division (HBO), yet you refuse to distribute HBO Max as a stand-alone offering on your service. Doesn't this mean you are leveraging your distribution power to weaken the competition (HBO Max[16]) and reduce consumer access to better content?    Q: Mr. Bezos, the recently released TOS for your audio and podcast platformsay[17]that participants on the service cannot say anything bad about Amazon. Are we to assume that all assets you control, includingThe Washington Post, are restricted to only positive comments regarding you and your firm?  Google  Q: Mr. Pichai, your search engine is the default on Android devices, and you have amultibillion[18]dollar contract with Apple to be the default search engine on the iPhone. You've alsobought[19]digital advertising networks[20]to build your part of the digital advertising duopoly. What company \u2014whether a search business or an advertising firm \u2014can begin to compete with a behemoth with such a massive advantage and such deep pockets?      Q: Google owns the dominant digital ad server, DoubleClick Ad Exchange, or AdX. Over90%[21]of large publishers sell their ad inventory on AdX. And Google owns the dominant tool, Google Ads, through which advertisers purchase inventory on AdX. Don't you think controlling both the auction house for ad space and the main auction participant for buying those ad spaces allows Google to engage in anticompetitive pricing?  Q: You've been finedthree[22]times by the EU for acting in ways that harm competition. Google searchesfavor[23]YouTube ahead of other video rivals. Searches often display results just under the question as the user types, making it unnecessary to click any links. This deprives other firms of revenue. You present search resultsas you see fit[24], independent of the cost to other businesses. Don't you think having 71% share in the search business and increasingly locking other companies out of profits through search is unfair use of monopoly power?    Q: YouTube has come under criticism many times in the past for radicalizing our children through an algorithm that suggests increasingly violent and extreme content. A user can start out with 'downtown NYC' and within three videos they are being offeredconspiracy[25]theories about how 9/11 was an inside job. One of your former engineers accused YouTube ofperverting civic discussion[26]through radicalizing algorithms. Don't you think that if YouTube were its own company and had more competitors of similar size, that it would be forced to work harder to correct these algorithms that are so toxic to the public good? If the best corrective mechanism of a free market is competition, where is the competition to force you to do better?  Q: Mr. Pichai, can you name any other firm, anywhere in the world, that has this level of market share of a sector greater than $100 billion in size?      Facebook  Q: Mr. Zuckerberg, a Princeton Universitystudy[27]of Americans' internet habits leading up to the 2016 presidential election found that Facebook led users to untrustworthy news sites 15% of the time, and to trustworthy news sites only 6% of the time. Studies have also found that the underlying Facebook algorithm, which promotes emotion and outrage, benefitted Trump more than Clinton. Do you feel partially responsible for the erosion in the sanctity of our elections?    Q: This summer, a number of Facebook's biggest advertisers announced a boycott of the platform in response to your inadequate handling of hate speech. In response, Nick Clegg, your Vice President for Public Affairs, said, 'We've made huge strides But, you know, on an average day, there are 115 billion messages sent on our services around the world, and the vast, vast, vast majority of that is positive.' Clegg's defense is alsoan admission[28]that Facebook is too large to safely manage. Are you too big to protect your platform from hate speech and socially divisive messaging?  Q: As we saw in the 2016 elections, Facebook's powercan be exploited[29]to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda, and inspire deadly hate campaigns around the globe. Facebook is an algorithmic rage machine that perpetuates conspiracy theories (including that vitamins will protect you from Covid) at a far greater rate than truth. Enragement is engagement. Nearly half of all top-performing posts that mention voting by mail arefalse or misleading[30]. What good are you offering your users that outweighs the cyberwar Russia fought on your platform, and that it is prepared to fight again, the systematic surveillance of users, and the torrent of misinformation on your platform?  Q: Teen suicide has skyrocketed \u2014 up 77% for older teen girls and up 151% for younger teens. Hospital admissions due to self-harm are up 50% for 15-19-year-old girls and up 200% for 10-14-year-old girls. Gen Z is on the brink of theworst[31]mental health crisis in decades. Do you think platforms like Instagram, where girls perpetually feel their appearance doesn't match up to filtered images, has something to do with this mental health crisis?  Q: Mr. Zuckerberg, you are in sole control of a platform whose algorithms select and deliver content (news and entertainment) to2.6 billion[32]people. Your algorithms are opaque to government agencies. You are the principal source of information for a cohort larger than any country orreligion[33]\u2014 a population greater than that of China and the US, combined. You cannot be removed from office, and will likely control these algorithms for the next 5-7 decades. So, we'd like to get to know you better. You know, get a feel for the real Mark Zuckerberg. A couple of questions:  Are you a pathologicalliar[34]?  Do you display alack[35]of remorse or guilt?  And again  Are you a pathologicalliar[36]?  Life is so rich,   P.S . More about my take on the hearings (or at least, more entertaining) on this week'sProf G Show[37].

Authored by Professor Scott Galloway via ProfGalloway.com,[3]  The CEOs of Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google are scheduled to testify in front of the US House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee later today. Some thoughts  Big tech has won before the hearing starts. Agreeing to let all four testify concurrently inhibits the committee's ability to go deep on any one issue, and will leave the American public with a sentiment instead of a viewpoint on big tech, much less any conclusions (such as, that the Obama DOJ was asleep at the switch, and Instagram and Whatsapp should be divested). The Covid-inspired remote format dramatically lessens the likelihood of an unscripted moment that reveals something the American public didn't previously know. Fabric softener for tough questioning is the deep pockets that keep members in power. </p><p>   When the show starts, Zuck will be the target of the most ire, as he's an oligarch minus the charm. Bezos, on the other hand, will receive the least ire, as his command of soft power is second only to China. Being on these committees must be just awesome, as every member clings to their office as if they were Puerto Rican rescue dogs clinging to lamb lung fillet. (I see this with my dog Gangster. It's a moment that gives you pause to see how much a living thing can love something else.)  Bezos has the power to take away the committee's lamb treats (he owns a powerful arbiter in theWaPo) and, maybe more important, they want invites to the best parties in DC (low bar) at the old textile museum\u2014 Bezos's man cave in Kalorama. I think Bezos lacks character and code (he gamifies the commonwealth for his own enrichment #HQ2), but I'd love to roll with him, and so would every first ballot hall of lame panelist questioning him at the hearings. Cook and Pichai will likely just try to stay out of the line of fire and fawning for Zuck and Bezos, respectively. Expect Zuck to use two words repeatedly in his defense (tik and tok[4]) as he attempts to wrap himself in the flag and convince the committee that he's our national champion, singularly able to repel the invading Chinese coming for our children.  But there is hope. By limiting the hearing to the antitrust subcommittee, the House gives more time to representatives who have domain expertise. The sharpest of these embers, if they take the right approach, may be able to move the needle from apathy towards outrage and build momentum for future change.  The key here is to recognize the mediumisthe message. Exploit the one attribute of the format that can be much improved: visuals. These always look awkward and very fifties during live testimony, though Representative Katie Porter does a great job with her mini white boards (note to self: get one). The 'share screen' function should be the weapon of choice here. Words will communicate themes (you're too big and abuse your monopoly power, which suppresses innovation, job growth, and the economy). Little is new here, but points can be communicated more effectively than before. The best opportunity to yield insight into why big tech should be broken up is to highlight the scale of the firms, and the problem. The winning cocktail is visuals and proportion.  The effective panelists at these hearings use the witness as a prop to stamp their passport on the way to the destination (you're a monopoly). The strategy is simple: ask a question, share screen/visual, unshare so public can see an awkward reaction by witness, allow 5 seconds max for answer, interrupt, and wash/rinse/repeat.  So, as I'm hoping to be unanimously approved as US Ambassador to Australia in the Biden Administration (#itcouldhappen), here are my suggestions for visuals and questions:  All Four  Q: Messrs. Bezos, Cook, Pichai, Zuckerberg, your firms have added greater market capitalization in the last five years than the largest retailers and CPG firms have in total. This is a large portion of the entire consumer economy. If you were public servants, would you be concerned that too many of the spoils are being registered by increasingly fewer firms and people?    Q: Your market capitalization per employee is thousands of times higher than that of other companies in your sectors. Do you think your companies contribute to income inequality?    Q: Since the onset of the pandemic, nearly every sector, other than big tech and companies deemed too big to fail, has shed substantial value. Instead, since the beginning of the year, your firms and Microsoft have increased in value by an average of 35%, while the remaining 495 firms in the S&amp;#38;P 500 are down 5%. Every firm, sector, and economy appears to have incurred a transfer in value and power to your firms. Should we be concerned that your considerable advantage pre-Covid is now unassailable?    Q: Small business formation is at a multi-decadelow[5]. The fastest-growing sectors receive scant funding from investors. Why should someone invest in a search engine right now, or a music streaming business, or a social media platform, or an e-commerce firm, given the sizes of your companies?    Apple  Q: Mr. Cook,monopoly rentis when a monopoly producer lacks competition and thus can sell its goods and services at a price far above what the otherwise competitive market price would be, at the expense of consumers. Our information age is often called 'the app economy,' denoting how important apps have become to commerce and consumption. Your firm and Google dominate the app ecosystem, with62% and 38%[6]shares, respectively. This chart shows the rents you are able to extract from every streaming video app. Every media company that wants to reach a consumer online must pay you a toll or rent. Do you think any of these firms believe that paying you this rent is a choice?    Q: Apple TV+ is offering consumers $1 billion in original content for every .80c a month the consumer spends on your Apple TV+ streaming video service. Isn't it your opportunity to differentiate your $1,300 phones and fund Apple TV+ from the revenues of an unrelated product that allows you to offer a media product at well below cost? In sum, isn't Apple guilty of 'dumping,' that is, buying market share with unfeasibly low prices?    Q: Spotify is consistently rated as a superior music service to your Apple Music, yet Apple Music is growingfaster[7]than Spotify in the US. Isn't this a function of you owning the rails, and being able to levy a30%[8]tax on a competitor while illegallyreducing[9]their discoverability in the app store?    Amazon  Q: Mr. Bezos, you are the wealthiest person in the world. Your wealth exceeds the GDP of Kuwait and Luxembourg, combined. It exceeds the defense budgets of Israel, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, combined. A common feature among the other wealthiest Americans of the 20th century (Rockefeller, Morgan, Mellon, Carnegie, Gates) is that most/all of these men presided over firms that were eventually tried for monopoly abuse and deemed monopolies. Why should we believe your wealth accumulation is any different?    Q: Last year, Amazon paid $162 million in federal tax while your largest competitor, Walmart, paid almost $3 billion. Do you think this level of participation in our country's infrastructure and services is appropriate for a company worth $1.5 trillion?    Q: Due to Covid-19, US consumers are expected to spend an additional $41 billion on retail ecommerce in 2020. Since you control38%[10]of US e-commerce revenue, doesn't this mean that you've added at least $16 billion in topline revenue due to Covid while thousands of small businesses havefolded[11]?    Q: In a five-week period during the pandemic, your firm added the value of the world's largest firm by revenue \u2014Walmart[12]. If your firm can accrete the value of the largest firm in the world in five weeks, and money is power, then isn't your firm the most powerful private entity in history? Hasn't your firm reached a level of soft and economic power well beyond the point when the DOJ has historically taken antitrust action?    Q: Our understanding is your firm has more full-time lobbyists in Washington than there are sitting US senators. Are you aware of any retailer or tech firm, other than Google, that has this manylobbyists[13]attempting to suppress regulation or antitrust action?    Q: Mr. Bezos,82%[14]of American homes have Amazon Prime, more than voted in the 2016 election, have a pet, attend church, or decorate a Christmas tree. Can you name any other firm that has a recurring revenue relationship with 8 out of 10 households?    Q: Your video content, as registered by IMDB and the National Academy of Television Arts &amp;#38; Sciences, is far inferior to the content offered by AT&amp;#38;T's division (HBO), yet you refuse to distribute HBO Max as a stand-alone offering on your service. Doesn't this mean you are leveraging your distribution power to weaken the competition (HBO Max[15]) and reduce consumer access to better content?    Q: Mr. Bezos, the recently released TOS for your audio and podcast platformsay[16]that participants on the service cannot say anything bad about Amazon. Are we to assume that all assets you control, includingThe Washington Post, are restricted to only positive comments regarding you and your firm?  Google    Q: Google owns the dominant digital ad server, DoubleClick Ad Exchange, or AdX. Over90%[17]of large publishers sell their ad inventory on AdX. And Google owns the dominant tool, Google Ads, through which advertisers purchase inventory on AdX. Don't you think controlling both the auction house for ad space and the main auction participant for buying those ad spaces allows Google to engage in anticompetitive pricing?  Q: You've been finedthree[18]times by the EU for acting in ways that harm competition. Google searchesfavor[19]YouTube ahead of other video rivals. Searches often display results just under the question as the user types, making it unnecessary to click any links. This deprives other firms of revenue. You present search resultsas you see fit[20], independent of the cost to other businesses. Don't you think having 71% share in the search business and increasingly locking other companies out of profits through search is unfair use of monopoly power?    Q: YouTube has come under criticism many times in the past for radicalizing our children through an algorithm that suggests increasingly violent and extreme content. A user can start out with 'downtown NYC' and within three videos they are being offeredconspiracy[21]theories about how 9/11 was an inside job. One of your former engineers accused YouTube ofperverting civic discussion[22]through radicalizing algorithms. Don't you think that if YouTube were its own company and had more competitors of similar size, that it would be forced to work harder to correct these algorithms that are so toxic to the public good? If the best corrective mechanism of a free market is competition, where is the competition to force you to do better?  Q: Mr. Pichai, can you name any other firm, anywhere in the world, that has this level of market share of a sector greater than $100 billion in size?      Facebook  Q: Mr. Zuckerberg, a Princeton Universitystudy[23]of Americans' internet habits leading up to the 2016 presidential election found that Facebook led users to untrustworthy news sites 15% of the time, and to trustworthy news sites only 6% of the time. Studies have also found that the underlying Facebook algorithm, which promotes emotion and outrage, benefitted Trump more than Clinton. Do you feel partially responsible for the erosion in the sanctity of our elections?    Q: This summer, a number of Facebook's biggest advertisers announced a boycott of the platform in response to your inadequate handling of hate speech. In response, Nick Clegg, your Vice President for Public Affairs, said, 'We've made huge strides But, you know, on an average day, there are 115 billion messages sent on our services around the world, and the vast, vast, vast majority of that is positive.' Clegg's defense is alsoan admission[24]that Facebook is too large to safely manage. Are you too big to protect your platform from hate speech and socially divisive messaging?  Q: As we saw in the 2016 elections, Facebook's powercan be exploited[25]to disrupt elections, broadcast viral propaganda, and inspire deadly hate campaigns around the globe. Facebook is an algorithmic rage machine that perpetuates conspiracy theories (including that vitamins will protect you from Covid) at a far greater rate than truth. Enragement is engagement. Nearly half of all top-performing posts that mention voting by mail arefalse or misleading[26]. What good are you offering your users that outweighs the cyberwar Russia fought on your platform, and that it is prepared to fight again, the systematic surveillance of users, and the torrent of misinformation on your platform?  Q: Teen suicide has skyrocketed \u2014 up 77% for older teen girls and up 151% for younger teens. Hospital admissions due to self-harm are up 50% for 15-19-year-old girls and up 200% for 10-14-year-old girls. Gen Z is on the brink of theworst[27]mental health crisis in decades. Do you think platforms like Instagram, where girls perpetually feel their appearance doesn't match up to filtered images, has something to do with this mental health crisis?  Q: Mr. Zuckerberg, you are in sole control of a platform whose algorithms select and deliver content (news and entertainment) to2.6 billion[28]people. Your algorithms are opaque to government agencies. You are the principal source of information for a cohort larger than any country orreligion[29]\u2014 a population greater than that of China and the US, combined. You cannot be removed from office, and will likely control these algorithms for the next 5-7 decades. So, we'd like to get to know you better. You know, get a feel for the real Mark Zuckerberg. A couple of questions:  Are you a pathologicalliar[30]?  Do you display alack[31]of remorse or guilt?  And again  Are you a pathologicalliar[32]?

Mr Clode said: \"Quality consumer companies trade on the same multiples as a lot of these tech stocks. We look at a company where we have an upside to earnings expectations, and you're not having to pay for it, and it happens to be a tech company.\"</p><p>                     Fangs                   </p><p>Much of the attention is inevitably focused on Fangs - Facebook, Apple, Netflix and Google (although that acronym is changing to include Microsoft and Alphabet). Rather than going on \"hype and expectation\", Mr Clode said that his team goes where they think \"growth potential is underestimated, and we think in five years' time they will still have growth\". </p><p>\"We're not going to build it up and then pull out. Who knows if you're going to get [that type of investment] right. We're trying to reduce the volatility of clients investing in tech; clients who have wanted to invest in tech but don't want to have the very volatile up and down years.\"</p><p>The funds he helps to run invest in Facebook, because despite the recent setbacks and the potential for regulation, it still has plenty of long term potential. Even though the stock fell 10 per cent following the Cambridge Analytica revelations, and potential regulatory implications, it rose 55 per cent last year.</p><p>He said: \"WhatsApp [which is owned by Facebook] is the biggest messaging site in India. We still think they have a good position of user growth. And they still haven't monetised heavily in Europe - we still think they've got some levers to pull. In the US they've gone a bit overboard, but they still have some levers.</p><p>\"Netflix has been a relatively cleaner story. It hasn't been targeted by [US president] Donald Trump in a tweet - we think it's a fantastic company.\" However, the company has high valuations so Mr Clode does not think it is worth buying into that stock.</p><p>The funds have about a 20 to 25 per cent turnover, with the entire fund turning over every four to five years. Mr Clode tends not to be very reactive to a stock if it is poorly performing: \"If you don't think the investment case is broken then you wouldn't sell it.</p><p>\"If you were in a Russian stock and they invaded Crimea and you think this is good long-term, but they face sanctions then you're forced to sell it.\"</p><p>Both funds have 50 stocks. \"Running a tech fund, we understand the obsession with Fang. We don't invest in all of them, only because we thought all of these other stocks were underappreciated. We thought it's paying too much for Netflix but we hold the others because we thought there was a good investment case. There are a lot of exciting tech stocks that have created a great return for us.\"</p><p>A lot of the big tech stocks are about to benefit from a beneficial tax regime, which means many of them will be bringing a large amount of cash onshore, putting it on their balance sheet, and some may be distributing it to shareholders. Apple's intended dividend means its share price has held up well despite the recent trouble with the iPhone X, which had production issues relating to the Face ID.</p><p>In addition, Mr Clode is interested in the less flashy tech stocks, such as Microsoft and Intel, as tax breaks are also encouraging firms to invest in IT infrastructure that they may have been putting off for a few years.</p><p>Mr Clode said: \"These are the stocks that are beating earnings and they're not expected to beat earnings. If they can beat earnings they should go up.\" The trick is finding stocks where the market has not already priced in a rise, if the manager expects good news: \"That's what keeps us in a job\".</p><p>                     Outlook                    </p><p>Looking to the future, Mr Clode said, was a near impossible task. \"Technology moves exponentially, it doesn't go one step at a time. It's very hard for us to [imagine] where it's going to go. There's no pathway to machine intelligence and super intelligent robots. Maybe there will be a breakthrough that creates the algorithm and learns like a baby.\" </p><p>It is impossible to say where processing power will be in the future, he said, so who knows where computing will take us.</p><p>                     Melanie Tringham is features editor at Financial Adviser                   </p><p>Richard Clode's Career Highlights</p><p>2014 - present: Portfolio manager, technology equities, Janus Henderson Investors </p><p>2012: Emerging markets research portfolio manager/technology analyst, Pioneer Investments</p><p>2010: Asian equity long/short technology analyst, Moore Capital</p><p>2007: Emerging markets technology analyst, Gartmore Asset Management</p><p>2003: Asian technology portfolio manager, Herald Investment Management</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTAONL-43961838</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTAONL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SBD-JRB1-JCJY-G1KM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459690</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"896\"/><timeReceived>11:46 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>FTAdviser.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59853\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 16, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0004GSA</classCode><className>HENDERSON INVESTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp;

Moody's estimates there are about 4000 fintech start-ups globally and investment in the sector has exploded from $2.4 billion to $19bn over the past four years.</p><p>A more defined regulatory stance would crystallise, and perhaps change, the rules of engagement between fintechs and traditional banks, Mr Williams said.\"And a killer app or the entrance of one or more Big Tech players, with large customer bases and deep pockets, could quickly shift the financial services landscape.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-The Australian20160520Australian22000153396951</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JTD-J9G1-JD3N-54XX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"625\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>May 20, 2016 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002GHH</classCode><className>COMMONWEALTH BANK OF AUSTRALIA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS524113 DIRECT LIFE INSURANCE CARRIERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS523110 INVESTMENT BANKING &amp;

Uber earns money by claiming a percentage of shipping fees--and the company says its take is significantly lower than the fees charged by traditional freight brokers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But no one, including Uber, thinks it will be able to conquer the freight industry simply by replicating its ride-hailing playbook. And Uber faces lots of competitors trying to claim their own piece of the action.</p><p>A wave of companies, including some in Indianapolis, are launching freight-related apps in hopes of making money by helping to streamline a huge and fragmented industry. Those players include Indianapolis-based tech startup Freight-Rover and freight broker Spot Freight Inc.</p><p>\"This didn't used to be a sexy industry and now it's the talk of the town,\" said Jeff Ogren, head of driver community and partnerships at Uber Freight. \"Everyone's paying very close attention to technology in this space because they understand the opportunity.\"</p><p>According to Virginia-based American Trucking Association, trucks carried 10.5 billion tons of freight in 2015, generating $726.4 billion in gross freight revenue. And more than 90 percent of U.S. carriers are small companies that operate fleets of six or fewer trucks.</p><p>In comparison, Ogren said, the pre-UberU.S. taxi industry was just a $20 billion industry.</p><p>Indianapolis attorney Greg Feary, a partner in the transportation law firm Scopelitis Garvin Light Hanson &amp; Feary PC, said his firm has counseled \"quite a few\" companies working on freight-based apps. Some are startups, Feary said, while others are traditional freight companies.</p><p>Why the boom in freight apps? \"In part, I think it's because of Uber's success\" in the taxi industry, he said.</p><p>But taxis and trucks are different, Feary added. \"The hurdles to moving freight from point A to point B, I think, are different--more significant, more substantial.\"</p><p>The freight industry is governed by a host of regulations that cover everything from driver qualifications to liability, and states can impose their own laws for shipments within their borders.</p><p>Labor-supply issues are also vastly different in the two industries, pointed out Ananth Iyer, the Susan Bulkeley Butler chair in operations management at Purdue University's Krannert School of Management.</p><p>Uber revolutionized the taxi industry, Iyer said, because its app created a much larger pool of people interested in driving for pay. That drove fares down industry-wide.</p><p>In contrast, he said, the trucking industry is facing a long-standing shortage of drivers, who must have proper training and qualifications in order to pilot the large rigs Uber Freight is targeting.</p><p>Iyer said he is not sure how Uber's model could work without luring in new truckers. \"It's not clear what Uber will do if new capacity were not added,\" he said.</p><p>Cultural shift</p><p>Cultural considerations are also a concern.</p><p>Uber's app is built around no-haggle pricing. Drivers can browse through listings of available loads, each one labeled with the amount the driver will earn from hauling it. This is a departure from tradition, where carriers and shippers typically arrive at shipping prices through negotiation.</p><p>Uber Freight is targeting smaller owner/ operators with 10 trucks or fewer, Ogren said. The app is intended to make drivers' lives easier by reducing the time they spend searching industry load boards and negotiating freight prices, he said.</p><p>Spot Freight's national account manager, Theo Mascari, said he's not sure a no-haggle pricing model will work.</p><p>Shipping fees can vary for a number of factors, including time-sensitivity, Mascari said, and negotiations are part of how business gets done. If a load is priced too low with no room for haggling, it won't get picked up.</p><p>Spot Freight is working on its own app, which is in beta testing now and should be finished by the end of September, he said. The app will allow carriers and drivers to browse available loads and book them directly without having to call Spot Freight as they do now. Spot's app will include shipping fees for each load, he said, but it will also include a \"bid tool\" option for drivers who want to try to negotiate a higher rate.</p><p>Mascari said he's confident in Spot's track record and is not concerned that Uber Freight or other competitors will hurt its business.</p><p>Another cultural reality: Trucking is not as highly computerized as some industries, which means convincing drivers to use an app might be a challenge.</p><p>\"Everything has been very manual,\" Mascari said.</p><p>For example, truckers are still allowed to log their hours using paper records, though that will change in December when the U.S. Department of Transportation mandates the use of electronic logging devices.</p><p>With that in mind, Ogren said Uber Freight is treading carefully and has hired some industry insiders to help build trust among drivers and educate them about how and why they should use the app.</p><p>\"We have to go about it in the way that the industry's ready for us to go about it,\" he said. \"They've been doing it the same way for so long. You can't just say, 'Hey guys, download this app and it'll change your whole life.'\"</p><p>Homegrown</p><p>Indianapolis-based FreightRover says it's also putting efforts into education.</p><p>The company describes its app, launched in January, as a freight exchange and management app that addresses multiple needs. Through the app, users can book and track loads, manage paperwork, and send messages, among other uses.</p><p>It's a different approach in a world where many drivers still use faxes or snail mail to submit required documents, said Mamie Silver, FreightRover's marketing and design manager.</p><p>\"It's difficult to convince people who have been using one way for so long that we can help them instead of making their life more difficult,\" Silver said.</p><p>To overcome the challenge, she said, FreightRover representatives have been spending time, sometimes over multiple sessions, to explain the app to potential customers.</p><p>FreightRover began its life as a project of Indianapolis-based Celadon Group Inc., which wanted to develop an internal freight app for its own drivers. After realizing the app's potential, Celadon decided in 2015 to make it into something that could be sold to other carriers, Silver said.</p><p>After former Celadon executive Eric Meek left that company in April, he purchased Prosair Technologies LLC, the Celadon subsidiary that developed FreightRover. Meek now serves as FreightRover's CEO and president.</p><p>The now-independent company is in hiring mode and its staff currently includes 16 managers and department heads, Silver said.</p><p>FreightRover's target customers are midsize and large carriers and shippers. Currently, Celadon is the company's only paying customer, Silver said, but FreightRover is doing demo work with two other prospects--a carrier and a shipper whom she declined to name--that are expected to become customers within a few weeks.</p><p>Silver said FreightRover expects to reach profitability in six to 12 months. \"We have multiple potential customers jumping at the gate to get started with this.\"</p><p>Uber declined to share information about how many users have signed up to use its freight app.</p><p>It's too early to tell how much of an impact apps might have on the freight industry or whether Uber will make as big a splash as it did in the taxi industry. Even Purdue's Iyer acknowledged that his skepticism about Uber Freight might be off-base because it's difficult to predict the future.</p><p>\"This is just a hunch,\" Iyer said of his reservations.</p><p>Ogren said Uber believes its experience and size give it an edge over competitors. \"We think we have the playbook to innovate and change this industry.\"</p><p>At the same time, he said, the freight industry might well be large enough for multiple players to succeed.</p><p>Silver, too, sees room for a variety of successful apps that address different challenges. \"It would be naive to say that there's only one solution to a problem that has so many different facets.\"</p><p>Uber Freight app</p><p>What it does: connects shippers with truckers who are looking for loads to haul</p><p>Target market: independent owner/operator truckers</p><p>History: Launched in \"stealth mode\" in Texas last fall, with an official launch there in May.</p><p>Expansion: Launched this month in six new markets: Chicago/Midwest (including Indianapolis), Arizona, California, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.</p><p>Freight locations: Most loads are currently in Texas, but Uber says that should change over the next few months as the new markets develop.</p><p>Something different: Drivers are offered a set price per load, with no haggling. This is a departure for an industry in which parties typically negotiate the price.</p><p>FreightRover app</p><p>What it does: allows users to post, book and track loads; manage paperwork; send messages; and handle other functions</p><p>Target market: midsize and larger carriers and shippers</p><p>Company address: 155 E. Market St.</p><p>President and CEO: Eric Meek</p><p>History: Began as a project of Indianapolis-based trucking company Celadon Group Inc. When Meek left Celadon in April, he purchased Prosair Technologies LLC, the Celadon subsidiary that developed FreightRover. FreightRover is now a separate company.</p><p>Sources: Uber Freight, FreightRover, IBJ research</p><p>By Susan Orr</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sorr@ibj.com\">sorr@ibj.com</email></p><p>Caption: Ogren</p><p>Caption: Feary</p><p>Caption: Iyer</p><p>Caption: Mascari</p><p>Caption: Silver</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INBUJO-503639995</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 503639995</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PFY-J221-JCBJ-K24S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433198</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1614\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2017 Indianapolis Business Journal Corp.

The founder and chief executive of PopSockets, a Colorado company that makes a widely popular kickstand of sorts for smartphones, says he isn't even an 'expert on antitrust laws' in Washington.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Barnett discovered firsthand the rare power and influence of Amazon in 2018, after clashing with the e-commerce giant over policies that made it hard to sell his products on his preferred terms and prices. PopSockets soon terminated its ties with Amazon, which helped lead to sizable losses later.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'What company that started a business out of their garage can afford to lose $10-million?' he asked in an interview. 'We're lucky we're in a position we're profitable and could take a stand.'</p><p>Barnett's story could resonate with federal regulators: Such tales of Big Tech's debatably brash, bullying tactics are set to take center stage when he and his corporate peers testify at a high-profile congressional hearing Friday. The session could elicit the most convincing public evidence to date that Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google have become too big and powerful \" and need to be restrained.</p><p>Since June, House lawmakers led by Democratic Rep. David N. Cicilline (R.I.) have trained their sights on the four tech giants, exploring their ascendancy as the world's most popular and profitable online services. Even in a capital wracked by partisanship, Democrats and Republicans have come to share heightened concerns the industry's biggest players may have stifled competition, enriched themselves on Americans' personal data or locked in their digital dominance unlawfully.</p><p>The hearing \" held not far from PopSockets' headquarters in Boulder \" could ultimately serve to put a new, personal face on long-standing calls for tech titans to be regulated, penalized or broken up, galvanizing those that believe Congress needs to toughen federal antitrust laws to prevent abuse.</p><p>'You think about the market share that some of these platforms have,' Cicilline said. 'You change an algorithm, you exclude someone from a platform, and you can put them out of business.'</p><p>Along with PopSockets, lawmakers are set to hear from top executives at Sonos, a high-end audio company, and Basecamp, which makes collaborative workplace software. Both allege Google undermines smaller rivals. Sonos has also sued Google, alleging patent infringement.</p><p>Joining those witnesses will be a senior official from Tile, best known for its technology that helps people track keys, wallets and other objects they're liable to lose around the house. Company officials contend Apple's software tweaks stifle competing services.</p><p>Ahead of the hearing, tech giants vigorously defended their practices. Amazon in a statement said its seller rules benefit consumers, and it took issue with PopSockets and some of its claims. Google said that its ad policies are fair and that it never infringed on Sonos technology. And Apple pointed to past comments saying it seeks to protect consumer privacy through its software updates, not undermine rivals. Facebook did not comment.</p><p>(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>The bipartisan congressional inquiry illustrates the precarious regulatory environment that now looms over Silicon Valley, once the darling of a tech-obsessed Washington. The industry's rapid rise and record-breaking profits, long heralded as an engine of American economic growth, now are seen as evidence of the dangers of corporate consolidation.</p><p>In response, federal antitrust regulators have started to ponder action: The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission last year divvied up competition oversight of the country's top tech companies. Nearly every state attorney general, meanwhile, has banded together for wide-ranging probes targeting Facebook and Google. And Cicilline, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust-focused subcommittee, has spent seven months leading the panel as it peers under the hood of Big Tech.</p><p>So far, members of Congress have obtained millions of documents with the goal of putting forward bipartisan recommendations in the next few months. Cicilline said this week lawmakers soon also seek to question 'the CEOs of some of the major technology companies,' threatening an uncomfortable public grilling for Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google.</p><p>The tech industry's top lobbyists say they understand the scrutiny. But they disagree vehemently with those that say consumers have suffered and tech companies should be broken up as a result.</p><p>'There's no question that the disruptive innovations have created some winners and losers,' said Matt Schruers, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which represents Amazon, Facebook and Google. 'I don't think there's any doubt members of Congress are hearing from those who have been on the losing side of some of these disruptive innovations, but consumer response to these products speaks for itself.'</p><p>Not everyone sees it that way.</p><p>Tile long had benefited from Apple's good graces: The company behind those tiny trackers for your most important possessions even had a rare shout-out onstage at the iPhone giant's annual developer conference in 2018.</p><p>But the relationship soured as Apple inched closer toward rolling out a tool \" built into its smartphone operating system \" that seemed like 'something that's going to resemble our service,' Kirsten Daru, Tile's general counsel, recalled in an interview ahead of her testimony Friday.</p><p>The result was 'Find My,' an enhanced effort by Apple to help its customers better locate their lost devices. Not only does it mimic many of the features long offered by Tile, it also has a major advantage: Apple turned on the location tracking that makes 'Find My' functional by default. Rivals such as Tile, meanwhile, must obtain users' permission in deep, hard-to-find smartphone settings, Daru said, then reauthorize it when presented with  follow-up reminders.</p><p>Apple said the changes are about protecting privacy, citing a need to prevent app makers from using consumers' data without their knowledge. 'Apple has not built a business model around knowing a customer's location or the location of their device,' spokesman Fred Sainz said in a statement.</p><p>But Tile said the changes for now have resulted in a 'confusing and frustrating experience for our users,' according to Daru, adding: 'We're looking to Congress to level the playing field.'</p><p>David Heinemeier Hansson has a similar message for lawmakers. The well-known programmer and co-founder of Basecamp, which offers Web-based product management tools, said he plans to stress Friday that it's time for regulators to 'broaden your definition of what antitrust enforcement is.'</p><p>For Basecamp, the trouble centers on Google's dominant search engine, which aided the tech giant in amassing $117-billion in ad revenue in 2018. Its competitors have been purchasing ads on Google against Basecamp's own name, he said, meaning people who search for Hansson's company see rivals unless they scroll down their results page. To Hansson, it means Google requires companies 'to pay protection money' \" or risk obscurity.</p><p>'They built their monopoly by having a great search engine\u00e2\u20ac\u0161' he said. 'Now that they have that monopoly, they're exploiting it to reap monopoly profits.'</p><p>In response, Google spokesman Jose Castaneda rebuffed Basecamp's claims. He said competitors are allowed to 'bid on trademarked terms because it offers users more choice when they are searching,' but he added Google will remove their names from text if they file a complaint.</p><p>By airing their criticisms publicly, many of Big Tech's biggest challengers now seek to change the political calculus. Scores of companies long have been willing to grouse about their bigger tech brethren only privately, afraid of squandering much-needed relationships or scaring off investors wary of open warfare.</p><p>But renewed antitrust interest in Washington has some corporate boardrooms rethinking their plans as they labor to attract the attention of regulators who say they are ready to do something about it. The troubles aired at the hearing Friday could later shape state and federal probes, leading to significant penalties, lawmakers and experts said.</p><p>'I don't think we've ever faced a situation where there's such a small group of companies with such unprecedented size, scale and dominance,' said Patrick Spence, the chief executive of Sonos.</p><p>This month, the audio company revealed in court documents it is suing Google, alleging the search giant copied its technology. Google has denied the charge and this week claimed Sonos has made 'misleading statements.' But Spence said Google's behavior reflects a culture where big companies are 'doing the math' and determining they can act as they please and survive the punishment.

The founder and chief executive of PopSockets, a Colorado company that makes a widely popular kickstand of sorts for smartphones, says he isn't even an 'expert on antitrust laws' in Washington.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Barnett discovered firsthand the rare power and influence of Amazon in 2018, after clashing with the e-commerce giant over policies that made it hard to sell his products on his preferred terms and prices. PopSockets soon terminated its ties with Amazon, which helped lead to sizable losses later.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'What company that started a business out of their garage can afford to lose $10-million?' he asked in an interview. 'We're lucky we're in a position we're profitable and could take a stand.'</p><p>Barnett's story could resonate with federal regulators: Such tales of Big Tech's debatably brash, bullying tactics are set to take center stage when he and his corporate peers testify at a high-profile congressional hearing Friday. The session could elicit the most convincing public evidence to date that Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google have become too big and powerful \" and need to be restrained.</p><p>Since June, House lawmakers led by Democratic Rep. David N. Cicilline (R.I.) have trained their sights on the four tech giants, exploring their ascendancy as the world's most popular and profitable online services. Even in a capital wracked by partisanship, Democrats and Republicans have come to share heightened concerns the industry's biggest players may have stifled competition, enriched themselves on Americans' personal data or locked in their digital dominance unlawfully.</p><p>The hearing \" held not far from PopSockets' headquarters in Boulder \" could ultimately serve to put a new, personal face on long-standing calls for tech titans to be regulated, penalized or broken up, galvanizing those that believe Congress needs to toughen federal antitrust laws to prevent abuse.</p><p>'You think about the market share that some of these platforms have,' Cicilline said. 'You change an algorithm, you exclude someone from a platform, and you can put them out of business.'</p><p>Along with PopSockets, lawmakers are set to hear from top executives at Sonos, a high-end audio company, and Basecamp, which makes collaborative workplace software. Both allege Google undermines smaller rivals. Sonos has also sued Google, alleging patent infringement.</p><p>Joining those witnesses will be a senior official from Tile, best known for its technology that helps people track keys, wallets and other objects they're liable to lose around the house. Company officials contend Apple's software tweaks stifle competing services.</p><p>Ahead of the hearing, tech giants vigorously defended their practices. Amazon in a statement said its seller rules benefit consumers, and it took issue with PopSockets and some of its claims. Google said that its ad policies are fair and that it never infringed on Sonos technology. And Apple pointed to past comments saying it seeks to protect consumer privacy through its software updates, not undermine rivals. Facebook did not comment.</p><p>(Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)</p><p>The bipartisan congressional inquiry illustrates the precarious regulatory environment that now looms over Silicon Valley, once the darling of a tech-obsessed Washington. The industry's rapid rise and record-breaking profits, long heralded as an engine of American economic growth, now are seen as evidence of the dangers of corporate consolidation.</p><p>In response, federal antitrust regulators have started to ponder action: The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission last year divvied up competition oversight of the country's top tech companies. Nearly every state attorney general, meanwhile, has banded together for wide-ranging probes targeting Facebook and Google. And Cicilline, the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust-focused subcommittee, has spent seven months leading the panel as it peers under the hood of Big Tech.</p><p>So far, members of Congress have obtained millions of documents with the goal of putting forward bipartisan recommendations in the next few months. Cicilline said this week lawmakers soon also seek to question 'the CEOs of some of the major technology companies,' threatening an uncomfortable public grilling for Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google.</p><p>The tech industry's top lobbyists say they understand the scrutiny. But they disagree vehemently with those that say consumers have suffered and tech companies should be broken up as a result.</p><p>'There's no question that the disruptive innovations have created some winners and losers,' said Matt Schruers, president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, which represents Amazon, Facebook and Google. 'I don't think there's any doubt members of Congress are hearing from those who have been on the losing side of some of these disruptive innovations, but consumer response to these products speaks for itself.'</p><p>Not everyone sees it that way.</p><p>Tile long had benefited from Apple's good graces: The company behind those tiny trackers for your most important possessions even had a rare shout-out onstage at the iPhone giant's annual developer conference in 2018.</p><p>But the relationship soured as Apple inched closer toward rolling out a tool \" built into its smartphone operating system \" that seemed like 'something that's going to resemble our service,' Kirsten Daru, Tile's general counsel, recalled in an interview ahead of her testimony Friday.</p><p>The result was 'Find My,' an enhanced effort by Apple to help its customers better locate their lost devices. Not only does it mimic many of the features long offered by Tile, it also has a major advantage: Apple turned on the location tracking that makes 'Find My' functional by default. Rivals such as Tile, meanwhile, must obtain users' permission in deep, hard-to-find smartphone settings, Daru said, then reauthorize it when presented with  follow-up reminders.</p><p>Apple said the changes are about protecting privacy, citing a need to prevent app makers from using consumers' data without their knowledge. 'Apple has not built a business model around knowing a customer's location or the location of their device,' spokesman Fred Sainz said in a statement.</p><p>But Tile said the changes for now have resulted in a 'confusing and frustrating experience for our users,' according to Daru, adding: 'We're looking to Congress to level the playing field.'</p><p>David Heinemeier Hansson has a similar message for lawmakers. The well-known programmer and co-founder of Basecamp, which offers Web-based product management tools, said he plans to stress Friday that it's time for regulators to 'broaden your definition of what antitrust enforcement is.'</p><p>For Basecamp, the trouble centers on Google's dominant search engine, which aided the tech giant in amassing $117-billion in ad revenue in 2018. Its competitors have been purchasing ads on Google against Basecamp's own name, he said, meaning people who search for Hansson's company see rivals unless they scroll down their results page. To Hansson, it means Google requires companies 'to pay protection money' \" or risk obscurity.</p><p>'They built their monopoly by having a great search engine,' he said. 'Now that they have that monopoly, they're exploiting it to reap monopoly profits.'</p><p>In response, Google spokesman Jose Castaneda rebuffed Basecamp's claims. He said competitors are allowed to 'bid on trademarked terms because it offers users more choice when they are searching,' but he added Google will remove their names from text if they file a complaint.</p><p>By airing their criticisms publicly, many of Big Tech's biggest challengers now seek to change the political calculus. Scores of companies long have been willing to grouse about their bigger tech brethren only privately, afraid of squandering much-needed relationships or scaring off investors wary of open warfare.</p><p>But renewed antitrust interest in Washington has some corporate boardrooms rethinking their plans as they labor to attract the attention of regulators who say they are ready to do something about it. The troubles aired at the hearing Friday could later shape state and federal probes, leading to significant penalties, lawmakers and experts said.</p><p>'I don't think we've ever faced a situation where there's such a small group of companies with such unprecedented size, scale and dominance,' said Patrick Spence, the chief executive of Sonos.</p><p>This month, the audio company revealed in court documents it is suing Google, alleging the search giant copied its technology. Google has denied the charge and this week claimed Sonos has made 'misleading statements.' But Spence said Google's behavior reflects a culture where big companies are 'doing the math' and determining they can act as they please and survive the punishment. Sonos kept the standoff quiet for years, a sign to some about the fear of challenging the largest tech companies publicly.</p><p>'It might be life or death for them,' Spence said.</p><p>To the average Amazon shopper, it might not have seemed anything was amiss with PopSockets, either. Their small, circular handles, attached to the back of iPhones and Androids, were readily available on the e-commerce site.</p><p>But that obscured a lengthy, tense relationship between the two companies that later cost PopSockets millions of dollars, the company's leader said.</p><p>In its earlier days, PopSockets tried to get Amazon's attention about counterfeits sold there, only to be browbeaten by the tech giant into spending more on marketing, according to Barnett. Adding to the headaches, PopSockets fretted about changes to Amazon policies that essentially left it little choice but to sell directly to Amazon, which then determined the prices of the products it later sold to customers.</p><p>For its part, Amazon said this week the debacle stemmed from the fact PopSockets essentially ran afoul of its rules. Amazon will sell a company's products on their behalf, but it prohibits a firm from simultaneously selling through another intermediary that could later undercut the Seattle-based juggernaut on price.</p><p>'Amazon obsesses over our customer experience, and we have policies for brands to ensure they are consistently meeting customer expectations,' said Jack Evans, a spokesman at Amazon.</p><p>But Barnett said the restrictions proved too limiting.

BONASIA</nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Business executives are lined up to give government regulators an earful about their struggles and costs in trying to comply with strict new accounting rules, at a public hearing set for Wednesday in Washington, D.C.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Securities and Exchange Commission called the meeting to gather feedback on Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the toughest part of that landmark law. Congress passed the law after accounting scandals erupted at Enron, WorldCom and elsewhere.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The first phase of Section 404 took effect in November. The mandate requires that managers vouch for the accuracy of their financial results and for the \"controls\" or systems put in place to assure such accuracy. Chief executives and chief financial officers who fail to adhere to these new rules could face stiff fines or even prison terms.</p><p>Many companies say they've had troubles complying, and that might be an understatement.</p><p>\"It's a nightmare,\" said Mark Feldman, senior vice president of Virsa Systems. The Fremont, Calif.-based company makes compliance controls software.</p><p>Complying has cost companies more money than expected, and has been a drain on human resources, says Paul Hamerman, an analyst at Forrester Research.</p><p>The law doesn't clearly spell out how tech systems should be used to achieve compliance. Many information technology (IT) managers are scratching their heads as a result, says Hamerman.</p><p>\"This whole effort has been tremendously disruptive, both to the finance organization and to the IT organization,\" he said.</p><p>The first-year cost of Section 404 compliance averages $4.36 million per company, says Financial Executives International, a trade group of CFOs and controllers.</p><p>That's 39% higher than an FEI estimate last July.</p><p>Frank Brod, chairman of the FEI's corporate reporting committee, has urged the SEC to streamline the reporting process.</p><p>The FEI suggests that the SEC ease the guidelines while still protecting against the gravest threats.</p><p>Called Drag On Profits</p><p>In an open letter dated April 1 to SEC Secretary Jonathan Katz, Brod wrote, \"The compliance burden will be a drag on future corporate productivity and profitability.\"</p><p>Experts say one compliance hang-up often is a lack of cohesion between a company's tech and finance departments. They developed respective systems not realizing tough controls would be mandated.</p><p>Companies are scrambling to replace manual financial controls with centralized, automated software systems.</p><p>Many firms still manually download data from a jumble of spreadsheets, says Virsa's Feldman.</p><p>One problem is the new law surfaced at a time when many companies cut their IT staffs and budgets amid corporate belt-tightening. That's only made their jobs harder, says Feldman.</p><p>\"A lot of systems are not yet in place,\" he said. \"A lot of companies are starting from scratch.\"</p><p>Compliance is even taking a toll on employee morale, says a survey released Tuesday of 212 financial executives by Oversight Systems, a transaction monitoring software firm.</p><p>The survey found that 46% of the executives say the biggest challenge to sustaining Sarbanes-Oxley compliance is \"maintaining the morale of employees\" who are involved.</p><p>Audit controls might include systems to scan for duplicate payments to suppliers, to impose limits on purchase orders or to segregate duties so one person can't both approve payments and write checks.</p><p>\"CIOs are saying they need the ability to automate all these internal processes,\" said Feldman.</p><p>This issue is clearly top of mind for executives. A survey of 100 U.S. CIOs released this month by Smith Barney found that 100% of them cite compliance projects as a top priority this year.</p><p>May Hurt Job Creation</p><p>Another just-released poll, from management research firm Corporate Executive Board, says CFOs of public firms in the U.S. will devote one-fourth of their time to Section 404 matters this year.</p><p>Because finance chiefs are so occupied with Sarbanes-Oxley compliance, other parts of their companies could suffer so much as to cost the creation of as many as 300,000 jobs, says the CEB report. The new law also could slow gross domestic product growth by nearly 0.5% the next three years, says the report.</p><p>The CFO Executive Board, a unit of CEB, says nearly 300 companies have indicated they won't be able to file their 10-Ks on time this year because of Section 404 vs. 70 last year. The 10-K is the year-end financial report all publicly traded companies must file with the SEC.</p><p>Despite the industry's complaints, other surveys show that Sarbanes-Oxley has boosted investor confidence. Of 135 financial analysts polled by Virsa, 83% say corporate governance affects their investment decisions.</p><p>The survey found that 61% of analysts avoid certain stocks because of low governance ratings.</p><p>And 60% are willing to pay an average 10% premium on shares of firms that can confirm solid compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley.</p><p>But building compliance takes teamwork from across a company, says Michael Cooke, head of continuous monitoring technology for ACL Services. ACL of Vancouver, British Columbia, makes financial software.</p><p>Compliance project leaders must bridge business goals, auditing rules and tech systems, says Cooke.</p><p>\"Companies have concluded that the only way to build a sustainable process for ongoing compliance is to use technology,\" he said.</p><p>Technology, though, can't solve the problem without strong leadership from CEOs and CFOs, Cooke says.</p><p>\"If the tone at the top doesn't believe governance is important, then it doesn't matter what the rules are,\" he said. \"They're going to look for ways to get around the rules.\"</p><p>Some big tech firms aligned last month to form the Compliance and Management of Electronic Information Working Group to help government and businesses work together on laws. Founders include Oracle, Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems.</p><p>Was \"Wild, Wild West'</p><p>Formation of this group shows that Sarbanes-Oxley work is still evolving, says Bill Lyons, CEO of AXS-One, a records compliance management software firm based in Rutherford, N.J.</p><p>Before Section 404 was enacted, controllers operated in a \"wild, wild West environment,\" said Lyons. Now more boards and governance advocates are demanding \"corporate instant replays\" to prevent fiascoes such as Enron.</p><p>\"When audits occur, they want an honest representation of what happened,\" Lyons said. \"They want to efficiently capture and (have the ability to) search all those electronic records.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-1227924</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2005</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4FXX-1S70-01J8-W3PT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1064\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Investor's Business Daily</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2005 Investor's Business Daily, Inc. \u00a0  www.investors.com</copyright><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"04\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>April 13, 2005 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SAP SE\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>\u00a0VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>\u00a0ENRON CREDITORS RECOVERY CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>\u00a0FORRESTER RESEARCH INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SECURITIES &amp;

For his part, Commissioner Carr's thread makes the case that the members of the board are highly partisan and mostly left-wing and can't be trusted with the responsibility of oversight. While Senator Hawley took the approach that the Board's very existence is just further evidence of the need to break Facebook up.Both Hawley and Carr have been lauded in rightwing circles, but in reality their positions contradict conservative notions of the free speech and private property protections given by the First Amendment. This blog post serves as a sequel to a post I wrote last year here at TOTM explaining how There's nothing 'conservative' about Trump's views on free speech and the regulation of social media[3]. As I wrote there:I have noted in several[4] places[5] before that there is a conflict of visions[6] when it comes to whether the First Amendment protects a negative or positive conception of free speech. </p><p>For those unfamiliar with the distinction: it comes from philosopher Isaiah Berlin,[7] who identified negative liberty as freedom from external interference, and positive liberty as freedom to do something, including having the power and resources necessary to do that thing. Discussions of the First Amendment's protection of free speech often elide over this distinction.With respect to speech, the negative conception of liberty recognizes that individual property owners can control what is said on their property, for example. To force property owners to allow speakers/speech on their property that they don't desire would actually be a violation of their liberty \u2014 what the Supreme Court calls 'compelled speech.'[8] The First Amendment, consistent with this view, generally protects speech from government interference (with very few, narrow exceptions), while allowing private regulation of speech (again, with very few, narrow exceptions).Commissioner Carr's complaint and Senator Hawley's antitrust approach of breaking up Facebook has much more in common with the views traditionally held by left-wing Democrats on the need for the government to regulate private actors in order to promote speech interests. Originalists and law &amp;#38; economics scholars, on the other hand, have consistently taken the opposite point of view that the First Amendment protects against government infringement of speech interests, including protecting the right to editorial discretion. While there is clearly a conflict of visions in First Amendment jurisprudence, the conservative (and, in my view, correct) point of view should not be jettisoned by Republicans to achieve short-term political gains. The First Amendment restricts government action, not private action The First Amendment, by its very text, only applies to government action: 'Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.' This applies to the 'State[s]' through the Fourteenth Amendment. There is extreme difficulty in finding any textual hook to say the First Amendment protects against private action, like that of Facebook.Originalists have consistently agreed. Most recently, in Manhattan Community Access Corp. v. Halleck[9], Justice Kavanaugh\u2014on behalf of the conservative bloc and the Court\u2014wrote:Ratified in 1791, the First Amendment provides in relevant part that 'Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.' Ratified in 1868, the Fourteenth Amendment makes the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause applicable against the States: 'No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . .' 1. The text and original meaning of those Amendments, as well as this Court's longstanding precedents, establish that the Free Speech Clause prohibits only governmental abridgment of speech. The Free Speech Clause does not prohibit private abridgment of speech In accord with the text and structure of the Constitution, this Court's state-action doctrine distinguishes the government from individuals and private entities. By enforcing that constitutional boundary between the governmental and the private, the state-action doctrine protects a robust sphere of individual liberty. (Emphasis added).This was true at the adoption of the First Amendment and remains true today in a high-tech world. Federal district courts have consistently dismissed First Amendment lawsuits against Facebook on the grounds there is no state action.For instance, in Nyawba v. Facebook[10], the plaintiff initiated a civil rights lawsuit against Facebook for restricting his use of the platform. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas dismissed the case, notingBecause the First Amendment governs only governmental restrictions on speech, Nyabwa has not stated a cause of action against FaceBook Like his free speech claims, Nyabwa's claims for violation of his right of association and violation of his due process rights are claims that may be vindicated against governmental actors pursuant to  1983, but not a private entity such as FaceBook.Similarly, in Young v. Facebook[11], the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California rejected a claim that Facebook violated the First Amendment by deactivating the plaintiff's Facebook page. The court declined to subject Facebook to the First Amendment analysis, stating that 'because Young has not alleged any action under color of state law, she fails to state a claim under  1983.' The First Amendment restricts antitrust actions against Facebook, not Facebook's editorial discretion over its platform Far from restricting Facebook, the First Amendment actually restricts government actions aimed at platforms like Facebook when they engage in editorial discretion by moderating content. If an antitrust plaintiff was to act on the impulse to 'break up' Facebook because of alleged political bias in its editorial discretion, the lawsuit would be running headlong into the First Amendment's protections.There is no basis for concluding online platforms do not have editorial discretion under the law. In fact, the position of Facebook here is very similar to the newspaper in Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo[12], in which the Supreme Court considered a state law giving candidates for public office a right to reply in newspapers to editorials written about them. The Florida Supreme Court upheld the statute, finding it furthered the 'broad societal interest in the free flow of information to the public.' The U.S. Supreme Court, despite noting the level of concentration in the newspaper industry, nonetheless reversed. The Court explicitly found the newspaper had a First Amendment right to editorial discretion:The choice of material to go into a newspaper, and the decisions made as to limitations on the size and content of the paper, and treatment of public issues and public officials \u2014 whether fair or unfair \u2014 constitute the exercise of editorial control and judgment. It has yet to be demonstrated how governmental regulation of this crucial process can be exercised consistent with First Amendment guarantees of a free press as they have evolved to this time.Online platforms have the same First Amendment protections for editorial discretion. For instance, in both Search King v. Google[13] and Langdon v. Google[14], two different federal district courts ruled Google's search results are subject to First Amendment protections, both citing Tornillo.In Zhang v. Baidu.com[15], another district court went so far as to grant a Chinese search engine the right to editorial discretion in limiting access to democracy movements in China. The court found that the search engine 'inevitably make[s] editorial judgments about what information (or kinds of information) to include in the results and how and where to display that information.' Much like the search engine in Zhang, Facebook is clearly making editorial judgments about what information shows up in newsfeed and where to display it.None of this changes because the generally applicable law is antitrust rather than some other form of regulation. For instance, in Tornillo, the Supreme Court took pains to distinguish the case from an earlier antitrust case against newspapers, Associated Press v. United States[16], which found that there was no broad exemption from antitrust under the First Amendment.The Court foresaw the problems relating to government-enforced access as early as its decision in Associated Press v. United States, supra. There it carefully contrasted the private 'compulsion to print' called for by the Association's bylaws with the provisions of the District Court decree against appellants which 'does not compel AP or its members to permit publication of anything which their `reason' tells them should not be published.'In other words, the Tornillo and Associated Press establish the government may not compel speech through regulation, including an antitrust remedy.Once it is conceded that there is a speech interest here, the government must justify the use of antitrust law to compel Facebook to display the speech of users in the newsfeeds of others under the strict scrutiny test of the First Amendment. In other words, the use of antitrust law must be narrowly tailored to a compelling government interest. Even taking for granted that there may be a compelling government interest in facilitating a free and open platform (which is by no means certain), it is clear that this would not be narrowly tailored action.First, 'breaking up' Facebook is clearly overbroad as compared to the goal of promoting free speech on the platform. There is no need to break it up just because it has an Oversight Board that engages in editorial responsibilities. There are many less restrictive means, including market competition, which has greatly expanded consumer choice for communications and connections. Second, antitrust does not even really have a remedy for free speech issues complained of here, as it would require courts to engage in long-term oversight and engage in compelled speech foreclosed by Associated Press.Note that this makes good sense from a law &amp;#38; economics perspective. Platforms like Facebook should be free to regulate the speech on their platforms as they see fit and consumers are free to decide which platforms they wish to use based upon that information. While there are certainly network effects to social media, the plethora of options currently available with low switching costs suggests that there is no basis for antitrust action against Facebook because consumers are unable to speak. In other words, the least restrictive means test of the First Amendment is best fulfilled by market competition in this case.If there were a basis for antitrust intervention against Facebook, either through merger review or as a standalone monopoly claim, the underlying issue would be harm to competition. While this would have implications for speech concerns (which may be incorporated into an analysis through quality-adjusted price), it is inconceivable how an antitrust remedy could be formed on speech issues consistent with the First Amendment. Conclusion Despite now well-worn complaints by so-called conservatives in and out of the government about the baneful influence of Facebook and other Big Tech companies, the First Amendment forecloses government actions to violate the editorial discretion of these companies. Even if Commissioner Carr is right, this latest call for antitrust enforcement against Facebook by Senator Hawley should be rejected for principled conservative reasons. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F12%2Ffirst-amendment-conflict-of-visions-redux-the-case-of-facebooks-oversight-board-and-the-threat-of-antitrust-action%2F&amp;#38;linkname=First%20Amendment%20Conflict%20of%20Visions%20Redux%3A%20The%20Case%20of%20Facebook%E2%80%99s%20Oversight%20Board%20and%20the%20Threat%20of%20Antitrust%20Actionhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F12%2Ffirst-amendment-conflict-of-visions-redux-the-case-of-facebooks-oversight-board-and-the-threat-of-antitrust-action%2F&amp;#38;linkname=First%20Amendment%20Conflict%20of%20Visions%20Redux%3A%20The%20Case%20of%20Facebook%E2%80%99s%20Oversight%20Board%20and%20the%20Threat%20of%20Antitrust%20Actionhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F12%2Ffirst-amendment-conflict-of-visions-redux-the-case-of-facebooks-oversight-board-and-the-threat-of-antitrust-action%2F&amp;#38;linkname=First%20Amendment%20Conflict%20of%20Visions%20Redux%3A%20The%20Case%20of%20Facebook%E2%80%99s%20Oversight%20Board%20and%20the%20Threat%20of%20Antitrust%20Actionhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F12%2Ffirst-amendment-conflict-of-visions-redux-the-case-of-facebooks-oversight-board-and-the-threat-of-antitrust-action%2F&amp;#38;title=First%20Amendment%20Conflict%20of%20Visions%20Redux%3A%20The%20Case%20of%20Facebook%E2%80%99s%20Oversight%20Board%20and%20the%20Threat%20of%20Antitrust%20ActionThe\">https://www.addtoany.com/add_to/facebook?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F12%2Ffirst-amendment-conflict-of-visions-redux-the-case-of-facebooks-oversight-board-and-the-threat-of-antitrust-action%2F&amp;#38;linkname=First%20Amendment%20Conflict%20of%20Visions%20Redux%3A%20The%20Case%20of%20Facebook%E2%80%99s%20Oversight%20Board%20and%20the%20Threat%20of%20Antitrust%20Actionhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/twitter?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F12%2Ffirst-amendment-conflict-of-visions-redux-the-case-of-facebooks-oversight-board-and-the-threat-of-antitrust-action%2F&amp;#38;linkname=First%20Amendment%20Conflict%20of%20Visions%20Redux%3A%20The%20Case%20of%20Facebook%E2%80%99s%20Oversight%20Board%20and%20the%20Threat%20of%20Antitrust%20Actionhttps://www.addtoany.com/add_to/email?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F12%2Ffirst-amendment-conflict-of-visions-redux-the-case-of-facebooks-oversight-board-and-the-threat-of-antitrust-action%2F&amp;#38;linkname=First%20Amendment%20Conflict%20of%20Visions%20Redux%3A%20The%20Case%20of%20Facebook%E2%80%99s%20Oversight%20Board%20and%20the%20Threat%20of%20Antitrust%20Actionhttps://www.addtoany.com/share#url=https%3A%2F%2Ftruthonthemarket.com%2F2020%2F05%2F12%2Ffirst-amendment-conflict-of-visions-redux-the-case-of-facebooks-oversight-board-and-the-threat-of-antitrust-action%2F&amp;#38;title=First%20Amendment%20Conflict%20of%20Visions%20Redux%3A%20The%20Case%20of%20Facebook%E2%80%99s%20Oversight%20Board%20and%20the%20Threat%20of%20Antitrust%20ActionThe</url> post First Amendment Conflict of Visions Redux: The Case of Facebook's Oversight Board and the Threat of Antitrust Action[17] appeared first on Truth on the Market[18].

Despite YouTube s ubiquity and its role as a public-facing platform, it remains a private forum, not a public forum subject to judicial scrutiny under the First Amendment,  the court said.</p><p>PragerU, a conservative media company, sued YouTube in October 2017, claiming the Google-owned video site  unlawfully censor[ed] its educational videos and discriminat[ed] against its right to freedom of speech. </p><p>PragerU said YouTube reduced its viewership and revenue with  arbitrary and capricious use of  restricted mode  and  demonetization  viewer restriction filters.  PragerU claimed it was targeted by YouTube because of its  political identity and viewpoint as a non-profit that espouses conservative views on current and historical events. </p><p>But a US District Court judge dismissed PragerU s lawsuit against Google and YouTube, and a three-judge panel at the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit upheld that dismissal in a unanimous ruling today.</p><p> PragerU s claim that YouTube censored PragerU s speech faces a formidable threshold hurdle: YouTube is a private entity. The Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment prohibits the government not a private party from abridging speech,  judges wrote.</p><p>PragerU claimed that Google s  regulation and filtering of video content on YouTube is  State action  subject to scrutiny under the First Amendment.  While Google is obviously not a government agency, PragerU pointed to a previous appeals-court ruling to support its claim that  [t]he regulation of speech by a private party in a designated public forum is  quintessentially an exclusive and traditional public function  sufficient to establish that a private party is a  State actor  under the First Amendment.  PragerU claims YouTube is a  public forum  because YouTube invites the public to use the site to engage in freedom of expression and because YouTube representatives called the site a  public forum  for free speech in testimony before Congress.</p><h>Hosting speech doesn t make YouTube a state actor</h><p>Appeals court judges were not convinced. They pointed to a Supreme Court case from last year in which plaintiffs unsuccessfully  tested a theory that resembled PragerU s approach, claiming that a private entity becomes a state actor through its  operation  of the private property as  a public forum for speech.'  The case involved public access channels on a cable TV system.</p><p>The Supreme Court in that case found that  merely hosting speech by others is not a traditional, exclusive public function and does not alone transform private entities into state actors subject to First Amendment constraints. </p><p> If the rule were otherwise, all private property owners and private lessees who open their property for speech would be subject to First Amendment constraints and would lose the ability to exercise what they deem to be appropriate editorial discretion within that open forum,  the Supreme Court decision last year continued.</p><p>Ruling against PragerU s First Amendment claim was ultimately a  straightforward  matter, the appeals-court ruling today said:</p><p>Both sides say that the sky will fall if we do not adopt their position. PragerU prophesizes living under the tyranny of big-tech, possessing the power to censor any speech it does not like. YouTube and several amicus curiae, on the other hand, foretell the undoing of the Internet if online speech is regulated. While these arguments have interesting and important roles to play in policy discussions concerning the future of the Internet, they do not figure into our straightforward application of the First Amendment. Because the state action doctrine precludes constitutional scrutiny of YouTube s content moderation pursuant to its Terms of Service and Community Guidelines, we affirm the district court s dismissal of PragerU s First Amendment claim.</p><p>The judges  panel also rejected PragerU s claim that YouTube was guilty of false advertising under the Lanham Act.</p><p>YouTube s statements concerning its content moderation policies do not constitute  commercial advertising or promotion  as the Lanham Act requires,  the decision said.  Nor was YouTube s designation of certain of plaintiff s videos for Restricted Mode part of an advertising or promotion or a misrepresentation as to the videos.  Judges also found that  YouTube s braggadocio about its commitment to free speech constituted opinions that are not subject to the Lanham Act. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See Campaign:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/youtube-1st-amendment-ruling.pdf\">https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/youtube-1st-amendment-ruling.pdf</url><br/>Contact Information:<br/>JON BRODKIN<br/><br/>Tags:<br/>, Wire, United States, English<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpsicrowdnewswirecomp2379449</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y9F-HGC1-JCTB-F4H4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"870\"/><timeReceived>12:25 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 27, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

And it was my mistake and I'm sorry.</p><p>I started <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>I run it and I'm responsible for what happens here.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SESAY: The British firm was working on <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>2016 presidential campaign. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>says that it accessed data from millions of users improperly. But Analytica says it didn't use that data at all drying the campaign.</p><p>Senator <person><nameText>Lindsey Graham </nameText></person>pressed <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>on government regulation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. <person><nameText>LINDSEY GRAHAM </nameText></person>(R), S.C.: You don't think you have a monopoly?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: It certainly doesn't feel like that to me.</p><p>GRAHAM: OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: My position is not that there should be no regulation. I think the Internet is increasing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GRAHAM: -- embrace regulation?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: I think the real question as the Internet becomes more important in people's lives is what is the right regulation, not whether there should be or --</p><p>GRAHAM: -- You as a company welcome regulation?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: I think if it's the right regulation then --</p><p>GRAHAM: You think the Europeans have it right?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: I think that they get things right.</p><p>GRAHAM: Have you ever submitted --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GRAHAM: -- that's true.</p><p>So would you work with us in terms of what regulations you think are necessary in your industry?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: Absolutely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SESAY: <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is to appear again Wednesday before the House Committee. Joining us now from Jerusalem with more on all of this is CNNMoney's technology and business correspondent Samuel Burke.</p><p>Samuel, before <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>appeared before the Senate, there had been a lot of talk about he was very uncomfortable when he's forced to defend <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>that he can be a little defiant, a little abrasive.</p><p>But the appearance on Tuesday was smooth and he seemed very much in control and able to hold off those senators.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: There were some awkward moments. There were some funny moments, like the one you just saw that got some laughter, which always bodes well for anybody in front of the world stage. But I think the way that <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>was really able to advance and get ahead of the senators was because there were so many questions here. Remember Cambridge Analytica was the impetus for this testimony.</p><p>But there were actually years of pent-up frustrations and questions for what's arguably the most powerful platform on planet Earth. So they covered all types of topics, including what's arguably the question of our time, the possible connection between <person><nameText>Donald Trump's </nameText></person>2016 campaign and Russia and <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>as a possible intermediary in a way.</p><p>And this was one place where <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>actually seemed a little frustrated, maybe not well prepared. Take a listen to the question that Democrat senator Patrick Leahy put to <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>about the Mueller investigation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. PATRICK LEAHY (D), VERMONT: I assume <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>been served subpoenas from the special counsel Mueller's office.</p><p>Is that correct?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p>LEAHY: Have you or anyone at <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>been interviewed by the Special Counsel's Office?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: Yes.</p><p>LEAHY: Have you been interviewed --</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: I have not. I have not.</p><p>LEAHY: Others have?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: I believe so. And I want to be careful here, because that -- our work with the special counsel is confidential and I want to make sure that, in an open session, I'm not revealing something that's confidential.</p><p>LEAHY: I understand. I just want to make clear that you have been contacted and you have had subpoenas.</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: Actually, let me clarify that. I actually am not aware of a subpoena. I believe that there may be, but I know we're working with them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE: Isha, very surprising that, on such an important question, <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>clearly has one answer and then walks it back. That said, sometimes the best judge of how somebody's done in a situation like this is the stock price. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>stock up 4.5 percent Tuesday, adding $20 billion of value onto the company and clearly investors thought that <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>was doing --</p><p>[01:05:00]</p><p>BURKE: -- OK and that the senators really didn't push him hard enough.</p><p>SESAY: Yes. Definitely there is the sense that they didn't push him hard enough partly because they just didn't get it. They just don't understand how <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>actually works. And in some ways this was a wasted opportunity.</p><p>BURKE: I don't want to be ageist here but clearly you could see that age did play a factor, that some of the people, some of the senators don't use <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person>There was an exchange between Orrin Hatch, the senator, and <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>which is very telling. Take a listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ORRIN HATCH (R), UTAH: How do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?</p><p><person><nameText>ZUCKERBERG</nameText></person>: Senator, we run ads.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE: So if he doesn't know that, maybe it doesn't bode well for data reform, which is the most important thing here.</p><p>Will laws be changed so that our data will be protected?</p><p>People around the world were watching this, all the tech CEOs of the startups here in Israel to the big tech companies in the United States, and wondering will there be a big change?</p><p>And I think it was a very weak signal. A lot of people are hoping, especially tech journalists, that there is some more serious questions asked -- maybe the boxing gloves taken off, as Kara Swisher (ph) Recode said, in the House Wednesday, questions like, does <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>track you when you're off of <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>as many people believe that it does and as <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>indicated might do but let's get a clear answer on that in the House today.</p><p>And another question which I think is the most important personally, why would <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>even share any of your data with these third-party companies, especially when they make little or no money doing that?</p><p>Their real money is made with their advertising.</p><p>Why give away your bread and butter when you could end up with a huge scandal like this, which, again is the impetus?</p><p>Cambridge Analytica is what got <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to Congress Tuesday and Wednesday. So we'll see if people are tougher.</p><p>SESAY: Yes, we will. There are a lot more questions to be answered. I think you're absolutely right there. Samuel Burke joining us there from Jerusalem, appreciate it. Thank you.</p><p>Joining us now from Vancouver, Canada, is Richen Patel. He's executive director of Avaaz. Avaaz is an online activist group and the group set up a troll army of fake Mark Zuckerbergs on the council lawn ahead of Tuesday's Senate hearing.</p><p>And Richen, it is good to see you. It wasn't dramatic and disturbing sight, 100 life-sized cutouts of the <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>boss.</p><p>Dramatic it was. But what was the message you were trying to get across?</p><p>RICHEN PATEL, AVAAZ: Well, the message was democracy is getting gamed right now by fake users, fake profiles, fake movements, fake pages. We wanted to try and create something that was visual and offline that conveyed how disturbing this was because this seems to be how democracy is done these days.</p><p>And we're just awash in and social media is awash in these big profiles and movements and we wanted to just highlight that at the moment of <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>testimony.</p><p>SESAY: Do you think that the concern that you have here about the fake news and the disinformation, do you think that was addressed in any way, shape or form sufficiently at the hearing on Tuesday?</p><p>PATEL: No, this is amidst the many embarrassments of the hearing today. There was explaining how <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>works. But there was not a single push on <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to commit any new commitment to protect our democracy.</p><p>We're looking at existential democratic threats. We're seeing democracy get gamed across the world and we've got crucial elections upcoming in Brazil and India and the U.S. and Mexico and <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>admits he's in an arms race with Russia and other malicious actors.</p><p>But he's moving at a snail's pace and not a single commitment was obtained today. It is really embarrassment on that front. We're praying that the House does better tomorrow.</p><p>SESAY: I think that were a couple things that were revealed and a couple of tensions and, again, they put it to <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>and I don't know that he sufficiently dealt with it, this notion, is <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>a technology company or is it a media company?</p><p>And as we talk about the notion of disinformation and all of that -- and I'm not sure that <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>sufficiently answered that.</p><p>What did you make of it?</p><p>Because that, again, is an existential question. PATEL: Well, I think from the perspective of millions of people around the world that are in our movement and that we poll all the time, they're worried about two things. They're worried about this tremendous threat from social media, information operations, information warfare. They're also worried about government stepping in too far and saying what's true and what's not and who can say what and who can't.</p><p>But even about <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>stepping in. So the solution that we see and that is widely supported in our polling is to just delete Fakebook. There's <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and there's Fakebook. And <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has admitted that 13 percent of its accounts are fake. And those accounts are very active.</p><p>So who knows what percentage of their activity, all those likes and comments are actually fake?</p><p>Why not just delete them?</p><p>They're actually violating <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>--</p><p>[01:10:00]</p><p>PATEL: -- user policy. They are the swamp that these disinformation campaigns swim in. That's how the Russians get this stuff going and there's lot of bots to like things and push things and share things.</p><p>Why not delete it?</p><p>The answer's revenue. <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>makes money selling fake likes and fake news. That's all of these advertisers. And that's where we need to push right now, is to just delete the stuff.</p><p>SESAY: You had this open letter, calling for specific action and you talked to (INAUDIBLE) calling for tell the truth, ban the bots, alert the public and fund the fact checkers.</p><p>But everything you saw on Tuesday, everything you heard, do you think these are steps that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>will take willingly without pressure, i.e., without the government forcing them to without regulation?</p><p>PATEL: Honestly, as an activist, it's uncommon to do -- to be charitable towards corporations. But I think the people who work at <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>the executives are not evil. They actually are well- intentioned but they are moving way too slowly.</p><p>They are two steps behind the disinformation warriors. And <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>today, the most shocking thing he said is, look, our AI is working to ID these fake --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PATEL: -- but it shouldn't be 5-10 years to clean it up. And we don't have 5-10 months to do it. And this is the kind of acceleration that we need them to do. They're moving in a little direction, saying, oh, we're going to verify large pages. Well, if you can do large pages with lots of followers, why don't you verify medium size pages and small -- why not accounts at that -- like you have the capability to do it.</p><p>Why not do it?</p><p>And this is where I think they need to be pushed right now.</p><p>SESAY: Richen Patel, my friend, it is nice to see you. Thank you so much for joining us. Very much appreciate it.</p><p>PATEL: Pleasure.</p><p>SESAY: Well, the U.S. and its allies are weighing how to respond to suspected chemical attack in Syria as a team of chemical weapons experts prepare to head to the country. The U.S. and Russia squared off at the United Nations Security Council again Tuesday, effectively blocking each other's draft resolutions for investigations into last weekend's suspected attack in Douma.</p><p>The U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley accused Russia of protecting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad whom she called \"a monster\" instead of protecting Syria's people.</p><p>Russia's ambassador pushed back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): You are very well at threatening and the threats that you are -- that you are proffering, that you're stating vis-a-vis Syria, should make us seriously worried, all of us, because we could find ourselves on the threshold of some very sad and serious events.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SESAY: CNN military analyst retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona joins us now from Oregon.</p><p>Col. Francona, good to see you as always.</p><p>Are you surprised that we haven't heard of any action on the part of the U.S., given the forceful comments made by the president on Monday?</p><p>LT. COL. RICK FRANCONA (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST: Actually I'm not because if you recall what happened a year ago, the United States reacted very quickly to that provocation, that attack of Kanshakun (ph), a sarin attack.</p><p>But this time it looks like they're -- the United States and its allies are talking about a concerted action, a much bigger action. And that's going to require some time to move forces into place.</p><p>It's one thing to fire 59 Tomahawks from a couple of vessels in the Mediterranean. But if you're going to launch a longer, even a sustained attack, you're going to have to bring additional assets into the region, of course. And that's going to require a little bit of planning, a little bit of time.</p><p>SESAY: Longer, more sustained action possibly. We don't exactly know what's going to happen. But If that were the case, what would that achieve?</p><p>I guess it's two questions.</p><p>What would that achieve?</p><p>And are we clear on what the end game is here?</p><p>FRANCONA: Well, two tough questions and I hope those are ---</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCONA: -- being addressed at the Pentagon right now because what will it achieve?</p><p>And we've talked before and I've said that I don't think whatever we do is going to change the final outcome of the situation there. It is just how it plays out. I believe that no matter what we do, the Russians have pretty much guaranteed that Bashar al-Assad and his regime are going to survive.</p><p>The question is, in what capacity or what's the final situation going to look like?</p><p>Are the Syrians going to be -- have any say what happens in their country?</p><p>Or are they going to be dictated to by the Russians, the Turks and the Iranians and of course we're being frozen out of this very -- quite effectively by the Russians. So is a military action going to achieve any change on the ground?</p><p>Probably not but it is going to indicate to the -- to the Syrians and the Russians that they cannot use these weapons of mass destruction, these chemical agents on innocent people without being any price to pay.</p><p>SESAY: Yes, but this is -- they did it just a year ago. I mean if the reports ultimately which they are by the U.N. and other investigators, as you just mentioned, Kanshakun (ph), some --</p><p>[01:15:00]</p><p>SESAY: -- 80 people died there. There were 59 Tomahawk missiles fired.</p><p>And here we are, a year later, seeing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SESAY: -- and what is suspected chemical attack. So again, if you're Bashar al-Assad or you're Vladimir Putin, and the finger of blame is being pointed at them, they're thinking to themselves, what of it? It doesn't change anything.</p><p>FRANCONA: Well, it's interesting though but it did take them a year to use sarin again; that we're absolutely sure of, to launch this kind of attack. The question I have is why would the Syrians do this?</p><p>They're on the verge of absolutely wiping out the resistance in those suburbs of Damascus. There's actually a deal on the ground now where many of them are being allowed to leave and go north, mostly to Idlib.</p><p>The Syrians didn't need to use chemicals. I doubt that the Russians had any role in this; they may -- they obviously turned a blind eye. But the Syrians probably didn't ask the council, the Russians to do this because the Russians would have said there is no need. Militarily it makes no sense to use chemicals when you're on the verge of that kind of victory.</p><p>So this was a real miscalculation on the part of Bashar al-Assad and I think he's going to pay a little bit of a price for it. But as I say I don't see where this changes the final outcome.</p><p>SESAY: For every action there's a reaction so if we take that, that truism and say there's a joint airstrike, a coalition airstrike, what happens next in terms of a reaction on the part of say Russia and Iran, Bashar al-Assad's backers?</p><p>FRANCONA: Yes, that's the real calculation that has to be looked at, at the Pentagon. It's just if we mount an attack and we take out some Syrian airbases, some Syrian facilities and, of course, there are Russians and Iranians at these facilities, you have to figure what if we kill some Iranian soldiers, some Russian troops?</p><p>What happens then?</p><p>Are the Russians then bound to react and do we start this tit-for-tat back and forth and pretty soon we find ourselves in a war?</p><p>SESAY: Rick Francona, it's been more than seven years. We've seen these images and it is just dreadful and heartbreaking. We always appreciate the insight, thank you.</p><p>FRANCONA: Sure thing, Isha.</p><p>SESAY: Quick break here. <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is angry about the raid on his attorney's home and office and special counsel <person><nameText>Robert Mueller </nameText></person>could feel the president's wrath. The latest on Mueller's possible firing -- next.</p><p>Plus we'll speak with Academy Award-winning actor Jared Leto. He says his new album with 30 Seconds to Mars is personal and provocative. Ahead, what he found when he hitchhiked across the U.S.</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>(MUSIC PLAYING)</p><p>SESAY: U.S. President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is facing a pair of enormous decisions, one involving events abroad; the other right here in the United States. Mr. Trump's anger is boiling over as he decides what to do about the --</p><p>[01:20:00]</p><p>SESAY: -- suspected chemical attack in Syria and what to do after the raid on his personal lawyer's office. CNN's chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN SR. WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Still furious but seething behind closed doors, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>declined to answer whether he's considering a dramatic move to try to end special counsel <person><nameText>Robert Mueller's </nameText></person>investigation.</p><p>But the White House made it clear the president thinks he has the authority to fire Mueller.</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Certainly believes he has the power to do so. The president has been clear that he thinks that this has gone too far and, beyond that, I don't have anything to add.</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over): The other looming question is whether the president could force out or constrain Mueller by firing attorney general Jeff Sessions or deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, who could name a different special prosecutor.</p><p>Asked about the fate of Sessions, who showed up, at all places, a celebration for the Alabama college football team...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mr. Attorney General, have you spoken with the president today?</p><p>SEN. JEFF SESSIONS (R-ALA.), U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Hey, not today. Roll Tide!</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over): -- the White House didn't exactly hold back the blitz of questions.</p><p>SANDERS: I think the president was pretty clear about his frustrations when he spoke about that last night.</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over): While the raid at the office of the president's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, was ordered by the U.S. attorney's office in New York and not Mueller, Mr. Trump is outraged at the special counsel.</p><p>According to Justice Department rules, Rosenstein, a Republican, had to sign off on the Cohen raid.</p><p>TRUMP: Why don't I fire Mueller? Well, I think it's a disgrace what's going on. We'll see what happens. But I think it's really a sad situation when you look at what happened. And many people have said, \"You should fire him.\"</p><p>ACOSTA: The president also vented his frustrations by tweeting: \"The Russia investigation is a total witch hunt,\" adding, \"attorney-client privilege is dead.\" A continuation of the rant he unleashed while sitting next to top military commanders.</p><p>TRUMP: And it's a disgrace. It's frankly a real disgrace. It's an attack on our country in a true sense. It's an attack on what we all stand for. So when I saw this and when I heard it -- I heard it like you did -- I said that is really now in a whole new level of unfairness.</p><p>ACOSTA: Democrats are taking issue with the comparison.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-N.Y.), MINORITY LEADER: The Japanese bombing Pearl Harbor was an attack on our country. Nine-eleven was an attack on our country. When Russia interfered with our elections, that was an attack on our country.</p><p>ACOSTA: Republicans are urging caution, some with the hope the president is simply letting off some steam.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEADER: I don't think he's going to be removed from this office. He shouldn't be removed from the office. He should be allowed to finish the job.</p><p>ACOSTA: While other GOP senators are warning Mr. Trump to leave Mueller alone.</p><p>SEN. CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA), JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN: I think it would be suicide for the president to fire him. I think the less the president says about this whole thing the better off he will be. And I think that Mueller is a person of stature and respected; and I respect him. Just let the thing go forward.</p><p>ACOSTA: The Cohen raid comes during another turbulent week at the White House as the president suddenly scrapped a trip to South America set for this weekend.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you disappointed not to go to South America?</p><p>TRUMP: I am, actually. I would have loved to have gone.</p><p>ACOSTA: A decision that surprised even his top economic adviser, who thought Mr. Trump was still going just this morning.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISOR (via phone): I'll be traveling with him, with the group going to Latin America. This -- well, say, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Japanese summit after that in Florida. I don't think it's going to stop him. It never stops him. ACOSTA: The White House said the president is no longer going to South America, where he was to attend the Summit of the Americas, so he can focus on the U.S. response to the suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria.</p><p>But the last time the president authorized airstrikes on Syria, we should point out, was when he was at Mar-a-Lago last year -- Jim Acosta, CNN, the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SESAY: Ethan Bearman is a California talk radio host and Lanhee Chen is a research fellow and lecturer at Stanford University.</p><p>Gentlemen, great to have you with us once again.</p><p>Ethan, to you, the president not going on this trip and, as you saw, taking Larry Kudlow by surprise there, which some would say that moment in and of itself is a microcosm of all the issues at the White House.</p><p>ETHAN BEARMAN, TALK SHOW RADIO HOST: Yes, really is. It's interesting how the president just does things on a whim and doesn't notify, doesn't talk to advisors. He just, I'm going to make the decision. I don't want to do that. I'm worried about Mueller thing. I'm worried about my attorney getting raided yesterday in Manhattan in a hotel room among other places as well.</p><p>So let's cancel what is actually arguably an exceptionally important trip to address what is happening in our own hemisphere with our Central American neighbors, with our South American neighbors.</p><p>If he is actually worried about things like undocumented workers coming across the border, he should be worried about working with those countries, building their economies and instilling confidence in their institutions and the rule of law because that would stop people from wanting to come here because they would be at home.</p><p>SESAY: Lanhee, what do you make of it, the president's decision not to go?</p><p>And is it a missed opportunity that geopolitical ramifications?</p><p>LANHEE CHEN, FORMER ROMNEY PUBLIC POLICY DIRECTOR: Well, certainly American leadership in the world is crucially important and --</p><p>[01:25:00]</p><p>CHEN: -- these summits are more than just sort of gatherings of leaders. They're opportunities for the United States to say these are the values and these are the things that we stand for and that are important to us.</p><p>Now he's actually sending I guess Mike Pence and Marco Rubio, who I'm sure will do a very able job. But they're not the President of the United States. It's still different. And the president needs to demonstrate that America cares. As Ethan says, the stuff that's going on in our own hemisphere is highly impactful. It matters a lot to the American people and it matters a lot frankly to our sphere of influence as well.</p><p>And so the lack of American involvement in a direct way, I do think is problematic.</p><p>SESAY: The president isn't going; he's staying. One will assume some of that time will be spent fuming over all the events of recent days.</p><p>The chatter is getting louder and louder out of the White House in terms of how upset he is, at least that's what's being reported by \"The New York Times\" and others.</p><p>The question is, what does he do about it?</p><p>He's clearly not happy about this raid on Michael Cohen's office.</p><p>What does he do next?</p><p>We heard Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, say he has the authority to fire Mueller.</p><p>BEARMAN: Well, I think that would create a constitutional crisis. I really do. I don't believe you have the authority. There's nothing clear that shows that he does. That's Rod Rosenstein's place. If somebody was going to fire Mueller, it would be Rod Rosenstein.</p><p>So it would be arguable that Rod Rosenstein is the one who would go and that he would try and find somebody who would go -- follow his desires in that position to then fire Mueller.</p><p>But I just want to say right now, I'm really glad that we have a president who doesn't have a dog for once because all presidents have dogs. And I would be really worried with the level of instability that happens with our president, I don't want him kicking a dog.</p><p>SESAY: Oh, Ethan.</p><p>BEARMAN: I'm not actually kidding you. I mean, the way he is overreacting to things right now, he throws tantrums. It's bizarre, it's unhealthy, it's unstable, it's not good for the American people, it's not good for our government, it's not good for the world when our White House is in chaos right now.</p><p>SESAY: Lanhee Chen, Sarah Sanders also refused to say that the president has confidence in the attorney general or Rod Rosenstein or Mueller.</p><p>What do you think about -- take from that and those three people who are in the presidents crosshairs?</p><p>CHEN: Well, keep them guessing. I think that's part of the idea here, is that the president has always been unpredictable and I think this is an extension of that. Now obviously, if you take those three figures and you think about them sequentially, I think they're all sort of very important in their own way.</p><p>So now Jeff Sessions is someone who came on as the original Trump loyalist but actually has resisted in a lot of ways what the president has tried to convince him to do. And obviously the biggest part of that was recusing himself in the Russia investigation, a huge decision that I think a lot of people overlook.</p><p>But in fact think gives him a little more credibility. He's really stuck with it. Rod Rosenstein, he's someone who I think has pretty faithfully executed the job he's been given as well.</p><p>Now eliminating or firing Rosenstein would be clearly a major salvo toward <person><nameText>Robert Mueller </nameText></person>because it's Rod Rosenstein that ultimately has control over the Mueller investigation.</p><p>So the president may not go and fire Mueller directly. I think that would be a pretty stupid thing to do. But he could fire Rod Rosenstein and that would put Mueller in jeopardy, which is why people are so focused on Rosenstein and what might happen.</p><p>SESAY: Ethan, do you want to see Congress pass legislation to insulate, protect <person><nameText>Robert Mueller?</nameText></person></p><p>BEARMAN: I think that if we had a spine in Congress, that they might actually do that because Republicans, for the most part, I think also recognize the severity of what we're facing right now and the importance of the rule of law and that this process gets followed to completion.</p><p>But I don't believe that they're going to do anything about it. They're afraid for their own base and the vote that is coming up in November this midterm is huge. And the Democrats are demonstrating that they very likely will retake the House.</p><p>SESAY: Lanhee.</p><p>CHEN: Republicans are walking a very thin line here because, on the one side of it, they have to continue to emphasize at least the more reasonable ones are saying, <person><nameText>Robert Mueller </nameText></person>needs to be allowed to finish the job. And I think that's absolutely true.</p><p>On the other hand, they are having a difficult time wrapping their arms around legislation to protect <person><nameText>Robert Mueller </nameText></person>because of the reasons Ethan's outlined now. It's an election year; obviously those are issues that matter a lot.</p><p>The Republican base here in the United States is still very firmly in <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>corner. And I think people don't realize that a lot of times when they think about what is happening in U.S. politics.</p><p>SESAY: Last thing I'm going to throw out there, next week James Comey's book is published. I think it comes out April 16th. The press tour will start any moment now.</p><p>Anyone care to take a guess what will be in the book?</p><p>(INAUDIBLE) what the president will do when all the press starts and FOX News starts talking about said book?</p><p>BEARMAN: If I'm Mike Pence, I'd be happy to be in South America and not in the White House when this book comes out. There's going to be explosive material in it that is going to offend and upset <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>terribly.</p><p>I just seriously, if I'm a White House staffer, I'm taking a vacation when this book comes out.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>[01:30:00] SESAY: Lanhee -- ten seconds.</p><p>CHEN: I would imagine that this next week is going to be spent a lot -- to put it (INAUDIBLE) this trite, try to discredit James Comey. But let's not forget he did have a very good career in law enforcement for a very long time and I hope people don't lose sight of that.</p><p>SESAY: All right. We'll be checking in on you next week as all the dust flies.</p><p>Ethan Bearman, Lanhee Chen -- we appreciate it. Thank you.</p><p>BEARMAN: Thank you.</p><p>SESAY: Thank you.</p><p>We're going to take a very quick break here.</p><p>Next on NEWSROOM L.A. disturbing video taken from the scope of an Israeli sniper. We'll tell you what Israel is saying about the shooting.</p><p>Plus, Myanmar takes action against some of its soldiers after the deaths of these Rohingya men. The details are just ahead.</p><p>You're watching CNN NEWSROOM live from Los Angeles. I'm Isha Sesay.

In Tuesday's hearing the <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>CEO apologized for mistakes the company made in failing to protect users' data. He did not commit to any specific regulations for social media.</p><p>The U.S. and its allies are weighing how to respond to last weekend's suspected chemical attack in Douma, Syria. An international team of chemical weapons inspectors is preparing to head to Douma to assess what happened there.</p><p>A source familiar with the matter says <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and his aides have discussed firing special counsel <person><nameText>Robert Mueller </nameText></person>for months. Speculation is heating up once again after the FBI raided the home and the office of the President's personal attorney, Michael Cohen. Well, a disturbing video from Israel shows a sniper from the Israel Defense Forces shooting a Palestinian standing near the border fence with Gaza. The video lasts more than a minute and it led the Monday evening news in Israel and was prominent in newspapers.</p><p>Now it has -- reignited rather -- a debate about the Israeli army's principles and the actions of its soldiers. We warn you (AUDIO GAP) is graphic and disturbing.</p><p>Ian Lee reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>IAN LEE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: An Israeli sniper zeroes in on a Palestinian man near the Gaza border. He appears unarmed.</p><p>\"When he steps, you take him down\", the commander orders in the video.</p><p>Gunshot cracks and the man falls.</p><p>\"Son of a bitch\", one soldier yells, \"what a legendary film\". \"I haven't seen this kind of thing for a long time.\"</p><p>Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman praised the soldier while criticizing the one who recorded it through his scope.</p><p>AVIGDOR LIEBERMAN, ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER (through translator): The sniper deserves a medal. The other soldier should be demoted.</p><p>[01:35:00] LEE: The video and the soldiers' celebration has provoked outrage.</p><p>AHMAD TIBI, ARAB MOVEMENT FOR CHANGE: They committed a crime but not only them. Above them there is one more criminal. His name is Avigdor Lieberman. He's inciting those soldiers to kill.</p><p>LEE: Israel's military says the video was filmed in December and that it doesn't show the full picture of what happened. It says the shooting was justified but will conduct a full inquiry adding, \"The cheering does not suit the degree of restraint expected of IDF soldiers.\"</p><p>This video comes on the heels of others from the recent violence on the Gaza-Israel border. Here an Israeli sniper shoots a protester in the back as he runs away from the border.</p><p>And this woman, waving a flag near the border drops after getting shot. Both appear unarmed and their conditions are unknown.</p><p>Tens of thousands of Palestinians have gathered near the border fence on two successive Fridays saying they want to cross over to lands lost to Israel 70 years ago. Israel says the demonstrations are led by Hamas and present a security threat.</p><p>In total, Israeli soldiers have killed 32 Palestinians since the protest started two weeks ago. No Israeli soldiers have been killed or injured. International and Israeli rights groups have accused Israel of using excessive force.</p><p>ROY YELLIN: The army shooting people outside of the normal rules of engagement and that's why my organization called soldiers to refuse those orders which are criminal orders and manifestly illegal.</p><p>LEE: Even before the latest round of protests began, Israel's military posted this video on social media. It shows what appears to be an unarmed Gazan near the fence, shot in the leg.</p><p>It warns, \"Hamas is sending you to demonstrations and endangering your lives.\"</p><p>JONATHAN CONRICUS, IDF SPOKESMAN: We use very specific -- there are sharpshooters or snipers and specific persons who are trying to sabotage the fence. We aim for the lower part of the body or the feet and -- to make sure that those people are not able, those rioters are not able to climb or sabotage the fence and pose a significant threat to our facilities.</p><p>LEE: With Palestinians vowing to cross and Israel's military not backing down, a video like this shows peace is far away.</p><p>Ian Lee, CNN -- Jerusalem.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SESAY: Well, a judge in Myanmar is refusing to dismiss the case against two Reuters journalists who were arrested while investigating the killing of ten Rohingya men last year. The journalists were accused of having secret government papers. They had interviewed a retired a Myanmar army officer who claimed he helped dig the mass grave for the Rohingya men.</p><p>Meanwhile Myanmar has reportedly sentenced seven of its soldiers for those killings. State media reports the soldiers were found guilty after a 13-day investigation. They're now facing ten years of hard labor.</p><p>Well, a failed prison break in northern Brazil has left at least 20 people dead. Authorities say a heavily armed group used explosives to take down a prison wall. Nineteen of those killed are believed to be prisoners or those who tried to free them. One victim was a guard. It's not known if anyone escaped.</p><p>Well, a quick break here.</p><p>A French priest is documenting what he calls a modern-day genocide. Still to come his heartbreaking stories of rape and murder against the Yazidi population.</p><p>[01:38:33] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SESAY: Eight-year-old boys bought and sold to build bombs and blow up other children on command. Kidnapped women, tortured and raped, forced to watch decapitations and death by firing squad -- all in the name of ISIS. This was the fate of thousands of Yazidi people in Iraq. Broken bodies and minds, witnesses to systematic brutality and persecution likened to the Holocaust. But some escaped, many lived to tell.</p><p>Joining me, the man who has spoken to more than 200 of them -- Father Patrick Desbois, a Georgetown University professor and co-author of the about-to-be-published book \"The Terrorist Factory: ISIS, the Yazidi Genocide and Exporting Terror\". Father Desbois -- welcome.</p><p>FATHER PATRICK DESBOIS, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY: Thank you. You're welcome.</p><p>SESAY: You know, it's so apropos that we have you here right now talking about this book about ISIS and their crimes because right now in the news, there's been all this talk about U.S. troops pulling out of Syria and ISIS being on the run.</p><p>You spoke with the people who have actually been with these people with ISIS in Iraq.</p><p>DESBOIS: Yes, I'd just come back from Iraq. That had been three weeks ago. And I'm not sure ISIS is on the run so much. They lost a lot of power but they have a long term vision. You know, the program was to unmask ISIS because officially they rape girls. That was what we show but I've tried to find what they didn't show and what they didn't show is hundreds of camps to train children.</p><p>I interviewed like 45 with my team of Yahad. I interviewed 45 children from seven years old to 11. They don't remember their name. They don't remember their father's face, their mother's face. They don't speak their language. One speaks English because they had been sold to an American ISIS family. One is speaking French because he has been sold to a French family. One speaks Arabic because he'd been sold to a Jordanian family, et cetera.</p><p>And they told them, the others told them we will die. We will die in Mosul. We'll die in Iraq. But you the children, the lion of the Caliphate, you will survive and you would have to act outside.</p><p>SESAY: How did they do it? Tell me. You spoke to children. What did they tell you about their day to day existence?</p><p>DESBOIS: First, they extract them from their family. They put them in camps. They don't see the TV. They woke up t 4:00. They pray. After they have to (INAUDIBLE) the suffering; they walk on them. They are not to cry.</p><p>And after specializing in commando (ph) -- free kind of commando; commando with Kalashnikov, commando to put bombs, commando to be beside bombers.</p><p>And after they make -- after I interviewed a child. He was putting bombs to (INAUDIBLE). Another one was putting bombs at a border of Kurdistan, et cetera.</p><p>So these children have been completely brainwashed and they feel like this. They say I am Daesh. I'm ISIS.</p><p>SESAY: And when they say I'm Daesh, I'm ISIS -- what does that mean to them? Does that mean them against the rest of the world, against non-Muslims? What does that mean to them?</p><p>DESBOIS: Even against their family -- it's why my organization we vow to talk, to try to bring them back because they are refugee, they don't know anymore who they are.</p><p>For example I interview a nine-year-old boy and he has been in ISIS three years. He has been taken at six-year-old. And at the end, he approached my camera man and said give me your bag, I will blow you. And he was yelling Allahu Akbar in the middle of the conversation. And the moment -- he doesn't know who he is.</p><p>And so we have to help these children to wake up from this nightmare of ISIS. That's why I'm afraid is that in fact ISIS has a strategy to export them because these children are not only Yazidi, they could be French --</p><p>SESAY: Yes.</p><p>DESBOIS: -- they could be German, they could be Americans, Saudi, Jordanians -- from anywhere. It's an exportation machine -- ISIS.</p><p>SESAY: It's a factory.</p><p>DESBOIS: It's a factory of children in fact.</p><p>SESAY: You talk about the mother there who doesn't recognize her child. Talk to me about the experience of the mothers, of the women who I know, in cases some bought and sold as many as 25 times. CNN has shown on our air video of slave markets of women being bought and sold.</p><p>Talk to me about where that fits in with ISIS' strategy, the abuse, the systematic abuse -- almost the factory element of how they treat women.</p><p>[01:44:57] DESBOIS: When they arrest a family of Yazidi -- a doctor enters and check every girl was virgin. If a girl is virgin, she will be taken in a group and sold by group to (INAUDIBLE) and are sold one by one.</p><p>If she's beautiful she was sold to a high authority of ISIS and it's an awful story. They will bring the girl in a hospital and they will rape her under anesthesia (ph) because they don't want her to remember she has been raped. So that's if she's sold to a high-rank.</p><p>But if she's sold to lower rank, she would be raped, sold one day, sold two days, et cetera meaning today she has been sold 25 times, 35 times and she has a new name, she has to pray everyday. She has to assure (ph) she's Muslim and she dreams to escape every day.</p><p>SESAY: Why the targeting of the Yazidi? DESBOIS: Because they classify them as evil worshipers. They say they have no vote (ph). They are not believers so we have the right -- we have the legal right to treat them as slaves.</p><p>SESAY: As we talk about you capturing these stories and you speaking to all of these people and capturing all of these stories in the book. It's even more important that books like these exist because they Yazidi haven't had justice. There's been no one held accountable.</p><p>Do you hope that these stories will one day play a part in a trial or --</p><p>DESBOIS: We work very closely with the Justice in France, Justice in Germany and other countries to bring (INAUDIBLE) because effectively for the moment, nobody, nobody has been judged for genocide. We say ISIS did a genocide. Nobody said that Baghdadi did a genocide.</p><p>I think today if we were judging Hitler, we would judge him for terrorists because it's easier to judge. But we have to unmask this genocide otherwise, it would be the first time a genocide happens with nobody guilty.</p><p>SESAY: And you, how does it affect you personally as you talk about taking care of yourself. You did all this work on the Holocaust. You're doing all this work on the Yazidi. How about you and your spirit?</p><p>DESBOIS: It's a fight. All my people, we are 29 full time -- all my people working in that say we are more lonely than before because you passed on the other side of the mirror. People like to sleep well and we don't sleep well. I will always encourage my team also to have a psychoanalyst and I would say, of course, if I didn't pray, I'm not sure I will stay in this duty.</p><p>SESAY: Father Desbois, we thank you for the work you do.</p><p>DESBOIS: Thank you.</p><p>SESAY: And congratulations on the book -- it's an important book.</p><p>DESBOIS: Merci.</p><p>SESAY: An important work.</p><p>Up next we speak with Academy award winning actor Jared Leto about his odyssey across the U.S. plus what motivated him to explore America in his new album with Thirty Seconds to Mars\".</p><p>SESAY: America -- land of the free, home of the brave. Possibility, potential dreams realized. That's the good.</p><p>Then there's the bad, even ugly -- political tension, racial and economic division, drugs, guns and war.</p><p>[01:49:50] Thirty Seconds to Mars' ambitious new project tackles it all head on.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>SESAY: The albums is called \"America\". It is out now. Academy-award winner Jared Leto is the band's lead singer. He joins me now here in L.A. Welcome.</p><p>JARED LETO, ACTOR AND SINGER: Hi.</p><p>SESAY: Congrats.</p><p>LETO: By the way, that intro -- I want to take it and play it before every show. It's so classy and so impactful, powerful. It's great.</p><p>SESAY: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>The album sounds great. It is your first album in five years.</p><p>LETO: Yes.</p><p>SESAY: A lot of people have been waiting for it. A lot of people have been excited. You know, it's called. \"America\". It's a big sweeping title. This is a big sweeping album.</p><p>LETO: Yes.</p><p>SESAY: But I guess my question to you is, is this more personal or political?</p><p>LETO: It's a little bit of both. It's so sure, it's personal, it's emotional. It's creative and fun, provocative maybe at times.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>LETO: This is a new chapter for Thirty Seconds to Mars and \"America\" is a very heavy-handed title, especially in the times we're living in now which is one of the reasons we have these crazy album covers -- these lists.</p><p>SESAY: I want to talk about that.</p><p>LETO: Yes.</p><p>SESAY: What is the thinking behind -- is it ten, ten different album covers?</p><p>LETO: I mean there are hundreds of different lists that we're using in billboards and snipes and street posters and album covers, you know.</p><p>SESAY: What's the thinking and what conversation are you trying to start?</p><p>LETO: I think individual the lists for me are -- they could be fun or funny, provocative. They're interesting. They're bizarre. But together they kind of act like a time capsule. If you were to look back on these lists -- 10, 20, 30, 50, a hundred years from now I think you get a sense of the times that we're living in, the culture that we're all a part of.</p><p>SESAY: You did this cross-country --</p><p>LETO: Yes.</p><p>SESAY: -- I don't want to put my grade -- I don't want to --</p><p>LETO: Honesty.</p><p>SESAY: There was an honesty -- that's a perfect --</p><p>LETO: A long walk.</p><p>SESAY: Yes.</p><p>LETO: Yes.</p><p>SESAY: First of all, why did you want to do that for this album?</p><p>LETO: Well, the album is called \"America\" --</p><p>SESAY: Yes.</p><p>LETO: -- and I thought retracing that journey that I took as a kid coming from New York, an art school kid, art school dropout, coming to California for the first time with my backpack and sleeping on Venice Beach. It was something to kind of retracing my steps.</p><p>It's a classic journey from East to West. I got a chance to visit states that we're going to be playing shows out for our tour in June and July. And I got on the streets. I got in front of people, you know, talking to a trucker in Milwaukee who's shipping Harley Davidson's across the nation and hearing about his concerns of the future.</p><p>So I don't know, it was very much in line with the album and in the spirit of what we're doing and it was an incredible trip. I met the most amazing people and I had the experience of a lifetime.</p><p>SESAY: What surprised you on the journey as you talked to all these people?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LETO: What surprised me -- what surprised me was the optimism that's still out there in the midst of such a conflict in times of instability and uncertainty, that people still hold on to hope.</p><p>SESAY: What are they optimistic about? About their own selves as individuals to push through or of the country as a collective?</p><p>LETO: The country as a collective. I think that the idea of the American dream, the idea of America, the possibility that we can leave this country in a better place for our children and our children's children. I think people still held on to that acknowledging that we're in really difficult times. But looking forward and hopeful that things can be different.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Can we get better?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Heck, yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I have that hope that America can change for the better.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Everything I have today is thanks to the United States.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: -- possibility.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: America is greater than it's ever been.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There's something positive that's going to come out of the negativity.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are all related.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SESAY: Are you optimistic?</p><p>LETO: I'm optimistic. I mean I see a lot of unity out there.</p><p>I mean if you looked at the news, you obviously get a sense of the conflict in the country. You get a sense of the uncertainty, the debate, the discussion that's going on. But when you cross the country, I think you see that we have a lot more in common than maybe expected.</p><p>[01:54:59] (MUSIC)</p><p>SESAY: The song that you have on the album, \"Hail to the Victor\", which you know, is taking again to really big, big issues, concerns -- about war, religion, drugs. But as the song I've listened in the opening scene there, the feeling was that it's still a very hopeful song.</p><p>LETO: Yes, I think so. I think there are songs in this album that are filled with optimism and hope and songs that talk about the times that we're living in.</p><p>There's a song called \"Walk on Water\" --</p><p>SESAY: I love that.</p><p>LETO: Thank you. It's about freedom. It's about standing up and fighting for what you believe in. And that's important, you know, not just in this time but at any time. SESAY: When you go to these concerts, when they see you on stage and in the days ahead, do you want them to leave with a particular feeling? Do you want them to take some thing in a particular way from this album?</p><p>I mean some creatives (ph) say no, they won't be able to take what they find and what they identify with.</p><p>LETO: I mean if I had my way, yes, I would love people to feel good. I would love people to feel some sense of possibility. I think when people come to a concert and there's 10,000 or 20,000 people in a room, sharing the same idea that's very unique especially in the times that we're living in, you've got a big group of people agreeing on something.</p><p>And I hope that people leave with a sense of excitement that they had a night that they'll never forget. And you know, I work really hard every night to make sure that that happens.</p><p>SESAY: Jared -- it's such a pleasure.</p><p>LETO: Yes, nice to talk to you.</p><p>SESAY: Thank you. Thank you very much.</p><p>LETO: Yes. Appreciate it.</p><p>SESAY: Thank you.</p><p>And the news continues right after this.

Ahead this hour:  Facebook faceoff.  (INAUDIBLE) grilled on Capitol Hill.  Why many say the Senate failed the Zuckerberg test.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They live to tell.  The Yazidi victims of ISIS expose the horror of what they were forced to endure.  I'll speak to a man who's documented hundreds of harrowing stories.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And (INAUDIBLE) and lead singer for 30 Seconds to Mars is here to talk America, the good, the bad and the ugly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hello and thank you for joining us.  I'm Isha Sesay.  This is NEWSROOM L.A.</p><p>Facebook's CEO is hours away from a second day of testimony before U.S. lawmakers. Mark Zuckerberg opened his first appearance before Congress with an apology for the release of user data involving a company called Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, COFOUNDER AND CEO, FACEBOOK:  Take a broad enough view of our responsibility and that was a big mistake.  And it was my mistake and I'm sorry.</p><p>I started Facebook, I run it and I'm responsible for what happens here.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SESAY:  The British firm was working on Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.  Facebook says that it accessed data from millions of users  improperly. But Analytica says it didn't use that data at all drying the campaign. </p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham pressed Zuckerberg on government regulation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN.  LINDSEY GRAHAM (R), S.C.:  You don't think you have a monopoly?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  It certainly doesn't feel like that to me.</p><p>GRAHAM:  OK.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  My position is not that there should be no regulation.  I think  the Internet is increasing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>GRAHAM:  -- embrace regulation? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I think the real question as the Internet becomes more important in people's lives is what is the right regulation, not whether there should be or --</p><p>GRAHAM:  -- You as a company welcome regulation? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I think if it's the right regulation then --</p><p>GRAHAM:  You think the Europeans have it right? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I think that they get things right.</p><p>GRAHAM:  Have you ever submitted --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GRAHAM:  -- that's true.</p><p>So would you work with us in terms of what regulations you think are necessary in your industry? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Absolutely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SESAY:  Zuckerberg is to appear again Wednesday before the House Committee.  Joining us now from Jerusalem with more on all of this is CNNMoney's technology and business correspondent Samuel Burke.</p><p>Samuel, before Zuckerberg appeared before the Senate, there had been a lot of talk about he was very uncomfortable when he's forced to defend Facebook, that he can be a little defiant, a little abrasive.  </p><p>But the appearance on Tuesday was smooth and he seemed very much in control and able to hold off those senators.</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  There were some awkward moments. There were some funny moments, like the one you just saw that got some laughter, which always bodes well for anybody in front of the world stage.  But I think the way that Mark Zuckerberg was really able to advance and get ahead of the senators was because there were so many questions here.  Remember Cambridge Analytica was the impetus for this testimony.  </p><p>But there were actually years of pent-up frustrations and questions for what's arguably the most powerful platform on planet Earth.  So they covered all types of topics, including what's arguably the question of our time, the possible connection between Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia and Facebook as a possible intermediary in a way. </p><p>And this was one place where Mark Zuckerberg actually seemed a little frustrated, maybe not well prepared.  Take a listen to the question that Democrat senator  Patrick Leahy put to Zuckerberg about the Mueller investigation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. PATRICK LEAHY (D), VERMONT:  I assume Facebook's been served subpoenas from the special counsel Mueller's office.</p><p>Is that correct?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Yes.</p><p>LEAHY:  Have you or anyone at Facebook been interviewed by the Special Counsel's Office?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Yes.</p><p>LEAHY:  Have you been interviewed --</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I have not.  I have not.</p><p>LEAHY:  Others have?</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  I believe so.  And I want to be careful here, because that -- our work with the special counsel is confidential and I want to make sure that, in an open session, I'm not revealing something that's confidential.</p><p>LEAHY:  I understand.  I just want to make clear that you have been contacted and you have had subpoenas.</p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Actually, let me clarify that.  I actually am not aware of a subpoena.  I believe that there may be, but I know we're working with them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE:  Isha, very surprising that, on such an important question, Mark Zuckerberg clearly has one answer and then walks it back.  That said, sometimes the best judge of how somebody's done in a situation like this is the stock price.  Facebook stock up 4.5 percent Tuesday, adding $20 billion of value onto the company and clearly investors thought that Zuckerberg was doing --</p><p>[01:05:00]</p><p>BURKE:  -- OK and that the senators really didn't push him hard enough.</p><p>SESAY:  Yes.  Definitely there is the sense that they didn't push him hard enough partly because they just didn't get it.  They just don't understand how Facebook actually works.  And in some ways this was a wasted opportunity.</p><p>BURKE:  I don't want to be ageist here but clearly you could see that age did play a factor, that some of the people, some of the senators don't use Facebook.  There was an exchange between Orrin Hatch, the senator, and Mark Zuckerberg, which is very telling.  Take a listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. ORRIN HATCH (R), UTAH:  How do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service? </p><p>ZUCKERBERG:  Senator, we run ads. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURKE:  So if he doesn't know that, maybe it doesn't bode well for data reform, which is the most important thing here.</p><p>Will laws be changed so that our data will be protected? </p><p>People around the world were watching this, all the tech CEOs of the startups here in Israel to the big tech companies in the United States, and wondering will there be a big change? </p><p>And I think it was a very weak signal.  A lot of people are hoping, especially tech journalists, that there is some more serious questions asked -- maybe the boxing gloves taken off, as Kara Swisher (ph) Recode said, in the House Wednesday, questions like, does Facebook track you when you're off of Facebook, as many people believe that it does and as Mark Zuckerberg indicated might do but let's get a clear answer on that in the House today. </p><p>And another question which I think is the most important personally, why would Facebook even share any of your data with these third-party companies, especially when they make little or no money doing that? </p><p>Their real money is made with their advertising. </p><p>Why give away your bread and butter when you could end up with a huge scandal like this, which, again is the impetus? </p><p>Cambridge Analytica is what got Mark Zuckerberg to Congress Tuesday and Wednesday.  So we'll see if people are tougher.</p><p>SESAY:  Yes, we will.  There are a lot more questions to be answered. I think you're absolutely right there.  Samuel Burke joining us there from Jerusalem, appreciate it.  Thank you.</p><p>Joining us now from Vancouver, Canada, is Richen Patel.  He's executive director of Avaaz.  Avaaz is an online activist group and the group set up a troll army of fake Mark Zuckerbergs on the council lawn ahead of Tuesday's Senate hearing.</p><p>And Richen, it is good to see you.  It wasn't dramatic and disturbing sight, 100 life-sized cutouts of the Facebook boss.</p><p>Dramatic it was.  But what was the message you were trying to get across?</p><p>RICHEN PATEL, AVAAZ:   Well, the message was democracy is getting gamed right now by fake users, fake profiles, fake movements, fake pages.  We wanted to try and create something that was visual and offline that conveyed how disturbing this was because this seems to be how democracy is  done these days.</p><p>And we're just awash in and social media is awash in these big profiles and movements and we wanted to just highlight that at the moment of Zuckerberg's testimony.</p><p>SESAY:  Do you think that the concern that you have here about the fake news and the disinformation, do you think that was addressed in any way, shape or form sufficiently at the hearing on Tuesday? </p><p>PATEL:  No, this is amidst the many embarrassments of the hearing today.  There was explaining how Facebook works.  But there was not a single push on Zuckerberg to commit any new commitment to protect our democracy.</p><p>We're looking at existential democratic threats.  We're seeing democracy get  gamed across the world and we've got crucial elections upcoming in Brazil and India and the U.S.  and Mexico and Zuckerberg admits he's in an arms race with Russia and other malicious actors. </p><p>But he's moving at a snail's pace and not a single commitment was obtained today.  It is really embarrassment on that front.  We're praying that the House does better tomorrow.</p><p>SESAY:  I think that were a couple things that were revealed and a couple of tensions and, again, they put it to Mark Zuckerberg and I don't know that he sufficiently dealt with it, this notion, is Facebook a technology company or is it a media company? </p><p>And as we talk about the notion of disinformation and all of that -- and I'm not sure that Zuckerberg sufficiently answered that.</p><p>What did you make of it?</p><p>Because that, again, is an existential question. PATEL:  Well, I think  from the perspective of millions of people around the world that are in our movement and that we poll all the time, they're worried about two things.  They're worried about this tremendous threat from social media, information operations, information warfare.  They're also worried about government stepping in too far and saying what's true and what's not and who can say what and who can't.</p><p>But even about Facebook stepping in.  So the solution that we see and that is widely supported in our polling is to just delete Fakebook. There's Facebook and there's Fakebook.  And Facebook has admitted that 13 percent of its accounts are fake.  And those accounts are very active. </p><p>So who knows what percentage of their activity, all those likes and comments are actually fake?</p><p>Why not just delete them?</p><p>They're actually violating Facebook's --</p><p>[01:10:00]</p><p>PATEL:  -- user policy.  They are the swamp that these disinformation campaigns swim in.  That's how the Russians get this stuff going and there's lot of bots to like things and push things and share things.</p><p>Why not delete it?</p><p>The answer's revenue.  Facebook makes money selling fake likes and fake news.  That's all of these advertisers.  And that's where we need to push right now, is to just delete the stuff.</p><p>SESAY:  You had this open letter, calling for specific action and you talked to (INAUDIBLE) calling for tell the truth, ban the bots, alert the public and fund the fact checkers.</p><p>But everything you saw on Tuesday, everything you heard, do you think these are steps that Facebook will take willingly without pressure, i.e., without the government forcing them to without regulation?</p><p>PATEL:  Honestly, as an activist, it's uncommon to do -- to be charitable towards corporations.  But I think the people who work at Facebook, the executives are not evil.  They actually are well- intentioned but they are moving way too slowly.</p><p>They are two steps behind the disinformation warriors.  And Mark Zuckerberg today, the most shocking thing he said is, look, our AI is working to ID these fake --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PATEL:  -- but it shouldn't be 5-10 years to clean it up.  And we don't have 5-10 months to do it.  And this is the kind of acceleration that we need them to do.  They're moving in a little direction, saying, oh, we're going to verify large pages. Well, if you can do large pages with lots of followers, why don't you verify medium size pages and small -- why not accounts at that -- like you have the capability to do it. </p><p>Why not do it? </p><p>And this is where I think they need to be pushed right now.</p><p>SESAY:  Richen Patel, my friend, it is nice to see you.  Thank you so much for joining us.  Very much appreciate it.</p><p>PATEL:  Pleasure.</p><p>SESAY:  Well, the U.S. and its allies are weighing how to respond to suspected chemical attack in Syria as a team of chemical weapons experts prepare to head to the country.  The U.S. and Russia squared off at the United Nations Security Council again Tuesday, effectively blocking each other's draft resolutions for investigations into last weekend's suspected attack in Douma.</p><p>The U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley accused Russia of protecting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad whom she called \"a monster\" instead of protecting Syria's people.</p><p>Russia's ambassador pushed back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  You are very well at threatening and the threats that you are -- that you are proffering, that you're stating vis-a-vis Syria, should make us seriously worried, all of us, because we could find ourselves on the threshold of some very sad and serious events.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SESAY:  CNN military analyst retired Lt. Col. Rick Francona joins us now from Oregon.</p><p>Col. Francona, good to see you as always.  </p><p>Are you surprised that we haven't heard of any action on the part of the U.S., given the forceful comments made by the president on Monday?</p><p>LT. COL. RICK FRANCONA (RET.), CNN MILITARY ANALYST:  Actually I'm not because if you recall what happened a year ago, the United States reacted very quickly to that provocation, that attack of Kanshakun (ph), a sarin attack.  </p><p>But this time it looks like they're -- the United States and its allies are talking about a concerted action, a much bigger action. And that's going to require some time to move forces into place.</p><p>It's one thing to fire 59 Tomahawks from a couple of vessels in the Mediterranean.  But if you're going to launch a longer, even a sustained attack, you're going to have to bring additional assets into the region, of course.  And that's going to require a little bit of planning, a little bit of time.</p><p>SESAY:  Longer, more sustained action possibly.  We don't exactly know what's going to happen.  But If that were the case, what would that achieve?</p><p>I guess it's two questions.  </p><p>What would that achieve?</p><p>And are we clear on what the end game is here?</p><p>FRANCONA:  Well,  two tough questions and I hope those are ---</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FRANCONA:  -- being addressed at the Pentagon right now because what will it achieve? </p><p>And  we've talked before and I've said that I don't think whatever we do is going to change the final outcome of the situation there.  It is just how it plays out.  I believe that no matter what we do, the Russians have pretty much guaranteed that Bashar al-Assad and his regime are going to survive.</p><p>The question is, in what capacity or what's the final situation going to look like?</p><p>Are the Syrians going to be -- have any say what happens in their country?</p><p>Or are they going to be dictated to by the Russians, the Turks and the Iranians and of course we're being frozen out of this very -- quite effectively by the Russians.  So is a military action going to achieve any change on the ground? </p><p>Probably not but it is going to indicate to the -- to the Syrians and the Russians that they cannot use these weapons of mass destruction, these chemical agents on innocent people without being any price to pay.</p><p>SESAY:  Yes, but this is -- they did it just a year ago.  I mean if the reports ultimately which they are by the U.N. and other investigators, as you just mentioned, Kanshakun (ph), some -- </p><p>[01:15:00]</p><p>SESAY:  -- 80 people died there.  There were 59 Tomahawk missiles fired.</p><p>And here we are, a year later, seeing --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SESAY:  -- and what is suspected chemical attack.  So again, if you're Bashar al-Assad or you're Vladimir Putin, and the finger of blame is being pointed at them, they're thinking to themselves, what of it? It doesn't change anything.</p><p>FRANCONA:  Well, it's interesting though but it did take them a year to use sarin again; that we're absolutely sure of, to launch this kind of attack.  The question I have is why would the Syrians do this?</p><p>They're on the verge of absolutely wiping out the resistance in those suburbs of Damascus.  There's actually a deal on the ground now where many of them are being allowed to leave and go north, mostly to Idlib.</p><p>The Syrians didn't need to use chemicals.  I doubt that the Russians had any role in this; they may -- they obviously turned a blind eye. But the Syrians probably didn't ask the council, the Russians to do this because the Russians would have said there is no need. Militarily it makes no sense to use chemicals when you're on the verge of that kind of victory. </p><p>So this was a real miscalculation on the part of Bashar al-Assad and I think he's going to pay a little bit of a price for it.  But as I say I don't see where this changes the final outcome.</p><p>SESAY:  For every action there's a reaction so if we take that, that truism and say there's a joint airstrike, a coalition airstrike, what happens next in terms of a reaction on the part of say Russia and Iran, Bashar al-Assad's backers?</p><p>FRANCONA:  Yes, that's the real calculation that has to be looked at, at the Pentagon.  It's just if we mount an attack and we take out some Syrian airbases, some Syrian facilities and, of course, there are Russians and Iranians at these facilities, you have to figure what if we kill some Iranian soldiers, some Russian troops? </p><p>What happens then?</p><p>Are the Russians then bound to react and do we start this tit-for-tat back and forth and pretty soon we find ourselves in a war?</p><p>SESAY:  Rick Francona, it's been more than seven years.  We've seen these images and it is just dreadful and heartbreaking.  We always appreciate the insight, thank you.</p><p>FRANCONA:  Sure thing, Isha.</p><p>SESAY:  Quick break here.

Mr. Trump's anger is boiling over as he decides what to do about the --</p><p>[01:20:00]</p><p>SESAY:  -- suspected chemical attack in Syria and what to do after the raid on his personal lawyer's office.  CNN's chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN SR. WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  Still furious but seething behind closed doors, President Trump declined to answer whether he's considering a dramatic move to try to end special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation.</p><p>But the White House made it clear the president thinks he has the authority to fire Mueller.</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  Certainly believes he has the power to do so.  The president has been clear that he thinks that this has gone too far and, beyond that, I don't have anything to add.</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over):  The other looming question is whether the president could force out or constrain Mueller by firing attorney general Jeff Sessions or deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein, who could name a different special prosecutor. </p><p>Asked about the fate of Sessions, who showed up, at all places, a celebration for the Alabama college football team...</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Mr. Attorney General, have you spoken with the president today?</p><p>SEN. JEFF SESSIONS (R-ALA.), U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  Hey, not today. Roll Tide!</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over):  -- the White House didn't exactly hold back the blitz of questions.</p><p>SANDERS:  I think the president  was pretty clear about his frustrations when he spoke about that last night.</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over):  While the raid at the office of the president's personal attorney, Michael Cohen, was ordered by the U.S. attorney's office in New York and not Mueller, Mr. Trump is outraged at the special counsel.</p><p>According to Justice Department rules, Rosenstein, a Republican, had to sign off on the Cohen raid.</p><p>TRUMP:  Why don't I fire Mueller? Well, I think it's a disgrace what's going on.  We'll see what happens.  But I think it's really a sad situation when you look at what happened.  And many people have said, \"You should fire him.\" </p><p>ACOSTA:  The president also vented his frustrations by tweeting:  \"The Russia investigation is a total witch hunt,\" adding, \"attorney-client privilege is dead.\" A continuation of the rant he unleashed while sitting next to top military commanders.</p><p>TRUMP:  And it's a disgrace.  It's frankly a real disgrace.  It's an attack on our country in a true sense.  It's an attack on what we all stand for.  So when I saw this and when I heard it -- I heard it like you did -- I said that is really now in a whole new level of unfairness.</p><p>ACOSTA:  Democrats are taking issue with the comparison.</p><p>SEN.  CHUCK SCHUMER (D-N.Y.), MINORITY LEADER:  The Japanese bombing Pearl Harbor was an attack on our country.  Nine-eleven was an attack on our country.  When Russia interfered with our elections, that was an attack on our country.</p><p>ACOSTA:  Republicans are urging caution, some with the hope the president is simply letting off some steam.</p><p>SEN.  MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), MAJORITY LEADER:  I don't think he's going to be removed from this office.  He shouldn't be removed from the office.  He should be allowed to finish the job.</p><p>ACOSTA:  While other GOP senators are warning Mr.  Trump to leave Mueller alone.</p><p>SEN.  CHUCK GRASSLEY (R-IA), JUDICIARY CHAIRMAN:  I think it would be suicide for the president to fire him.  I think the less the president says about this whole thing the better off he will be.  And I think that Mueller is a person of stature and respected; and I respect him. Just let the thing go forward.</p><p>ACOSTA:  The Cohen raid comes during another turbulent week at the White House as the president suddenly scrapped a trip to South America set for this weekend.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Are you disappointed not to go to South America?</p><p>TRUMP:  I am, actually.  I would have loved to have gone.</p><p>ACOSTA:  A decision that surprised even his top economic adviser, who thought Mr.  Trump was still going just this morning.</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, CHIEF WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISOR (via phone):  I'll be traveling with him, with the group going to Latin America.  This -- well, say, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.  Japanese summit after that in Florida.  I don't think it's going to stop him.  It never stops him. ACOSTA:  The White House said the president is no longer going to South America, where he was to attend the Summit of the Americas, so he can focus on the U.S.  response to the suspected chemical weapons attack in Syria.  </p><p>But the last time the president authorized airstrikes on Syria, we should point out, was when he was at Mar-a-Lago last year -- Jim Acosta, CNN, the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SESAY:  Ethan Bearman is a California talk radio host and Lanhee Chen is a research fellow and lecturer at Stanford University.</p><p>Gentlemen, great to have you with us once again.</p><p>Ethan, to you, the president not going on this trip and, as you saw, taking Larry Kudlow by surprise there, which some would say that moment in and of itself is a microcosm of all the issues at the White House.</p><p>ETHAN BEARMAN, TALK SHOW RADIO HOST:  Yes, really is.  It's interesting how the president just does things on a whim and doesn't notify, doesn't talk to advisors.  He just, I'm going to make the decision.  I don't want to do that.  I'm worried about Mueller thing. I'm worried about my attorney getting raided yesterday in Manhattan in a hotel room among other places as well. </p><p>So let's cancel what is actually arguably an exceptionally important trip to address what is happening in our own hemisphere with our Central American neighbors, with our South American neighbors.</p><p>If he is actually worried about things like undocumented workers coming across the border, he should be worried about working with those countries, building their economies and instilling confidence in their institutions and the rule of law because that would stop people from wanting to come here because they would be at home.</p><p>SESAY:  Lanhee, what do you make of it, the president's decision not to go?</p><p>And is it a missed opportunity that geopolitical ramifications?</p><p>LANHEE CHEN, FORMER ROMNEY PUBLIC POLICY DIRECTOR:  Well, certainly American leadership in the world is crucially important and --</p><p>[01:25:00]</p><p>CHEN:  -- these summits are more than just sort of gatherings of leaders.  They're opportunities for the United States to say these are the values and  these are the things that we stand for and that are important to us.</p><p>Now he's actually sending I guess Mike Pence and Marco Rubio, who I'm sure will do a very able job.  But they're not the President of the United States.  It's still different. And the president needs to demonstrate that America cares.  As Ethan says, the stuff that's going on in our own hemisphere is highly impactful.  It matters a lot to the American people and it matters a lot frankly to our sphere of influence as well.</p><p>And so the lack of American involvement in a direct way, I do think is problematic.</p><p>SESAY:  The president isn't going; he's staying.  One will assume some of that time will be spent fuming over all the events of recent days. </p><p>The chatter is getting louder and louder out of the White House in terms of how upset he is, at least that's what's being reported by \"The New York Times\" and others.</p><p>The question is, what does he do about it?</p><p>He's clearly  not happy about this raid on Michael Cohen's office. </p><p>What does he do next?</p><p>We heard Sarah Sanders, the White House press secretary, say he has the authority to fire Mueller.</p><p>BEARMAN:  Well, I think that would create a constitutional crisis.  I really do.  I don't believe you have the authority.  There's nothing clear that shows that he does.  That's Rod Rosenstein's place.  If somebody was going to fire Mueller, it would be Rod Rosenstein.</p><p>So it would be arguable that Rod Rosenstein is the one who would go and that he would try and find somebody who would go -- follow his desires in that position to then fire Mueller.</p><p>But I just want to say right now, I'm really glad that we have a president who doesn't have a dog for once because all presidents have dogs.  And I would be really worried with the level of instability that happens with our president, I don't want him kicking a dog.</p><p>SESAY:  Oh, Ethan.</p><p>BEARMAN:  I'm not actually kidding you.  I mean, the way he is overreacting to things right now, he throws tantrums.  It's bizarre, it's unhealthy, it's unstable, it's not good for the American people, it's not good for our government, it's not good for the world when our White House is in chaos right now. </p><p>SESAY:  Lanhee Chen, Sarah Sanders also refused to say that the president has confidence in the attorney general or Rod Rosenstein or Mueller.</p><p>What do you think about -- take from that and those three people who are in the presidents crosshairs?</p><p>CHEN:  Well, keep them guessing.  I think that's part of the idea here, is that the president has always been unpredictable and I think this is an extension of that.  Now obviously, if you take those three figures and you think about them sequentially, I think they're all sort of  very important in their own way. </p><p>So now Jeff Sessions is someone who came on as the original Trump loyalist but actually has resisted in a lot of ways what the president has tried to convince him to do.  And obviously the biggest part of that was recusing himself in the Russia investigation, a huge decision that I think a lot of people overlook. </p><p>But in fact think gives him a little more credibility.  He's really stuck with it.   Rod Rosenstein, he's someone who I think has pretty faithfully executed the job he's been given as well.</p><p>Now eliminating or firing Rosenstein would be clearly a major salvo toward Robert Mueller because it's Rod Rosenstein that ultimately has control over the Mueller investigation.</p><p>So the president may not go and fire Mueller directly.  I think that would be a pretty stupid thing to do.  But he could fire Rod Rosenstein and that would put Mueller in jeopardy, which is why people are so focused on Rosenstein and what might happen.</p><p>SESAY:  Ethan, do you want to see Congress pass legislation to insulate, protect Robert Mueller?</p><p>BEARMAN:  I think that if we had a spine in Congress, that they might actually do that because Republicans, for the most part, I think also recognize the severity of what we're facing right now and the importance of the rule of law and that this process gets followed to completion. </p><p>But I don't believe that they're going to do anything about it. They're afraid for their own base and the vote that is coming up in November this midterm is huge.  And the Democrats are demonstrating that they very likely will retake the House.</p><p>SESAY:  Lanhee.</p><p>CHEN:  Republicans are walking a very thin line here because, on the one side of it, they have to continue to emphasize at least the more reasonable ones are saying, Robert Mueller needs to be allowed to finish the job.  And I think that's absolutely true. </p><p>On the other hand, they are having a difficult time wrapping their arms around legislation to protect Robert Mueller because of the reasons Ethan's outlined now.  It's an election year; obviously those are issues that matter a lot.</p><p>The Republican base here in the United States is still very firmly in President Trump's corner.  And I think people don't realize that a lot of times when they think about what is happening in U.S. politics.</p><p>SESAY:  Last thing I'm going to throw out there, next week James Comey's book is published.  I think it comes out April 16th.  The press tour will start any moment now.</p><p>Anyone care to take a guess what will be in the book?</p><p>(INAUDIBLE) what the president will do when all the press starts and FOX News starts talking about said book?</p><p>BEARMAN:  If I'm Mike Pence, I'd be happy to be in South America and not in the White House when this book comes out.  There's going to be explosive material in it that is going to offend and upset President Trump terribly. </p><p>I just seriously, if I'm a White House staffer, I'm taking a vacation when this book comes out.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>[01:30:00] SESAY:  Lanhee -- ten seconds.</p><p>CHEN:  I would imagine that this next week is going to be spent a lot -- to put it (INAUDIBLE) this trite, try to discredit James Comey. But let's not forget he did have a very good career in law enforcement for a very long time and I hope people don't lose sight of that.</p><p>SESAY:  All right.  We'll be checking in on you next week as all the dust flies.</p><p>Ethan Bearman, Lanhee Chen -- we appreciate it.

Still to come his heartbreaking stories of rape and murder against the Yazidi population.</p><p>[01:38:33] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SESAY:  Eight-year-old boys bought and sold to build bombs and blow up other children on command.  Kidnapped women, tortured and raped, forced to watch decapitations and death by firing squad -- all in the name of ISIS. This was the fate of thousands of Yazidi people in Iraq.  Broken bodies and minds, witnesses to systematic brutality and persecution likened to the Holocaust.  But some escaped, many lived to tell.</p><p>Joining me, the man who has spoken to more than 200 of them -- Father Patrick Desbois, a Georgetown University professor and co-author of the about-to-be-published book \"The Terrorist Factory: ISIS, the Yazidi Genocide and Exporting Terror\".  Father Desbois -- welcome.</p><p>FATHER PATRICK DESBOIS, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY:  Thank you.  You're welcome.</p><p>SESAY:  You know, it's so apropos that we have you here right now talking about this book about ISIS and their crimes because right now in the news, there's been all this talk about U.S. troops pulling out of Syria and ISIS being on the run.  </p><p>You spoke with the people who have actually been with these people with ISIS in Iraq.</p><p>DESBOIS:  Yes, I'd just come back from Iraq.  That had been three weeks ago.  And I'm not sure ISIS is on the run so much.  They lost a lot of power but they have a long term vision.  You know, the program was to unmask ISIS because officially they rape girls.  That was what we show but I've tried to find what they didn't show and what they didn't show is hundreds of camps to train children.  </p><p>I interviewed like 45 with my team of Yahad.  I interviewed 45 children from seven years old to 11.  They don't remember their name. They don't remember their father's face, their mother's face.  They don't speak their language.  One speaks English because they had been sold to an American ISIS family.  One is speaking French because he has been sold to a French family.  One speaks Arabic because he'd been sold to a Jordanian family, et cetera.</p><p>And they told them, the others told them we will die.  We will die in Mosul.  We'll die in Iraq.  But you the children, the lion of the Caliphate, you will survive and you would have to act outside.</p><p>SESAY:  How did they do it?  Tell me.  You spoke to children.  What did they tell you about their day to day existence?</p><p>DESBOIS:  First, they extract them from their family.  They put them in camps.  They don't see the TV.  They woke up t 4:00.  They pray. After they have to (INAUDIBLE) the suffering; they walk on them.  They are not to cry.</p><p>And after specializing in commando (ph) -- free kind of commando; commando with Kalashnikov, commando to put bombs, commando to be beside bombers. </p><p>And after they make -- after I interviewed a child.  He was putting bombs to (INAUDIBLE).  Another one was putting bombs at a border of Kurdistan, et cetera.</p><p>So these children have been completely brainwashed and they feel like this.  They say I am Daesh.  I'm ISIS.</p><p>SESAY:  And when they say I'm Daesh, I'm ISIS -- what does that mean to them?  Does that mean them against the rest of the world, against non-Muslims?  What does that mean to them?</p><p>DESBOIS:  Even against their family -- it's why my organization we vow to talk, to try to bring them back because they are refugee, they don't know anymore who they are.</p><p>For example I interview a nine-year-old boy and he has been in ISIS three years.  He has been taken at six-year-old.  And at the end, he approached my camera man and said give me your bag, I will blow you. And he was yelling Allahu Akbar in the middle of the conversation. And the moment -- he doesn't know who he is.</p><p>And so we have to help these children to wake up from this nightmare of ISIS.  That's why I'm afraid is that in fact ISIS has a strategy to export them because these children are not only Yazidi, they could be French -- </p><p>SESAY:  Yes.</p><p>DESBOIS:  -- they could be German, they could be Americans, Saudi, Jordanians -- from anywhere.  It's an exportation machine -- ISIS.</p><p>SESAY:  It's a factory.</p><p>DESBOIS:  It's a factory of children in fact.</p><p>SESAY:  You talk about the mother there who doesn't recognize her child.  Talk to me about the experience of the mothers, of the women who I know, in cases some bought and sold as many as 25 times.  CNN has shown on our air video of slave markets of women being bought and sold.</p><p>Talk to me about where that fits in with ISIS' strategy, the abuse, the systematic abuse -- almost the factory element of how they treat women.</p><p>[01:44:57] DESBOIS:  When they arrest a family of Yazidi -- a doctor enters and check every girl was virgin.  If a girl is virgin, she will be taken in a group and sold by group to (INAUDIBLE) and are sold one by one.  </p><p>If she's beautiful she was sold to a high authority of ISIS and it's an awful story.  They will bring the girl in a hospital and they will rape her under anesthesia (ph) because they don't want her to remember she has been raped.  So that's if she's sold to a high-rank.</p><p>But if she's sold to lower rank, she would be raped, sold one day, sold two days, et cetera meaning today she has been sold 25 times, 35 times and she has a new name, she has to pray everyday.  She has to assure (ph) she's Muslim and she dreams to escape every day.  </p><p>SESAY:  Why the targeting of the Yazidi? DESBOIS:  Because they classify them as evil worshipers.  They say they have no vote (ph).  They are not believers so we have the right -- we have the legal right to treat them as slaves.</p><p>SESAY:  As we talk about you capturing these stories and you speaking to all of these people and capturing all of these stories in the book. It's even more important that books like these exist because they Yazidi haven't had justice.  There's been no one held accountable.</p><p>Do you hope that these stories will one day play a part in a trial or -- </p><p>DESBOIS:  We work very closely with the Justice in France, Justice in Germany and other countries to bring (INAUDIBLE) because effectively for the moment, nobody, nobody has been judged for genocide.  We say ISIS did a genocide.  Nobody said that Baghdadi did a genocide.</p><p>I think today if we were judging Hitler, we would judge him for terrorists because it's easier to judge.  But we have to unmask this genocide otherwise, it would be the first time a genocide happens with nobody guilty.</p><p>SESAY:  And you, how does it affect you personally as you talk about taking care of yourself.  You did all this work on the Holocaust. You're doing all this work on the Yazidi.  How about you and your spirit?</p><p>DESBOIS:  It's a fight.  All my people, we are 29 full time -- all my people working in that say we are more lonely than before because you passed on the other side of the mirror.  People like to sleep well and we don't sleep well.  I will always encourage my team also to have a psychoanalyst and I would say, of course, if I didn't pray, I'm not sure I will stay in this duty.</p><p>SESAY:  Father Desbois, we thank you for the work you do.</p><p>DESBOIS:  Thank you.</p><p>SESAY:  And congratulations on the book -- it's an important book.</p><p>DESBOIS:  Merci.</p><p>SESAY:  An important work.</p><p>Up next we speak with Academy award winning actor Jared Leto about his odyssey across the U.S. plus what motivated him to explore America in his new album with Thirty Seconds to Mars\".</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SESAY:  America -- land of the free, home of the brave.  Possibility, potential dreams realized.  That's the good.  </p><p>Then there's the bad, even ugly -- political tension, racial and economic division, drugs, guns and war.</p><p>[01:49:50] Thirty Seconds to Mars' ambitious new project tackles it all head on.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>SESAY:  The albums is called \"America\".  It is out now.  Academy-award winner Jared Leto is the band's lead singer.  He joins me now here in L.A.  Welcome.</p><p>JARED LETO, ACTOR AND SINGER:  Hi.</p><p>SESAY:  Congrats.</p><p>LETO:  By the way, that intro -- I want to take it and play it before every show.  It's so classy and so impactful, powerful.  It's great.</p><p>SESAY:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.</p><p>The album sounds great.  It is your first album in five years.</p><p>LETO:  Yes.</p><p>SESAY:  A lot of people have been waiting for it.  A lot of people have been excited.  You know, it's called.  \"America\".  It's a big sweeping title.  This is a big sweeping album.</p><p>LETO:  Yes.</p><p>SESAY:  But I guess my question to you is, is this more personal or political?</p><p>LETO:  It's a little bit of both.  It's so sure, it's personal, it's emotional.  It's creative and fun, provocative maybe at times.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>LETO:  This is a new chapter for Thirty Seconds to Mars and \"America\" is a very heavy-handed title, especially in the times we're living in now which is one of the reasons we have these crazy album covers -- these lists.</p><p>SESAY:  I want to talk about that.</p><p>LETO:  Yes.</p><p>SESAY:  What is the thinking behind -- is it ten, ten different album covers?</p><p>LETO:  I mean there are hundreds of different lists that we're using in billboards and snipes and street posters and album covers, you know.</p><p>SESAY:  What's the thinking and what conversation are you trying to start?</p><p>LETO:  I think individual the lists for me are -- they could be fun or funny, provocative.  They're interesting.  They're bizarre.  But together they kind of act like a time capsule. If you were to look back on these lists -- 10, 20, 30, 50, a hundred years from now I think you get a sense of the times that we're living in, the culture that we're all a part of.</p><p>SESAY:  You did this cross-country --</p><p>LETO:  Yes.</p><p>SESAY:  -- I don't want to put my grade -- I don't want to -- </p><p>LETO:  Honesty.</p><p>SESAY:  There was an honesty -- that's a perfect -- </p><p>LETO:  A long walk.</p><p>SESAY:  Yes.</p><p>LETO:  Yes.</p><p>SESAY:  First of all, why did you want to do that for this album?</p><p>LETO:  Well, the album is called \"America\" -- </p><p>SESAY:  Yes.</p><p>LETO:  -- and I thought retracing that journey that I took as a kid coming from New York, an art school kid, art school dropout, coming to California for the first time with my backpack and sleeping on Venice Beach.  It was something to kind of retracing my steps.  </p><p>It's a classic journey from East to West.  I got a chance to visit states that we're going to be playing shows out for our tour in June and July.  And I got on the streets.  I got in front of people, you know, talking to a trucker in Milwaukee who's shipping Harley Davidson's across the nation and hearing about his concerns of the future.</p><p>So I don't know, it was very much in line with the album and in the spirit of what we're doing and it was an incredible trip.  I met the most amazing people and I had the experience of a lifetime.</p><p>SESAY:  What surprised you on the journey as you talked to all these people?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LETO:  What surprised me -- what surprised me was the optimism that's still out there in the midst of such a conflict in times of instability and uncertainty, that people still hold on to hope.</p><p>SESAY:  What are they optimistic about?  About their own selves as individuals to push through or of the country as a collective?</p><p>LETO:  The country as a collective.  I think that the idea of the American dream, the idea of America, the possibility that we can leave this country in a better place for our children and our children's children.  I think people still held on to that acknowledging that we're in really difficult times.  But looking forward and hopeful that things can be different.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Can we get better?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Heck, yes.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I have that hope that America can change for the better.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Everything I have today is thanks to the United States.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  -- possibility.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  America is greater than it's ever been.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There's something positive that's going to come out of the negativity.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  We are all related.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SESAY:  Are you optimistic?</p><p>LETO:  I'm optimistic.  I mean I see a lot of unity out there.</p><p>I mean if you looked at the news, you obviously get a sense of the conflict in the country.  You get a sense of the uncertainty, the debate, the discussion that's going on.  But when you cross the country, I think you see that we have a lot more in common than maybe expected.</p><p>[01:54:59] (MUSIC)</p><p>SESAY:  The song that you have on the album, \"Hail to the Victor\", which you know, is taking again to really big, big issues, concerns -- about war, religion, drugs.  But as the song I've listened in the opening scene there, the feeling was that it's still a very hopeful song.</p><p>LETO:  Yes, I think so.  I think there are songs in this album that are filled with optimism and hope and songs that talk about the times that we're living in.</p><p>There's a song called \"Walk on Water\" -- </p><p>SESAY: I love that.</p><p>LETO:  Thank you.  It's about freedom.  It's about standing up and fighting for what you believe in.  And that's important, you know, not just in this time but at any time. SESAY:  When you go to these concerts, when they see you on stage and in the days ahead, do you want them to leave with a particular feeling?  Do you want them to take some thing in a particular way from this album?</p><p>I mean some creatives (ph) say no, they won't be able to take what they find and what they identify with.</p><p>LETO:  I mean if I had my way, yes, I would love people to feel good. I would love people to feel some sense of possibility.  I think when people come to a concert and there's 10,000 or 20,000 people in a room, sharing the same idea that's very unique especially in the times that we're living in, you've got a big group of people agreeing on something.</p><p>And I hope that people leave with a sense of excitement that they had a night that they'll never forget.  And you know, I work really hard every night to make sure that that happens.</p><p>SESAY:  Jared -- it's such a pleasure.</p><p>LETO:  Yes, nice to talk to you.</p><p>SESAY:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.</p><p>LETO:  Yes.  Appreciate it.</p><p>SESAY:  Thank you.</p><p>And the news continues right after this.  You're watching CNN.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[02:00:01] SESAY:  This is CNN NEWSROOM live from Los Angeles.

Don\u2019t miss our special FirstFT year in review quiz (link below). We\u2019ll be back in January with a preview of 2020 \u2014 in the meantime, we wish season\u2019s greetings to all our readers.</emphasis></p><p>In the news</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Boris Johnson takes Britain</emphasis>\u00a0<br/>The former mayor of London achieved a\u00a0 life-long goal, ascending to lead the Conservative party and entering Number 10. Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership capped a year of political turbulence:\u00a0 three Brexit deadlines missed,\u00a0 Theresa May\u2019s premiership scuttled and a\u00a0 rare judicial intervention in parliament. A December election, the first in a century, was widely seen as a\u00a0 gamble\u2014 but\u00a0 paid off handsomely for the Tories, who achieved their\u00a0 largest electoral majority in three decades. Britain enters 2020 facing a\u00a0 January 31 Brexit target and a premier determined to meet it. What seems less secure is the\u00a0 very integrity of the United Kingdom itself.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Washington whirlpool\u00a0</emphasis><br/>The year began in Washington with speculation about whether\u00a0 Robert Mueller\u2019s report would lead to Donald Trump\u2019s removal from office and ended with an impeachment vote on the US president\u2019s conduct with\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/trump-impeachment-inquiry\">Ukraine</url>. House Speaker\u00a0 Nancy Pelosi took the decision to pursue\u00a0 impeachment proceedings after details of a\u00a0 July 25 phone call between Mr Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart were leaked by a\u00a0 CIA whistleblower. Mr Trump in December became only the third US president in history \u2014 after Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998 \u2014 to be\u00a0 impeached by the House. The chances of Mr Trump being\u00a0 removed from office, however, are remote: the president would need to lose the support of 20 Senate Republicans because a two-thirds majority is needed to convict.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Global trade tensions</emphasis>\u00a0<br/>In the US-China trade war, officials fluctuated between\u00a0 optimism and\u00a0 escalation, before settling on a\u00a0 \u201cphase one\u201d agreement in a December detente. China wasn\u2019t alone in facing US trade hostility this year: Mr Trump taxed a swath of\u00a0 European goods in retaliation for illegal aircraft subsidies and reimposed levies on\u00a0 Brazil and Argentina the same day he threatened 100 per cent tariffs on\u00a0 French goods. Among the world\u2019s trade blocs, North American policymakers came to a long-awaited\u00a0 USMCA deal, while South America\u2019s\u00a0 Mercosur members battled to keep the group intact. In Asia,\u00a0 Japanese-South Korean tensions received a last-minute reprieve.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The climate crisis</emphasis>\u00a0<br/>The mounting impact of climate change was undeniable this year: unprecedented fires raged in the\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://ig.ft.com/amazon-conservation/\">Amazon</url>,\u00a0 California and\u00a0 Australia while Japan endured a record\u00a0 typhoon.\u00a0 Greta Thunberg took the UN Climate Action Summit by storm, accusing the adults in the room of offering only\u00a0 \u201cempty words\u201d. Activism and a\u00a0 preponderance of data, however, was no match for stubborn world leaders. Donald Trump formally requested to\u00a0 withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, and the global community\u00a0 failed to reach agreement on carbon credit trading.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Banks buffeted\u00a0</emphasis><br/>For central banks, 2019 was a year of monetary policy reversals. Having increased interest rates in 2018, the US Federal Reserve was forced to\u00a0 reduce them thrice in the face of slowing growth in the US and around the world.\u00a0 Mario Draghi indicated the European Central Bank would resume its bond-buying programme before handing over the presidency to\u00a0 Christine Lagarde. In Japan, the\u00a0 home of deflation since the 1990s, the central bank continued to print money and the Bank of England received a new governor:\u00a0 Andrew Bailey.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unicorns stumbled</emphasis><br/>It was\u00a0 meant to be the year that Silicon Valley\u2019s unicorns lit up Wall Street. But IPOs for\u00a0 Uber,\u00a0 Lyft and workplace chat app\u00a0 Slack all disappointed as investors poured cold water on the pre-IPO hype. WeWork, expected to be the biggest listing of the year, retreated from public markets as investors became alarmed by a series of scandals involving co-founder\u00a0 Adam Neumann, forcing the office rental company to\u00a0 shelve its IPO. But there was some good news for markets:\u00a0 Alibaba \u201creturned home\u201d with an $11bn secondary listing on the Hong Kong stock exchange.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hong Kong rebelled</emphasis><br/>Hong Kong erupted this year, the previously staid Asian financial centre becoming the scene of fiery street battles between black-clad protesters and police. The unrest was provoked in June by a bill permitting suspects to be\u00a0 extradited to mainland China, but evolved into the\u00a0 most serious political challenge yet to Chinese president Xi Jinping. While Hong Kong captured global attention, it was\u00a0 far from alone: youth-fuelled protests tested and toppled governments in\u00a0 Bolivia,\u00a0 Iraq,\u00a0 Lebanon,\u00a0 Chile and elsewhere as economic frustration and political paralysis shook status quos around the world.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Boeing hit turbulence</emphasis><br/>2019 has been the\u00a0 most disastrous year in the illustrious history of US aircraft manufacturer Boeing. Two fatal crashes involving the company\u2019s best-selling Boeing 737 Max aircraft left 346 dead and the company\u2019s reputation in tatters. The\u00a0 costs of the crisis have mounted for the aerospace group and its\u00a0 global suppliers after regulators around the world\u00a0 grounded the aircraft in March. Boeing has now\u00a0 suspended production of the plane as it awaits the all-clear to put the 737 Max back in the air.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aramco\u2019s ambitions</emphasis><br/>After nearly four years of anticipation, Saudi Arabia finally launched a listing for its state oil company in December. But the\u00a0 $25.6bn IPO on Riyadh\u2019s Tadawul exchange \u2014 the world\u2019s largest ever \u2014\u00a0 fell short of Crown Prince\u00a0 Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s stratospheric\u00a0 ambitions, as foreign investors shied away. The listing was just one\u00a0 speed bump for energy markets, with a\u00a0 missile attack in September briefly crippling Saudi production and\u00a0 tankers detained in the Strait of Hormuz.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Backlash against Big Tech</emphasis>\u00a0<br/>\u201cSurveillance capitalism\u201d entered the popular lexicon this year as society\u00a0 questioned the power of today\u2019s tech giants. While Big Tech giants made efforts to\u00a0 diversify, Facebook faced\u00a0 major hurdles in its attempt to leap into financial services.\u00a0 Lawmakers grilled Mark Zuckerberg on the planned digital currency Libra and put pressure on Facebook over\u00a0 political adverts, which\u00a0 Twitter banned. The emergent platform of 2019 was\u00a0 TikTok, but by the year\u2019s end the viral video app faced a US\u00a0 national security probe into its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Google, meanwhile, claimed to have created the world\u2019s first\u00a0 quantum computer.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Epstein\u2019s echoes</emphasis>\u00a0<br/>Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s death shone a harsh light on the high-society in which the former financier operated, which included\u00a0 US presidents (past and present),\u00a0 powerful businessmen and even\u00a0 British royalty\u2014 a Trump\u00a0 cabinet secretary and\u00a0 MIT\u2019s Media Lab director were dumped. The investigation into the convicted sex offender\u2019s death in jail has raised questions about America\u2019s\u00a0 legal system,\u00a0 penal institutions and\u00a0 universities. The whereabouts of\u00a0 Ghislaine Maxwell, his alleged co-conspirator, remain a mystery, and for Mr Epstein\u2019s\u00a0 victims, his suicide ended hopes of justice.</p><p>Most read by you</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The most-read FirstFT stories in 2019</emphasis></p><p>Robert Shrimsley: Brexit policy shows the Liberal Democrats are not serious about power</p><p>Republicans raise concern over Trump Ukraine telephone call</p><p>No 10\u2019s concessions in race to break Brexit deadlock</p><p>Here\u2019s how to buy the best bookshelves</p><p>Laura Deming: \u2018I wanted to work on the world\u2019s most important problem</p><p>Amazon\u2019s puffa jacket success sends shivers through luxury sector</p><p>Tim Harford: how behavioural economics helped kick my phone addiction</p><p>Philip Stephens: Three things to know about Boris Johnson\u2019s premiership</p><p>Simon Kuper: How schools are fighting fake news</p><p>How to talk down the price of a house</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">And the most popular stories from elsewhere</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://narratively.com/the-man-with-the-golden-airline-ticket/\"> The man with the golden airline ticket</url> (Narratively)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/05/the-five-key-takeaways-from-trumps-state-of-the-union-address\"> The key points from Trump\u2019s State of the Union address</url> (Guardian)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-04-01/birth-control-app-natural-cycles-is-more-effective-than-the-pill\"> It\u2019s tough being the first birth control app</url> (Bloomberg)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/06/iphone-session-replay-screenshots/\"> Many popular iPhone apps secretly record your screen without asking</url> (TechCrunch)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2019/02/05/why-are-women-lawmakers-wearing-white-state-union/\"> Why did women in Congress wear white at Trump\u2019s State of the Union?</url> (WaPo)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/15/gillette-metoo-ad-on-toxic-masculinity-cuts-deep-with-mens-rights-activists\">Gillette #MeToo razors ad on \u2018toxic masculinity\u2019 gets praise \u2014 and abuse</url> (Guardian)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/07/mh370-malaysia-airlines/590653/\"> What really happened to Malaysia\u2019s missing airplane</url> (Atlantic)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-03/what-happens-when-an-economist-walks-into-a-brothel?srnd=businessweek-v2&amp;sref=PhB3liAe\"> What happens when an economist walks into a brothel?</url> (Bloomberg)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/style/the-awkward-art-of-office-small-talk.html\"> The awkward but essential art of office chit-chat</url> (NYT)</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/have-aliens-found-us-a-harvard-astronomer-on-the-mysterious-interstellar-object-oumuamua\"> Have aliens found us?

Lisa Murkowski, the fourth possible Republican swing vote, told reporters she would announce her position on Friday morning.</p><p>Mr Alexander\u2019s no vote would probably mean a 50-50 tie, in which case some Democrats were hoping that John Roberts, the chief justice of the supreme court presiding over the trial, might break the tie in favour of witnesses but that is thought unlikely. Here\u2019s what happens if the Senate vote is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/happens-theres-tie-vote-impeachment-trial-complicated\"> tied</url>.</p><p>The vote on whether to allow testimony from new witnesses will take place on Friday. The vote on whether to convict or acquit Mr Trump is expected to follow shortly after.</p><p>A vote acquitting Mr Trump of all charges would allow the president to claim victory ahead of Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses, which launch the 2020 presidential election campaign, and his State of the Union address to Congress on Tuesday. During the Washington trial, supporters of the president have remained faithful, like those at a recent rally in Wildwood, New Jersey.

But although the country awakes on Saturday to a new era in its history the task of Boris Johnson and his new government is now to heal the rifts caused by the Brexit process and to build a new framework of ties with the EU and wider world, says our latest editorial. </p><p>Mr Johnson has cautioned against \u201ctriumphalism\u201d, with British embassies instructed not to hold celebratory events on Friday. \u201cIt\u2019s all very strange \u2014 it\u2019s like we\u2019re slinking out of the EU,\u201d said one diplomat. </p><p>The PM himself will hold his weekly cabinet meeting in the northern city of Sunderland, the first to declare support for leaving the EU in 2016 and home to a Nissan auto plant bound up in EU trade negotiations. </p><p>Our Brexit Briefing recounts Thursday in Brussels, where Britain bid farewell with a song and a tear ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://ep.ft.com/newsletters/577b86070988bc03007f195b/subscribe\"> sign up here</url>).

(FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">European economic gloom</emphasis><br/>The French and Italian economies, the second and third largest economies in the eurozone, both shrank unexpectedly in the final quarter of 2020. \u201cThe spectre of recession is back,\u201d said one economist.

But locals\u2019 reaction to the \u20ac4bn project has been less euphoric, reflecting a broader nimbyism that has also hit wind energy. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Loeb criticises Washington \u2018swamp\u2019</emphasis><br/>Activist investor Daniel Loeb has launched a stinging attack on the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s plans to curb the power of shareholder advisory firms, saying the regulator has been misled by corporate lobbyists.

In nine charts, the FT summarises the Brexit years\u2014 so far. Martin Wolf unwinds the UK\u2019s employment and productivity puzzle.

In Antarctica, a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-51097309\"> \u201cdoomsday\u201d glacier</url> roughly the size of Britain accounts for 4 per cent of sea level rise each year.

The years since her 2012 scientific breakthrough have seen a frenzy of Crispr-ing that has put her at the heart of a moral maelstrom. \u201cI don\u2019t want it to be something that is only available to a few. That\u2019s a big push, a big challenge,\u201d she says of her discovery.

But two truly disruptive technologies have reverberated through Wall Street: the cloud and electric vehicles. Both were deemed inferior to established practices, Richard Waters writes, but are now tipping markets in their favour. In the US, a fight over regulating Big Tech could <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-30/big-tech-fight-brews-between-the-right-s-kochs-and-mercers\"> split the rightwing</url>. (FT, Bloomberg)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The courage to disagree</emphasis><br/>It might seem strange, in this divided age, to call for people to speak out if they see things differently.

Lawmakers also passed a second article of impeachment accusing Mr Trump of obstructing Congress\u2019s inquiry.

Finally, meet the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/18/trump-impeachment-tourists-086736\"> impeachment tourists</url> visiting Washington to witness the historic event. (FT, NYT, Politico)</p><p>In the news</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Airbnb wins big legal victory in Europe</emphasis><br/>Europe\u2019s top court has ruled that the home rental site Airbnb does not need to comply with the onerous regulations applied to property agents in the EU. In a rare sign of co-operation among Big Tech groups, Apple, Amazon and Google have formed an alliance to improve smart home devices in an effort to avoid a turf war. Meanwhile, the UK government will create a new technology regulator next year to police companies such as Facebook and Google after Brexit, according to several people involved in the process. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Queen\u2019s Speech</emphasis><br/>Britain\u2019s new legislative programme will be unveiled by the Queen on Thursday, in a ceremony stripped of some of its pomp. It will include bills to take Britain out of the EU by January 31 and improve public funding for the National Health Service. Here are the key Brexit dates ahead. Meanwhile, Emily Thornberry, shadow foreign secretary, became the first candidate to formally enter the Labour leadership race. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WorldCom chief released</emphasis><br/>The former chief executive of WorldCom was granted early release from prison on Wednesday, 13 years into a 25-year sentence in consideration of his declining health. Bernard Ebbers came to symbolise an era of corporate corruption for orchestrating an $11bn accounting fraud that was then the largest in US history. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Warren Buffett\u2019s power company under fire for coal plant closures</emphasis><br/>PacifiCorp, an electric utility owned by Warren Buffett\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway, is facing criticism for accelerating plans to install wind turbines, solar panels and battery storage, while retiring coal-fired generators in the US west. Wyoming, which mines 40 per cent of US coal, has launched an investigation into the company\u2019s plan. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">White House agrees to cheaper drug imports from Canada</emphasis><br/>The Trump administration has laid out a plan that would allow certain drugs to be imported from Canada, where they can cost a third to a tenth of US list prices. Announcing the plan alongside the governor of Florida, a swing state where healthcare costs are particularly important because of its large population of retirees, the health and human services secretary Alex Azar said it was a \u201creally historic day for healthcare\u201d. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BoE pressers hacked</emphasis><br/>The Bank of England has acknowledged that high-speed traders were able to listen in on market-sensitive press conferences before they were officially broadcast after one of its suppliers hacked into its systems. The UK\u2019s financial watchdog has launched an investigation into the claims. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">India deal drawn into Wirecard scandal</emphasis><br/>The FT has published its latest investigation into Wirecard, the German technology company. It examines allegations of \u201cround tripping\u201d, where sales and profits are faked by sending money to a third party, who then uses it to buy services from the sender, and poses a simple question: why did the German company agree to pay around \u20ac300m for an Indian business only weeks after it changed hands for \u20ac37m? Read more on the investigation <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/wirecard\"> here</url>. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">India bans New Delhi demonstrations</emphasis><br/>India has banned demonstrations in New Delhi and shut down mobile networks across the country as authorities struggle to contain protests against a new citizenship bill. Police have made hundreds of arrests since protests erupted last week after Narendra Modi\u2019s government passed a new citizenship law that critics say marginalises Muslims and violates the constitution of the world\u2019s largest democracy. This is a profile of Amit Shah, Mr Modi\u2019s right-hand man. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bolivia issues arrest warrant for Evo Morales</emphasis><br/>Prosecutors in Bolivia have issued an arrest warrant for former president Evo Morales, accusing him of \u201csedition, terrorism and the financing of terrorism\u201d in the turbulent weeks following his resignation in October and his escape to Mexico.

A chartered ANA flight carried 206 Japanese citizens out of the city, while a US flight departed earlier on Wednesday carrying government staff and civilians. Other countries, including Britain, Germany and Italy, have said they plan evacuations.

KFC, Pizza Hut and McDonald\u2019s have also closed outlets in China. The impact is also being felt in the technology sector. Apple, which released record earnings on Tuesday (more on this below), warned of the virus\u2019s \u201cpotential impact\u201d on this quarter\u2019s results.

Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers wrapped up the impeachment trial\u2019s opening arguments with an impassioned defence of the US president. Today begins a new phase in the trial, which will see senators asking questions about the case.

The EU proposal largely mimics the UK strategy to exclude equipment from high-risk vendors from the sensitive \u201ccore\u201d of a network. The Trump administration considers the UK decision a craven surrender of national sovereignty that could strain the US-UK \u201cspecial relationship\u201d.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nissan\u2019s \u2018invisible\u2019 chief</emphasis><br/>Just two months into his tenure, Nissan\u2019s chief executive Makoto Uchida is facing doubts from insiders who say the carmaker needs decisive leadership to heal the wounds with French alliance partner Renault, which\u00a0 named Luca de Meo as its chief executive.

The statement by Mr Kuroda followed a highly unusual and significant intervention from Jay Powell, chairman of the Federal Reserve. He said on Friday the US central bank would \u201cact as appropriate\u201d to support growth, suggesting it was ready to cut interest rates at its next meeting on March 17-18. The Bank of England said it was working with UK regulators and other central banks \u201cto ensure all necessary steps are taken to protect financial and monetary stability\u201d as calls grow for policymakers to intervene.</p><p>Elsewhere, Italy is to inject \u20ac3.6bn into its economy to mitigate the impact of the largest outbreak of coronavirus in Europe. Roberto Gualtieri, Italy\u2019s economy minister, said on Sunday the government would introduce tax credits for companies that reported a 25 per cent drop in revenues, as well as tax cuts and extra cash for the health system. Bruno Le Maire, France\u2019s finance minister, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-02/le-maire-g7-finance-ministers-to-coordinate-on-coronavirus?sref=PhB3liAe\"> warned</url> that the hit to the French economy would be \u201cmuch more significant\u201d than the 0.1 per cent forecast when the Covid-19 outbreak was restricted to mainland China.</p><p>In Asia, China\u2019s factory activity plunged to an all-time low in February, according to data released on Saturday. In other developments over the weekend Mike Pence, the US vice-president, authorised state health officials to close schools if necessary to contain the coronavirus as President Donald Trump announced new travel restrictions as two people died of the virus over the weekend.</p><p>Follow our live coverage here and the latest figures on the outbreak, which has now killed more than 3,000.

The FT View is that Britain\u2019s bellicose position is not as hardline as it seems, but Wolfgang M\u00fcnchau writes that the UK\u2019s threat to walk out in June is real. The UK also publishes US trade objectives on Monday.

Donations to 2020 presidential candidates from employees of the state\u2019s most prominent tech firms totalled $1.1m by the end of January 2020 in the Golden State, the biggest prize of the 14 states which vote on Super Tuesday.

But perhaps the most radical ambition is to generate profits almost from the get-go, defying dire industry-wide projections. Andrew Hill writes that VW is right to hire a young climate activist to challenge senior executives. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Find an anti-role model</emphasis><br/>The \u201cinspiration\u201d market is booming, but much of it frames work as a quasi-religious experience.

It also imposes a cap of $5,110 on sick leave for adults, and $2,000 for staff who take leave from work to care for a child or person quarantined because of the virus.</p><p>But negotiations with congressional Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, and the White House could be testy. Democrats faulted the Republican plan for providing insufficient aid to workers as the economy rapidly sheds jobs.</p><p>As well as the massive stimulus package for US households and business, Donald Trump also said his government was open to taking equity stakes in companies as the economy grinds to a halt because of the pandemic.</p><p>The order by Gavin Newsom, governor of California, to all the state\u2019s citizens is similar to lockdowns already introduced in Italy, Spain and France. It follows new advice from the Trump administration that US citizens should avoid all international travel.

Popular\u00a0 hedge fund bets have been hammered, including by Millennium and Schonfeld. Two US senators, meanwhile, offloaded millions of dollars in stocks shortly before US markets crashed.

Swiss drugmaker Roche announced it was launching an FDA-approved trial for a potential new Covid-19 drug. Clinical trials in China of an anti-flu drug called Avigan suggest it appears to be an effective treatment for coronavirus.

Lufthansa, the world\u2019s second-largest airline, warned that it was likely to emerge as a smaller business. Airlines want to defer payments to Europe\u2019s air traffic controllers, worth about \u20ac500m a month, as they battle a deepening cash crisis. What can Boeing buy with $60bn?

MSCI\u2019s Asia Pacific index dropped 2.5 per cent, while the Stoxx Europe 600 fell 4 per cent and the FTSE 100 dropped by 3.6 per cent. S&amp;P 500 futures suggested Wall Street\u2019s benchmark index would decline 2 per cent.</p><p>The renewed selling comes after the S&amp;P 500 ended down 4.4 per cent on Thursday, its worst one-day performance since 2011, taking its decline since a peak last week to 12 per cent, into correction territory. Goldman Sachs predicted on Thursday that US companies would \u201cgenerate no earnings growth in 2020\u201d.</p><p>But as investors increase bets that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates in response to the health crisis, questions were being asked about whether monetary policy can help. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, warned on Friday the coronavirus would hit the UK economy in the months ahead. The euro and gold are benefiting from the panic. </p><p>In Asia, China has issued a record number of force majeure certificates to exempt local exporters from fulfilling contracts, while start-ups are struggling to maintain funding. Shenzhen\u2019s tech-focused index is now the world\u2019s best performing this year even as risky assets have been hammered.

The latest setback follows an announcement on Sunday that Saudi Arabia had significantly pared back its ambitious listing plans for the state-owned oil company. The Kingdom will now sell just 1.5 per cent of the group\u2019s total shares to investors, raising between $24bn-$25.6bn, a fraction of the $100bn it had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-17/saudi-aramco-accepts-lower-ipo-price-and-defines-limits\"> hoped for</url>.

Here\u2019s our guide to the inquiry. (FT, WSJ)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Boris Johnson reverses tax cut promise</emphasis><br/>Britain\u2019s prime minister has reversed a promise to cut corporation tax. Speaking to Britain\u2019s business bosses, Boris Johnson said the \u00a36bn saved by the U-turn would be spent on the NHS and other public services. Later, Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the opposition Labour party, will outline plans to help tackle climate change at a Confederation of British Industry conference. The leaders were speaking to business as polls show the Conservative party\u2019s lead widening with less than a month to go until the general election. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yahoo Japan and Line to merge</emphasis><br/>SoftBank-backed Yahoo Japan and messaging app Line have agreed to merge to create a south-east Asian powerhouse in data and artificial intelligence worth \u00a53.3tn ($30bn). SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son has long pitched the merger as a way to compete against bigger groups in China and Silicon Valley, according to people familiar with the discussions. Elsewhere, ByteDance is in talks with the world\u2019s largest record companies for global licensing deals as the Chinese company behind TikTok prepares to challenge Spotify and Apple with its own music streaming service.

Carl Icahn, the activist investor who owns stakes in both companies, described the potential deal \u201ca no-brainer\u201d.

But the TV appearance turned into a PR disaster, engulfing him in a royal sex-and-propriety scandal unmatched since the 1990s. It was packed with bizarre alibis and unleashed a wave of excoriating coverage and amplified accusations over his connections to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. (FT, BBC)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Former Goldman </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sachs partner dies</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">at 81</emphasis><br/>Roy Smith ran Goldman Sachs\u2019 international operations in the 1980s and was based in London, when Margaret Thatcher was British prime minister and the City of London was undergoing the biggest transformation in decades following the \u201cbig bang\u201d. But Mr Smith, who studied at Harvard Business School with Michael Bloomberg, would have more of an impact on the public as an academic at New York University, where he became one of the investment industry\u2019s foremost academic chroniclers.

Previous state media accounts appeared to date Mr Xi\u2019s earliest direct involvement to a January 20 statement. </p><p>China\u2019s central bank on Monday cut a key medium-term lending rate in an attempt to prop up the economy. The reduction is expected to filter through to the loan prime rate, a benchmark for the broader financial system. Chinese equities rallied on expectations the stimulus measures will be part of a programme aimed at dulling the negative economic and financial effects of the coronavirus outbreak. The intervention by the People\u2019s Bank of China put the renminbi on track for its first rise in four days.</p><p>Reported new cases of the Covid-19 virus rose to 2,048 on Sunday evening, taking the total to 70,548. The death toll increased by 105 to 1,770. For the latest on the number of reported cases of the outbreak, check our dynamic map.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">In other developments:</emphasis></p><p>Japan has confirmed another 99 cases of coronavirus on board the stricken Diamond Princess cruise ship, currently under quarantine in Yokohama, taking the total number of cases on the vessel to 454. On Sunday night, the US evacuated more than 300 of its citizens on board the ship. </p><p>Cathay Pacific, Hong Kong\u2019s de facto flag carrier, has warned that its \u201cfinancial results for the first half of 2020 will be significantly down on the same period last year\u201d. Inbound traffic to Hong Kong, the airline\u2019s main hub, was down 40 per cent in January compared with a year earlier.</p><p>Samsung has begun flying electronic components for its latest Galaxy phones from China to its factories in Vietnam, where it produces nearly two-thirds of its phones. The coronavirus crisis has left Vietnam\u2019s manufacturers, both local and foreign-owned, vulnerable in areas from electronics to textiles and footwear because many have supply chains that rely on China.

The plan has found support from Abu Dhabi\u2019s state fund Mubadala and the government of Kazakhstan but would mark a sharp deviation from the vision of SoftBank\u2019s founder Masayoshi Son, who created the telecoms company\u2019s investment arm to take stakes in private, technology-focused start-ups and profit from scaling them up. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Japanese economic data worse than expected</emphasis><br/>Japan\u2019s economy shrunk at an annual rate of 6.3 per cent in the fourth quarter after last autumn\u2019s rise in the country\u2019s consumption tax. The contraction was far worse than expected and puts pressure on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and the Bank of Japan to mount a policy response. The dismal figures suggest that stimulus measures to cushion the effects of the tax rise were ineffective.

Her remarks echoed those of Mark Esper, US defence secretary, and Mike Pompeo, secretary of state, at the annual Munich security conference over the weekend. The stark rhetoric was contested by Wang Yi, China\u2019s foreign minister. The risk being discussed on the sidelines of the Munich conference was that the Europeans may end up crushed between Washington and Beijing, writes our Brussels Briefing (sign up <url normalizedValue=\"https://ep.ft.com/pages/newsletters/566825b8cb56e60cea589e91/subscribe/success\"> here</url>). Here are the highlights from the conference. Meanwhile, the US is turning to Qualcomm for its 5G buildout, as Rana Foroohar reports in her latest Swamp Notes. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ex-justice officials call for US attorney-general to resign</emphasis><br/>More than 1,100 former justice department officials have called on US attorney-general William Barr to resign, accusing him of doing Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cbidding\u201d by intervening to reduce the proposed sentence of the president\u2019s longtime friend Roger Stone. Over the weekend Donald Trump ignored his attorney-general\u2019s plea to stop tweeting and asserted it was his \u201clegal right\u201d to direct criminal cases as he wished. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brexit warnings</emphasis><br/>France\u2019s foreign minister has warned that the UK and EU face bitter negotiations over their future relationship. The warning from Jean-Yves Le Drian comes ahead of a speech on Monday by the UK\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, where he is expected to say that the chances of a deal are being undermined by Brussels\u2019 insistence that Britain sticks to EU rules. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GM to exit Australia and New Zealand </emphasis><br/>General Motors is pulling out of Australia and New Zealand, retiring its 160-year-old Holden brand and selling its factory in Thailand in the latest phase of its global restructuring. GM said China\u2019s Great Wall Motors had agreed to buy its Thai manufacturing plant and that the moves would incur cash and non-cash charges of $1.1bn. The news comes as Geely sets its sights on becoming China\u2019s first global carmaker. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dubai port operator delists</emphasis><br/>DP World, which operates ports in 50 countries around the world, is to delist and be taken private by Dubai. It said going private would allow it to take a longer term view on the ports and logistics business. As part of the deal, majority owner Port and Free Zones World has offered to buy DP World shares listed on Nasdaq Dubai and pay $5.15bn to its parent Dubai World.

Her ideas, fuelled by a small group of leftwing academics, are now gaining a wide hearing in the 2020 presidential race and causing trepidation in Silicon Valley. Meanwhile, Joe Biden\u2019s biggest backers are responding to calls for donations but in private several donors expressed concern about his prospects.

But decentralised technology can support individuals and liberal democracies, Rana Foroohar writes, finding one such example in Taiwan. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Inside Syria\u2019s final battle</emphasis>\u00a0<br/>There are some\u00a0 3m civilians trapped in north-west Syria near the Turkish border, facing an intense bombing campaign by forces loyal to Bashar al-Assad. Streets are jammed with loaded cars, as families desperate to escape have little option of where to go. (FT)\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Is Modi\u2019s BJP introducing Big Brother? </emphasis><br/>India\u2019s ruling BJP has used what critics say are authoritarian tactics to contain unrest over a controversial new citizenship law. The surveillance build-up comes as the government embarks on its first personal data protection bill, which activists and some of the bill\u2019s original champions fear will adopt a model closer to China than Europe.

FT readers shared their top tips, from sushi on the Upper East Side to modernist Milanese on Park Avenue. Our US finance editor\u2019s picked his favourite New York eateries in this guide. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Corporate schmoozing will survive coronavirus </emphasis><br/>The cancellation of the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona has pushed coronavirus to the top of any trade body or corporate board\u2019s agenda. But it\u2019s unlikely to derail our desire to meet in person, Andrew Hill writes. For chief executives, social media can be risky, but we should hear\u00a0more from bosses on Instagram, not less, Pilita Clark argues. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A City life on film </emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sulphur and White</emphasis>, which opens next month, tells the story of David Tait, a senior City executive \u2014 and the impact of childhood sexual abuse that nearly cost him his life. Emma Jacobs writes that it\u2019s a difficult watch that demonstrates how the conversation around mental health has changed. Another film not to miss: the Battle for Hong Kong. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lunch with the FT: Olga Tokarczuk</emphasis><br/>The fame that came with winning the Nobel Prize for Literature has been a bit jarring for the Polish writer: even on a recent trip to a hardware store, she was mobbed. Over\u00a0 Lunch with the FT, Olga Tokarczuk sounded off on confronting history, battles with the nationalist right and why populist nostalgia will pass.

It is also a bigger market capitalisation than the combined value of the next five biggest international oil companies.</p><p>The company raised $25.6bn in the IPO, surpassing the $25bn raised by China\u2019s Alibaba when it debuted on Wall Street in 2014 and making it the world\u2019s largest ever IPO. However, state investment funds and wealthy families were encouraged to buy Saudi Aramco shares in a last-ditch attempt to give Saudi Arabia\u2019s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman his long-coveted $2tn valuation.</p><p>Saudi Arabia pared back its hopes for the public offering after international investors balked at the valuation, forcing the kingdom to abandon an international roadshow weeks before the listing. Just 1.5 per cent of the company was sold to investors in the end, down from an initial target of 5 per cent or $100bn of new financing.</p><p>In the news</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Impeachment charges announced</emphasis><br/>House Democrats outlined two articles of impeachment against Donald Trump on Tuesday, accusing him of abusing power by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals and of obstructing Congress\u2019s inquiry (read the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/12/10/articles-impeachment-against-president-trump-annotated\"> annotated articles</url>, and an       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment-charges-factbox/factbox-abuse-of-power-obstruction-the-charges-against-trump-explained-idUSKBN1YE2DM\"> explanation</url> of the charges). Mr Trump will probably be formally impeached by a House vote next week, leading to a trial in the Senate, which can remove him from office by a two-thirds vote. (FT, WaPo, Reuters)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">USMCA trade pact signed</emphasis><br/>But Democrats also gave Donald Trump a breakthrough on Tuesday, agreeing to ratify the USMCA trade pact with Canada and Mexico. Here are the deal\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-in-the-new-usmca-trade-deal-11575998455\"> crucial provisions</url>, including free flow of data. Edward Luce writes that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi made a political bet pursuing impeachment and the trade deal simultaneously. (FT, WSJ)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Polls show UK election narrowing</emphasis><br/>The Conservative party lead has narrowed in the UK general election after a rocky few days for prime minister Boris Johnson. On the final day of campaigning, a new poll by YouGov projected the ruling Conservative party would secure a majority of 28 seats in the House of Commons, down from 68 in an earlier model.

Mr Starr led the effort to unseat Bill Clinton in the 1990s, which culminated with the impeachment of the former president for lying about his relations with Monica Lewinsky, a White House intern at the time.</p><p>Mr Trump also appointed Robert Ray, who succeeded Mr Starr as independent counsel in the Clinton probe, to his legal team as well as Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard law professor who successfully defended Claus von Bulow and OJ Simpson in murder trials that gripped the US.</p><p>Here\u2019s a full guide to only the third impeachment trial of a US president since the founding of the republic.</p><p>In an editorial, the FT says the conduct of the trial is bound to be as political as the eventual vote.

Congratulations USA!\u201d Earlier in the week, he tweeted: \u201cAnother new Stock Market Record.

Huawei is alleging the FCC acted illegally when it banned the company\u2019s customers from receiving federal broadband subsidies. Boris Johnson, meanwhile, has proposed excluding Huawei from Britain\u2019s 5G networks after lobbying by Donald Trump at the Nato summit and in China the company is facing criticism over its treatment of a former employee.

(FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Labour rules out coalition</emphasis><br/>With just a week to go until Britons go to the polls the leader of the opposition Labour party has ruled out negotiating with smaller parties in the event of a hung parliament. Labour are lagging far behind the ruling Conservative party in the polls and many believe the party\u2019s only viable path to power is by cobbling together a coalition. \u201cWe will implement our manifesto\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009no negotiation, no deal, no coalitions,\u201d said John McDonnell, would-be finance minister, in an interview with the Financial Times.

It is not the first time the controversial money manager has tried to buy a baseball team: in 2012 he tried but failed to buy the Los Angeles Dodgers.

After the video emerged the US leader abruptly cancelled a press conference to mark the conclusion of the summit in Watford, near London. Mr Trump\u2019s latest intervention exacerbated tensions as Nato leaders battled to curb disagreements over Syria and funding of the cold war-era alliance.

Riyadh is hoping to raise as much as $60bn with a sale of up to 3 per cent of the company, but bankers believe a $1.2tn-$1.5tn valuation is more realistic.</p><p>The company said it would issue the IPO prospectus on November 9, with the final offer price, listing size and valuation <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-03/key-facts-from-saudi-aramco-s-intention-to-float-in-riyadh\"> to be determined</url> at the end of the bookbuilding period. Saudi Aramco has also sweetened terms to win over investors, but two people briefed said the listing could still be pulled depending on the response.</p><p>The FT View is that MBS\u2019s shallow reform effort underscores the lack of accountability for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

(FT, Bloomberg)</p><p>In the news</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Are you better off since Trump came to power?</emphasis><br/>Nearly two-thirds of Americans say they are not financially better off than they were when Donald Trump was elected, according to the first in a series of new polls conducted by the Financial Times and the not-for-profit Peter G Peterson Foundation. A total of 31 per cent of Americans say they are now worse off financially than they were at the start of Mr Trump\u2019s presidency, while another 33 per cent say there has been no change in their financial position since Mr Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2017. Thirty five per cent of the more than 1,000 people questioned for the nationwide poll said they are better off. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u2018It is time for me to move on\u2019</emphasis><br/>McDonald\u2019s sacked Steve Easterbrook, its chief executive, after he engaged in a consensual relationship with a colleague that \u201cviolated\u201d company policy. In an email to staff, the 52-year-old Briton, who has been credited with turning around the fast-food chain\u2019s fortunes, admitted making a mistake and agreed it was time to move on. Chris Kempczinski, president of McDonald\u2019s US business, will become the new chief executive. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trade outlook</emphasis><br/>The US is pushing Taiwan to restrict its biggest chipmaker from producing semiconductors for Huawei and tighten technology exports to China. Toshimitsu Motegi, Japan\u2019s foreign minister, said a new trade deal could lead to the elimination of US car tariffs in an interview with the FT, while US commerce secretary Wilbur Ross said he was \u201coptimistic\u201d that sticking points with China would be resolved. This single Chinese company dominates the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-china-positioned-itself-to-dominate-the-future-of-electric-cars-11572804489\"> electric vehicle battery</url> market. (FT, WSJ)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JPMorgan\u2019s bond boost</emphasis><br/>JPMorgan Chase has pushed more than $130bn of excess cash into long-dated bonds and cut the amount of loans it holds, marking a big shift in response to capital rules that treat loans as riskier than bonds. Berkshire Hathaway increased its cash pile to a record $128bn in the third quarter as it struggled to find large acquisitions. (FT)</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trump impeachment inquiry</emphasis><br/>The\u00a0anonymous whistleblower who sparked the impeachment inquiry into Donald Trump has agreed to answer questions by House Republicans, while a top aide to Mike Mulvaney, the president\u2019s acting chief of staff, has been instructed not to appear before a hearing on Monday. The FT View says an open impeachment inquiry offers welcome opportunities for public scrutiny. (FT)\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UK general election watch</emphasis><br/>Nigel Farage will not stand in the forthcoming election, but will campaign for a \u201cclean break\u201d Brexit, which the FT View calls a delusion.

This weekly roundup[1] offers the highlights of what you might have missed. 'Fact checkers need to move from 'publish and pray' to 'publish and act.'' 'The idea that fact checking can work by correcting the public's inaccurate beliefs on a mass scale alone doesn't stack up,' write representatives from Full Fact (U.K.), Africa Check (Africa), and Chequeado (Argentina), in a manifesto of sorts[2] published Thursday to all[3] three sites.  'First-generation fact-checking' \u2014 the approach of simply publishing fact-checks, which sites like FactCheck.org do \u2014 is a worthy effort, the authors write, but it isn't enough if you actually want to change people's minds. </p><p>'Nobody should be surprised when, despite fact checkers publishing lots of fact checks, people still believe inaccurate things and politicians still spin and distort. Fact checking can work but not if this is all we do.' Full Fact, Africa Check, and Chequeado argue instead for their second-generation approach that includes not just publishing but also pressure and working for system change: First, we move from just publishing to 'publish and act.' We seek corrections on the record, pressure people not to make the same mistake again, complain where possible to a standards body. In other words, we use whatever forms of moral, public, or where appropriate regulatory pressure are available to stop the spread of specific bits of misinformation. Secondly, we recognize that our fact checking provides a unique evidence base that gives us important insight into where misleading claims come from in public life and how they are spread Thirdly, we work for system change. Using the evidence from our fact checks we identify patterns and common causes, points where we can intervene to significantly reduce particular kinds or sources of information. The pattern might be who's publishing something, where it's published, a particular subject that there's a lot of false information about, or something else. The interventions can range from educating children or adults to advocating for policy changes. Finally, culture. We are trying to create institutions in different societies that can help anchor public debate to reality and to challenge the casual acceptance of deceptive and misleading behavior. This is a long-term task: it involves earning good trusted reputations and not just getting attention. It needs funders to think long-term as well as fact checkers. And, they acknowledge, they're striving for a third generation of fact-checking that 'will have to address all these issues \u2014 but also be able to function at internet scale, be massively collaborative, and work across international borders.' The sixth-annual fact-checking summit, GlobalFact, took place this week in Cape Town[4]. Here are a few highlight tweets:I appreciate we are mostly small organisations who are just trying to get by, but we have to be striving for more than just checking. Checking alone is not enough to diagnose problems, or to eventually solve those problems at scale.

Fernndez (@fernandezpm) June 19, 2019[32]'It's a sweatshop in America.' The Verge's Casey Newton published another horrifying story (here's the first one[33]) on working conditions for Facebook content moderators[34], this time at the Cognizant site in Tampa that is 'Facebook's worst-performing content moderation site in America.' The content moderators are contract workers, not Facebook employees. The story outlines the gross working conditions that the content moderators face and shows them horribly affected by the videos they have to moderate, especially those that feature animal abuse. But I kept thinking about this part of the article: In June 2018, a month into his job, Facebook began seeing a rash of videos that purportedly depicted organs being harvested from children. (It did not.[35]) So many graphic videos were reported that they could not be contained in Speagle's queue. 'I was getting the brunt of it, but it was leaking into everything else,' Speagle said. 'It was mass panic. All the SMEs had to rush in there and try to help people. They were freaking out \u2014 they couldn't handle it. People were crying, breaking down, throwing up. It was like one of those horror movies. Nobody's prepared to see a little girl have her organs taken out while she's still alive and screaming.' Moderators were told they had to watch at least 15 to 30 seconds of each video. The debunk of the organ harvesting was an update added to the story after publication: 'This article has been updated to reflect the fact that a video that purportedly depicted organ harvesting was determined to be false and misleading.' These videos have, in fact, been debunked[36] multiple[37] times[38]. That makes them no less horrifying to watch since they do actually show children receiving medical care after airstrikes. To the moderators, they felt real. What I don't understand is why moderators were seeing so much content that had been debunked already, presumably including by Facebook's own fact-checkers, but, seemingly, not being educated on the fact that it was fake, which might have made the moderation of it less scarring. If the education part isn't happening, why not?The picture of kids whipping a screaming lizard around by its tail doesn't ring true given their biology. Add that to what other sources in the story claim about an \"organ harvesting\" video that's almost certainly false and you really start to question their reliability. \u2014 Christopher Ingraham (@_cingraham) June 20, 2019[39]I don't question the moderators' reliability \u2014 I think this just goes to show, again, that this work is hard and mentally scarring and shouldn't be foisted off on contract employees without proper training. But that's the whole point of this article!At some big tech companies, more than half the workforce is already contractors. NDAs typically prevent all but the worst stories from coming out.  My thanks to Shawn Speagle, Michelle Bennetti, and Melynda Johnson for having the courage to share their experiences. \u2014 Casey Newton (@CaseyNewton) June 19, 2019[40] So Facebook has been around 15 years, always with a problem of some users uploading horrifying content. Scale intensifies the issues. But the company talks about these consequences like they're new.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/aTwa21bPo2\">https://t.co/aTwa21bPo2</url>[41] read @CaseyNewton[42] pic.twitter.com/TM7QseyMhP[43]; \u2014 Sarah Frier (@sarahfrier) June 19, 2019[44]The report came out the same day that Facebook announced it's launching a global cryptocurrency[45]. Judging by this story on Facebook's 'content moderation'\u2014which adds to the pioneering work by @ubiquity75[46] and @TarletonG[47]\u2014Facebook's expansion into financial services should be smooth, since it's such an easy thing to manage, especially across borders.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/AGk3QV6R9R\">https://t.co/AGk3QV6R9R</url>[48] \u2014 zeynep tufekci (@zeynep) June 19, 2019[49] Illustration from L.M.
