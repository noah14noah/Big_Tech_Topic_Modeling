(Was this email forwarded to you?       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/dealbook-special-section\">Sign up here</url>.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ranking U.S. companies by the priorities of Americans</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just Capital and Forbes have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/dealbook-special-section\">rated U.S. firms based on factors that matter most</url> to the American public, like fair pay, ethical leadership, customer privacy, environmental impact and job creation.</p><p>Here are the top 10 most just U.S. companies according to their analysis:</p><p>1. Microsoft</p><p>2. Nvidia</p><p>3. Apple</p><p>4. Intel</p><p>5. Salesforce</p><p>6. Alphabet</p><p>7. Anthem</p><p>8. PayPal</p><p>9. P&amp;amp;G</p><p>10. VMware</p><p>Microsoft\u2019s top spot is a result of its \u201cparticularly strong track record on how it serves its workers, communities, and the environment,\u201d according to Just Capital.</p><p>Compared with averages for the Russell 1000, the 100 companies in the listing pay their median workers 31 percent more, give 8.4 times as much to charitable causes, have 25 percent more women on their board, and are 32 percent more likely to have established environmental policies. They also score a higher return on equity, by six percentage points.</p><p>KKR bids to take Walgreens Boots private</p><p>The drugstore chain Walgreens Boots Alliance <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/dealbook-special-section\">has received a buyout offer</url> from the private equity firm KKR, Bloomberg News reports, citing unnamed sources.</p><p>It would be the biggest private equity transaction on record. Walgreens Boots has a market value of about $56 billion and $16.8 billion of debt. At that size, a successful take-private transaction would top the $45 billion buyout of the utility TXU in 2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p><p>But \u201cit\u2019s unclear how feasible the transaction would be,\u201d Bloomberg reports, because of the financing required. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge stretch doing things over $50 billion,\u201d Stephen Schwarzman, head of the Blackstone Group, said at a conference last week.</p><p>A buyout would test the appetite of bond investors, \u201cwhere a tide of cash has sent borrowing costs lower but <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/dealbook-special-section\">investors have worried about risky deals</url>,\u201d the FT reports.</p><p>Still, investors liked the news, and sent Walgreens Boots shares 5 percent higher by the close of the market.</p><p>Uber\u2019s C.E.O. missteps over Saudi Arabia</p><p>Uber\u2019s C.E.O., Dara Khosrowshahi, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/dealbook-special-section\">is facing a backlash</url> after calling the murder of Jamal Khashoggi a \u201cmistake\u201d by the Saudi government and comparing the killing to the accidental death of a woman hit by a self-driving car. He\u2019s walked his comments back, but they highlight the difficult situation that Saudi money puts the company in.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a serious mistake,\u201d Mr. Khosrowshahi said in the interview with Axios on HBO, after he was asked about the brutal killing last year by Saudi operatives of Mr. Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist. \u201cWe\u2019ve made mistakes too, right, with self driving, and we stopped driving, and we\u2019re recovering from that mistake. So I think that people make mistakes.\u201d</p><p>Mr. Khosrowshahi retreated in three steps:</p><p> He backtracked first in a phone call and then in an emailed statement to Axios, before the interview aired.</p><p> Then yesterday on Twitter he wrote: \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/dealbook-special-section\">I was wrong to call it a \u2018mistake.\u2019</url>\u201d</p><p>Saudi Arabia is Uber\u2019s fifth-largest shareholder, and its board includes Yasir al-Rumayyan, the governor of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Public Investment Fund who was recently named chairman of the state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco.</p><p>\u201cI am under no illusions that Silicon Valley will stop taking ever-dirtier Saudi money,\u201d the tech columnist Kara Swisher <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/dealbook-special-section\">wrote last week in an NYT Op-Ed</url>. \u201cBut tossing Mr. al-Rumayyan off the board would go a long way in acknowledging the problem.\u201d</p><p>Would John Legere even want to run WeWork?</p><p>WeWork is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/dealbook-special-section\">in talks with John Legere of T-Mobile</url> as a potential C.E.O., Peter Eavis of the NYT writes, citing unnamed sources.</p><p>Adam Neumann, the co-founder of the struggling real estate company, stepped down from the role in September amid controversy over the company\u2019s business model and corporate governance and the calling off of its I.P.O. He was replaced by two executives, Sebastian Gunningham and Artie Minson. WeWork was bailed out of a cash crunch last month by its largest outside shareholder, SoftBank.</p><p>Mr. Legere is credited with reviving T-Mobile, which he has led since 2012. \u201cHe slashed prices, introduced new plans and heaped ridicule on rival cellphone companies,\u201d Mr. Eavis writes. It paid off: T-Mobile has more than doubled its subscribers under Mr. Legere.</p><p>He is one of several candidates WeWork is considering, the sources said.</p><p>But significant conflicts of interest are embedded in these talks. \u201cT-Mobile is seeking to merge with Sprint, which SoftBank controls,\u201d Mr. Eavis writes. \u201cMr. Legere could have a difficult time separating T-Mobile\u2019s negotiations with Sprint from his talks with WeWork.\u201d</p><p>And any new C.E.O. would face a tough task. WeWork posted a $1.4 billion operating loss in the first half of the year, and it is not clear if and when any of its office spaces might become profitable.</p><p>Google strengthens its push into health care</p><p>Google yesterday <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/dealbook-special-section\">announced a deal with Ascension</url>, the country\u2019s second-largest hospital system, to store and analyze the data of millions of patients, write Natasha Singer and Daisuke Wakabayashi in the NYT.</p><p> Ascension operates 150 hospitals in 20 states and the District of Columbia.</p><p> The data of all Ascension patients could eventually be uploaded to Google\u2019s cloud computing platform.</p><p>\u201cAlready, the two organizations are testing software that allows medical providers to search a patient\u2019s electronic health record by specific data categories and create graphs of the information, like blood test results over time,\u201d Ms. Singer and Mr. Wakabayashi write.</p><p>Google\u2019s big health plans include the use of artificial intelligence to read electronic health records and predict or identify medical conditions.</p><p>But it faces competition from other tech giants. Amazon, Apple and Microsoft are also seeking slices of the huge health care market.</p><p>And Google\u2019s handling of health care data is a touchy subject, on which its A.I. subsidiary DeepMind has a checkered past. Some Ascension employees have raised concerns about Google access to patient data and about whether it complies with federal privacy laws.</p><p>Boeing\u2019s vision for getting the 737 Max airborne</p><p>The airplane maker yesterday explained its plan for getting its 737 Max, which has been grounded since March following the fatal crashes, back into the air, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/dealbook-special-section\">the AP reports</url>.</p><p>Boeing hopes the F.A.A. will certify updates to the jet this quarter, which it says could allow it to start delivering the jets to customers again in December.</p><p> But retraining pilots would take longer. Airlines would be unlikely to be flying the jets until January, if then.</p><p>Investors liked the news, and Boeing\u2019s share price jumped by as much as 5 percent.</p><p>But \u201cwhy the F.A.A. would be willing to throw Boeing a bone like this is less clear,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/dealbook-special-section\">Brooke Sutherland of Bloomberg Opinion writes</url>. And even if all goes to plan, Boeing faces the logistical complexity of delivering a huge backlog of airplanes, and the continued fallout of legal proceedings over the jets.</p><p>Just how tough is Europe on tech?</p><p>E.U. regulators are considered the world\u2019s leading tech industry watchdogs. But those involved in the Continent\u2019s antitrust battles tell American authorities that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/dealbook-special-section\">there is a lot to learn from Europe\u2019s mistakes</url>, writes Adam Satariano in the NYT.</p><p>Among the challenges that the E.U. faces:</p><p> \u201cAntitrust investigations in Europe have taken years to complete, in part because company lawyers use stalling techniques that give the tech giants added time to squeeze out rivals.\u201d</p><p> \u201cThe inquiries have centered on single aspects of the companies, like Google shopping, rather than their entire business.\u201d</p><p> \u201cThe penalties have focused on headline-grabbing fines rather than structural changes that would restore competitive balance.\u201d</p><p>But tougher antitrust enforcement is necessary, the authorities in the U.S. and Europe have suggested in recent weeks, Mr. Satariano notes. Margrethe Vestager, the top antitrust regulator in the E.U., is pushing for new approaches, and Makan Delrahim, head of the antitrust division at the U.S. Justice Department, said remedies like breaking up the companies were \u201con the table.\u201d</p><p>More: Germany has urged the E.U. to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/dealbook-special-section\">toughen its approach to Big Tech</url> as part of a wider push to maintain competition. </p><p>Revolving door</p><p>Lionel Barber is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/dealbook-special-section\">stepping down as the editor of the FT</url> after 14 years.</p><p>Andreas Utermann, the C.E.O. of Allianz Global Investors, is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/dealbook-special-section\">departing after three years in the role</url>. His replacement will be Tobias Pross, a member of the asset manager\u2019s global executive committee.</p><p>David Miller has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/dealbook-special-section\">chosen to run Credit Suisse\u2019s investment banking and capital markets</url> business. He replaces James Amine, who will become head of private credit opportunities.</p><p>Robinhood\u2019s vice president of product, Josh Elman, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/dealbook-special-section\">has left the company</url> after less than two years at the company.</p><p>Vijay Karnani, the co-head of India for Goldman Sachs, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/spotlight/dealbook-special-section\">is retiring from the bank</url> after 21 years with the company.</p><p>The speed read</p><p>Deals</p><p> Travis Kalanick sold more than $500 million of Uber stock in the days immediately after the end of restrictions on early investors.

On March 20 it agreed to acquire its Dutch peer in a (EURO)5.16 billion ($6.75 billion) cash deal that will create Europe's largest parcel delivery company. The Hoofddorp, Netherlands-based target persuaded its Atlanta-based suitor to raise its offer from (EURO)9 to (EURO)9.50 a share -- and to agree to pay a (EURO)200 million reverse breakup fee should the deal fall through on competition grounds. That's 4 times the (EURO)50 million penalty TNT would have to cough up were it to go with a rival offer.   \"It was a way of having UPS confirm that this deal is doable also from a regulatory point of view,\" says <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jan Louis Burggraaf</emphasis>, who co-led the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Allen &amp; Overy LLP</emphasis> corporate team advising TNT along with fellow Amsterdam partner <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tim Stevens,</emphasis> with partner <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Glazener</emphasis> covering antitrust issues. Allen &amp; Overy has represented TNT for more than a decade, from the 1998 demerger from Dutch telecoms giant <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KPN NV</emphasis> and the creation of TNT's parent company, TNT Post Group, to last year's split of TNT into TNT Express NVand <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PostNL NV</emphasis>.   In the deal with UPS, TNT also turned to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.</emphasis> bankers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gordon Dyal</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Govers</emphasis>, as well as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lazard</emphasis>'s <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wouter Han</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alexander Doll</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bas van der Vlist</emphasis>. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Deutsche Bank AG</emphasis>'s <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nicholas Aperghis</emphasis> advised TNT's largest shareholder, PostNL, which gave its irrevocable backing to the transaction. A team led by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP</emphasis> London-based corporate partner <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">William Plapinger</emphasis> represented Goldman.  For the largest takeover in its 105-year history, UPS enlisted bankers from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Morgan Stanley</emphasis> including <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Runde</emphasis>, a former vice chairman and special adviser who also helped the Atlanta company with its $5.5 billion initial public offering in 1999, as well as managing directors <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Krowinkel</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mark Eichorn</emphasis>. UPS turned as well to a <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UBS</emphasis> team led by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Charles Otton</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Robertson</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Heino Teschmacher</emphasis>, along with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bob Elfring</emphasis> at <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bank of America Merrill Lynch</emphasis>. For legal counsel UPS enlisted <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP</emphasis>, whose team was led by Amsterdam partner <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jan Willem van der Staay</emphasis>. He has often sat at the other end of the table from Burggraaf, including representing Italy's <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Prysmian SpA</emphasis> in last year's acquisition of Dutch cable maker Draka Holding NV.<br/> -- Renee Cordes    <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cisco Systems Inc.</emphasis> jumped back into the big tech acquisition game last month with a $5 billion agreement to buy video software developer <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NDS Group Ltd.</emphasis>  The deal is a high-profile assignment for New York advisory boutique <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Centerview Partners LLC</emphasis>, whose <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Handler</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David St. Jean</emphasis> advised Cisco. The two bankers, who joined Centerview in 2008 from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">UBS</emphasis>, brought the Cisco relationship with them, having advised the company on its $6.8 billion deal for Scientific Atlanta Inc. in 2006 while working at Bear Stearns Cos. Before joining Bear in 2000, Handler and St. Jean also worked together at <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jefferies &amp; Co.</emphasis>  They've stayed busy at Centerview, advising <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Motorola Mobility Holdings Inc.</emphasis> in its $12.5 billion agreement to be acquired by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google Inc.</emphasis>, announced in August last year, and, more recently, helping network security software developer <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SonicWall Inc.</emphasis> in its $1.5 billion sale to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dell Inc.</emphasis>, announced March 13. Handler advised smart-grid technology developer <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Itron Inc.</emphasis> on its $100 million deal for <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SmartSynch Inc.</emphasis> in February.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">J.P. Morgan</emphasis> also advised Cisco on the NDS deal. Its team included technology, media and telecommunications leader <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anwar Zakkour</emphasis>, along with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jimmy Lee</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Curt Sigfstead</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jennifer Nason</emphasis>. Staines, U.K.-based NDS had listed J.P. Morgan as one of its lead underwriters, along with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Morgan Stanley</emphasis>, when it filed to go public in December.   For legal advice Cisco again turned to a <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fenwick &amp; West LLP</emphasis> team led by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Doug Cogen</emphasis>, its San Francisco-based co-chair of M&amp;A. Rounding out the team were <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kris Withrow</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stephen Gillespie</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scott Spector</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian Savage</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Adam Andrews</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matthew Stewart</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thomas Kang</emphasis>. Cogen has advised Cisco on more than 75 transactions.   <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kirkland &amp; Ellis LLP</emphasis>'s <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Daniel Wolf</emphasis>and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Feirstein</emphasis> provided counsel to J.P. Morgan, while Centerview received counsel from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sullivan &amp; Cromwell LLP</emphasis>'s <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sarah Payne</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Joseph Frumkin</emphasis>. &amp;lt;  NDS did not hire an investment bank for the deal. Its legal team was led by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Howard Ellin</emphasis>, co-chair of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom LLP</emphasis>'s corporate transactions and M&amp;A practices. His connection to the company likely grew out of its acquisition in 1992 by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">News Corp.</emphasis>, which has been relying on Ellin for deal work since 2000. The media giant spun out NDS in 1999; 10 years later, London buyout shop <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Permira</emphasis> paid $3.5 billion to acquire 51% of the company, with News Corp. holding on to the remaining 49%. Ellin advised News Corp. in that deal. NDS listed Skadden partner <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jennifer Bensch</emphasis> as company counsel in its IPO filing in December.     Skadden's team on the NDS deal also included <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Michael Hatchard</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Allison Schneirov</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lou Kling</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stacy Kanter</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Clifford Aronson</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stephanie Teicher</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Regina Olshan</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steven Matays</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tim Sanders</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Katherine Bristor</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bruce Goldner</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">C. Michael Chitwood</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Daniela Tisch</emphasis>. -- Olaf de Senerpont Domis    The $2.2 billion purchase of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">AboveNet Inc.</emphasis> would be the largest deal ever for <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Zayo Group LLC</emphasis>, a fiber network operator and prodigious acquirer with a raft of private equity backers. Pending completion, the deal would mark Zayo's 19th purchase since its 2007 founding.  To fund the deal, the fiber networker brought in new investor <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GTCR LLC</emphasis> and received equity from existing backer <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Charlesbank Capital Partners LLC</emphasis>.   At the deal's March 19 announcement, GTCR principal <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Phil Canfield</emphasis> said the Chicago firm had been looking to enter the infrastructure market. The deal would combine two prominent fiber players and reduce competition in future fiber auctions.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marco Caggiano</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fred Turpin</emphasis> of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">J.P. Morgan</emphasis> were lead advisers to AboveNet, which retained <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Moelis &amp; Co.</emphasis>bankers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matthew A'Hearn</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matthew Clark</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeffrey Raich</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stanley Holtz</emphasis> as co-advisers. AboveNet hired J.P. Morgan to explore alternatives in 2011. Moelis became involved more recently and will lead the process during a go-shop period that allows AboveNet to seek other offers until April 17, and possibly until May 2. Moelis, which does not have a financing arm, could oversee an independent marketing period, while J.P. Morgan could provide debt for suitors.  AboveNet went by the name Metromedia Fiber Network Inc. in the 1990s. A highflier in the telecom boom, it went bankrupt in 2002 and took the name AboveNet when it exited Chapter 11. To focus on fiber infrastructure, it exited businesses such as data centers.  AboveNet retained <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scott Kaufman</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">William Kilgallen</emphasis> of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wiggin and Dana LLP</emphasis> for its sale. Kaufman started working with AboveNet when he was at Kronish Lieb Weiner &amp; Hellman LLP, which had been Metromedia's bankruptcy counsel. The relationship continued when Kronish Lieb merged with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cooley LLP</emphasis>, and when Kaufman moved to Wiggin and Dana in 2009.   AboveNet's board received counsel from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Willkie Farr &amp; Gallagher LLP</emphasis>lawyers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeffrey Hochman</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steven Gartner</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">William Hiller</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jennifer Wade</emphasis>.  GTCR is joining a sizable club of investors in Zayo, including <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Battery Ventures</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Centennial Ventures</emphasis>, Charlesbank, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Columbia Capital</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">M/C Venture Partners</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment Partners</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oak Investment Partners</emphasis>. That Zayo could align interests with a new investor and a large existing base for a large purchase is noteworthy.  In addition to the GTCR and Charlesbank equity funding, Zayo has financing from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Morgan Stanley</emphasis>and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barclays Capital</emphasis>. The Morgan Stanley team included <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jon Yourkoski</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Adam Shepard</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew Earls</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reagan Philipp</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">James Rekas</emphasis>. Heading the Barclays Capital group were <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bob Chen</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Joe Valenti.</emphasis>  Zayo received counsel from <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP</emphasis> lawyers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steve Talley</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aaron Adams</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Beau Stark</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Eduardo Gallardo</emphasis>.  GTCR retained <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Latham &amp; Watkins LLP</emphasis> lawyers <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bradley Faris</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Edward Sonnenschein</emphasis>. Latham has worked increasingly with GTCR in the past two years, advising on the purchases of Protection One Inc., Global Traffic Network Inc. and Merlin Media LLC, the last with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emmis Communications Corp.</emphasis>   Because of its open go-shop window, AboveNet's story could grow more interesting. The situation poses a dilemma for any large telecom contemplating a big fiber deal: Consider moving for AboveNet now, or spending more later on the combined company.   -- Chris Nolter  </p><h>DEAL SIZE</h><p>$ 1-10 Billion</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DADEAL-45659</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DADEAL2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7YS6-1TX1-2PMW-W0NK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244689</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1422\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 The Deal, L.L.C.

There are, in the US, the hearings on whether Big Tech-a Facebook, Apple, Amazon, or Google (FAANG, without Netflix)-needs to be broken up. And in India, the issue of curbing data monopolies is a live one with, as it happens, the government inviting suggestions-August 13 is the last date for submissions-on the report on sharing of non-personal data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While Google and Facebook aren't ripping off customers-how can they since they provide their services free?-the issue here is whether they are using their power, including over data, to stifle competition. Do the insights Google gains by offering services worth billions for free give it an edge over the competition in, say, the advertisement market? And if they do, how undesirable is that? More important, is it worth breaking Google up to fix this? Think of, for starters, the Android ecosystem it has created and how that has dramatically lowered the costs of mobile phones.</p><p>When a final decision is taken on whether or not Big Tech firms need to be broken up, or their powers circumscribed in some other way, it will have interesting lessons for the Competition Commission of India (CCI) and other regulators. CCI cleared the Facebook investment in Jio Platforms in very little time in June, and was quick to dismiss the allegations of predatory pricing by RJio some years ago. This is not to pass judgment on CCI's rulings, but just to say that thinking on competition issues is evolving the world over, and issues that were dismissed as not important earlier are being relooked with a different lens today.</p><p>The issue of data monopolies and the powers of Big Tech, of course, are intimately connected. Sure, the issue of Facebook buying Instagram or WhatsApp is about using its money to buy out the competition, but data monopolies can, the argument goes, have a larger impact on stifling competition. In fact, one of the charges against Amazon (on.wsj.com/30AbVuT) is that it used data from its suppliers to build products that competed with them! Given how much it sells on its platforms across the world, knowledge about what sells and at what price-points is a big advantage to have. But, think about it a bit more, and how much of this can Amazon possibly do? After all, if it does too much of it, no one will want to sell on its platform.</p><p>The issue of data monopolies is what India is hoping to address through its sharing of non-personal or anonymised data. To use the Amazon example, once the principle of sharing is accepted, Amazon will have to part with its data-on payment of a sum that a Non-Personal Data Authority (NDPA) will determine-to anyone that asks. Ditto for Google and Facebook, WhatsApp, etc. As for data available with public authorities like the GST Network or civic authorities-how many cars travel to Mumbai's BKC during rush hours?-this will also be shared, possibly for free.</p><p>Conceptually, this is easy to do, but it throws up several questions that are less easy to deal with. If Retailer A applies to the NDPA asking for the top-selling items on Amazon's website, duly anonymised of course, will this be given? It is data that is proprietary in nature, but it is non-personal data (since it is anonymised), and sharing it will help boost the competition and, in a sense, the data belongs to individuals, not Amazon; put together, all these criteria suggest such data must be shared. Yet, the fact remains that if it is shared, it takes away a lot of Amazon's USP, its ability to produce/procure and deliver, in time, what the customer wants, at desired price-points, and in different parts of the country.</p><p>What is the top-selling garment in the country, in what fabric, what design? Where can you procure the best-quality silk trousers? Marketers would normally spend a small fortune in trying to figure these questions out, but now this can simply be asked for via the NDPA?</p><p>It is obvious, as Infosys co-founder Kris Gopalakrishnan-he headed the panel on sharing of data-has said in an interview (bit.ly/2PzNHL7) that simply giving out raw data won't help, it is what you do with the data that matters, and the business model that you build on top of this data. That is, if Retailer A takes Amazon's data dump, it won't help; Retailer A will have to work on the correct algorithms to be able to tweak out the valuable consumer insights that Amazon got by investing billions of dollars in setting up its sourcing and distribution network. But surely a top competitor will have the ability to develop the algorithms to extract the relevant data; and surely there will be lots of boutique firms who will do the data analysis for a fee? Gopalakrishan, after all, says Nasscom-McKinsey has estimated the data business could be as big as $500 billion over the next five years.</p><p>It is important, as Gopalakrishnan says, to share data equitably and to ensure that data monopolies don't stifle the competition. But a lot of this data is collected through huge investments. Is that something that should be shared just like that? Why not force Coca-Cola to make its secret recipe public? After all, that too helps cement its market dominance. These are issues that the government, and even the Gopalakrishan panel, will need to take another look at.</p><p>To begin with, start making government data available; this could be the number of diabetics or the sales of analgesics in a particular PIN code, or traffic patterns, etc. As for data collected by private firms, a much larger debate is called for as well as a study of its pros and cons to be able to understand whether it is a public good. An individual selling the details of what she bought, read, travelled, ate, etc is one thing; a company being forced to part with customer data it has acquired is quite another.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THFIEX-0054101024</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THFIEX2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JM-CTN1-DXMP-K504-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365020</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"974\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Express, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Financial Express</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 10, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The provision was dropped from a budget bill that was approved later in the week by the Senate.</p><p>The H-1B visas are reserved for highly skilled foreign workers. Congress had capped their number at 65,000 a year, and that limit has already been reached for the government's 2006 fiscal year. Tech employers say they need the foreign workers to compete with global rivals, but critics say they should hire U.S. applicants.</p><p>But the tech industry also got a big win from Congress: a firm Feb. 17, 2009, deadline to complete the transition from analog to digital TV. Some of that freed broadcast spectrum is expected to be used for high-speed wireless Internet services.</p><h>Tuesday</h><p>Those math geniuses at Googleran the numbers and concluded that 5 percent of America Onlineis worth $1 billion. I barely showed up for my college math class, but I'm told that values AOL as a whole at a whopping $20 billion. Making the deal official, the board of AOL parent Time Warner happily took the cash.</p><p>Google, though, got more than a tiny stake in an online content and dial-up access provider: It blocked rivals Microsoft and Yahoo from teaming up with a company that accounts for a huge chunk of its advertising revenue. AOL, for its part, won $300 million worth of Googleads. Plus it gets to bask in Google's golden glow.</p><h>Wednesday</h><p>Who knew consolidation in the disk-drive industry could make Wall Street so happy? In a ringing endorsement, shares of both Milpitas-based Maxtor and its larger Scotts Valley rival, Seagate Technology, climbed after the companies announced merger plans.</p><p>Seagate agreed to pay about $1.9 billion in stock for Maxtor. Maxtor stock soared 53 percent in response to the news, and Seagate shares climbed 3 percent.</p><h>Thursday</h><p>Shielding children from sex, violence and harsh language, and protecting itself from having to offer ``a la carte'' pricing, Comcast confirmed that it would offer a family-friendly package of programming.</p><p>Comcast's Family Tier, available early next year, will offer basic cable plus channels such as Toon Disney, Nickelodeon and Discovery Kids for about $31.20 a month.</p><p>The cable industry strongly opposes the idea of offering individual channels. That means no price break for those of you who want just the channels with sex, violence and harsh language in their programming.</p><h>Friday</h><p>That big Google-AOL deal: It turns out those geniuses at the Mountain View Internet giant already have an exit strategy.</p><p>A regulatory filing revealed that Googlehas a right to demand an initial public offering of America Onlinebeginning in July 2008. If AOL parent Time Warner doesn't want to seek an IPO, it could choose to buy back Google's 5 percent stake based on a fair market appraisal.</p><p>Frank Russell compiles the 60-Second Business Break, posted weekday afternoons at about 2 at mercurynews.com.

And while media consolidation may well continue into 2019, the pace of dealmaking is likely to slow, with bankers and insiders\u00a0citing an array of reasons for the more deliberate approach including a more volatile economic picture, the lack of last year's newly minted tax cuts, rising interest rates and lagging stock prices.</p><p>\"While I believe there is still significant capital in private equity, there may be limits to deal sizes from here on out,\" wrote Bourkoff.</p><p>The rear-view mirror, though, is filled with action.\u00a0M&amp;A in the global \"TMT\" sector (telecom, media and technology) surged 22% from 2017 levels to $793 billion in 2018, according to figures from Bloomberg. (Though let's spare a thought for the mega-deal that didn't come to pass: the long-expected reunion of CBS and Viacom.)</p><p>In the two biggest conquests, <url normalizedValue=\"https://deadline.com/tag/disney/\">Disney</url> finalized its plan to acquire most of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://deadline.com/tag/21st-century-fox/\">21st Century Fox</url> for $71.3 billion after fending off rival bids from Comcast, and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://deadline.com/tag/att/\">AT&amp;T</url> got a federal judge's blessing to formally close its $81 billion deal for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://deadline.com/tag/time-warner/\">Time Warner</url>. The Disney-Fox deal is expected to close during the first quarter of 2019, after the deal clears its final regulatory hurdles outside of the U.S.</p><p>Comcast, undeterred by losing out on Fox's studio assets, edged out Fox and Disney to acquire European pay-TV giant Sky for a cool $40 billion, bringing a key chapter of Rupert Murdoch's empire-building narrative to a close. Discovery also sealed its $14.4 billion takeover of Scripps Networks Interactive and UK exhibitor Cineworld scooped up Regal Cinemas for $3.6 billion. Nexstar swooped in to buy <url normalizedValue=\"https://deadline.com/tag/tribune-media/\">Tribune Media</url> for $4.1 billion after Sinclair Broadcast Group was rebuffed by regulators in its own Tribune quest. (See a chart of the year's biggest deals below.)</p><p>There is an overhang of regulatory uncertainty as the industry rolls toward the 2020 election cycle, still processing the divergent results of deal reviews and wondering about the approach of a new administration. \"Any deal of consequence would have to be announced in the first half of 2019,\" predicts Pivotal Research Group. The Department of Justice's decision to pursue the first lawsuit opposing a vertical merger (AT&amp;T-Time Warner) in more than 40 years continues to cast a shadow even though a federal judge rebuffed the suit and allowed the merger to proceed. (The government's appeal remains pending.)</p><p>Many of the buyers are also still playing python, trying to digest the large mammals they have just swallowed.\u00a0Wall Street has scrutinized the high debt levels of AT&amp;T and Comcast, which have become the two biggest companies in America.</p><p>The stock prices of the 50 top media and tech companies are almost all within range of their 52-week lows. Disney shares have bucked the trend somewhat due to the company's steady theme park revenue, but in general the sector is slumping, which can hamper flexibility.</p><p>\"You have to grow. Whether that's organically or through acquisitions, you still have to grow,\" observes one veteran media executive. \"That's what a lot of people forget. And when you have these limitations, it makes it difficult to grow.\"</p><p>Despite the warning signs, there remain a lot of ripe targets in the media business, especially content-rich independent players like MGM, Lionsgate and AMC Networks. While some likely buyers like Verizon have reassessed their interest in media, other companies (Charter, for one) appear to have the wherewithal to make more deals. And most analysts expect CBS and Viacom to finally tie the knot soon, with Fox also possibly exploring a merger with News Corp.</p><p>One zone of concern, despite the larger economic picture, is digital, where valuations have plunged over the past year. Vice Media was valued at $5.7 billion when it got an investment in mid-2017 from private equity firm TPG, but when Disney recently took a $157 million write-down on its Vice stake, the move implied a shrunken valuation in the range of $2.5 billion. Distressed digital properties like AwesomenessTV and Mic sold for a fraction of their original value in 2018, and former high-flier BuzzFeed has said it would be well-served by merging with not one but several direct competitors.</p><p>As digital properties consolidate, one scenario that will not die is that of a tech giant like Amazon, Apple or Google buying a traditional media company. That vision was reinforced by reports that Amazon has entered the bidding for the Fox regional sports networks that Disney must shed in order to get regulatory approval for the Fox deal; the Jeff Bezos-run giant is also reportedly kicking the tires (along with Sinclair Broadcast Group) of the YES Network for the remaining 80% stake worth $5 billion-$6 billion.</p><p>\"It's easy to look across the aisle or over your shoulder and speculate that Big Tech is going to just roll it all up,\" one media investor says. \"But that ignores the cultural issue. Why would technology companies, which specialize in user interfaces and data, want the legacy headaches of operating networks or studios or other 20th century assets?\"</p><p>Cultural integration is not just a consideration for media and tech firms pondering get-togethers. It is a key elements with all of the pending deals between rival companies. While there has been no end of blue-skying about the combined future, Disney will soon have to lay off thousands of workers and get everyone in its newly expanded choir singing from the same page in the hymnal.</p><p>Avoiding an AOL or General Electric culture clash will be crucial as these companies ramp up direct-to-consumer streaming services and other new offerings. And then there are emerging areas like smart speakers, 5G wireless and sports betting that will likely whet dealmaking appetites.</p><p>\"We think the push towards consolidation in so-called traditional media will continue,\" wrote Pivotal analysts\u00a0Jeffrey Wlodarczak and Brian Wieser in a recent report. Cost-cutting is the primary motivation, they said, but dealmakers will also have \"an eye towards securing negotiating leverage with distributors and advertisers alike.\"</p><p>Related stories</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://deadline.com/2018/12/tv-controversies-2018-sexual-harassment-racism-bombs-roseanne-les-moonves-1202525908/\">TV Controversies In 2018: #SexualHarassment, #Racism, #Bombs, #Guns, #BabySnatching</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://deadline.com/2018/12/movies-that-fueled-2018-bart-and-fleming-podcast-deadline-1202526933/\">The Bart &amp;

This is FIRST MOVE. And here's your need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Deal or No Deal: These are the only Brexit options according to a defiant Boris Johnson. Going all in, gambling giant Paddy Power's $12 billion bet with Pokerstars. And Zuck's bad luck. The Facebook CEO caught on tape saying an Elizabeth Warren presidency wood suck. It's Wednesday. Quick, let's make a move.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome once again to the show, and to FIRST MOVE. As I mentioned there, we've got big deals going on in the lucrative gambling space, but I have to say limited bets being placed on a global stock market rally today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Take a look at what we're seeing for U.S. futures right now. We are well and truly in the red. It follows yesterday's rough start to the final quarter of the year. Investors hit by the worst monthly reading for U.S. manufacturing survey data in over a decade. Has the long talks about global manufacturing session now firmly arrived in the United States?</p><p>Well, it seems so according to that data, at least all the majors here in the U.S. ending down one percent plus. Interest rate sensitive stocks like the financials, the banks were a real drag hereto as bond yields tracked lower.</p><p>Investors now believe there is a 60 percent chance of another Fed rate cut at the end of this month. But it's not just the United States -- Europe, take a look at that session, too. Well and truly feeling the pain just two days in fact, after JPMorgan Chase said it's time to buy Eurozone stocks.</p><p>We had a prominent German economic research firm lowering their growth forecasts for this year and for next. They say the manufacturing slowdown is spreading to the services sector in Germany, too. That, of course, is the real fear for the United States, too. Manufacturing data has felt recessionary for months. We've talked about it plenty of times on this show.</p><p>But the big concern is whether that impacts future hiring, and then U.S. consumers decide to pull back. We already saw that sharp drop in consumer confidence last week.</p><p>However, private sector job numbers today coming in line, even with revisions lower in the private -- the previous month, even as the pace slows there, and we did see a slight uptick in manufacturing jobs in that reading, too.</p><p>I'll tell you what, nonfarm payrolls on Friday. It's going to be pretty critical.</p><p>Let's get to the drivers because Christine Romans joins us now. Christine, great to have you with us. You and I have talked about this. The manufacturing data feels recessionary, actually, it's not just that, it is agriculture here in the United States, but real fears being raised yesterday.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN BUSINESS CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, and that's September ISM number, I mean, it confirms what we saw in August, remember, so we've got two months in a row of a contraction in manufacturing. And that's what's troubling so many.</p><p>You know, I keep looking at, at these slices of data and these surveys that say the worst since 2009, the weakest since 2009, and that starts to alarm me a little bit. The World Trade Organization, WTO, also lowered its growth forecasts for trade -- global trade to 1.2 percent for the year. That is the weakest since 2009.</p><p>You'll recall, the recession was ending in June of 2009. That was a deep and painful period here. So there are concerns that what has started in manufacturing, in large part because of the President's trade war could be a recessionary problem for the broader economy.</p><p>At least that's what economists are starting to worry about because they're seeing in survey after survey these little signs of 10 years of economic growth that seemed to be fizzling.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, there's two economies here. And again, we've talked about this. It's less than a fifth of the growth of the United States, the economy of the United States here is manufacturing. The rest is the consumer and it's what happens there, whether what we're seeing filters into job hiring, or less of them, even job losses, perhaps going forward. And that then filters into the consumer data. Because that's what we're asking here. Is the recession risk for the overall economy here real?</p><p>ROMANS: That's absolutely right, and that jobs report tomorrow, you're so right will be incredibly important to gauge here. I'll be looking for the manufacturing number, you're right that in today's private sector payroll number, there were I think 2,000 manufacturing job gains in that report.</p><p>We will look to see if jobs growth is slowing overall beyond the manufacturing sector in the government jobs report tomorrow. I suspect you could see more census hiring. You know, every 10 years, they do this big hiring push for census.</p><p>So you could see -- those are highly paid jobs, by the way -- so you could see the jobs numbers lead tomorrow by that. But with so many people watching the trade war and worrying that we're really at an impasse with the Chinese right now, next meeting is October 10th, can there be meaningful progress or is this going to be a rough fourth quarter? That seems to be the million dollar question on Wall Street?</p><p>[09:05:35]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and very quickly, the President here, saying it's the Federal Reserve's fault. They've not cut rates quicker. The strong dollar is a problem hereto. And all of these are, you can argue factors, rates relatively high compared to other countries, the dollar is strong relative to other currencies. But that's not what businesses are saying here. Particularly small and medium sized.</p><p>ROMANS: That's right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: They are saying trade war uncertainty is the key here.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes, they're not blaming interest rates. When you talk to people who are running companies and who are the treasurers of companies and purchasing managers and CEOs, they are not saying that Fed interest rate policy is their problem. They're saying a trade war is their problem.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Oh, did we just lose, Christine or she finished. Sorry, I was distracted. I am very naughty.</p><p>ROMANS: No, that's all right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Live TV. All right, Christine Romans. Great job. Finished quickly. More for me. Now on to our next driver and I'll pay attention on this one.</p><p>Boris Johnson unveiling plans, in his words to get Brexit done on October 31st. The British Prime Minister has been speaking at the Conservative Party Conference. Here's a flavor.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BORIS JOHNSON, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: If we fail to get an agreement because of what is essentially a technical discussion of the exact nature of future customs checks, when that technology is improving the whole time, then let us be in no doubt, conference, of that the alternative is. The alternative is no deal, and that is not an outcome we want. It is not an outcome we seek at all. But let me tell you this, it is an outcome for which we are ready.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Remember the Brexit deadline of course, October 31st. Nina dos Santos is there and was listening to that speech. He is always pretty engaging and lively, I have to say but it did feel rather Brexit deal light.</p><p>What are they going to present today, Nina, because he is already being accused of presenting a deal here that simply is not going to fly with the Europeans.</p><p>NINA DOS SANTOS, CNN EUROPE EDITOR: Yes, what's more, Julia, so this is the deal apparently, according to Downing Street insiders, if you believe the latest rounds of briefings today that will be the final deal that the E.U. has offered.</p><p>So basically, the message is this is it. It is all or nothing. Why is he doing that? Well, largely because if you're speaking to the party faithful here of the last four days as I have been in Manchester, he prefers to face the fire and fury of some people who don't want a no deal in the U.K., all the fire and fury of Brussels rather than a certain political death of not actually delivering Brexit, albeit by October 31st.</p><p>So what is in this deal? Well, we don't really know at this point. Earlier today, we were speaking to senior Cabinet member advisers who even intimated that their own Ministers hadn't been fully briefed on the legal text that Brussels will see. That is how closely guarded a secret this is being held.</p><p>But some of the details, perhaps not the final draft, but an earlier draft were leaked to \"The Daily Telegraph,\" which is a newspaper Boris Johnson has written for, for many, many years. Those include basically a deal that is a revised version of Theresa May's deal with the unpopular arrangement over the Irish border, the backstop scraps, and instead replaced it with a plan that would see Ireland -- effectually Northern Ireland have to borders for about four years. That's what we're talking about here.</p><p>A distinct area for Northern Ireland, and a distinct time limited type of backstop arrangement until after the transition period when some kind of border technology will be up and ready -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It is a challenge, isn't it? Nina, very quickly here again, there will be viewers looking at this situation and going, hang on a second, wasn't the law changed to prevent Boris Johnson taking the U.K. out of the E.U. on October 31st. without a deal? We're mystified. Can you explain that for me quickly? I know it's a challenge.</p><p>DOS SANTOS: Right. Well, nobody really has an answer as to how he is going to square this circle, if you like, apart from Boris Johnson in the next 14 to 15 days or so because that's when he could have his hands bound. If he doesn't manage to get a deal with Brussels, remember, there's an E.U. Summit coming up.</p><p>And if you haven't managed to get one by the middle of the month, then according to what he has dubbed the Surrender Act, the Hilary Benn Act, to give it its full name which was voted to by Parliament about three weeks or so ago, he will be forced to ask for an extension from the E.U.</p><p>[09:10:06]</p><p>DOS SANTOS: But if the Prime Minister doesn't, this is a battle that many people have told me on the fringes of this Conservative Party Conference will go back to the Supreme Court, so you can imagine more scenes like the ones we saw two weeks ago, surrounding that battle over whether or not Parliament was well and truly prorogued or suspended. Boris Johnson lost that one in a spectacular fashion. It could be setting the scene for another battle like that -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, just ongoing uncertainty, unfortunately. Nina, great to have you with us. Nina dos Santos there.</p><p>All right, let's move on to our next driver and taking a punt. Ireland's Paddy Power and Canada's Pokerstars to unite. The merger will create the world's largest online gambling Empire.</p><p>Anna Stewart is taking a look at this story for us. We've seen consolidation and shift of consumers to things like online gambling, which has played a part here, too. But there's also deregulation going on potentially more in the United States, which is also playing a part here, too, I think. Talk us through it.</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: Yes, I think three key drivers to this deal actually. What we have is, as you say, increasing regulation, legal challenges, taxation of gambling industry here in the U.K., also, actually in Australia.</p><p>We also have the shift online, as you said, and that involves not just shift online, but also diversification of the product range. It's no longer just, you know, flash from the GGs. We're talking about sports betting, poker, casino. Fantasy sports, Julia, also a big one.</p><p>And then perhaps the biggest is the legalization of sports gambling in the United States. Actually, this is what the CEO of Flutter, Peter Jackson said on the call today.</p><p>He said that the opening up of the U.S. sports betting market is perhaps the most exciting development in the industry since the advent of online betting. They've already been positioning themselves here, you'll see that Stars Group, they had a recent deal with Fox Sports, Flutter Sport FanDuel, that is a U.S. fantasy sports business.</p><p>And it is traditionally of course, as you say, an industry that already is pretty high on the consolidation front. Of course, Flutter was created by three Irish gambling companies followed by Betfair in 2016.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, I mean, it's quite fascinating. I was just digging around in the details, cost synergies of $140 million a year. It looked pretty nice here, and then I get to the regulatory part, and the combination of these two companies, 40 percent of the gambling market in the U.K. after this deal, and I say, U.K. regulators are going to have a real problem with that.</p><p>STEWART: And this was so what everyone wanted on the call, because this doesn't just need shareholder approval, and I'm sure they'll get it if you look at the share price here. But yes, it needs approval from the regulators of the U.K., of Ireland, of Australia, the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. will be particularly difficult. Forty percent market share is likely to raise some eyebrows. Of course, they have 40 days, the CMA, the regulator here to make that call once this is all made official.</p><p>But all the questions they will -- will they dispose of any assets? They're just keeping tight-lipped on that one. Very confident, of course that this will get through, but I think this is a story that will come up again in the next few weeks -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, and we will continue to track it. Anna Stewart, thank you so much for that. All right, let me bring you up to speed now with some of the other stories that we're following around the world.</p><p>And an update on the U.S. Impeachment Inquiry. A short time ago during his visit to Italy, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke about the phone call between President Trump and Ukraine's leader in July. He confirmed he was on the call, which he said is consistent with American policy.</p><p>Melissa Bell joins us now from Rome and was in that press conference. Melissa, what he didn't say, though, was whether that phone calls set off any alarm bells while he was on it. Talk us through it.</p><p>MELISSA BELL, CNN PARIS CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Julia. No answer to the question of whether any red flags had been raised in his mind as he listened to Donald Trump press the Ukrainian President in that phone call, but at last, a confirmation on the part of the Secretary of State himself that he had indeed been on the call.</p><p>Now that's important, Julia, because it goes to the heart of what the chairmen of the House committees that are in charge of this Impeachment Inquiry are saying in a joint statement that they published last night essentially accusing the Secretary of State of having a conflict of interest in this Impeachment Inquiry, because he had been on the call. This is what Mike Pompeo had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: As for was I on the phone call? I was on the phone call. The phone call was in the context of, now, I guess I've been a Secretary of State for coming on a year and a half. I know precisely what the American policy is with respect to Ukraine. It's been remarkably consistent and we will continue to try to drive those set of outcomes.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BELL: He was also asked, Julia about those accusations on the part of the three committee chairmen that he was essentially stonewalling trying to get in the way of their inquiry and certainly not being as forthcoming as he should with the production of documents that he has been asked for and allowing for those depositions by the five current or previous members - officials from the State Department to make those statements to the committees.</p><p>[09:15:16]</p><p>BELL: Now, he replied on that question that he would, of course do his constitutional duty, but that he insisted on protecting officials from the State Department from what he described and has described during this week as act of intimidation.</p><p>So not being very clear there about how far he intends to go in cooperating with an inquiry, but suggesting that perhaps he wouldn't seek to be standing in its way as clearly as he was earlier this week.</p><p>But clearly the headline from this, Mike Pompeo admitting that he was on that call. He also went on to talk about the Inspector General tonight on whether he was asked about, whether he knew anything about what the Inspector General who is asked to Congressmen later on today, would have to say to them, what were the documents that will be given to the Congressmen, he would not be drawing on that question at all -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, plenty of questions to come from Congress, I think and only fueled by this presser. Melissa Bell in Rome there. Thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right to Istanbul now where crowds are remembering slain Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi one year after his brutal murder. The vigil was held outside the Saudi consulate where Khashoggi entered on October 2, 2018, never to be seen again.</p><p>Turning to North Korea now and just one day after Pyongyang agreed to resume stalled nuclear talks with the United States, the country fired a ballistic missile towards the Sea of Japan. This is the first time North Korea has launched a missile from an underwater platform since its talks with U.S. President Donald Trump.</p><p>The 18-year-old protester who was shot by Hong Kong Police is under arrest for assaulting an officer. A source tells CNN, current and former students staged a sit-in at the protester's school on Wednesday to denounce the shooting. Authorities say Tuesday's arrests count for the National Day has risen to 269.</p><p>All right, so we're going to take a quick break here on FIRST MOVE, but coming up, Hong Kong's latest retail sales data highlight the business cost of unrest and in the meantime, it is full steam ahead in the Chinese Mainland as Tesla prepares for production. Stay with CNN. We're back after this.</p><p>[09:20:29]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. We're live at the New York Stock Exchange counting down to the market open as always this morning and we are looking at a weak open for U.S. stocks following the weakness that we saw in yesterday's trading session, too. A shaky start to Q4 trading.</p><p>All the major averages are off more than one percent yesterday. We're down around three percent from all-time highs for the Dow and the S&amp;P, so in aggregate, always worth the context here.</p><p>Safe havens, also benefiting from some of this weakness. We've got bond yields here in the United States, the 10-year down in terms of rates for the fifth straight session. The dollar at its strongest levels for some two years. The Dollar Index versus a number of different other currencies. What about Japanese bond yields hereto? Ticking lower after a big jump higher yesterday after the Central Bank suggested they would buy less longer term bonds hereto, so that's having a global impact on bonds.</p><p>There's a lot going on. That's the bottom line. To explain it all, Liz Young, Director of Market Strategy at BNY Mellon. Liz, fantastic to have you on the show.</p><p>LIZ YOUNG, DIRECTOR OF MARKET STRATEGY, BNY MELLON: Great to be here.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Let's start with the data.</p><p>YOUNG: Certainly.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: What we saw yesterday in the manufacturing survey data confirming pretty much a lot of data that we've seen recently that at least as far as the manufacturing sector is concerned here, it is recessionary.</p><p>YOUNG: Sure, but I think the important thing to remember here is that this is not new news. The globe has really been in a manufacturing downturn for a while now. A lot of which was due to trade.</p><p>So the fact that our manufacturing data is suffering a little bit, not entirely surprising, I'm not going to say that it's a positive thing. But it's not a surprise, it shouldn't really be a shock.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So some analysts coming out in the last 24 hours going, the overall recession risk here for the U.S. economy is real. Obviously, we have to watch the consumer. Are people being alarmist even at this stage?</p><p>YOUNG: I think at this point, when you get this late in the cycle, no matter what your opinion is, you can probably find the data to support it. So when you look at the U.S. economy and really remember what a recession is defined as, it's two consecutive quarters of negative growth, right? And the US economy is still driven almost 70 percent by the consumer.</p><p>So the consumer is strong, and a lot of this positivity has been predicated on a strong labor market and a strong consumer, the consumer stays strong, manufacturing is a concern, but the consumer piece is really the crux of the issue.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know what's interesting, the President came out and we've mentioned it on the show already blaming the strong dollar. He blamed a slug Federal Reserve. It's interesting that when you look at what the small and medium-sized businesses are saying in the survey, they're pointing to what we keep saying is the big risk here and that's trade -- trade uncertainty at this stage.</p><p>YOUNG: Right. Trade continues to be a risk. I think one of the bigger risks is that the market still sort of expects even a lightweight deal before the election next year. So if we don't get one that could be somewhat of a negative catalyst.</p><p>However, I don't think anybody really expects a grand resolution, us, included anytime in the near future and when I say near future, I mean six to 12 months.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You also point to something that I find quite interesting, a 30 percent chance that a market pullback here actually does create a recession in the United States. Talk us through that.</p><p>YOUNG: Right. So we could we could put ourselves into what's a self- fulfilling prophecy here, and I want to be clear, Julia. It's a 30 percent chance. We actually have a higher chance of there not being a recession.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. Good point.</p><p>YOUNG: But that risk, that 30 percent chance is that we have some kind of sentiment shock, and right now with the market near all-time highs, and we continue to have some of these short term intraday rallies and the little pullbacks, but what's really the risk here is that if we have a sentiment shock and selling pressure comes in, and it reverberates through, that bleeds through into the real economy that would probably cause a more short-lived and shallow recession. But it is definitely a risk.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Is that because people are owning stocks and they lose money and therefore they get nervous, or is it simply that you turn on the news, you see the red arrows, you see people talking about stock markets falling, and it has a sentiment impact?</p><p>YOUNG: It is both of those issues. So Americans right now actually own more in equities than they did in real estate since before the crisis. So they're more exposed to equities than they have been for a long, long time. So that's a big piece of our wealth.</p><p>And then the other piece is obviously, this market has been driven mostly by macro factors, mostly by rhetoric, mostly by monetary policy support and not as much by fundamentals.</p><p>So if we get a surprise from those macro factors or from news pieces, that's what really breeds sensitivity into the market.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So, my takeaway from what you're saying here is actually that you should still be invested in these markets and don't be concerned.</p><p>[09:25:07]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: JPMorgan said this week, time to buy Eurozone stocks and most of those markets are actually having a shock in aggregate today, I have to point out, where -- would you be investing in Europe at this moment? What do you think of the United States?</p><p>YOUNG: I would split Europe up. I don't know that I'd be ready to put fresh capital into European stocks right now. I'd like to wait through some of this fall nonsense that's going to happen. We still have to figure Brexit out. We have a leadership change that's going to happen at the ECB at the end of this month.</p><p>So there's a lot of uncertainty there, and then obviously, we have a question mark about Germany may be falling into recession.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>YOUNG: So I'd like to see some fiscal stimulus come out of Europe before I'm ready to put fresh capital in. But we do find an interesting buying opportunity in the U.K. equities and with Brexit concerns, because a lot of that bad news has already been priced in and remember, we are years after that vote.</p><p>So this is not -- again, this is not a new story. This is not new volatility that Brexit piece, so I think we could start to dabble in U.K. equities.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Interesting. We need to be prepared for volatility, though, at least by the end of this month.</p><p>YOUNG: Right.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Interesting one. The United States?</p><p>YOUNG: Still positive on the U.S. We continue to be the best house in a bad neighborhood.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes.</p><p>YOUNG; And we see growth slowing and continuing to slow, but not turning negative. And if the Fed does cut one more time this year, which is what we're expecting, we have a chance to really turn that trend around. So 2020, could be a positive surprise.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So the battle of the uglies, the United States wins. Liz Young.</p><p>YOUNG: That's true.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Liz Young, thank you so much. There's nothing ugly about this show. Director of Market Strategy at BNY Mellon there. All right, we're counting down to the market open. Coming up, we'll be talking about some excitement. Comments from the Facebook CEO. Ouchies. That's coming up, and plenty more discussion and we will be heading over to Hong Kong. Tune in for the latest there. Stay with us. We're back in two.</p><p>[09:30:00]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Come back to FIRST MOVE and the opening bell this morning. U.S. stocks following what we've seen in the European session, too. Moving lower early on in the session today, as we mentioned, that manufacturing survey data, a real kicker for sentiment over the last 24 hours.</p><p>The major averages, beginning the session at one-month lows, but remember just a couple of percentage points away from all-time highs.</p><p>We also had the ADP payrolls data here in the United States ahead of nonfarm payrolls on Friday, which we've already discussed. It will be pretty key here.</p><p>The September numbers are coming in. Pretty much in line though, some lower revisions in August. The point I'll pull out here is the manufacturing sector in the U.S. adding some 2,000 jobs. We will take whatever we can get amid broader worries here about manufacturing.</p><p>What about the oil sector, too? Because that all ties in. Turning lower in the session today, despite a surprise drop in U.S. inventory numbers. Again, I think it's the kicker after greater demand fears outweighing supply fears here when you look at sentiment in that market today, too.</p><p>Okay, let's bring it back to stocks and the global movers. Stars Group trading higher in the session. The Canadian online gaming and betting company merging with Ireland's Flutter entertainment. That's the parent company of Paddy Power. The tie-up will create the world's biggest online gambling company as we've discussed, just as the U.S. sports betting market really gets opening up here. The question will be of course, regulators elsewhere in the world as we've discussed on the show.</p><p>TD Ameritrade, the American broker announced Tuesday that its online operations will stop charging commissions on stocks and ETFs - Exchange Traded Funds. This follows a similar move by rival, Charles Schwab. We'll discuss that in more detail later in the show.</p><p>And for now, the final stock to watch, Lennar, the homebuilder's profits and revenues beating Wall Street's expectations. New orders rising nine percent compared to a year earlier. It's a nice indication there on consumer confidence hereto with big purchases.</p><p>All right, Facebook, let's turn to them. The CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently told employees what he thinks an Elizabeth Warren presidency would mean for the company. Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: ... someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies, I mean, if she gets elected President, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge.</p><p>Does that still suck for us? Yes. I mean, I don't have to have a major lawsuit against our own government ...</p><p>(END AUDIO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Ouch. The audio of that meeting was published by The Verge. Meanwhile, Democratic presidential candidate, Elizabeth Warren, who has been a strong critic of big tech responded by saying, \"What would really suck is if we don't fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anti-competitive practices.\"</p><p>Facebook, of course, facing a number of antitrust probes. Donie O'Sullivan, joins us on this story. I mean, he was quite pointed there. But you could argue he has a point. She is not the only person saying this. But she is the loudest voice and she has got the corporate sector and big tech well and truly in her sights here.</p><p>DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: That's right, Julia. I mean, I think a lot of people who want to see these companies broken up and say Facebook is too big -- remember, they own Instagram and WhatsApp as well -- say that, you know, this argument touch Facebook because it's a bigger company, it has better resources to tackle election interference and provide better security.</p><p>If you look at the track record of the company over the past few years, they don't particularly have a good one. They let a lot of election interference happen. We know there's been a lot of data breaches on the platform.</p><p>And speaking to somebody from one of the smaller companies -- competitor -- know, told me this morning that because these companies are so big, they don't actually have that competitive pressure to really truly have to clean up their platform.</p><p>Another interesting point that Zuckerberg made was that the companies work together better if they're all within the one umbrella organization in terms of let's say, tackling foreign interference or trolls, things like that.</p><p>But at the same time, Facebook is telling us and the U.S. government, that they're working well with Twitter and Google on coordinating ahead of the 2020 election.</p><p>And if you want to go back just to a month ago, we learned that the Chinese government were behind accounts that were interfering with protests in Hong Kong trying to attack protesters there on online. That tip actually came from Twitter. So it's Twitter that told Facebook about that, and Twitter is obviously a much smaller company.</p><p>[09:35:06]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: It's quite fascinating there. The idea that breaking up these big tech companies will make election interference worse, I have to say, I think is a complete stretch.</p><p>If they're working together as different companies, surely they will still work together. I'm not quite sure I believe that, but I do want to go back to what you and I concluded yesterday, Donie, as a result of politicians being allowed to post things, say things on Facebook, pay for ads effectively, that could contain fake news.</p><p>The D.N.C. has waded in here, the CEO at least and she is not happy. Talk us through that.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: That's right. So we know that Facebook has taken this massive effort to combat misinformation on its platform over the past three years. But, Nick Clegg last week confirmed that when it comes to politicians, when it comes to somebody like President Trump, they will not fact check his posts. They will let him post freely and not in any way sort of down rank those posts.</p><p>The Trump campaign has spent $20 million on Facebook ads since May of 2018, just in about a year and a half. So they're a big spender on Facebook. The D.N.C. came out yesterday, the Democratic National Committee, and they said, look, President Trump doesn't have a good track record with the truth and his posts should be fact checked.</p><p>Now, I think that goes back to a sort of bigger argument of well, how much power do you really want these platforms to have? You know, Democrats want them to take responsibility, the likes of Facebook, but also we hear that they have too much power, and you know, would sort of censoring or in some way, taking down the posts of the President of the United States overstep that boundary.</p><p>And this morning, we learned that Kamala Harris, a Democratic presidential hopeful here, wrote to Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter yesterday, asking him to suspend President Trump's account. We know President Trump has been tweeting about references to Civil War and things like that over the weekend.</p><p>And she pointed to how Twitter had suspended other high profile figures, like the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, but, I think Twitter who has told us just in the past few minutes that they have received Harris's letter and intend to respond. I think they'll be very slow to want to suspend the account of the President of the United States.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. So slow they will backwards on that one. What we can't ignore here is the President Trump has been great for business. Donie, great to have you with us, telling it like it is. Donie O'Sullivan. Great.</p><p>All right, let's move on because we're going to take a quick break. Coming up though, after this, the summer of discontent over in Hong Kong, a reflection of the price paid by the economy. All the details, next.</p><p>[09:50:56]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. In Iraq, the Prime Minister has announced measures aimed at fighting joblessness. The move follows two days of violent protests there that left three dead and 230 injured after clashes with Security Forces, protests erupted in Baghdad and elsewhere on Tuesday over employment, government corruption and the lack of basic services.</p><p>Meantime, Hong Kong dealing with the aftermath of Tuesday's protests, it was the most violent in almost four months of demonstrations. Dozens were injured and police reported 269 arrests.</p><p>The 18-year-old who was shot by Hong Kong Police is among them, a source tells CNN. Current and former students staged a sit-in at his school Wednesday to denounce the shooting.</p><p>This, as the city counts the cost of the protests, new figures suggests the unrest is hitting the economy hard. Retail sales dropped from 23 percent in August to the worst level on record.</p><p>For more. I'm joined by Tara Joseph. She is President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. Tara, always great to have you with us on the show. This day, too, I think reflects what you've been saying some time, whether it's the retail sector, hotels, leisure, tourism, it's really bearing the brunt here of the ongoing protests.</p><p>TARA JOSEPH, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN HONG KONG: That's right. And when you look at those retail sales figures that you just mentioned, Julia, that's for August. We're now in the month of October. And as far as retail sales goes, things aren't getting any better.</p><p>We're actually into a new normal when it comes to the local economy in Hong Kong, and to tell you the truth, it's starting to feel a bit surreal. You were showing pictures before of the scenes from yesterday, you could walk into the middle of the Central Business District yesterday evening and hear a pin drop.</p><p>All the shops were closed shopping malls were shut. Bars, restaurants, hotels are down to very low occupancy and that's on days when there are protests.</p><p>But today was a normal work day and the metro was running, people were going to work, everything feels almost back to normal. And we're experiencing this constant flip flop here that's become, as I said, the new normal and it's a little bit strange.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, we should also make the point as well. This is traditionally, this week is traditionally a great time for mainland tourists from China to come to Hong Kong, even as you say things go back to normal on days where we don't see protests. What about Chinese Mainland tourists coming to Hong Kong. Are they staying away or are they still coming back when things calm down?</p><p>JOSEPH: The numbers right now are definitely down and you can feel that in the streets when you walk around. The shops, especially the big luxury shops and hotels are really feeling the pinch right now. And hopefully, if and when these protests end, they'll come back.</p><p>Hong Kong is a great place for people to come and visit and very close to Mainland China. It's one of the favorite places to come. The issue right now is when will it end? And that's what businesses are really trying to figure out. Do you hunker down? Maybe close early? Et cetera. And just wait for this to finish or at some point, are people going to have to lay off staff or think of other ways to keep going? So that's the issue.</p><p>But I do want to bring up the fact that multinational companies and many of the major American companies that are here, they're not leaving. It is business as usual here, and I haven't heard of any real examples of companies saying, you know, we're out of Hong Kong. We're done now.</p><p>Many people are waiting to see how this is going to play out and hoping that Hong Kong can come back and be the amazing city for business that it's always been.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You know, it's interesting, Tara. We spoke to Victor Gao of the China National Association of International Studies yesterday and he said there's a difference between peaceful protest and violent protest and from the business community members that you're speaking to, would they like to see the police act to prevent the violence here? Or are they sticking away from what is a very sensitive subject?</p><p>[09:45:21]</p><p>JOSEPH: Well, it is a sensitive subject. But as far as businesses go and we have many businesses that have chambers here, it's a very international city, nobody wants to see violence. Violence is hurtful. It's harmful to society. People are worried about their own employees and the dangers they may face.</p><p>So it's quite easy to say the violence is rough and people would much prefer to see peaceful protest.</p><p>For the American Chamber, we really respect the right for people to have freedom of speech and to be able to express themselves peacefully, but the difficulty with violence is that it gives people around the world for one, a very harsh image of Hong Kong, and that's going to be hard to overcome in the long run.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's good to get your perspective though, as you point out, it's troubled but trying to carry on despite the challenges. Fantastic to have you with us Tara. Tara Joseph, the President of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong there. Thank you for that.</p><p>All right. Troubles in Hong Kong, but one company not so worried about what's going on in the mainland. Tesla is stepping on the gas in China. They're reportedly starting production this month. It's the first car manufacturing site outside of the United States.</p><p>Clare Sebastian is with me. Tesla faces broader challenges around the world and here in the United States, but not holding back in China. What do we know Clare on this?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Julia. The report from Reuters citing sources familiar with the matter is that they are on track to start production at their China Giga Factory, which as you say, is the first one outside of the U.S. this month. That is increasing rapidly fast progress.</p><p>I think we can show you some pictures from July of the Giga Factory itself. They only broke ground on this in January. So it's pretty stunning at how far they've come. And they, you know, are incredibly bullish on this.</p><p>Elon Musk saying in their July earnings call that it's going incredibly well. He visited China in August. He said that the work of the China team is mind blowing. I think you can see from those pictures that he has a point there.</p><p>But according to the Reuters report, there's still no guarantee that they will meet their end of year targets of at least a thousand cars a week out of this factory.</p><p>There's still issues with the supply chain, whether or not they can get the local employees up to speed, but this is a huge part of Tesla's business don't forget, Julia, about a quarter of their revenue comes from China and that all reports suggests that they've actually been doing really well in the country despite the slowing car market.</p><p>Their revenues were up in the first six months of this year, 40 percent compared to the same period last year. So this is a big bet on China, but so far, it looks like that they are betting in the right place.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, doing well even as the broader electric vehicle market there slows. Clare, what about other numbers from Tesla? Because we're going to get an update from them about the broader business today, too. What should we expect?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Yes, so production and delivery numbers are expected. The third quarter was ended on Monday. Now, we did have a letter from Elon Musk to staff that was published by \"Electric\" last week where he said they have a shot at meeting 100,000 deliveries this quarter. That would be the first time they've ever done that. It would beat the previous record of 95,000 in the previous quarter.</p><p>But there are some challenges to this logistics. It remains a big issue for Tesla, there are questions over whether they can get the vehicles into the right places to get them to customers. There's a Federal tax break, which was cut by 50 percent in July.</p><p>So straight in the start of this quarter, whether or not that will have impacted orders. There's competition from new players on the market, like Hyundai and Kia who have all brought new electric cars to the market.</p><p>And of course, the big question for investors, Julia is whether or not bigger delivery numbers can actually translate into a smaller potential loss in the third quarter. I think that is something that many people will be asking.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, critical question. I think investors have learned to just buckle up for these numbers, quite frankly. We shall see. Clare Sebastian, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right. Up next, a war without winners. Broker TD Ameritrade matching Charles Schwab in slashing online brokerage fees. The question is who can survive a race to the bottom? We'll discuss after this.</p><p>[09:51:30]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Tuesday saw an all-out price war erupt in the brokerage industry. Charles Schwab fired the first shot announcing it would slash to zero fees on some online trades. TD Ameritrade swiftly followed suit.</p><p>Paul La Monica joins us on this story. The problem for these players is they've got different levels of the proportion of their revenues attributable to this part of the business. It hurts some more than others here, Paul, and that played out in the market yesterday.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Exactly, Julia. It hurts TD Ameritrade and E-Trade who we have yet to hear from whether or not they're going to match this and go to zero commissions as well. They have a higher percentage of their revenue coming from commissions in these types of trading accounts. So it does impact them more negatively even than Schwab which is going to take a hit, of course, as well.</p><p>All three companies though, doing more advisory. They're going to probably, I would imagine, maybe do some more margin lending. They have to find other areas to supplement the revenue that they're going to be losing by basically going all Robinhood in getting rid of these commissions.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Oh, what a perfect link, because that is exactly what I was going to ask you. How much of the challenge that we're seeing here is customers simply getting more sensitive and looking around and going, you know, I don't want to pay big fees, and so we've got this race to the bottom here.</p><p>This is competition from some of the upstarts like Robinhood that are saying, look, we'll let you do it. We will let you do it on your phone, and we'll let you do it cheaper.</p><p>LA MONICA: Exactly. I think the rise of Robinhood, particularly with millennial investors is one of the primary reasons why Schwab and TD Ameritrade made this decision and also last week, Interactive Brokers, another smaller, lesser known online discount brokerage company also getting rid of commissions.</p><p>So the key question I think that's going to be interesting, though now is this is obviously something that validates Robinhood. But there's also now all this competition.</p><p>Robinhood, at last check, it was valued at about $7.6 billion dollars as a private company. Given this new competition and the crazy amount of skepticism we now have for unicorns in general, in light of WeWork, what's their valuation going to look like if they ever go public? I wonder if it's going to be as high as it is right now.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: When the disruptor set gets disrupted back, that's what you're saying.</p><p>LA MONICA: Pretty much. This is obviously a no-brainer decision, I think for Schwab and TD Ameritrade and I would expect E-Trade to follow suit and that means all of a sudden, what does Robinhood have that really makes them stand out if everyone has zero commissions?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. I wonder if we get below zero as you keep people to --</p><p>LA MONICA: What? Is it the ECB?</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, it's a possibility. We'll see. Paul La Monica, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right. Let me bring you up to speed with today's \"Boardroom Brief.\" Fitch ratings downgraded WeWork's credit status to junk territory after the company abandoned plans to go public. The office sharing company had hoped to raise at least $3 billion in the IPO. Fitch downgraded WeWork to a CCC- plus rating with a negative outlook.</p><p>Vice Media in talks to acquire digital media company, Refinery29. The two companies are hammering out a deal that would value the woman focused brand at less than $500 million. The acquisition is part of Vice Media's strategy to compete for digital ad dollars.</p><p>[09:55:06]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The CEO of Britain's largest retailer, Tesco, is stepping down. It comes after he the heat declared the retailer's turn around complete. Dave Lewis launched Tesco's recovery plan after an accounting scandal hit the company in 2014.</p><p>And this, just in, Walmart has announced that it is suspending sales of heartburn medication, Zantac. It's the latest major retailer to pull that drug from shelves on consents, but it's been contaminated by low-levels of cancer causing chemical.</p><p>Walmart is also pulling generic versions of Zantac from the shelves. Walgreens, Rite Aid and CVS have also stopped selling Zantac. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says it's investigating the risk to patients.</p><p>All right, that just about wraps it up for the show. Let me give you a look at what we're seeing for U.S. majors. This market, as we mentioned, it was a tough start to the session. Where are we now? Well, it continues and we continue to see pressure for the majors. We continue to track the changes. \"Express\" is up in a couple of hours' time, but for now, you've been watching FIRST MOVE, time to go make yours. Have a great Wednesday.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2019100201cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X64-00K1-DXH2-63JT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7790\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 2, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0009AVH</classCode><className>PADDY POWER PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"82\"><classCode>CC00027NH</classCode><className>JPMORGAN CHASE &amp;

Among the issues that were top of mind were one blockbuster acquisition, two agency closings and how data, privacy concerns and platform changes are shaping advertising. Here\u2019s what we heard.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unsurprisingly, the most-cited agency story of the year was Accenture Interactive acquiring Droga5 in April, which included the marketing arm of global consultancy Accenture buying out a 49% stake in the formerly 51% independent agency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">T3 CCO Jay Suhr called it a \u201cpinnacle event that points to a macro trend,\u201d stressing that \u201cthe real story for the agency community goes beyond the financials, to the why behind Accenture\u2019s largest acquisition to date. \u2026\u00a0This move is about the all-out pursuit of a new agency model\u2014something that consulting firms, agencies, and brands are all undertaking at an accelerated pace.\u201d</p><p>The VIA Agency chief strategy officer David Burfeind called the acquisition both the story of the year and \u201cthe deal of the decade.\u201d</p><p>He pointed to the important demonstration of the commitment of consultancies\u2013and their financial resources\u2013to level the playing field. Burfeind added the move shows the branding while commanding a price premium as well as the power of creativity and importance of independents.</p><p>\u201cWith all the headlines around data, technology and systems, let\u2019s hope Accenture\u2019s big investment in creativity reminds us all of its vital importance in unleashing marketing\u2019s full potential,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the fact that creativity flourishes with independence and freedom.\u201d</p><p>There seems to be a consensus that there are many implications from the acquisition of one of the industry\u2019s most celebrated largely independent agencies by a large global consultancy.</p><p>Barkley\u2019s svp, director of strategic projects David Gutting described the move as a paradigm shift from the status quo as it \u201cripped the Band-Aid off the aging holding company model.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the recognition\u2014by a premier creative leader\u2014that it\u2019s not all about storytelling,\u201d he said. \u201cDavid Droga acknowledged that Accenture \u2018can build things that we can\u2019t build, they understand things we don\u2019t understand.\u2019 He also said he wanted to build businesses, not just brands. That\u2019s revolutionary.\u201d</p><p>2019 also saw the sad departure of two independent agencies.</p><p>In August, Barton F. Graf announced it would close by the end of 2019, concluding its run as advertising\u2019s weirdest agency.</p><p>\u201cBarton F. Graf\u2019s demise wasn\u2019t just sad for its founders, employees, and clients. It was sad for everyone who loves the business, creativity, and the work,\u201d Pereira &amp; O\u2019Dell founder and creative chairman P.J. Pereria said, who called for the need to take care of each other and care more about the work.</p><p>In October, Dallas agency TM Advertising closed after 85 years in business, less than two years after the agency bought itself back from IPG. Last week, TM Advertising sold its URL tm.com for $1.25 million. For some, the sale displayed another closure made under financial pressure.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear that clients continue to cut fees and look for the best bargains making it impossible for some agencies to compete,\u201d North CEO Rebecca Armstrong said. \u201cFurther, we know that CEOs are bracing for the long-predicted market correction. Agencies need to brace, too. Only the responsive and flexible will survive. Or maybe those with the foresight to cash in early on their unique and valuable URLs.\u201d</p><p>The growing importance of data in advertising was an unavoidable topic in 2019. Publicis Groupe made headlines in April with its $4.4 billion acquisition of Epsilon. Each of the five major holding companies provided differential data offerings. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that the importance of creativity diminished. Forrester debuted a study at Cannes entitled \u201cThe Cost of Losing Creativity\u201d that showed how much data can provide a competitive advantage.</p><p>Jacki Kelley, recently promoted to CEO of the Americas at Dentsu Aegis Network sees \u201cthe rise of identity and the renaissance of creativity\u201d as key, intrinsically-linked stories.</p><p>\u201cSuccess in our business is about creating ideas in a data-rich world,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cSo that they can create personalized experiences using those identities, is essential. \u2026 It\u2019s about connecting through creativity that is magnetic, engaging and at times, beautiful.\u201d</p><p>AMV BBDO CCO Sarah Douglass maintained agencies need to protect creativity in what\u2019s acknowledged as a sometimes aggressively expansive tech revolution.</p><p>\u201cThere is only one tool sharp enough to cut through the gluttony, apathy and noise and that is creativity. We are entering a new golden age of our inaugural purpose,\u201d she added.</p><p>Relatedly, the industry felt the impact of consumer privacy regulations such as the ramifications of GDPR being implemented in Europe in 2018, and the anticipation around the upcoming California Consumer Privacy Act.</p><p>\u201cWith CCPA looming and the cookie crumbling, it\u2019s an absolutely pivotal moment for agencies to become key partners in terms of helping brands transition from proxy-based marketing to people-based marketing,\u201d Kelley said. \u201cThen, it\u2019s about marrying the math with the magic of brilliant creativity. That is the winning formula for success now and will be throughout the coming year.\u201d</p><p>Havas Media evp, digital strategy Sargi Mann explained that the narrative around consumer privacy concerns rippled impact beyond agencies to marketers, publishers, ad tech, marketing tech and other partners across the entire media and marketing ecosystem.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s made the consumer\u2019s data and the handling of consumer information with the highest responsibility a center of attention for everyone,\u201d she explained. \u201cEarning and retaining that trust and ensuring that the value created for consumers as part of that exchange is not trivialized in the industry\u2019s quest to do more personalized, targeted advertising; it\u2019s become a key value proposition for the ad and marketing technology industry.\u201d</p><p>Mann predicted a more hands-on approach in the world of marketing under more scrutiny of big tech\u2019s data gathering, process, storing and usage practice a la Facebook and Google.</p><p>While cord-cutting and streaming services were hardly new topics in 2019, developments in OTT remained top of mind for advertisers in 2019.</p><p>\u201cThe rise in OTT platforms will fundamentally change how viewers consume content \u2013 and impact how advertisers have to seek out new ways to capture their attention,\u201d said Spark Foundry chief client officer Eric Levin.</p><p>TikTok demanded advertisers\u2019 attention, as did the continued growth of Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix and YouTube. There was the highly anticipated launch of Disney\u2019s streaming service last month, which saw 10 million users sign up for Disney+ by its second day. Apple\u2019s own streaming service, Apple TV+, also launched\u00a0in November.</p><p>\u201cThere is officially a swing from TV\u2019s dominance to the rise of digital channels,\u201d explained SocialCode CEO Laura O\u2019Shaughnessy. She cited reports from Edison Research which found that 55.3% of the U.S. population subscribed to over-the-top services this year, with the number of cord-cutters and non-pay TV households expected to reach 44 million in 2020.</p><p>\u201cNow more than ever, it\u2019s critical for brands to create a coherent content strategy across platforms that reaches customers where they are spending the bulk of their time, including OTT streaming, social, mobile and digital channels,\u201d O\u2019Shaughnessy said. \u201cThese channels can\u2019t be thought of as independent silos, but need to work together as the customer travels across them.\u201d</p><p>In 2019, the ad industry recognized it still had significant strides to make towards more diverse representation and inclusivity.</p><p>An ANA Educational Foundation report released in February called \u201cCharting a More Diverse Pathway to Growth\u201d focusing on the demographics of African-Americans, Hispanics and Asian-Americans showed that hiring practices weren\u2019t enough to advance inclusivity in marketing and advertising. Duncan Channon CEO Andy Berkenfield said the eye-opening report uncovered a tough truth.</p><p>\u201cInvestments in diversity hiring aren\u2019t leading to inclusivity in advertising,\u201d Duncan Channon CEO Andy Berkenfield said. \u201cIn 2019, the data forced us to reckon with the fact that hiring people of diverse backgrounds is simply a start, not the solution.\u201d</p><p>Berkenfield said the report challenges and reminds the industry \u201cthat agency leadership can\u2019t be afraid to build a nuanced understanding of the challenges their employees face with regard to diversity, and create work environments that are both culturally literate and safe for tough conversations.\u201d</p><p>As the ad industry heads into 2020, perhaps the next decade can be the one where ad agencies truly make progress on this issue.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1107611</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XTR-H4Y1-JC8H-T003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1458\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 24, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The deal for Jet.com is just the latest defensive internet acquisition of an emerging start-up that will preserve the hegemony of a select few.</p><p>Jet.com was created to take on the dominant force in internet sales, Amazon.com. Although traditional brick-and-mortar retailers like Sears are dying slowly, unable to adapt to the internet, Jet.com - founded by Marc Lore, who sold the parent company of Diapers.com and other sites to Amazon for $545 million - has been different.</p><p>Opening for business about a year ago, Jet.com was able to achieve scale remarkably quickly, reportedly increasing revenue to more than $1 billion, with more than 3.5 million registered shoppers.</p><p>Yes, Jet.com has been losing money on every shipment, but remember that Amazon went years without turning a significant profit. Jet.com is still a minnow - Amazon clocks in $100 billion in annual revenue - but it is, as Investor's Business Daily put it, ''one of the few e-tail companies in the U.S. that's openly challenging Amazon's dominance.''</p><p>And now it is being swallowed up by the largest retailer in the world.</p><p>This could be seen as a victory for competition. Walmart will now have a more dynamic management and brand to buttress its own internet sales operation. This will allow it to better compete against Amazon. The likely result is that competition in online retailing will eventually be a slugfest between Amazon and Walmart with everyone else thrown by the wayside.</p><p>The problem with this narrative is that it cements the positions of Walmart and Amazon as the only players in town.</p><p>This is the modus operandi of the big internet behemoths. They live in fear of new technology disrupting their businesses and killing them off.</p><p>Antonio Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez's recent book about Silicon Valley, ''Chaos Monkeys,'' tells how Facebook operates on the model of ''we might die any day.''</p><p>Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez was a Facebook product manager when the company faced its greatest threat: Google Plus. Facebook won because it enforced an ethos of all work, all the time, spurred by constant fear of extinction.</p><p>Facebook and its elite brethren will do anything to make sure they are not the next Yahoo or RadioShack, killed by disruption and failure to innovate. This translates into paying obscene sums for technology that might challenge their dominance one day.</p><p>If you don't believe this, there is a passage in ''Chaos Monkeys'' where Mr. Garc\u00eda Mart\u00ednez notes that Mark Zuckerberg saw two companies with ''hockey stick growth'' that matched Facebook's own: Instagram and WhatsApp. Both were amassing users at an amazing rate and both were a threat to Facebook.</p><p>Did Mr. Zuckerberg rev up the Facebook machine to try to outcompete them? No. Instead, he bought Instagram for about $1 billion and WhatsApp for $21.8 billion.</p><p>Today, Facebook is dominant, with more than 1.7 billion monthly active users. WhatsApp has more than 1 billion monthly active users and Instagram more than 500 million.</p><p>This is par for the course in Silicon Valley. Google bought Waze for $1 billion in part to prevent Facebook from getting it and in part to buttress its own dominant map technology. The result is that Google remains dominant, with only Apple as its main competitor. For a time, the only other competitor was Nokia's Here maps, which was sold in 2015 for use in driverless cars and has disappeared as a competitor. The result is a duopoly in map technology.</p><p>Billions of dollars are made in Silicon Valley by selling upstarts to the giants. And the dominant players pay eagerly to remain dominant. That is what is going on with the Jet.com acquisition and perhaps even the $26.2 billion purchase of LinkedIn by Microsoft.</p><p>Where are the antitrust authorities in all of this? The guiding standard under the law is that no acquisition should be allowed if it would ''lessen competition.''</p><p>Under the traditional view of antitrust, when Facebook, for example, tries to buy a company like Instagram, it can argue that anyone can start such a website, and there are other competitors, like Google and Snapchat. And so this gets past the antitrust authorities, who seem more concerned with how the data will be used rather than the accumulation of users. Both United States and European Union regulators examined the WhatsApp deal, but it passed muster because WhatsApp was viewed as a messenger service, something where there was alternative competition.</p><p>This misses the point that domination is all about users and views. Those companies with users and page views can dominate, and accumulating those users is everything, something only a small number of companies can do.</p><p>The antitrust system results in the increasing oligopoly that we have, where a few companies dominate major industries, accruing the wealth and power that go with it as potential disrupters are swallowed at birth, the way Cronus, the titan in Greek mythology, ate his young to prevent their uprising.</p><p>No one knows what might happen to Jet.com if it remains independent. Perhaps it will fail. Amazon is dominant, and Walmart may be the only real competitor. So preventing this acquisition may result not in creating a competitor to Amazon but in the death of Jet.com.</p><p>The flip side of this risk is that the big tech companies continue unchallenged in their dominance. Perhaps it is time to rethink antitrust enforcement, and take the risks associated with a different view of antitrust that looks at potential dominance and at breaking up oligopolies.</p><p>If the antitrust authorities do not adapt and emerging competitors continue to be bought up, we should not be surprised of the continued dominance of a very few companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Walmart.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-2207232</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KGK-XNX1-JC85-N1DY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1057\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>International New York Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>August 18, 2016 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>CC0002LAF</classCode><className>WAL-MART STORES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000CUVE</classCode><className>QUIDSI INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC00028J5</classCode><className>RADIOSHACK CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>NAICS452311 WAREHOUSE CLUBS &amp;

If we had lawmakers that were genuinely interested in policies that improve competition, we wouldn't need net neutrality rules protecting consumers from often-unchecked duopoly power. In the absence of said competition -- or lawmakers willing to stand up to AT...Verizon and Comcast -- the FCC's current net neutrality rules, however imperfect[1], are the next best thing. And to be clear, net neutrality is something specific to the uncompetitive telecom industry. </p><p>Yet we've watched for years as people have tried to take the concept and apply it to other, competitive sectors. AT...for example, has tried to foist regulations on Googleby insisting the company violates \"search neutrality[2].\" Other folks, like Blackberry CEO John Chen, have similarly tried to push regulation on Googleand Apple by trying to insist we need protections for \"app neutrality[3].\" Usually, these folks are only interested in saddling their own competitors with additional regulation, not actually improving the internet. These folks consistently ignore the fact that this is an apples to oranges comparison. You don't need search or app store neutrality rules because those markets are actually competitive. While there are certainly some exceptions, users offended by Googleor Apple's app store policies, privacy practices, or search engine behaviors have the choice of using a myriad of other services. The same can't be said of the broadband industry, where 75% of the public technically only has one choice for broadband (as defined by the FCC at 25 Mbps). These problems aren't directly comparable. And while <person><nameText>Al Franken </nameText></person>has been a welcome and outspoken defender of net neutrality, he too fell into this trap this week during a speech given at the Open Markets Institute[4], a think tank devoted to fighting monopoly power. While engaged in a well-intentioned rant warning of the perils of unchecked social media power at the likes of Facebook, Franken conflated net neutrality with, well, something else entirely:As tech giants become a new kind of internet gatekeeper, I believe the same basic principles of net neutrality should apply here: no one company should have the power to pick and choose which content reaches consumers and which doesn't. And Facebook, Google, and Amazon- like ISPs - should be 'neutral' in their treatment of the flow of lawful information and commerce on their platforms. Following years of hard work and dedication, we found in the Open Internet Order a strong and time-tested framework to protect net neutrality. While we fight to preserve the Order, we must now begin a thorough examination of big tech's practices in order to secure the free flow of information on the internet.Again though, net neutrality isn't this universal concept you can just pick up and apply to other markets to try and make a point. And conflating the uncompetitive duopoly shitshow that is the telecom market with more competitive social media markets just doesn't work. Users can and should choose to not visit Facebook if they find the company's ethics troubling. You can use Duck Duck Go if you're understandably wary about Google's schnoz up in your business. There are options. There is competition in these markets. Net neutrality is about ensuring duopolists can't interfere in the free flow of information. What Franken's proposing here is the advocation of interference, and urging government to dictate \"search neutrality\" or \"website neutrality\" could prove to be a muddy free speech rabbit hole, as Wired was quick to point out[5]:As with much of the backlash against big tech, Franken's suggestions contain their own contradictions. Applying net neutrality rules to Googleor Facebook, for example, could make them obligated to distribute content from political extremists and even foreign propaganda under some circumstances. Unfortunately for Silicon Valley, lack of solutions never stopped a congressional hearing.Again, it's fine to want to pressure Facebook, Twitter, and Googleto better handle disinformation and propaganda (though it's hard to \"legislate away\" a problem we don't fully understand yet). It's also perfectly reasonable to be concerned about the growing power these companies hold, particularly as it pertains to privacy. But these are very complicated and very different problems that require different solutions and different conversations. Conflating net neutrality here only aids companies like AT...which have long wanted to distort the concept of net neutrality[6] to heavily regulate their Silicon Valley nemeses to ill effect. We went down said rabbit hole once with the fairness doctrine, believing government was competent and incorruptible enough to be trusted to dictate \"acceptable\" speech. It would be a shame if we used the entirely different fight for net neutrality to justify making that mistake again.Permalink[7] | Comments[8] | Email This Story[9] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150305/06260630213/fcc-approval-zero-rating-shows-companies-can-still-violate-neutrality-under-new-rules-they-just-have-to-be-more-clever-about-it.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150305/06260630213/fcc-approval-zero-rating-shows-companies-can-still-violate-neutrality-under-new-rules-they-just-have-to-be-more-clever-about-it.shtml</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100615/1849299842.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100615/1849299842.shtml</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150122/08093329777/no-app-neutrality-is-not-thing.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20150122/08093329777/no-app-neutrality-is-not-thing.shtml</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/08/big-tech-security-freedoms-democracy-al-franken\">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/08/big-tech-security-freedoms-democracy-al-franken</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wired.com/story/al-franken-just-gave-the-speech-big-tech-has-been-dreading/\">https://www.wired.com/story/al-franken-just-gave-the-speech-big-tech-has-been-dreading/</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100615/1849299842.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100615/1849299842.shtml</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171109/09552938582/dear-al-franken-net-neutrality-is-not-magic-wand-you-can-wave-any-company.shtml\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171109/09552938582/dear-al-franken-net-neutrality-is-not-magic-wand-you-can-wave-any-company.shtml</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171109/09552938582/dear-al-franken-net-neutrality-is-not-magic-wand-you-can-wave-any-company.shtml#comments\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171109/09552938582/dear-al-franken-net-neutrality-is-not-magic-wand-you-can-wave-any-company.shtml#comments</url> [ 9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171109/09552938582/dear-al-franken-net-neutrality-is-not-magic-wand-you-can-wave-any-company.shtml?op=sharethis\">https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20171109/09552938582/dear-al-franken-net-neutrality-is-not-magic-wand-you-can-wave-any-company.shtml?op=sharethis</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DIRT1023051510327227854251763700244</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIRT-0001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PXK-GBT1-JCMN-Y2NY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1049\"/><timeReceived>3:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Techdirt</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 10, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

(Earlier, CEO Tim Cook had ridiculed Microsoft's forthcoming one-size-fits-all desktop-tablet operating system by saying that you could fuse a refrigerator with a toaster but that wouldn't make either good.)</p><p>These jokes are funny and aggressive, in keeping with the role Apple has played for decades--that of a feisty underdog.</p><p>But the problem is that Apple is no longer a feisty underdog.</p><p>It's now a feisty overlord.</p><p>And, consequently, these digs come off as the gloating of a cocky, graceless winner instead of the admirable pluck of small competitor.</p><p>In other words, over the past five years, in the David vs. Goliath story that forever plays out in big tech, Apple has switched roles. But its rhetoric and attitude still match that of when it was playing the far more sympathetic role of David.</p><p>This attitude, moreover, is now combined with business practices that are aggressively competitive--to the point where Apple is now doing exactly the same thing Microsoftwas doing when Microsoftgot dragged into court for anti-trust violations.</p><p>Specifically, as at least one Wall Street analyst noted this morning, Apple is now \"tying\" its own apps into the guts of its operating system, elbowing out competitors in the process.</p><p>In the most egregious example of this, Apple has now replaced Googleas the source of the \"maps\" used in the forthcoming version of the Apple mobile operating system. Some analysts, including Business Insider's Jay Yarow, thinks that Apple's maps are worse than Google's maps, which means that Apple is, at least initially, making the overall user experience on its mobile devices worse than it would be if Apple weren't trying to use its market power to elbow a competitor out of the way.</p><p>To be sure, Apple has every right to do this. Googleis plenty powerful on its own, and Googleis competing head-to-head with Apple with its Android phones.</p><p>Apple's shareholders and employees should also be thrilled that Apple is not resting on its laurels but is instead responding quickly and aggressively to competitors' attempts to eat into its business.</p><p>And, most importantly, although Apple is now employing the exact same competitive tactics that Microsoftused to devastating effect in the 1990s to destroy Netscape (\"tying\"), Apple's market share of the mobile platform is nowhere near the monopoly that Microsoftenjoyed.</p><p>(Apple has about 30% platform share in the US, versus more than 50% for Google's Android. Microsofthad about 90% share of the PC operating system market in the 1990s.)</p><p>So, as much as Apple's rhetoric and practices will infuriate competitors and users who hate to have their worlds controlled by a single company, Apple isn't anywhere close to a \"monopoly\" yet.</p><p>But the company's attitude is important to how it is perceived--by both users and regulators. And that attitude has now become grating. People don't like winners who gloat and rub losers' faces in it. And that's exactly what Apple is doing.</p><p>To be fair to Apple, the fact that it does not yet appreciate how this attitude \"plays\" in light of its changed circumstances is likely the result of speed with which Apple has moved from near-dead also-ran to world domination.</p><p>In the 1990s, Microsofthad the same problem, which was part of why so many people grew to hate the company. Microsoftsucceeded in large part because of the intensely competitive attitude it developed when it was a tiny startup. Like other great companies, Microsoftinternalized this attitude into its DNA, until it became an embodiment of Intel founder Andy Grove's famous maxim that \"only the paranoid survive.\" But then, over the course of a decade, Microsoft's wealth and market power became utterly dominant. And, suddenly, Microsoft's attitude began to get it in trouble.</p><p>Apple has undergone the same transition. And to his credit, CEO Tim Cook appears to be every bit as competitive and fiesty as Steve Jobs was. That's great news for Apple shareholders and customers.</p><p>But Apple's role in the world has now changed forever. So the rhetoric and style Apple uses to convey this intensity now seems grace-less and arrogant, rather than funny and inspiring. So unless Apple wants to turn regulators and the public against it, the way the company communicates needs to change.</p><p>SEE ALSO: THE BOTTOM LINE: Apple Really Is Going To Try To Kill Google</p><p>Please follow SAI on Twitter and Facebook.</p><p>Join the conversation about this story \u00bb</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-BZIN10564513395078116980817800</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BZIN-5352</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:55W4-XXD1-DXX7-H0JW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"826\"/><timeReceived>1:30 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Newstex LLC<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2012 The Business Insider</copyright><publicationName>The Business Insider</publicationName><aggregationName>Newstex Web Blogs</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>June 12, 2012 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Or at least our thoughts. That\u2019s the basic premise behind an oddly counterintuitive push for more government regulation of internet companies by the conservative right.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That group recently and rightly cheered FCC Chairman Ajit Pai for putting a stop to Net Neutrality. It\u2019s the same group that lambasted the Fairness Doctrine, and its disguised return under former President <person><nameText>Barack Obama.</nameText></person></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It goes against type, but obviously the drone of \u201cit\u2019s not fair\u201d coming from the bully pulpit has had some effect on the psyche of the right wing. Because now, there is growing sentiment within that same group that government is needed to prevent tech companies\u2014social media especially\u2014from targeting conservatives for removal; from silencing the thought from the right.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Complaints from the right about social media, and Twitter and Facebookin particular, aren\u2019t unfounded. It was long theorized that Twitter, for example, was \u201cshadowbanning\u201d conservative users. That is, limiting the availability of their tweets to other users, hiding them from the timelines of even people who follow them, excluding them from searches, etc... That theory was given additional credence a few weeks ago when Twitter announced that it would be doing this exact thing as a matter of policy going forward.</p><p>To address this problem, many on the right are now calling for the feds to regulate search engine algorithms, Facebooksharing, and tweets. The free market, they argue, isn\u2019t a sufficient check, because the public spaces of social media essentially aren\u2019t reproducible and therefore exist without competition.</p><p>Writing for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">National Review</emphasis>, John Hawkins argues that, \u201csocial media has come to dominate our national conversation\u201d and that \u201cpolitical websites thrive or die based on changes to Facebookand Google algorithms.\u201d He then offers a quote from former Google employee Tristan Harris as further evidence of this point.</p><p>A handful of people, working at a handful of technology companies, through their choices will steer what a billion people are thinking today. I don\u2019t know a more urgent problem than this. It\u2019s changing our democracy, and it\u2019s changing our ability to have the conversations and relationships that we want with each other.</p><p>It is a dire and alarming assessment, if you accept the premise. But Hawkins\u2019 solution is just as dramatic: using anti-trust to actually break up large tech companies for the good of America.</p><p>Alternately, Victor Davis Hanson, also at <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">National Review</emphasis>, doesn\u2019t want to break up the tech companies, he wants to enthrone them in red tape and imbue them with the stamp of authority.</p><p>Hanson says we need a \u201cbipartisan national commission\u201d to \u201coffer guidelines to legislators about how to make sure that these companies do not abuse their enormous powers of surveillance and data acquisition, vast wealth, and monopolistic control of how we write, think, shop, and communicate.\u201d He\u2019s advocating creating a new big government beast with amazing power to regulate both capitalist enterprise and free speech! And the reason? To protect safe spaces. Not exactly conservative.</p><p>In both cases, the argument rests on the premise that big tech companies are a sort of public utility, an irreplaceable and vital function to which the government must guarantee access. President Obama made a similar argument in favor of the infamous \u201cObama phone\u201d program: these technologies are <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">necessary</emphasis> to modern American life, and those who do not have them are disenfranchised.</p><p>Disenfranchisement as a concept is also at the heart of the lawsuit that just resulted in a court ruling that President Trump\u2019s Twitter account cannot block other users from seeing his tweets. A judge determined that a public official blocking a citizen from following them on Twitter because of their replies or tweets violates their First Amendment protections.</p><p>Conservatives showered social media with reactions ranging from mockery to outrage after the court\u2019s ruling. But the decision in that case is a virtual blueprint for those on the right arguing for regulation of these tech entities, establishing the service as a public forum, one the government can and should require fair access to it.</p><p>More important than the nature of the solutions is that they\u2019re being offered for a problem that may not even exist. Not yet, anyway.</p><p>This may be heretical, but the very premise that social media is disfavoring conservative ideas or even Trumpist ideas is questionable. Even stipulating that efforts at silencing voices on social media are almost exclusively directed at the right, it doesn\u2019t answer whether those efforts have actually <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">worked</emphasis>.</p><p>For weeks now, CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News, websites like Politico and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Washington Post</emphasis>, and people in general were using the term \u201cspygate.\u201d It is a term coined by the president to make the idea of an FBI informant seem less law-enforcement and more <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Falcon and the Snowman</emphasis>. On social media, Republicans and the #MAGA legions used the tagline relentlessly from the moment the President uttered it. It was a top trending hashtag the day he said it.</p><p>That was the right, setting narrative. There was neither an attempt by social media titans to censor it nor a need for the government to come in and ensure that it remained trending.</p><p>How about special counsel Robert Mueller himself? If Bush 43 were under such an investigation, there would almost certainly have been no easily available, widespread counterattack. But today, the president\u2019s push back on the investigation, distrust of Mueller, and related talking points are common knowledge. They are ubiquitous on Twitter.</p><p>If you use Facebook, you either have a relative or ARE the relative who has said \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d \u201cwiretap,\u201d or \u201cswamp\u201d a thousand times. I\u2019d wager you can\u2019t walk up to a water cooler in America and find someone unfamiliar with the phrase \u201cdeep state.\u201d</p><p>Silenced? If anything you can\u2019t get the right to just take a breath.</p><p>This is a good thing. I mean, it\u2019s a bad thing if people believe crazy talking points or undermine serious investigations. But it\u2019s good that people can speak and be heard on the internet. That\u2019s what it\u2019s for. It\u2019s working, and contrary to the alarmists, it\u2019s working especially well for the right.</p><p>So why are conservatives trying so hard to get the government involved in regulating the free internet that not only has worked to their advantage in the past but is currently still a boon?</p><p>Here is one more argument offered in favor of government intervention in these platforms, specifically the spreading of Fake News, which is obviously a top concern for the Trump right.</p><p>We talk about how 55 percent of Americans get their news from Facebook. And we talked about regulations that need to be put in place. There should be a threshold, where they have to send out a blast to every Facebooksubscriber that got these false stories, that the story they got was a lie. And until they do that they are being irresponsible.</p><p>That\u2019s not a MAGA writer or a Trump partisan. That\u2019s Joe Scarborough lamenting the spreading of \u201call the lies and conspiracy theories that are hurting democracy today by Republicans.\u201d</p><p>Left, right, or whatever <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Morning Joe</emphasis> is, each has the same basic premise: The bad guys are winning because the government isn\u2019t helping the good guys fight back. This has been the argument between left and right on social media since the dawn of hashtags.</p><p>This is a solution in search of a problem that will only create a problem with no solution. I shouldn\u2019t have to remind conservatives that the slippery slope of government intervention rarely ends up benefiting conservatives. But consider yourselves reminded.</p><p>Right now, the best way to fight unfairness by content control dictatorships like those at Google, Facebook, or Twitter, is to complain loudly, argue effectively, and be prepared to walk. Maybe someday the situation will be so intensely intolerable that getting government to act will be the best, last resort. But that is not this day.</p><p>Today, you can read an article at The Daily Beast about the unfairness of Twitter toward conservatives by clicking on the link on Twitter shared by a conservative. You see what I mean?</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYBST-2052717461</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYBST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TKD-HBD1-JBHT-D41D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464369</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1361\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Beast</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 10, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The founder of Wikipedia <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/03/26/europe-votes-curb-power-google-facebook-milestone-copyright/\">took to Twitter</url> after the vote to say that the decision \"empowered monopolistic practices\" and was damaging Internet freedom.</p><p>\"You, the Internet user, have lost a huge battle today in the European Parliament. The free and open internet is quickly being handed to corporate giants at the expense of ordinary people.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/03/26/europe-votes-curb-power-google-facebook-milestone-copyright/\">Article 13 | Sir Paul McCartney's letter</url></p><p>German MEP Julia Reda, who campaigned vociferously against the reform, also claimed it was a \"dark day for internet freedom\" as MEPs refused to consider a last-ditch attempt to amend the reform to exclude the link tax and compulsory content filters.</p><p>Reda's main concern was Article 13, which aims to strengthen the bargaining power of rights holders with platforms such as YouTube, Facebook and Soundcloud, which use their content. Under the reform, platforms would be legally responsible for using technology to police and prevent intellectual property violations, which she claims could lead to censorship.</p><p>\"The new copyright law as it stands threatens a free internet as we know it,\" she argued. \"Algorithms cannot distinguish between actual copyright infringements and the perfectly legal re-use of content for purposes such as parody. Obliging platforms to use upload filters will lead to more frequent blocking of legal uploads and make life difficult for smaller platforms that cannot afford expensive filter software.\"</p><p>Musician and Fugees co-founder Wyclef Jean also spoke out against the reform. In September, he visited Strasbourg and urged MEPs to \"embrace and improve the internet, rather than attempt to block and hinder it\". In a guest column for Politico, he said that he used to worry about fans uploading versions of my work to YouTube. \"I'd tell my team, 'Oh my god, take it down!',\" he wrote. \"It turns out I didn't understand user-generated content back then.\"</p><p>\"We started keeping up these user videos to see what would happen. Subscribers to my YouTube channel increased. More fans were checking out my older work. And all of it meant a new source of revenue for me.\" However, his comments were later attacked by Blondie frontwoman Debbie Harry, who argued Jean was arguing on behalf of a company that would take away the livelihood of many of his peers.</p><p>These proposals, which critics claim were \"watered down\" after intense lobbying from technology companies, have largely failed to please anyone. Concerns that this may actually get the likes of Google and Facebook off the hook while damaging smaller companies are still dominating conversations about the vote this morning.</p><p>Commentators on both sides of the debate have claimed that the changes to articles 11 and 13 are confusing and open to interpretation. The amendments have done little to silence the people who claimed that copyright filters could trigger the beginning of the end of memes and parodies online, as well as artistic reinterpretations inspired by existing work.</p><p>\"If copyright filters go ahead, large numbers of mistaken takedowns will impact what we do and say online,\" the Open Rights Group warned. \"The EU Parliament has made a serious error of judgement here. We will go on doing everything we can to stop this being the disaster it promises to be.\"</p><p>Google, which was one of the main targets of the initial push for widespread copyright change, was also displeased with the result in comments released in the first few minutes after the result.</p><p>The technology behemoth claimed that while the directive has \"improved\", it will \"still lead to legal uncertainty and will hurt Europe's creative and digital economies\".</p><p>UK technology trade association Tech UK said that the European Parliament \"failed to strike the right balance between protecting copyright and ensuring freedom of expression\" and expressed concern over the high costs that will be levied on growing companies.</p><p>\"Policy makers have to take responsibility for the consequences of pursuing simplistic solutions to complex problems,\" a spokesperson said.</p><p>The European Council will now be tasked with making sense of the proposals and enacting it into workable laws for individual countries to adopt in the coming weeks. Experts predict that technology giants will start to pay their dues from 2021 if there are no further delays.</p><p>Although the UK was the first to lobby for a change in copyright, it is still not clear yet how London will react and adapt to these new proposals -- but something will be done. On Monday, the Government said it plans to introduce the laws alongside the rest of Europe even after Brexit.</p><p>Regardless of how the UK acts, Europe is sending a clear signal to the technology elite.</p><p>European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, who just <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/03/26/europe-votes-curb-power-google-facebook-milestone-copyright/\">last week handed down a chilling \u00a0\u00a31.28bn fine to Google</url>, summed up European sentiment about big tech in a single tweet about the result:</p><p>\"This is great news.

But the specifics vary dramatically.</p><p>Take, for example, the widely discussed proposal by Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Mass., who wants to break up the dominant Big Tech companies, much as she has proposed to break up the biggest banks.</p><p>Over the past few years, companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook have grown significantly both in their user and customer bases and in the range of sometimes only barely related subsidiary operations they control.</p><p>Facebook also owns popular photo and messaging apps Instagram and WhatsApp, for instance. Amazon has a television and film studio, operates a web hosting service and is expanding into the grocery business. Google - via its parent company Alphabet - dabbles in artificial intelligence, biomedical research and self-driving car technology.</p><p>Ms. Warren makes a convincing case that such sprawling investments represent barriers to smaller companies and start-ups. And the sheer scale of data collection by a company like Facebook raises privacy concerns that aren't just hypothetical.</p><p>But breaking up the biggest tech companies would be a daunting task, and one that would undoubtedly have unintended consequences. It would probably be smarter to focus on incremental reforms that help put individuals back in control of their information.</p><p>A serious discussion of online privacy heated up after the disclosure last year that Facebook had supplied details on the likes and dislikes of tens of millions of its users to a Trump campaign contractor, Cambridge Analytica, without first obtaining their permission. The data allowed the contractor to craft psychological profiles designed to help sell Mr. Trump's presidential campaign.</p><p>The lack of transparency in that particular case was what made it so troubling. But online data is almost always treated as a commodity. That's how popular services remain free or low-cost.</p><p>It would still be useful to strengthen disclosure requirements, however, so that more users know specifically how their data are used.</p><p>The European Union has adopted sweeping but imperfect legislation to that end, and California has considered similar measures. New privacy rules for the rest of the United States would be worth discussing.</p><p>Sen. Warren, on the other hand, is more concerned about the economic issues involved in Big Tech's growth. Her approach pits a populist perspective - that big companies are dangerous because they are big - against the more sensible view that large businesses should be broken up, or prevented from merging, only when it can be shown that the consumer benefits would be overwhelming.</p><p>But even if an anti-trust free-for-all would be an overreaction, Ms. Warren and several unlikely allies on the political right, including Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, are correct in assessing that a few Big Tech companies have grown to a scale in which their power and control raise concerns.</p><p>So far, the right path forward remains unclear. The debate, however, is well worth having.</p><p><nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"image\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"PAC5c9015d890337image\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"31449\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>FILE - This photo combo of images shows the Amazon, Google and Facebook logos.

A range of minority advocacy groups say no. Both Johnson and people on the other side of the debate have commercial interests that align with their views.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At issue is a proposal by Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler to allow cable television subscribers to access their preferred online content alongside their cable content through the settop box, which they now typically rent monthly from their cable providers.</p><p>If the proposal passes, you could go online or into a store like Best Buy and pay a single price for a single device that would offer access to your favorite cable programs - as well as a host of streaming channels (although you'd still have to pay for programming in many cases).</p><p>For cable providers like Comcast, the move could mean a possible loss of nearly $20 billion per year in rental fees to an industry already reeling from the trend of customers abandoning cable in favor of streaming devices such as Apple TV and Chromecast.</p><p>For cable customers, however, it could mean a big annual savings on set-top box rental fees, as well the ability to search and compare programming choices across more than 500 cable and streaming channels. The proposal is strikingly similar to the debate over telephones more than 40 years ago, when consumers could rent phones only from Ma Bell - the old American Telephone and Telegraph monopoly. Proponents see freeing the set-top box as opening the door to the same kind of innovation that created cellphones.</p><p>Wheeler's office states that a typical consumer's set-top box rental fees amount to $231 annually, having risen 185 percent since 1994, while the cost of mobile phones has dropped by 90 percent.</p><p>Johnson, who recently launched the Urban Movie Channel, an online streaming company for diverse and African-American audiences, sees the proposal as a win - not just for minority consumers but for minority programming not carried by cable.</p><p>\"I want an open forum for every minority or independent producer who wants to produce content,\" he said in an interview with Urban News Service. \"And I'm willing to compete with my content channels\" - Urban Movie Channel or Acorn TV (which streams British programming) - \"with whoever comes along with programs to get to the consumer.\"</p><p>President Barack Obama and several Congressional Black Caucus members also support the proposal.</p><p>But opponents say that if cable TV providers lose the money people are paying to lease their boxes, they would have less money to pay minority channels such as BET and TV One for subscribers.</p><p>Alfred Liggins, chairman of TV One and president and CEO of Radio One, told Urban News Service in a statement that the proposal, known as \"Allvid\" regulations, is \"nothing more than a sweetheart deal for Big Tech, letting companies like Google strip-mine the value of our work for their profit.\"</p><p>\"Niche and minority-focused networks like TV One could be relegated to the remote reaches of the channel guides, or buried at the bottom rung of search results - depriving audiences of diverse viewpoints and threatening the very survival of networks like ours,\" said Liggins, who launched the Future of TV Coalition in opposition to the proposal. Wheeler's statement said the new structure would encourage minority programmers to innovate.</p><p>\"When it's easier for content creators to reach consumers, we would expect this to lead to more and better programming accessed more easily, especially minority, independent and international programming,\" said the chairman's proposal.</p><p>But major African-American, Asian-American and Hispanic-American organizations - such as the NAACP, National Action Network, National Urban League and the Rainbow PUSH Coalition - doubt FCC assertions that copyright and privacy protections will remain the same under the new arrangement.</p><p>Evan Swarztrauber, communications director of the think tank TechFreedom, said minority organizations are in part worried that the tech companies poised to win in an open system are the same companies that have yet to show a commitment to diversity in hiring or content. And so minority groups have joined in common cause with cable companies.</p><p>\"They're very concerned, and that's why they're teaming up with the companies to oppose it,\" he said.</p><p>Johnson said he understands the opposition from cable programmers. \"It's a natural instinct,\" he said. \"If you've got a channel that targets a certain group, do you want 10 channels targeting that same group? You'd want to keep your monopoly hold over that audience.\"</p><p>By Josh Peterson</p><p>URBAN NEWS SERVICE</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-1791391861</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">45494ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5N4D-N281-JC85-J20D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"939\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2016 Charlotte Post Publishing Co.

A range of minority advocacy groups say no. Both Johnson and people on the other side of the debate have commercial interests that align with their views.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> At issue is a proposal by Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler to allow cable television subscribers to access their preferred online content alongside their cable content through the set-top box, which they now typically rent monthly from their cable providers.</p><p> If the proposal passes, you could go online or into a store like Best Buy and pay a single price for a single device that would offer access to your favorite cable programs \u2014 as well as a host of streaming channels (although you\u2019d still have to pay for programming in many cases).</p><p> For cable providers like Comcast, the move could mean a possible loss of nearly $20 billion per year in rental fees to an industry already reeling from the trend of customers abandoning cable in favor of streaming devices such as Apple TV and Chromecast.</p><p> For cable customers, however, it could mean a big annual savings on set-top box rental fees, as well the ability to search and compare programming choices across more than 500 cable and streaming channels. The proposal is strikingly similar to the debate over telephones more than 40 years ago, when consumers could rent phones only from Ma Bell \u2013 the old American Telephone and Telegraph monopoly. Proponents see freeing the set-top box as opening the door to the same kind of innovation that created cellphones.</p><p> Wheeler\u2019s office states that a typical consumer\u2019s set-top box rental fees amount to $231 annually, having risen 185 percent since 1994, while the cost of mobile phones has dropped by 90 percent.</p><p> Johnson, who recently launched the Urban Movie Channel, an online streaming company for diverse and African-American audiences, sees the proposal as a win \u2014 not just for minority consumers but for minority programming not carried by cable.</p><p> \u201cI want an open forum for every minority or independent producer who wants to produce content,\u201d he said in an interview with Urban News Service. \u201cAnd I\u2019m willing to compete with my content channels\u201d \u2014 Urban Movie Channel or Acorn TV (which streams British programming) \u2014 \u201cwith whoever comes along with programs to get to the consumer.\"</p><p> President <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>and several Congressional Black Caucus members also support the proposal.</p><p> But opponents say that if cable TV providers lose the money people are paying to lease their boxes, they would have less money to pay minority channels such as BET and TV One for subscribers.</p><p> Alfred Liggins, chairman of TV One and president and CEO of Radio One, told Urban News Service in a statement that the proposal, known as \u201cAllvid\u201d regulations, is \u201cnothing more than a sweetheart deal for Big Tech, letting companies like Google strip-mine the value of our work for their profit.\u201d</p><p> \u201cNiche and minority-focused networks like TV One could be relegated to the remote reaches of the channel guides, or buried at the bottom rung of search results \u2014 depriving audiences of diverse viewpoints and threatening the very survival of networks like ours,\u201d said Liggins, who launched the Future of TV Coalition in opposition to the proposal. Wheeler\u2019s statement said the new structure would encourage minority programmers to innovate.</p><p> \u201cWhen it\u2019s easier for content creators to reach consumers, we would expect this to lead to more and better programming accessed more easily, especially minority, independent and international programming,\u201d said the chairman\u2019s proposal.</p><p> But major African-American, Asian-American and Hispanic-American organizations \u2014 such as the NAACP, National Action Network, National Urban League and the Rainbow PUSH Coalition \u2014 doubt FCC assertions that copyright and privacy protections will remain the same under the new arrangement.</p><p> Evan Swarztrauber, communications director of the think tank TechFreedom, said minority organizations are in part worried that the tech companies poised to win in an open system are the same companies that have yet to show a commitment to diversity in hiring or content. And so minority groups have joined in common cause with cable companies.</p><p> \u201cThey\u2019re very concerned, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re teaming up with the companies to oppose it,\u201d he said.</p><p> Johnson said he understands the opposition from cable programmers. \u201cIt\u2019s a natural instinct,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a channel that targets a certain group, do you want 10 channels targeting that same group? You\u2019d want to keep your monopoly hold over that audience.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Liggins Johnson</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKNC-15CC8907EB99F57D</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289870E60A5FDD NWBKNC2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JRH-5221-F0NV-F0H7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401970</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"783\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Charlotte Post<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

A range of minority advocacy groups say no. Both Mr. Johnson and people on the other side of the debate have commercial interests that align with their views.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> At issue is a proposal by Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler to allow cable television subscribers to access their preferred online content alongside their cable content through the set-top box, which they now typically rent monthly from their cable providers.</p><p> If the proposal passes, you could go online or into a store like Best Buy and pay a single price for a single device that would offer access to your favorite cable programs \u2014 as well as a host of streaming channels (although you'd still have to pay for programming in many cases).</p><p> For cable providers like Comcast, the move could mean a possible loss of nearly $20 billion per year in rental fees to an industry already reeling from the trend of customers abandoning cable in favor of streaming devices such as Apple TV and Chromecast.</p><p> For cable customers, however, it could mean a big annual savings on set-top box rental fees, as well the ability to search and compare programming choices across more than 500 cable and streaming channels.</p><p> The proposal is strikingly similar to the debate over telephones more than 40 years ago, when consumers could rent phones only from Ma Bell \u2013 the old American Telephone and Telegraph monopoly. Proponents see freeing the set-top box as opening the door to the same kind of innovation that created cellphones.</p><p> Wheeler's office states that a typical consumer's set-top box rental fees amount to $231 annually, having risen 185 percent since 1994, while the cost of mobile phones has dropped by 90 percent.</p><p> Johnson, who recently launched the Urban Movie Channel, an online streaming company for diverse and African-American audiences, sees the proposal as a win \u2014 not just for minority consumers but for minority programming not carried by cable.</p><p> \"I want an open forum for every minority or independent producer who wants to produce content,\" he said in an interview with Urban News Service. \"And I'm willing to compete with my content channels\" \u2014 Urban Movie Channel or Acorn TV (which streams British programming) \u2014 \"with whoever comes along and programs to get to the consumer.\"</p><p> President <person><nameText>Barack Obama </nameText></person>and several Congressional Black Caucus members also support the proposal.</p><p> But opponents say that if cable TV providers lose the money people are paying to lease their boxes, they would have less money to pay minority channels such as BET and TV One for subscribers.</p><p> Alfred Liggins, chairman of TV One and president and CEO of Radio One, told Urban News Service in a statement that the proposal, known as \"Allvid\" regulations, is \"nothing more than a sweetheart deal for Big Tech, letting companies like Google strip-mine the value of our work for their profit.\"</p><p> \"Niche and minority-focused networks like TV One could be relegated to the remote reaches of the channel guides, or buried at the bottom rung of search results \u2014 depriving audiences of diverse viewpoints and threatening the very survival of networks like ours,\" said Mr. Liggins, who launched the Future of TV Coalition in opposition to the proposal.</p><p> Wheeler's statement said the new structure would encourage minority programmers to innovate.</p><p> \"When it's easier for content creators to reach consumers, we would expect this to lead to more and better programming accessed more easily, especially minority, independent and international programming,\" said the chairman's proposal.</p><p> But major African-American, Asian-American and Hispanic-American organizations \u2014 such as the NAACP, National Action Network, National Urban League and the Rainbow PUSH Coalition \u2014 doubt FCC assertions that copyright and privacy protections will remain the same under the new arrangement.</p><p> Evan Swarztrauber, communications director of the think tank TechFreedom, said minority organizations are in part worried that the tech companies poised to win in an open system are the same companies that have yet to show a commitment to diversity in hiring or content. And so minority groups have joined in common cause with cable companies.</p><p> \"They're very concerned, and that's why they're teaming up with the companies to oppose it,\" he said.</p><p> Johnson said he understands the opposition from cable programmers.</p><p> \"It's a natural instinct,\" he said. \"If you've got a channel that targets a certain group, do you want 10 channels targeting that same group? You'd want to keep your monopoly hold over that audience.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDREC-df313ff1c6a0615cb3fabbe9c3ce353ff5282</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDREC2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JPD-FSX1-JD6S-R3W6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">387689</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"784\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Indianapolis Recorder, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Over the past few years, Apple, Google parent Alphabet, Facebook and Amazon have become among the world's most valuable companies. Along with stalwarts like Microsoft and rising stars like Netflix, the tech firms exercise enormous control over what people see and how they live. Increasingly, policymakers and others have begun to consider breaking up or regulating the biggest technology companies, although imminent action appears unlikely. </p><p>While many consumers welcome innovation from the tech sector, critics have complained about the power of 'gatekeepers' of information and other content. Google holds around 90 per cent of the internet search market in the United States and Europe. Facebook and Google scoop up some 60 per cent of digital ad revenues and are eating up 90 per cent of new ad growth in the United States. Google's Android and Apple's iOS power the overwhelming majority of mobile devices. Amazon accounts for nearly half of US online sales and is expanding into new sectors. Barry Lynn, executive director of the Open Markets Institute, said three firms \u2014 Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 'have more power than any previous monopolies we've dealt with in the past century'. 'We have to be incredibly concerned about the power of Facebook, Google and Amazon,' said Lynn, who launched his research centre last month after his team was ousted from the Google-funded New America Foundation. 'They have their hands on the flow of news, the flow of books and they are manipulating that flow in a conscious way to promote their interests.' Even though the idea of taking on the tech giants appears extreme, the upheaval in US politics over the past year has brought together allies from across the spectrum worried about their concentration of economic power. The recently formed 'New Centre' political alliance that includes leaders from the traditional right and left has placed 'challenging big tech' on its agenda. Bill Galston, a former White House advisor under Bill Clinton and co-founder of New Centre, argued that tech monopolies are hurting wages, entrepreneurship and could be distorting the political landscape. 'The big tech firms have almost unlimited funds they can throw into lobbying, and they have been ramping this up steeply,' Galston said. 'Is that a good thing for democracy?' Lou Kerner, partner at the investment firm Flight Ventures, said this monopoly power is more concentrated than any in recent history, and expressed concern it will 'strangle innovation' and increase income inequality. But Kerner said he opposes heavy-handed regulation or breakup of the tech giants. 'By their nature regulators move slowly and by the time they address the problems they are no longer problems,' Kerner said. 'Historically the market has been much better at addressing monopoly powers in technology.' Ed Black, president of the Computer Communications Industry Association, which represents firms including Google, Facebook and Microsoft, said breaking up the tech giants could have a 'chilling effect on innovation'. 'If our goal is really to maintain innovation, spur the entire economy, and grow higher paying jobs, asking the government to penalise a successful foundational economic sector, absent bad behaviour or consumer harm, seems illogical,' Black said. European regulators have taken a more aggressive approach, imposing a hefty fine on Google after concluding the search giant illegally favoured its own shopping services, one of three antitrust investigations into the company. In Washington, the rise of Donald Trump suggests a possible shift in US policy after years in which Silicon Valley was seen as close to the White House. Former White House strategist Steve Bannon said recently he was leading an effort within the administration to turn Facebook and Google into 'public utilities'. But Federal Trade Commission chief Maureen Ohlhausen, who would lead any US antitrust action, signalled any effort to break up tech firms is remote.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1095902242</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PK9-KKC1-JCNX-34RT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"692\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 27, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>AAPL (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

But with the drops today, and as bad as it looks today, it could have been a lot worse. The Nasdaq had been about 300 points worse, and that average had fallen close to 10 percent, the technical definition of a correction, in a matter of two days.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's not done that since going back to March and the height of the pandemic sell-off, but that was then. This is now, a market that rebounded from the worst levels. Now the only question they're asking is, which is real, what happened yesterday or what they tried to call back today?</p><p>Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World,\"</p><p>And, man, oh, man, this was one for the crazy record books.</p><p>Jackie DeAngelis to sort out the data and then, well, the dumping of stocks, and then the return to stocks. It was that crazy.</p><p>Hey, Jackie.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FOX BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Good afternoon to you, Neil.</p><p>Well, the markets did come back from session lows, especially the Dow there, finishing down only 160 points. And that was after that big 800- point sell-off that you mentioned that we saw yesterday.</p><p>A few things to note here. Wall Street is worried about stimulus coming out of Washington. It's concerned about the pace at which the market has moved here. It's also cautious as we're going into a long holiday weekend.</p><p>So, most of the selling that we're seeing right now, I'm told, in big tech, for example, looks like it's profit-taking. It's Amazon and Facebook and Microsoft, and Apples saw some pressure too. The financials, the industrials, they were also part of the pull lower today.</p><p>It's pretty broad-based across the board. Now, the mixed reaction that we're seeing is coming off the back of that August unemployment report; 1.37 million jobs were added in August. It was slightly lower than what Wall Street was expecting.</p><p>But the unemployment rate, that was the good news, it did move lower from north of 10 percent to 8.4 percent. The bulk of the jobs coming back from the retail and the leisure and hospitality sectors, those were hit so hard by the pandemic, so that was some welcome news.</p><p>Still, Wall Street wants these numbers to improve and they want them to improve quickly. Pre-pandemic, unemployment was at a 50-year low. So we know it's going to take a while to get back there. And, of course, we still don't know about the virus, about a second wave, about a vaccine, about so much as we head into the fall -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Jackie, thank you very, very much, Jackie DeAngelis.</p><p>So, that was the good news before the markets opened, the surprisingly strong employment report that, as Jackie indicated now, has proven we made it back about half the jobs lost by the coronavirus and the shutdown and all of that.</p><p>And then there was some other news, courtesy -- well, I will let John Roberts explain from the White House.</p><p>Hey, John.</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX NEWS CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, first of all, Neil, let's take on the unemployment numbers and the jobs numbers.</p><p>The fact that there were 1.4 million jobs that were added, which beat expectations, and that unemployment dropped to 8.4 percent, which beat expectations, was seen as good news by the president, who painted a rosy picture in the Oval Office earlier today about what lies ahead for the economy.</p><p>Listen here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think what's happening is, you're going to see tremendous growth in the very near future. We're rounding the curve. We're coming up with vaccines.</p><p>I think the vaccines are going to be announced very soon. And I think you're going to see great companies announcing these vaccines.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Now to the other story that you were talking about. That was the story in The Atlantic magazine that, back in November of 2018, the president decided not to go out to the American cemetery at Aisne-Marne east of Paris is, about 50 miles east of Paris, because the people who were interred there, the U.S. war dead, are -- quote -- \"losers and suckers.\"</p><p>I have talked to three people, including John Bolton, who say that that never happened, that those words never came up in that discussion.</p><p>Here's what the president said about it earlier today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: It was a totally fake story. And that was confirmed by many people who were actually there. It was a terrible thing that somebody could say the kind of things of -- especially to me, because I have done more for the military than almost anybody else.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: Now, the reason why the trip was canceled initially was because of a bad weather call. Marine One couldn't fly because of low ceilings and rain.</p><p>Here is the e-mail that talked about: \"Team, we are a bad weather call for today's lift. Chief of Staff General Kelly will replace President Trump for today's ceremony. Please advise if any questions.\" That came from the United States Marine Corps military aide to the president.</p><p>As I mentioned, I talked to John Bolton earlier today. He was in -- quote - - \"the room where it happened,\" where the decision was made for the president not to go out to the Aisne-Marne Cemetery. Bolton says, as to those words, suckers and losers, did he ever hear those mention?</p><p>Listen here.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN BOLTON, U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Well, I didn't either of those comments or anything even resembling them.</p><p>I was there at the point in time that morning when it was decided that he would not go to Aisne-Marne Cemetery. He decided not to do it because of John Kelly's recommendation. It was entirely a weather-related decision and I thought the proper thing to do.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: So, he talked about John Kelly's recommendation. There was a backup plan that was potentially being formulated that the president could take a motorcade out there.</p><p>The White House initially said that it would disrupt traffic. There were also security concerns about the president being so far away out of the country from Air Force One, in case there were some sort of international emergency, and the president didn't particularly feel like sitting in the limousine for four hours.</p><p>He was going to do a wreath-laying out at Aisne-Marne, but then the next day he was scheduled to do a full speech at the Suresnes Cemetery. That went off. I was actually there about 30 feet away from the president.</p><p>So, those are the explanations for everything that happened. The president did not go to Aisne-Marne. It was talked about being a weather call, but the president also did not want to go in the motorcade. But all of the people that I have talked to about this, again, including John Bolton, who is no fan of the president, say at no time did he ever refer to U.S. dead as -- quote -- \"suckers or losers\" -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: John Roberts, thank you very, very much.</p><p>Back to the jobs report to which John was referring here. Joe Biden pounced on that, and then welcomed the about 1.4 million jobs added the economy, but still did note that about half the jobs lost are still lost. And that trend of getting them back is slowing down. So he says.</p><p>Let's go to Scott Martin on, Kingsview Wealth Management. We have also got Frances Newton Stacy, the Optimal Capital director of strategy.</p><p>Frances, what about that view, two different views of essentially the same job situation? We're way down from where we were, of course, at the height of this, when we were looking at north of a 15 percent unemployment rate, now at 8.4 percent. But, again, we're way up from the best of days, well before the epidemic, when we were at 3.6 percent.</p><p>The president says the trend is his friend and he likes what he's saying. Do you?</p><p>FRANCES NEWTON STACY, OPTIMAL CAPITAL: Yes, I think that the trend is our friend, and I do like what we're seeing, because think about the conversation we'd be having if it were going the other direction.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>NEWTON STACY: Now, the curve is a little bit flattening. We're adding less and less and less, but we're not fully reopened yet.</p><p>We are still -- California is still pretty much shut down. A lot of restaurants and places are at 50 percent capacity. So I think this is pretty good, considering that we're not nearly fully reopen yet.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, what explained the comeback, particularly in the Nasdaq, when you looked at everything, Scott?</p><p>I mean, we were in correction territory. We recouped some, not all of that. But it was a remarkable turnaround. What did you make of that?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT: Yes, Neil, it hearkened up thoughts of one of my favorite LL Cool J songs, if I could bring that up right now, because it was it was a great comeback.</p><p>But the Nasdaq has been here for years. And it's done this for years. That's the thing that we kind of all forget. Neil, I think, sometimes, as traders, as investors, as money managers, is that we always think that this is going to be different this time, whether it's the sell-off on Thursday or the sell-off Friday morning.</p><p>But if you look back at the Nasdaq, as you mentioned, over the last several years, we have had days like this. We have had weeks like this, even months like this, only to have all-time new highs.</p><p>And I think, as Frances pointed out, with the economic data backing up what is going to be a strengthening economy as we go into a possible vaccine release, there's a lot to be excited about in stocks here.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, Frances -- and he -- Scott touched on it, the hope of a vaccine, the president still looking forward to it, telegraphing something by fall, as soon October.</p><p>Others, when we look at what Pfizer is up to in phase three trials of its own vaccine candidate, something is bubbling. And I'm wondering if, forget about just how good that would be for folks who've long been waiting for that. For the markets, what would the impact be?</p><p>NEWTON STACY: Well, it remains to be seen whether that news is priced in, and that's sort of the issue with markets. And that's the disconnect from the real economy, is that markets trade so far forward into the future.</p><p>And they're trading profits well into the future, right?</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>NEWTON STACY: And the economy is lagging.</p><p>So, sometimes, markets sell the good news. I think, at this point, the vaccine is largely priced in. I think new fiscal stimulus, despite the gridlock, is largely priced in. So I think most of the good news is priced in.</p><p>I do think there are some potential risks coming, because some of the bad news is not necessarily priced in, just because, statistically, we can't really get there quite yet. We don't have enough data.</p><p>We have 100 million loans in forbearance; 8.2 percent of the mortgages are in forbearance, right? What statistically percentage of those people are going to end up in a default situation? You have 26.5 percent of the country feeling like they can't make their next housing payment.</p><p>You have people trading $70-an-hour jobs for $10-an-hour jobs. And you have the food-insufficient or -insecure houses going up still. So we're not out of the woods yet. I think the market is just pricing so far into the future that we are eventually going to come out of this thing, but we're not there yet as far as the economy goes.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, Scott, I was talking to a prognosticator on FBN, which, Scott, if you don't get, you should demand, but I digress.</p><p>MARTIN: I do.</p><p>CAVUTO: And one of the things he was saying is, Neil, the closer we get to the election, expect a lot more volatility, a lot more serious swings like this, because the traders will be anxious. This is typical behavior, so close, now, what, two months out.</p><p>What do you make of that?</p><p>MARTIN: I make of it that it's a very key scenario.</p><p>And I think, to Frances' point, the things that, to me, are not being factored in -- because she's right. A lot of future growth is coming into stock prices here, Neil. It's a Biden election victory, frankly, that I don't think the market has really taken to heart, because that means higher taxes. That means more government regulation, more government involvement in everyday life.</p><p>And I think the market is still hoping that, say, Trump is going to pull this thing out, and he just might. But that will be something that will affect markets, to your point, as far as the volatility trade going into, say, the end of the weeks in October, certainly into early November, at some of the polls maybe tighten up here, as some things get clearer as to what may happen in the outcome after November 3.</p><p>CAVUTO: Guys, I want to thank you both very, very much.</p><p>As we told you a little bit earlier, Joe Biden was not impressed with these economic numbers and the trend. But what we noticed here at FOX, ever fair and balanced in counting balls and strikes, is, why didn't any of the press questioning him today ask him what he was going to do, and specifically whether his numbers add up?</p><p>We break it down, you decide.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, it was either a very good employment report, where the trend was certainly the economy's friend, to hear the president tell it, or just the opposite, to hear Joe Biden tell it.</p><p>Hillary Vaughn following what the former vice president had to say in an economic address of sorts today in Delaware -- Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Neil.</p><p>Well, Democratic nominee Joe Biden says he's never been so close to losing his temper on the trail. But, today, Biden was angry about a report that he read in The Atlantic that uses anonymous sources to say President Trump called fallen soldiers -- quote -- \"losers.\"</p><p>The White House is flatly denying the report. And Biden admitted he doesn't know if it's true.</p><p>But the point of Biden's speech today was about the economy. And Biden said today's jobs report is good news for the 1.4 million people that got jobs in August, but says those jobs aren't in the right places.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSEPH BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Donald Trump may be the only president in modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than when he took office.</p><p>He just doesn't care. He thinks, if the stock market is up, and everything's fine, if his wealthy friends and donors are doing well, then everything's doing well, if corporations see their valuations rising, then they must be hiring.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN: Biden dished out those heated attacks against President Trump for not doing enough to help businesses stay afloat and keep workers on the job during the pandemic.</p><p>But Biden made those comments while speaking at the West End Neighborhood House that received a PPP loan for at least $350,000 in the spring as part of relief in the CARES Act that President Trump signed into law.</p><p>White House economic adviser, today, Larry Kudlow, pushed back on Biden's claim that these new jobs aren't helping lower-income workers, saying new jobs are popping up in leisure, hospitality, food and beverage and retail, which include a lot of minimum wage jobs.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: So, I just don't agree with Mr. Biden.</p><p>DANA PERINO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Got it.</p><p>KUDLOW: And I just want to say, Dana, look, we're talking policy here. Mr. Biden has a plan that would increase taxes by $4 trillion. Nobody would want to raise taxes and...</p><p>PERINO: Great. I hear you.</p><p>KUDLOW: ... take money out of people's wallets and pocketbooks. It doesn't make any sense.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN: Neil, in his remarks, Biden admitted he does not have a job, but he wants one.</p><p>After his speech, he hit the ATM on his way home, where he will attend two virtual fund-raisers today to raise more money -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Hillary Vaughn, thank you very, very much.</p><p>I want to go to Congressman Kevin Brady right now of the fine state of Texas, House Ways and Means Committee, the man responsible for those tax cuts that Joe Biden that has been haranguing.</p><p>Congressman, good to have you.</p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R-TX): Good to see you, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, I heard Larry Kudlow telling Dana Perino that now would not be a good time to raise taxes.</p><p>But, by the same taken, the White House is saying, things are so much better, so we can raise taxes.</p><p>Which is it?</p><p>BRADY: Yes, so, I can't think of anything more economically damaging to this recovery than to raise taxes, either on families or on businesses, as Joe Biden has proposed.</p><p>The truth of matter is, Joe Biden presided over the worst economic recovery in our lifetime. With this report today, President Trump has presided over the fastest labor market recovery from an economic crisis in history.</p><p>Joe Biden never dreamed of 1.4 million new jobs a month. And it's true, we are not through this yet. But gaining back half, nearly half the jobs we lost from COVID in a fairly short time is impressive.</p><p>And I think, looking at the numbers today in that report, Neil -- you probably noticed it too -- but, for households, their job prospects are up. The number of laid off population has shrunk.</p><p>Their wages, hourly wages, are strengthening, average 3 percent. And then they're working longer each week. These are, directionally, really -- this is -- given August was supposed to be the month our economy dropped off the cliff due to the flare-ups, this is an extraordinary report.</p><p>CAVUTO: I know people can look at numbers and administrations any which way, Congressman, but during the Obama/Biden years, while the recovery was slow, it was steady, and it did present consistent growth.</p><p>And the last three years, a lot of the Obama folks say, was stronger than the first three years of the Trump administration.</p><p>I guess what I'm asking you is, if it's consistent and it's steady, and that was an environment where taxes were being raised, who's to say that they can't do the same thing again?</p><p>BRADY: Yes.</p><p>If you look, though -- good point, but if you look at the results of the Obama/Biden recovery, it's true, they drove our economy at about 20 miles an hour. It was slow. They rarely got more than 200,000 jobs a month.</p><p>But the result of that was that payrolls were stagnant.</p><p>CAVUTO: But, you know, to be fair, to be fair, Congressman, right -- to be fair, they were starting with an economy losing a million jobs a month after the meltdown.</p><p>BRADY: No question.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm just trying to put everything in perspective here, right?</p><p>BRADY: Yes. Yes. That is exactly true.</p><p>But no one lost 22 to 30 million jobs in just a month or so because of this unprecedented crisis. There is -- as tough as the Great Recession was, it doesn't come close the economic damage that we have seen in this crisis.</p><p>And the recovery is extraordinary -- at this point, I think is better then expectations by a significant way.</p><p>But, again, I was going to make the point, at the end of Joe Biden's time in the White House, most Americans still felt they were in a recession. It tells you what happens when you don't...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Let me ask you. Could I ask you this, though, Congressman?</p><p>Let me just get a sense. We're tight on time, but maybe you can help me with this, that the argument right now is that the economy is going to have a tougher time moving forward from here, that there might be a bit of a drag. It might not matter now we have got employment -- unemployment back down to single digits, but this might be as good as it gets for a while.</p><p>How do you counter that? Because a lot of these same doom-and-gloomers missed the strength and the ferocity of this comeback, period? But I want you to respond to that, because Joe Biden is saying, unless I do something drastic here to address this, we're going to topple in and stay in something bad at for a long time.</p><p>BRADY: Yes, so I disagree with that.</p><p>Look, as we recover more and more from the pandemic, the growth, the trajectory may slow, but the direction is going exactly the way we want it to go. If we can continue to add a million jobs a month, we will be working out of this crisis in a significant way.</p><p>Taxes will slow back down. Also, higher regulation, lifting taxes on -- or raising taxes on businesses competing around the world will ship our jobs overseas.</p><p>So, my view is, I don't think Joe Biden understands the modern economy. President Trump does.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we will watch it very closely.</p><p>Congressman, hope you're doing well, family is well, everyone's healthy, Kevin Brady, the House Ways and Means Committee ranking member, joining us to take a look at where this economy really stands.</p><p>It really depends on with whom you chat. We just look at the stats, try to compare and contrast where we were, where we are, where we're going. But the trend of late does certainly seem to be going more the economy's way, more your way.</p><p>We will see how long that lasts.</p><p>All right, in the meantime, here: The mail-in ballot controversy continues here, but that doesn't mean that mail-in ballots aren't still happening, North Carolina among the first to say, send them out. And they are as of today.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, as we get into Labor Day weekend, a lot of Americans must be ready to fly and travel and have fun, right?</p><p>Wrong. In fact, it's getting worse.</p><p>The holiday bookings that are making it look more like Scrooge -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Voting begins, and, today, in North Carolina.</p><p>Mark Meredith with more from Raleigh on the latest on how that's been going -- Mark.</p><p>MARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Neil, good afternoon.</p><p>North Carolina officials say they are seeing a surge in requests for mail- in voting. And, as you mentioned, those ballots are going out starting today.</p><p>We had a chance to go take a look inside Wake County's election office as they are getting ready for this really onslaught of absentee ballot requests. We have seen the workers there in their masks.</p><p>And in North Carolina, you don't have to give a reason as to why you're voting absentee. But you do have to go ahead and request a ballot. Look how many North Carolinians have done that so far, some 643,000 people planning to vote by mail. That's out of the seven million registered voters here in the state.</p><p>President Trump, he was in North Carolina Wednesday. And while he was here, he said he wanted his supporters to make sure that they did all they can that their votes were counted, and potentially show up to vote a second time, if they were concerned it wasn't counted.</p><p>But state officials here, they tell us that is not an option.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KAREN BRINSON BELL, NORTH CAROLINA STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS: We do record when someone's vote has been cast by mail. And if they come to vote in person during the early voting period, we have a record of that, so that if they show up on Election Day and have voted in either one of those situations, we know that that's occurred.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEREDITH: Now, the state is setting up an online portal that will allow people to track essentially after your ballot has been mailed back to the state or to your local elections office where it is and make sure that it's going to be counted.</p><p>And the state is not encouraging people just show up at the polls. Of course, poll workers are going to have enough to deal with when it comes to people there showing up to vote on Election Day, Neil</p><p>Also North Carolina, a big state that does early voting starting in mid- October -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, thank you very, very much, Mark Meredith.</p><p>By the way, we will be monitoring this and how states roll out their mail- in ballot plans on \"Cavuto Live\" tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time. We will be looking at this and a host of other issues that have become front and center, as both sides argue over the effectiveness of this and whether it could just add to the Election Day mess.</p><p>Again, that's tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. on this fine channel.</p><p>In the meantime, I want to go to James Freeman, who has been studying all of this, Wall Street Journal, FOX News contributor, bestselling author.</p><p>JAMES FREEMAN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Hey, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: James, North Carolina is just the first. There will be more. And it's going to start building a head of steam here.</p><p>What can we expect?</p><p>FREEMAN: Well, I think the president and others are right to raise the issue.</p><p>I'm not sure if I would raise it exactly the way he does. But this idea -- I think part of what he may be doing is kind of challenging what's been sort of a mantra in much of the media, that this is really nothing to worry about.</p><p>But going too much more mail-in voting in many states across the country with very tight timelines, I think, does raise problems. as the Postal Service has warned, it doesn't work perfectly. There can be delays. The count can be drawn out.</p><p>And, of course, when you're sending out unsolicited ballots, millions of Americans move every year, you do open up the possibility of fraud in a way you don't have with in-person voting.</p><p>CAVUTO: Also, there's some confusion, right? Some people just fill them out incorrectly, or they don't verify exactly who they are, don't write out their full name.</p><p>I was amazed at hundreds of thousands of examples from just the last election. So, there is that. And that gets to be part of a recount effort in a very close election.</p><p>Do you think any of this could mean, as the president has feared, that we might not have a clear winner on Election Day, and this might drag out for some time?</p><p>FREEMAN: I think the problem here is that some states are almost designing it that way.</p><p>You think of New York, Michigan, where you have very tight deadlines, the ability to send in a ballot. And there are going to be a lot more of them by mail than there normally are. Right before the election, Postal Service normally will deliver something within five days, but not always.</p><p>It almost guarantees that you're going to have disputes and litigation for days and perhaps weeks after Election Day. And that's not the system we want. We want a clean, respected system that gives us an election night result.</p><p>And so I think, at a minimum, as this issue is raised, those states should think about moving deadlines, so that we can declare a winner on election night. That should be the goal.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, so many people have been focusing on whether the post office can handle the volume of mail-in ballots. And they have in the past, of course.</p><p>The volume that we're talking about here is roughly what they deal with on any given day. But I do get the concern about that. But I am now wondering, to the issue you raise, that it's not so much the post office, but the reliability of what you're getting on those ballots, and then who's doing the counting and all that, right?</p><p>FREEMAN: You're introducing a lot of new risks into the system. And I think these issues should be thought about, discussed, debated, addressed, not swept aside with this comment that, well, we haven't seen widespread fraud.</p><p>Thank goodness we haven't, but you want to do everything you can to ensure the integrity of the ballot. And sending out unsolicited ballots by the millions and tens of millions is not exactly a way to do that.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, it could -- it could get very complicated, to put it very mildly.</p><p>James Freeman, thank you very much, my friend.</p><p>FREEMAN: Thanks, Neil.</p><p>We will be focusing on it, also focusing on a tale of, I don't know, two -- two give-and-takes, with -- one with the president of the United States and one with the guy who wants to be president, regarding the press.</p><p>Who do you think got the easier questions? Who do you think consistently gets the easier questions? And then -- then I want to flip it around. Who do you think gets virtually no good or kind questions?</p><p>We report, you decide. And, this time, I don't want you to come from this from your political position, who you like more or less. This, I want you to see. And you will.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, I have often said on this show, and I have said a lot of critics on both sides who say I just call balls and strikes. I look at what's right when I hear something out of a candidate. I look at what's wrong when I hear something out of a candidate, regardless of the candidate.</p><p>So, I think that both men, especially when you're running for the highest office in the land, should be held under intensive scrutiny.</p><p>I did not see that today with Joe Biden when it came to the press. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUESTION: When you hear these remarks, suckers, losers, recoiling from amputees, what does it tell you about President Trump's soul and the life he leads?</p><p>QUESTION: You said today is the angriest you've been as a presidential candidate.</p><p>Aren't there a lot of people out there who are supporting you or inclined to not vote for the president, who would say, why isn't Joe Biden angrier?</p><p>QUESTION: President Trump mocked you for wearing a mask. I wonder if you worry that this kind of language that comes from the president of the United States could deter some Americans who are tuning into him to not wear masks.</p><p>QUESTION: Let me ask you about another thing the president said last night.</p><p>He once again suggested to his supporters that they should consider voting twice. State officials have said it's a felony in some cases. Just curious what you make of it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Let me cut to the upshot there.</p><p>What they're essentially saying, can again confirm for us why you think the president is such a jerk, given some of these jerky things that he said and argued?</p><p>That's not fair and balanced. That's not doing your job.</p><p>Compare it to the routine treatment that comes out of a -- I don't know, a Donald Trump give-and-take with the press. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUESTION: Sir, do you need to apologize to service members and veterans?</p><p>TRUMP: That was a peaceful protest, totally.</p><p>QUESTION: But it was a supporter of yours, Mr. President.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMP: Go ahead, please. Yes, go ahead, please.</p><p>QUESTION: It was a supporter of yours, Mr. President.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUESTION: It was a supporter of yours, Mr. President...</p><p>TRUMP: Excuse me?</p><p>QUESTION: ... who killed someone, who is accused of killing...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUESTION: Because you have made it so plain that you are opposed and do not trust mail-in voting, is your postmaster general using the agency of the Postal Service to create delays?</p><p>QUESTION: You have a large storm. You have the fallout from these police shootings. Is tonight an appropriate time to have a political celebration?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>I don't know. I don't know. I have no fans in the White House. I have no fans from a lot of sides. But, man oh, man, all I'm saying here -- I know a lot of you maybe don't share that view -- is, let's be fair to everyone.</p><p>If you're going to criticize someone, make sure you clarify that and make sure you're very focused on that. And, conversely, if something good is happening, make sure you get to that.</p><p>But the same should apply to both sides. If you're going to have Joe Biden talking about how he would do things economically differently, or how, for example, a virus, he was on top of this from the very beginning, when the facts are he wasn't, call him on it. Call both on it.</p><p>But treat both the same way. If you want to be kind and gentle to both, if that's your strategy, well, then be kind and gentle to both. But if you want to be a jerk to one side vs. the other side, that's not right. That's not fair. That's not balanced. And that shouldn't be.</p><p>Francesca Chambers joins us now, the McClatchy White House correspondent. We have also got Kristen Hawn here, Democratic strategist, and Nick Adams, Republican strategist.</p><p>And, Francesca, I'm -- you're not guilty of this, by the way. You tend to be pretty mean to everyone, which is admirable.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: But my point here is, just, come on. I mean, this was insulting.</p><p>To frame it in a way that there was no bad way the former vice president could answer, that's embarrassing.</p><p>FRANCESCA CHAMBERS, MCCLATCHY D.C.: Well, Neil, but you're also talking about two separate sets of reporters.</p><p>May I just note that, today, I was at the White House, sitting in the White House press Briefing Room, watching the press conference with former Vice President Joe Biden. I was then in a White House briefing where I posed questions to White House officials.</p><p>And, generally, those questions are on news of the day. Now, the Atlantic article and what the president reportedly said is news of the day, and you should expect to hear questions about that when he has what we believe will be a news conference at 5:00 p.m. today.</p><p>But he is often asked about comments that he has made or actions that his government has taken or not taken, particularly lately as it pertains to the economy and as it pertains to COVID-19.</p><p>Joe Biden is not currently in government. So, it's not as easy, I would say, to pose questions to him about what he has or hasn't done, when he is not the one who is leading the country currently. And, frequently, the questions from myself and colleagues in the Briefing Room are related to Donald Trump's government.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, to be fair, I heard a lot of these questions before he ever became president.</p><p>And believe I'm not an apologist for the president. I am saying, Kristen -- I know you might share that view -- but I'm looking at it, saying, absolutely go on this Atlantic article and what's what, and it is true, and does it make sense? Does it jibe with what you have heard? Have at it.</p><p>But this was this an economic address as well, in which he got into some of the details, certainly on the virus and what he would do. And I would just follow up to say, all right, some of the faster testing you want, check, it's being done. Some of the advanced testing you want, check, it's being done.</p><p>The aggressive search for a vaccine, check, it's being done. No one held him accountable on the same things of which he was charging the president. Now, I know and I readily agree with what Francesca is saying. There is a different standard for the president, the guy who is in power and has the power to do a lot of these things presently.</p><p>But he shouldn't get a pass. The guy who wants the job shouldn't get a pass. And I, frankly think, Kristen, that he got a pass.</p><p>Your thoughts?</p><p>KRISTEN HAWN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I think we're picking certain questions here.</p><p>I wouldn't think that he's gotten a pass, if you asked Joe Biden, over the course of the campaign. He's gotten some pretty difficult questions, and rightly so.</p><p>Both of these men -- one's currently the sitting president, but both are running for the most important job in the world. No question...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAWN: ... too difficult.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, both should get hit. Both should get walloped. Both should get attacked. Both should get scrutinized.</p><p>HAWN: Absolutely. Absolutely.</p><p>CAVUTO: Both should get nasty questions, right? That's not happening.</p><p>HAWN: Well, and -- and, also, President Trump, he brings a lot of this on himself.</p><p>Reporters are going to ask him about questions -- or questions about things that he tweets that impact the country and what the -- what the public thinks.</p><p>CAVUTO: Absolutely. Fair enough. Fair enough.</p><p>HAWN: And, also, he doesn't respond always well to...</p><p>CAVUTO: But can't you balance it out by being aggressive with the other guy? Can't you balance it out with the other guy, to call him up on specifics on some of this stuff?</p><p>I recognize the Atlantic story, and it's a news story in the moment. I get that. I would pursue the same.</p><p>But to make it all about the president, what he said or what he didn't say, and not about the gist of the reason for Joe Biden's presser, to talk about the economy and what he would do differently, the virus, what he would do differently, and none of that came up, man, oh, man.</p><p>HAWN: Yes, I mean, I think, like I said, both sides -- reporters, I think, here -- and I have had such a pleasure to work with them in D.C. -- are extraordinarily talented.</p><p>And I think they have been tough, tough on both sides.</p><p>The interesting thing is, you will have a press briefing at the White House with the president where a reporter, a pool reporter, asks him, very basically, what would you say to -- what would you say to families, grieving families of victims of COVID, who have died of COVID?</p><p>And he -- his response is to lash out at this news organization, to say, that's a terrible question.</p><p>So, the president doesn't necessarily respond well, no matter what kind of questions he's asked.</p><p>CAVUTO: No doubt. And I have heard it and seen it, and, by the way, experienced myself, so -- but I'm -- all I'm saying, Nick Adams, is, when you get into that and the controversial stuff he says -- it's irrefutable you have to get into it.</p><p>I just think this notion that both are treated the same by the press, it could be the genteel approach that Joe Biden takes. It could be the friendly approach, the fact that he constantly praises the press. I get that. That's very, very nice.</p><p>But I do think, if you're going to be a jerk to one, it might be beneficial to just be the same jerk to all. I'm so used to negative, nasty e-mails. I don't pay attention. The ones that say I'm overweight, those bug me, but I dismiss them.</p><p>I'm just saying, Nick, that there's got to be a sense of fair play here. I don't see it all the time. Your thoughts?</p><p>NICK ADAMS, FOUNDER, FOUNDATION FOR LIBERTY AND AMERICAN GREATNESS: And you're exactly right. I don't say it either. And I don't think the American people do.</p><p>Let me put it in language that everybody can understand. When it comes to Donald Trump, the media is an attack dog. When it comes to Joe Biden, the media is a lapdog. They carry his water. They handle him with kid gloves.</p><p>He doesn't get many questions. When he does, they're very, very easy. There are very few specific follow-ups. The media is carrying the water. He -- Joe Biden gets more difficult questions now from members in the audience than he does journalists.</p><p>He's had two tough questions this year, both from African-American journalists, resulting in him snapping. And this is exactly why the media doesn't ask him the questions that they should be asking him, because they have a horse in this race.</p><p>They don't want Donald Trump to be reelected. They want Joe Biden to be elected. And if that involves ignoring him...</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I will be careful. I'm going to be very careful with that.</p><p>I certainly don't think that's the style of a Francesca Chambers.</p><p>I will say this, though, that Francesca will not get as much of an opportunity. Now, she's obviously in the White House press corps to question the president, who routinely on his way out to Marine One or whatever at any venue takes reporters' questions on the scene.</p><p>Joe Biden doesn't do much of that. And I think, from that angle, Francesca, he better start doing more of it. I'm not saying to invite nasty questions, but to get used to this idea that you're both running and -- for the highest office in the land, it comes with the territory to get questioned a lot.</p><p>CHAMBERS: There have been fewer opportunities to ask Joe Biden questions, no doubt.</p><p>And reporters had put pressure on the Biden campaign to put him in front of reporters to start taking more questions from them. And, as a result, you have seen him on two separate opportunities do that recently.</p><p>And, absolutely, we would love to hear more from both President Trump and Joe Biden about what they would do, for President Trump, in his second term, Joe Biden, why he is seeking the office and the specific details into his policy.</p><p>No doubt, we'd like to hear more of that from both of them. Of course, Neil, I wish that I had more opportunities to speak to President Trump about what he would do in his second term.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: We will see. I just think, have at it.</p><p>Say that again. I'm sorry.</p><p>ADAMS: Where are questions about the social unrest? Where are the questions about the protesting and the criminal activity and the rooting and the lighting?</p><p>There's none of that stuff being asked. And that's why people are looking at this, thinking the media has one standard for Joe...</p><p>CAVUTO: Guys, I think you just illustrated that these are all fair game issues. That's all I'm saying. Be fair about it. It's -- I'm going to alienate people on the left and right doing this.</p><p>I just want to call balls and strikes on it here. I want to be fair to everybody, even though, when you're doing that, sometimes, you just piss off everybody.</p><p>But, on this, I think I'm touching on something that's got to be addressed for all the media. Let's all just go into this, whatever our peeves or annoyances that we get, just to do our job, to be tough on everybody, to be obnoxious with everybody, and maybe see your ratings hurt as a result.</p><p>Anyway, just a thought.</p><p>Guys, I want to thank you, seriously, all very, very much.</p><p>HAWN: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: We're going to keep exploring this, this whole election year.</p><p>We will be exploring this very issue tomorrow, by the way, live at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we're minutes away from a White House briefing that will feature the president of the United States.</p><p>He might very well get into some of the issues we were just addressing here. But he is likely to respond and take up that article in The Atlantic, that he's charged with making some scurrilous comments about military figures and soldiers who died in various wars, but that coming up a few minutes from now.</p><p>Ahead of that, of course, this is Labor Day weekend. We're cruising it on it here right now. And as far as demand for travel is concerned, it's not what you think.</p><p>And, furthermore, looking toward the holidays, it's not what you might have hoped.</p><p>Charles Watson has more from Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta -- Charles.</p><p>CHARLES WATSON, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Neil.</p><p>Millions of Americans will travel this Labor Day weekend, and public health officials are urging folks to sanitize, wear masks, and social distance this holiday season -- or holiday weekend, rather.</p><p>Here in Atlanta, the lines aren't long at all. Folks are getting through TSA checkpoints in about 15 minutes. Experts say, most people are opting to travel short distances by car this holiday weekend, as COVID-19 remains a concern.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GARRETT TOWNSEND, AAA SPOKESMAN: There's going to be more people that are going to be getting in their car and driving to their destination. They feel more comfortable. They can control that environment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATSON: Airline reservations are only about a third of what they were in 2019, as the pandemic keeps would-be travelers home, according to data from TripIt.</p><p>Meanwhile, companies like Delta are trying to ease the minds of those who are flying this holiday weekend, the airline giving concerned customers a look into how they sanitize its planes ahead of every flight.</p><p>Additionally, airlines could implement a new rapid COVID-19 test, which can deliver results in about 15 minutes and boost airline activity. Abbott Laboratories received emergency authorization earlier this week to produce the rapid test.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There's concerns. But I have to weigh it against the fact that my parents are older, and I want to make sure that I'm able to see them.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My precautions and my social distancing and wearing the mask, everything, as long as you follow the rules, you can stay alive.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WATSON: And, Neil, we have seen a steady flow of traffic here at Hartsfield-Jackson Airport in Atlanta, but far less than you would expect on a holiday weekend at America's busy, busiest airport -- back to you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Thank you, Charles. Very good seeing you again, Charles Watson following all of that.</p><p>I want to go to Dr. Mike Varshavski right now, a board-certified family medicine physician, Atlanta Medical Group, on all this news about colleges and the like that are delaying in-person classes because they get a quick spike, and, all of a sudden, the spike gets more worrisome. So they hold off on in-person, and the back-and-forth goes on and on.</p><p>It has widened now to at least 28 colleges and universities. Others could similarly push things back.</p><p>Doctor, what do you think of all that? It's inevitable people get back. There are going to be spikes. I guess you have to decide what's an acceptable spike.</p><p>DR. MIKE VARSHAVSKI, FAMILY MEDICINE PHYSICIAN: Yes, absolutely, Neil.</p><p>Thank you so much for having me on.</p><p>When we look at these spikes, what we need to pay attention to is more so what's going on in the community, rather than what's going on, on campus, because if you're part of a community where we're seeing widespread transmission, that ultimately is going to end up on campus or in the classroom.</p><p>So, if you have a hot zone, an area, a city where there's a lot of COVID-19 transmission, opening schools is just not a smart idea. And it's not something we recommend.</p><p>That being said, when we talk about reopening of schools, we're not just talking about one specific route. There's many different variables that we can take when it comes to opening schools. That could be hybrid models of opening schools, schools that will have some in-person classes on certain days of the week, others online.</p><p>And it really needs to be tailored to that individual city, individual community, because only then can we make some sort of sense of what's going on.</p><p>What happens in New Jersey is not the same as what's going on currently in Florida. And we can't treat them -- just like we can't treat patients the same, we can't treat those areas the same.</p><p>CAVUTO: Doctor, in some of these cases, it's not the conventional excuse, oh, college kids love to party, and they were a crowd at a bar or dormitory, and going wild.</p><p>In a lot of cases, it's just they're congregating in numbers, let's say, at a quad at the University of Alabama, and then we get up to 1,200 cases, what have you, and, at other schools, where it has nothing to do with any big parties around.</p><p>So, obviously, this is a very contagious virus. I get that. But then how, as a school, do you deal with something like that?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Well, you have to have strict measures in place in order to keep social distancing measures in effect.</p><p>That six-feet rule is not a perfect rule. It's not magical. But it is the best guidance we have at this time. So, if you have an area where you see students congregating, there should be steps taken to mitigate that situation.</p><p>Now, as far as media goes, they love highlighting the parties, because that's what gets all of our emotions going, gets us angry. And while it certainly does happen, we see people who are not taking COVID-19 seriously, I don't think that holds true for the majority of students.</p><p>I think the majority of my patients who fall into this age demographic are taking COVID-19 seriously. They're worried about not only their own health, but the health of those around them, including their parents, grandparents, and anyone that they can potentially get with the virus.</p><p>So, I want to take a moment, unlike most media institutions, and celebrate those individuals that are taking the proper precautions, wearing masks, staying six feet away from others, and washing their hands frequently.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well said. Dr. Mike, good catching up with you. I appreciate it.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, in the meantime, you can see at the corner of your screen we're waiting for a White House briefing that will be featuring the president of the United States.</p><p>Amongst topics that could come up, that Atlantic article that has a lot of people raising their fists, some choosing fingers, the president responding to that already, saying it's just not so.</p><p>Separately, the comeback in the markets today from their worst level, but they were still shaken. Now I'm wondering if investors are stirred to get out. We will be exploring that tomorrow 10:00 a.m. Eastern time, \"Cavuto Live.\"</p><p>Right now, here comes \"The Five.\"</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

La pregunta posee m\u00faltiples matices: de entrada, la propia Warren pone en su punto de mira especficamente a esas tres compa\u00f1as, Amazon, Facebook y Google, pero deja fuera a Apple, ms grande que todas ellas seg\u00fan su valoraci\u00f3n actual, lo que indica claramente que no hablamos de una cuesti\u00f3n intrnseca de tama\u00f1o, sino ms bien de comportamiento y actitudes. De hecho, su nota cita especficamente casos en los que esas tres compa\u00f1as han utilizado estrategias de diversos tipos destinadas especficamente para perjudicar a competidores, alcanzar una posici\u00f3n de dominio absoluto o limitar la competencia: el caso de Microsoft y los navegadores, la copia y comercializaci\u00f3n con marca blanca de productos exitosos por parte de Amazon, la prdida de visibilidad en los resultados de b\u00fasqueda[3] a la que Google someti\u00f3 a varios competidores, y adquisiciones como las de Instagram o WhatsApp por parte de Facebook, las de DoubleClick, Nest o Waze por Google, o las de Whole Foods o Zappos por Amazon. </p><p>Seg\u00fan Warren, estas acciones han contribuido a que haya disminuido el n\u00famero de [4]startups[5] tecnol\u00f3gicas[6], a que haya menos compa\u00f1as j\u00f3venes en ciclo de crecimiento[7], o a que se haya reducido la participaci\u00f3n en primeras rondas de financiaci\u00f3n[8]. A estos datos podramos a\u00f1adir adquisiciones como la de Kaggle por Google[9], Github por Microsoft[10], o las m\u00faltiples compa\u00f1as de machine learning que varios de estos gigantes han ido adquiriendo en un esfuerzo por controlar todo lo que se mueve en esa naciente industria. Contra esto, la candidata a las presidenciales del 2020 propone restaurar la competencia en la industria tecnol\u00f3gica elevando el nivel de regulaci\u00f3n de las compa\u00f1as que facturen ms de 25,000 millones, para que no puedan poseer plataformas de ning\u00fan tipo que conecten a terceras partes y participar adems en ellas. Adems, revertira todas las fusiones y adquisiciones ya realizadas que pudiesen evaluarse como anti-competitivas, empezando, l\u00f3gicamente, por las que cita especficamente. Imaginar el alcance de una regulaci\u00f3n as resulta muy difcil, y supondra sin duda una autntica pesadilla de complicadsimo cumplimiento para todas las empresas tecnol\u00f3gicas. Adems, considerando que la competencia ms relevante para esas compa\u00f1as proviene de un pas, China, que se dedica a apoyar a sus compa\u00f1as tecnol\u00f3gicas de todas las maneras posibles y que jams se plantea imponerles restricciones o limitaciones para que puedan crecer ms y alcanzar otros mercados, el efecto comparativo sobre la industria tecnol\u00f3gica norteamericana podra ser bastante perjudicial. Tengo pocas dudas, y as lo he manifestado en numerosas ocasiones[11], de que las grandes compa\u00f1as tecnol\u00f3gicas han llevado a cabo en muchos casos acciones o adquisiciones que deberan haber sido analizadas de manera ms dura por las autoridades antimonopolio. Puedo simpatizar con la idea de que los gigantes tecnol\u00f3gicos se hayan vuelto demasiado poderosos y hayan, adems, abusado de ese poder en numerosas ocasiones, sobre muchas de las cuales, adems, he escrito en su momento. Considero una legislaci\u00f3n antimonopolio fuerte fundamental para que el mercado funcione de manera adecuada y se proteja su diversidad. Pero, por otro lado, me resulta bastante contraintuitivo que se pretenda incrementar la innovaci\u00f3n y el dinamismo del mercado incrementando la cantidad de regulaci\u00f3n, porque habitualmente, los mercados ms dinmicos e innovadores son aquellos en los que la regulaci\u00f3n es menor, cuando la intervenci\u00f3n estatal es escasa. Los mercados fuertemente regulados no suelen ser precisamente innovadores. Si adems hablamos de regulaci\u00f3n en modo 'trazo grueso' como la anticipada en el artculo, me cuesta pensar que el resultado fuese un mayor dinamismo y un mayor nivel de innovaci\u00f3n en la industria. Por otro lado, la tecnologa es un entorno en constante cambio: los protagonistas actuales no son los mismos que tenamos hace no demasiados a\u00f1os, y de los que haba entonces, hay numerosos casos de desapariciones o de cadas en desgracia. D\u00f3nde est Yahoo!? MySpace? AOL? En su momento, llegaron a dominar claramente sus mercados, y los cambios que el mercado experiment\u00f3 en torno a ellas no fueron por el impacto de ninguna legislaci\u00f3n, sino por los mritos de aquellos que las sustituyeron. Podra estar de acuerdo en incrementar en control sobre las adquisiciones, dado que son operaciones en las que siempre suele generarse una importante destrucci\u00f3n de valor y que, en muchos casos, se llevan a cabo por motivos que podran calificarse de anticompetitivos, pero incluso en ese mbito, me parecera ms adecuado asegurar el cumplimiento adecuado de la legislaci\u00f3n existente[12] y tratar de impedir la creciente influencia de los todopoderosos lobbies de las grande compa\u00f1as, que dedicarse a inflacionar la legislaci\u00f3n existente creando a\u00fan ms normas. La Uni\u00f3n Europea es, sin duda, un entorno sensiblemente ms regulado que los Estados Unidos. La legislaci\u00f3n antimonopolio tiende a actuar en ms ocasiones, la actividad sancionadora es sensiblemente ms fuerte, el intervencionismo sobre las compa\u00f1as es sensiblemente superior, y hasta se inventan derechos inexistentes y completamente absurdos[13]. Ha conseguido generar eso un entorno ms competitivo e innovador? El resultado de ese plus de regulaci\u00f3n no ha sido precisamente un entorno ms innovador, sino, claramente, todo lo contrario. Plantearse que los Estados Unidos pudiesen de alguna manera envidiar el entorno ms regulado que sufrimos en Europa resulta completamente demencial. No discuto que las grandes compa\u00f1as tecnol\u00f3gicas tengan un poder posiblemente excesivo o perjudicial, y que sea necesario intervenir en algunas de las cosas que hacen. En algunos casos, adems, lo tengo clarsimo[14]: apostar por una mayor regulaci\u00f3n y control sobre el mbito de la privacidad me parece fundamental en el caso de los Estados Unidos, por ejemplo, o ser ms serio interpretando los resultados de las operaciones de adquisici\u00f3n. Pero francamente, me parece ms un tema de matices, de aplicaci\u00f3n ms estricta de la legislaci\u00f3n existente o de elevar el nivel de control sobre las acciones de compa\u00f1as que son autnticos elefantes movindose en cacharreras, que de plantear nuevos escenarios que puedan resultar en una inflaci\u00f3n regulatoria. De la que, por la experiencia europea, sabemos que no sale nada positivo.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, June 11th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. A new tariff threat on China. President Trump may impose the next round on Chinese goods if there is no meeting with Chinese Xi Jinping later this month at the G20.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, Huawei warning of sales slowdown this morning. A new sign that the U.S. pressure on the company is weighing on the company. How Huawei's Chief Security Officer responded in my exclusive live interview coming up. Markets are higher this morning. Take a look at futures indicating a gain at the start of trading of 117 points. The S&amp;P is up 13 and the NASDAQ up 50 points right now.</p><p>This on top of modest gains yesterday on Wall Street. The Dow on its longest victory winning streak in over a year. Yesterday, up 78 points, S&amp;P up 13 and the NASDAQ up 81. Global markets this morning are also higher. Take a look at European indices, FT-100 up 36, half a percent. CAC Quarante in Paris up 45 and the DAX index in Germany up 162 points. In Asia overnight, stocks there also higher. China with some economic stimulus having the best of them all up 2-1/2 percent overnight.</p><p>All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Forbes Media Chairman Steve Forbes, and Washington Examiner Columnist, Republican pollster, Kristen Soltis Anderson. Great to see you this morning.</p><p>KRISTEN SOLTIS ANDERSON, POLITICAL COLUMNIST, WASHINGTON EXAMINER: Good to be here.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, CHAIRMAN, FORBES MEDIA: Good to be here. Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks so much for joining us. One story I wanted to bring to everybody's attention because nobody is talking about that is that Rikers Island prison in New York, outside of New York is closing apparently and three quarters of the inmates will be released. We haven't heard anything about this. Mayor de Blasio --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: -- so they are what?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Mayor de Blasio came out with this plan to close Rikers Island and come up with satellite prisons that will house some of them but they're much smaller, the capacity is much smaller than the actual Rikers Island. And I'm being told, my sources tell me three quarters of the inmates are being released by January. Don't you think we should hear more about this? Shouldn't the neighborhood's near Rikers Island know?</p><p>FORBES: Absolutely. It goes part of this part pro crime approach and being blunt about it. No bail anymore for a lot of these people who are arrested. Come on, what do you think is going to happen? Doesn't he -- he is old enough to remember the 1970s and 80s.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. These are nonviolent criminals in Rikers Island but I wanted to point it out because they're telling us -- the mayor's office and the governor's office are telling us that they want to close Rikers Island but they're not telling us the important point. How many of the inmates will go to the satellite jails and how many of the inmates will be released. I'm being told three-quarters of the inmates are being released.</p><p>And yesterday AOC walked into this, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said she'd like to see Rikers Island as a place for solar panels. She said, if we put solar panels all over Rikers Island that will eliminate the need to waste electricity and she thinks that's what Rikers Island should be used for.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Once --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: Coming from her I rather have grazed cows there.</p><p>ANDERSON: And remember, at one point, didn't President Trump suggest we could put solar panels on the wall down at the southern border? I only mention this because I actually poll tested it at one point. Do you support the wall? Would you support the wall with solar panels on it? People don't really change their opinion too much.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I like that.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Once the people of New York City find out what the mayor's plans are and that's the messaging of his opponents and people who are not left- wing Democrats I'm parsing myself that once they find out what the plans are. By the way, if you look back to the early 1990s, there were at least 20,000 people in jails around New York City and now it's about 8,000 and he wants to bring that down to 5,000 to your point.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's exactly right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And so even the jails will be closed, Rikers, there are going to be community jails in people's neighborhoods. Well that's when anybody regardless of their party affiliation says not in my backyard and not on my street and not in my -- not in my neighborhood.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's if they go to the jails, Dagen. Because my sources say three-quarters of the inmates of Rikers Island will be released. Now, I know this is somewhat of a local story but at the same time, Mayor de Blasio is running for president of the United States. So --</p><p>MCDOWELL: He was one --</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- we should -- we should look at that.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But in the Iowa poll, he was one of two candidates who hasn't even -- the first or second choice of any of the people who were polled. Literally he didn't not even show up in the poll at all. People don't even know who he is and you should consider that a blessing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: -- giving him bus tickets to Iowa. Those people being released from Rikers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Good for it. I'd like to see more coverage on this story. I think it's extraordinary. Joining the conversation this morning, Michigan Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, Lands' End CEO Jerome Griffith is here. The CEO will talks to us about retail today. And the host of \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" Stuart Varney weighs in as well. Don't miss a moment of it. We got a big hour right now.</p><p>And our top story this hour is that U.S.-China trade. Stocks are higher on trade optimism even as the U.S. and China remain at odds over potential deal. This as Huawei claims American pressure is hurting sales. I spoke with -- exclusively to Huawei's Chief Security Officer Andy Purdy in the last hour about global telecom bans on his is company.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have you explained Australia banning Huawei? How do you explain the U.S. banning? Taiwan, how do you explain so many countries now seeing the same thing that the U.S. has seen and banning telecom equipment from Huawei?</p><p>ANDY PURDY, CHIEF SECURITY OFFICER, HUAWEI: The fact is that in the discussions between Huawei and Australia all the issues and concerns were addressed and then political pressure was put in place to get Australian government to block Huawei. The political pressure that's being used around the world is intense but despite that many of our major allies are resisting it not because it's just about money, it's because they've got no evidence of significant cyber wrongdoing and they believe there are effective risk mitigation mechanism.</p><p>And frankly, for the security of cyberspace and for United States, we need to use those mechanisms for network operators and all equipment providers.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hillary Vaughn is live at the White House this morning with more. Hillary, good morning to you.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria. Well, President Trump says that if Chinese President Xi Jinping is a no show at their G20 in Japan more tariffs could be on the way to meet up between the two leaders at the end of the month could promise progress and a trade fight that was really ramped up over the past few weeks, the head of international affairs that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce expressing doubts about the White House weaponizing tariffs in this trade war. But the President yesterday says taxes against Beijing products has been bringing in the cash.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think President Xi of China, great relationship with him. I think he will be there. We are scheduled to talk right and to meet right now. We're getting 25 percent on $250 billion worth of goods. It's a lot of money that's pouring into our treasury. We've never gotten $0.10 from China, now we're getting a lot of money from China.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: The President also pressing pause on the Huawei ban after listing them as U.S. and to be in May but some are concerned that the move could backfire on U.S. tech companies here in the U.S. But Trump's top economist Kevin Hassett telling Fox Business in the last hour that cracking down on Huawei and stopping I.P. theft will actually bring hundreds of millions of dollars back to the economy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEVIN HASSETT, CHAIRMAN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS: It's not just about tariffs, I think that if you saw Maria's previous segment where she talked to the Huawei representative, you know, there's been a heck of a lot of misbehavior by Chinese firms that we're trying to get ahead of, right? But I think that by putting tariffs on the table, you know, we've estimated that maybe four or $500 billion a year through force technology transfer and intellectual property theft is taken out of U.S. economy because of bad deals we made in the past. So what want to do is want to reform those deals.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN: And Hassett also saying this morning in a gaggle with reporters on the White House lawn that he says uncertainty among businesses here is understandable that he thinks at the end of the day a long-term deal that levels the trade deficit is going to be better. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Hillary. Thanks very much. We'll be watching that. Hillary Vaughn. I want to bring in Michigan Congresswoman and House Energy and Commerce Committee member Debbie Dingell. Congresswoman, it's always great to see you. Thanks so much for joining me once again.</p><p>REP. DEBBIE DINGELL (D-MI): Good to see you, Maria.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And so the China story, Congressman, what do you want to see happen here? Do you agree with the President's pushback and the ban on Huawei?</p><p>DINGELL: I don't think he should be backing off. I agreed with him when he did it. I think that China is guilty of currency manipulation, trying to engage in trade with China in China. It's difficult, we know it. They do steal our intellectual property and they manipulate their currency to keep goods in this country artificially reduced. So I think we need to be doing more. My biggest problem with the President, I think he's right to take on these trade issues but he's got to be consistent.</p><p>You can't be here and there and everywhere. He's got a loop all of this in and we've got to have a consistent trade policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, he's been consistent. He's going to use tariffs to -- the way the wants to use it and he's been very consistent in terms of putting America first, hasn't he?</p><p>DINGELL: Well, I think his consistency is he kind of -- he lobs them in like grenades and that, you know, I think what -- he -- what I worry about is no one is quite sure where he is going to be in any given day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Maybe that's by design. He doesn't really want people to know what's on his mind and the next thing. Look, it's very important that the U.S. passes USMCA, this is NAFTA 2.0, you've had your concerns about this. Do you expect Nancy Pelosi to bring it to the floor?</p><p>DINGELL: I expect that it will get to the floor this year. But -- we -- I told you and I keep saying --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Before the August recess? Before the August recess?</p><p>DINGELL: If they can guarantee me that they're -- we're not going to be paying an auto worker $1.50 in Mexico and that's what my autoworkers competing within this country, yes, but I don't know that that will get done. I talked to Ambassador Lighthizer last night about it. I respect him but it is very clear that my autoworkers need a level-playing field and I am -- I keep saying this, I'm a one horse woman.</p><p>500 jobs to Mexico last August paying $1.50 an hour is not level-playing field. The way this is -- this agreement is right now, it doesn't stop it, I got to see that stopped. I have to see what's going to let my workers compete on a level-playing field.</p><p>FORBES: Congresswoman, Steve Forbes here. What would be the impact in the U.S. economy if we put tariffs on all Chinese imports into the United States? Already business investment is down because of uncertainty. We have threat of 25 percent tariffs on autos and auto imports from the rest of the world. Is that going to weigh down on the economy?</p><p>DINGELL: It -- this is my point on tariffs, tariffs are an important trade tool which is why I do agree.</p><p>FORBES: But they're also sales tax.</p><p>DINGELL: They can be but when you need a level-playing field and you've got companies that are devaluing their -- I'm sorry, countries that are devaluing their currency then tariffs are a way that you can level the playing field for workers. I do agree that tariffs -- for the farmers we've got farmers that are paying a price. So that's why we need a consistent stable trade policy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It sounds like -- Congresswoman, it's Dagen McDowell, that you're in favor of tariffs. Again we always go back to the chicken tax which is the 25 percent tariff on imported light trucks into this country. That's been over the last 55 years or so a huge benefit for the very American automakers that you represent.</p><p>DINGELL: Listen, when the President came out with steel tariffs I had on my (INAUDIBLE) on my river front for 25 years empty. We are -- we have other countries that are doing a number of things that make it very difficult for us to compete in the production of steel. Tariffs are an appropriate tool in the trade leveling the playing field.</p><p>FORBES: But raising -- putting sales taxes on imports in these sophisticated supply chains doesn't that to raise the cost of doing business? Studies show that when President Bush put in steel tariffs in the early part of first term for every job saved in the steel industry, five to 10 were lost by those who bought the steel.</p><p>DINGELL: I will agree with you that there are issues and that's why we have to handle these tariffs as trade tool and do it very smartly. I think we should be looking at other things like the imported steel that we're bringing into this country having to meet the same standards that the steel that we produced in this country. We're using substandard steel and bridges.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Look, there are lot of things that you need to be looking at. Big tech is on Capitol Hill today for a House hearing on market dominance. Google has big plans for Michigan, investing $17 million into Detroit. And (INAUDIBLE) I want to get your take on that. But when you look all of the issues on the table, Congresswoman, we don't actually see them turning out to success and turning out into laws for the American people.</p><p>We only hear from your party complaints about Donald Trump. Hearings on impeachment, he should go to prison, on and on and on meanwhile, he is dealing with China, he's dealing with North Korea, he is -- he is waiting and dealing with Mexico, wants to get USMCA passed. When is Nancy Pelosi and your colleagues going to get to work, Congresswoman?</p><p>DINGELL: So, for starters, you can't say that you're only hearing that from Democrats because that's not what you're hearing from me. I am saying that we've got to protect manufacturing in this country. We got a fragile auto industry, Maria and I'm worried about it. And I'm worried not only about the trade policies that had a huge (INAUDIBLE) into it and nobody knew quite what to do on trade policy for the last two weeks when you started using tariffs as an immigration tool not a trade tool.</p><p>We have the -- this administration is looking at setting -- repealing the cafe standards that Obama put in place when the industry is saying let's work with California, let's have one set of standards. And then we've got contract negotiations coming up with this auto industry. I'm worried about auto industry.</p><p>FORBES: But on the cafe standards have been a disaster for the auto industry, forcing you to -- industry to make cars they make no money on.</p><p>DINGELL: That's not -- I would beg to disagree with you. I think that they may need to be tweaked.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: No. The eclectic cars aren't exactly selling like hotcakes.</p><p>DINGELL: OK. But let -- no, they're not because we don't have the infrastructure, people don't have confidence in the range but here -- let me -- do we believe that this country needs to be producing for global market? I do. China is the -- is the largest growth market that the auto industry has. They're mandating electric vehicles. They are going to go to an all-electric vehicle fleet.</p><p>Our manufacturers in this country if they're going to compete in that global marketplace have to be at the forefront of building them. So how do we support them? We can't just badmouth them all the time if we want to be trading to China.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will leave it there. Congresswoman, great to see you. Thanks very much. We appreciate it.</p><p>DINGELL: Good to see you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Debbie Dingell, always a pleasure. Coming up. The May Producer Price Index is out. It's expected to be up one-tenth of a percent. We got the numbers in 20 minutes as soon as it hits the tape. Then Uber's sky-high venture. The ridesharing giant showcasing its latest plans to take customers up, up, and away and a first on Fox interview. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Uber unveiling its plan for a flying car service. Cheryl Casone with the details. That look wild earlier.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: It really did. Interesting interview, Maria. So the Uber elevate conference is under way in Washington as the companies laying out plans for -- yes, flying cars. And a first on Fox interview Uber Elevate head Eric Allison spoke about the issue of regulation.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: When you actually think about all of those things, those vehicles, in the sky, there has to be organization and obviously regulation. So can you lay out for us specific regulation that you would expect to materialize in order for this thing to get in the air?</p><p>ERIC ALLISON, HEAD OF ELEVATE, UBER: Yes, absolutely. So we actually will be operating under the same set of regulations like govern aircraft both vehicles and operations right now. We don't need any legislative change and we don't need any rule change. We're working with FAA to take the existing rules and to use them and apply them in the right way to the -- this new form of transportation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Shares of Uber are moving higher in the premarket. As you can see, Maria, up 1-1/2 percent. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Thank you so much, Cheryl. We are awaiting the May Producer Price Index. It's due out in about 10 minutes time. We're expecting increase one-tenth of a percent. We'll have that number as soon as it hits the tape when we come right back. Meanwhile, pretty good rally underway, Dow Industrials up 128 points right now. We're also looking at the future of retail. We got the CEO of iconic brand Lands' End joining us here in the studio. What's in store, what the tariff fight is meaning for business. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: President Trump responding to an opinion piece from Bloomberg over Twitter this morning. This is what the President just wrote. This is because the Euro and other currencies are devalued against the dollar. Putting the U.S. at a big advantage. The Federal Reserve interest rate was way too high, added tot ridiculous quantitative tightening. They don't have a clue, writes the President.</p><p>He goes on to say this, the United States has very low inflation. A beautiful thing, writes the President.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The Wall Street Journal Nick Timiraos has a very important article about President Trump's hectoring of the Fed chairman, how it complicates the interest rate calls. I encourage to people read it. But here's a quote from the article, not a quotation from an individual. Mr. Powell's game plan is to tune out the President and that the President even called him on his cell phone after a weak jobs' report earlier in the year after that \"awkward dinner\" on Jay Powell's 66th birthday, and called him on his cell phone about the disappointing jobs' report.</p><p>Again, you're putting -- again, your trade policy and the uncertainty that has foamed in it among businesses and even some individuals. It's putting the economy in a bind. The President is going to need the Federal Reserve in his corner with -- even potentially a rate cut --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- this coming year to stabilize the economy if indeed that's what it's meant to do because usually Fed rate cuts come before the, you know, before something bad -- because they see something bad happening in the economy. The President absolutely needs the Federal Reserve in his corner if he wants to win reelection --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What does he say on that phone call when he called him? I guess I'm stuck with you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm stuck with you. I guess I'm stuck with you and that is actually according to Nick Timiraos' reporting, according to the president later recounting the call to supporters.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. But the President did say that the call --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: The Fed is a lagging indicator and its impact in the economy is overstated, they're not going to o overcome the damage big tariffs coming especially on autos if they put that 25 percent tariff in on autos, good- bye, Europe. Good global economy.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But it's just the uncertainty of the -- it's oh, we got tariffs on Mexico, oh, we don't but I'm keeping that powder dry, I'm going to use them if Mexico doesn't do what I want them to. Again, businesses are sitting back gone -- I don't know what to do. G.M., 3M, Deere cutting spending. Even not hiring or even cutting jobs. Again, it's starting -- the concern is starting to build among this --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is why we saw CapEx, you reported this a week ago. It was up 20 percent a few weeks ago, now it's up only three percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. That was in the first quarter and that's according to the S&amp;P earning reports too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We are looking at markets this morning and your 401(k) has done well in the face of all of this in the last couple of months. The Department of Labor is proposing a new regulation that would make it easier for workers to move retirement accounts when they change jobs. Joining us right now is Ramsey Solutions Financial Expert, author of Everyday Millionaires, Chris Hogan. Chris, good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>CHRIS HOGAN, FINANCIAL EXPERT, RAMSEY SOLUTIONS: Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And everybody knows that situation when you leave one job you want to take your 401(k) with you. Oftentimes it's so complicated that you just leave it at the company that you just left.</p><p>HOGAN: Yes. And that's, Maria, not what you want to do. You actually want to remain in control. And so the best thing to do is to roll that 401(k) over into an IRA. Now, you can do that by reaching out to an investment professional to be able to guide you or you can do that yourself. So, don't have to leave it and forget it mentality. I want people to stay in control of their money so they can leave themselves toward their retirement dreams.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I get it. I get it. When I was at CNBC I had 20 years under my belt and I had a great 401(k), I put it into an IRA. It wasn't hard at all.</p><p>HOGAN: No. It's the -- yes, it's the best to do, Maria. The thing that makes me nervous about this new proposed law is that the employees could cash out their 401(k) if the employee doesn't roll it over if it's a thousand dollars or under. This makes me nervous because a lot of people will forget to roll it over. And if the -- it is cashed out early they're going to have penalties and taxes on this money.</p><p>So I'm continuing to educate people to stay in control of your financial future and don't leave your 401(k) behind.</p><p>ANDERSON: Chris, this is Kristen Soltis Anderson here. What are some of the biggest impediments there are to millenials investing in the first place? I mean, a lot of these, you know, when a retirement is kind of something wherein employers are putting money in for you, you don't have to think about, that works but with student loan debt and all sorts of other obligations, are millennials choosing to invest and the do right things to prepare for retirement?</p><p>HOGAN: Well, Kristen, you hit on a couple of things. I think the impediment of being able to save is debt. A lot of people, you know, 70 percent of people are living paycheck to paychecks. So that means their money is going out toward debt and student loans. However on my show, The Chris Hogan Show, I'm talking to millenials that our saving in are getting intentional. And, so what we have to do is continue to educate people to help them to understand,</p><p>If you want to spend money in the future, you've got to address it and make sure you're saving for yourself right now.</p><p>FORBES: Chris, would you ever recommend borrowing on your IRA or 401(k) to pay down credit card debt?</p><p>HOGAN: Oh, Steve, you're trying to get me riled up this morning. Absolutely not. You leave that money alone and you let it grow. And too many people are doing that. And you know, if you reach into that money because it's pretax money, you're going to pay taxes and penalties on it. I love the idea of getting out of debt. I teach people all across America how to do that but I would much rather people tighten up their belt with their budget. Take on an extra job but leave that money for your future alone.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Chris. We appreciate it. Thank you so much. We will see I soon, Chris Hogan --</p><p>HOGAN: Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- joining us there. We want to take a look at PPI which we're expecting in about a minute. Markets are higher going into this. Futures up 129 points on the Dow Industrials. S&amp;P is up 15 and the NASDAQ up 58. Now we are waiting PPI up one-tenth of a percent. Expectations up two percent year-over-year. This is important because the Fed has not seen inflation at its target rate, right?</p><p>And a lot of people say look, less unless we actually see inflation where the Fed wants it to be, then maybe we won't in fact -- then maybe the Fed will cut interest rates because of that specifically.</p><p>FORBES: Well, they shouldn't even be trying to soak inflation in the first place and of documentary we had on money. Paul Volcker said he gets a little crossed when they talk about inflation. He -- we had a terrible bout in the 60s and 70s. Why he want to release that virus again. They worship this thing, Maria, called the Phillips Curve that says if you want low employment, have to have fine inflation, well we have both today that the Fed still worships that thing which is why they have these inflations targets. They ought to get in the 21st Century.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How important is this PPI number to you, Dagen? Produced prices up one-tenth of a percent? Inflation has been non-existent.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Non-existent. The core PCE, the personal consumption expenditures index which the Federal Reserve looks at. That's consumer inflation, but it's still running at 1.6 percent so it's extremely, extremely low. It's important to see if there's any impact of you've had a -- again, a bear market in oil prices, that's what -- that's a top line inflation number but you want to see if there's any impact at all from the tariffs on imported goods into this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So anything that would change the Fed's decision, making -- people are again counting on the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates. At least like --</p><p>BARTIROMO: it's up two-tenths of a percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Two-tenths of a percent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Now the estimate was up one-tenth of a percent, the number is added, it's up two-tenths of a percent. We're watching markets to see any change here and what this means for the Federal Reserve. But for the month of May, we did in fact see a higher than expected showing up two-tenths of a percent versus an estimate of one-tenth of a percent. Yes, it's only two-tenths of a percent, but it's also double what the expectations were.</p><p>FORBES: I wouldn't lose too much sleep over it. Again, the key thing is investment, that's more important than the inflation numbers. And the other thing to look at is the gold price which shot up in anticipation. The Fed is going to weaken the dollar. All currencies around the world are wobbling right now. And so when we -- when the Chinese Yuan goes against the dollar, it's -- they're weak and the dollar's weak as well. They just happen to be weaker than we are. It's not a good -- not a good environment this uncertainty.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And this is X-food and energy. Year-over-year, it's up 1.8 percent which is actually below the estimate.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Uh-hmm.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is two percent year-over-year.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Inflation's very, very tame.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. We'll take a break. When we come back, we're going to look at demand and that is from the consumer. The CEO of the iconic brand Lands' End is here in studio. We will talk about the future of retail and how the trade dispute is hitting your wallet. This is an important issue for Lands' End, China. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, June 11th. Your top stories 8:34 a.m. on the East Coast. Breaking news, May producer prices coming in, in line with expectations. Actually, when you look at the actual number up, it was one-tenth of a percent. Earlier, we showed you X-food and energy which was up two-tenths of a percent. So, the number was actually right in line with expectations. Markets actually traded up on it. Take a look at the Dow right now, up 143 points on the Dow Jones Industrial average.</p><p>The S&amp;P is up 17, and the NASDAQ up 65. In Europe this morning, firmer tone there as well, take a look at European Indices where the FT-100 is up 43, the CAC Quarante is up 47, and the DAX Index in Germany up 156 points, that's one and a third percent. In Asia overnight, the Chinese announced some stimulus, and as a result, markets took off. Shanghai composite up 2- 2/3 percent in China overnight. That was the best performer in Asia. Our top story this half an hour, retail in America, Lands' End is a leading multichannel retailer, from casual clothing to home products, the iconic brand announced first-quarter earnings last week as it closes retail spaces inside Sears Stores.</p><p>Joining me right now for an exclusive interview is the CEO of Lands' End, Jerome Griffith. Jerome, it's great to have you on the program. Thanks for joining us.</p><p>JEROME GRIFFITH, CEO, LANDS' END: Thanks. Thanks for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So last week's numbers, people were expecting a wider loss. It was better than expected. Tell us what drove the quarter first off in terms of Lands' End business.</p><p>GRIFFITH: Two things were really good for us in quarter one, one is our e- commerce business continues to performer pretty well. Our U.S. e-commerce business was up eight percent over the last year, so that was a good sign. Plus we're opening up our own stores, and our comp store sales increase was in the double digits so it was really pleasing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And what about the Sears connection?</p><p>GRIFFITH: Sears is something we've been backing away from for the last couple of years. We were spun off in 2014 so that was five years ago. And we are only in about 40 Sears Stores now and that'll be gone by the end of the year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've been talking all morning, and really, for the last several weeks about what seems to be a slowing economy. You look at the manufacturing side of things, things have slowed. And also when you just look at retail, I know it's very bifurcated, whether it's brick and mortar versus e-commerce, but how would you characterize the consumer right now? Are you expecting things to slow down rest of the year?</p><p>GRIFFITH: I think the consumer's being very cautious and they're very tight with their money right now, so they're very careful about where they're spending it. But as we go into the back part of the year, we still feel very comfortable with what our expectations have been.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But of course there's that big unknown and that is China, and I know Lands' End will have a big impact here. That's what I want to talk about because Lands' End, some of your products are made in the United States, but the majority produced oversees. What is the impact of new tariffs going into place should that happen?</p><p>GRIFFITH: I think if you had a very large China-based manufacturing base, you're going to have issues with where you're going to passing on the costs that you're going to -- that are going to increase. For us, we're pretty well diversified, so we're looking at other options, you know, you can pass along the costs to the consumer, you can eat it yourself, you can go back to the manufacturing base, or you can look for other places to save money in your own business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So would the first move be to try to renegotiate with vendors?</p><p>GRIFFITH: That's generally what most people would do for ourselves. Again, we're really well diversified so we don't really look at that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK. And so the next move would be moving production out of China and go to Vietnam or somewhere else.</p><p>GRIFFITH: You can go someplace else, but quite honestly, it's a very long process. It might take a year, it might take even longer to get the same quality.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So easiest thing to do then if you're getting hit with tariffs, retaliatory tariffs, and tariffs on your goods is to raise prices, pass it on to the consumers.</p><p>GRIFFITH: Easiest thing to do is to pass it on to the consumers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And do you think that's in the cards?</p><p>GRIFFITH: For us, I don't think so. It's one thing that we could be doing but we're really looking at other options.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But we just talked about all the options and you said one is really hard.</p><p>GRIFFITH: One is --</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what are you going to do? We got a China fight on our hands.</p><p>GRIFFITH: Yes, we're looking at really everything. You're talking to your manufacturing bases, you could have saved some money there, you're looking at other places in the come pay where you could save money. But ultimately, if they all come into effect, it's not going to be good for the consumer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where are you in the recovery of Lands' End in the new revitalization? Tell us where you are in that process, do you still have to sell assets perhaps cut down and slim down on expenses?</p><p>GRIFFITH: No, I don't think so. What we've been really doing is looking to increase our e-commerce business. We're looking to increase our store base, and our store base has actually been performing pretty well along with the e-commerce.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell me about you I.T. investment then because that's going to included putting money new money, right? In terms of investing, and into e-commerce.</p><p>GRIFFITH: Yes, we've been playing catchup for the last few years, so we've increased our investments in I.T., we've installed new VRP system, we're looking at our -- oh, sorry, at our wear housing system right now, and we've been putting more money into our e-commerce space.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There also has been a question in terms of what the focus is. Do you want to still be a retailer going everything from home goods to camping goods to clothing or do you want to specialize into certain categories?</p><p>GRIFFITH: No, we really want to have a complete lifestyle brand.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm. And how do you do that? Tells us about that.</p><p>GRIFFITH: Well, most of our business is done through women's. Females are -- is our best customer. And we service her and all of needs for her.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We had some weak jobs numbers. Well, they were weaker than expected in the month of May. You know that 75,000 jobs created, but we were expecting 180,000, in terms of jobs. Are you having a hard time finding talent? Tell me about putting people to work.</p><p>GRIFFITH: No, not at all. We're the third largest employer in southern Wisconsin. And when the company was not performing well a few years ago it was hard to get people. But I think most people want to be associated with an organization that's doing well and doing the right thing and I think we are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you don't -- because there is a skills gap, I guess, but you're finding that you're finding the employees that you need, putting them to work.</p><p>GRIFFITH: Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell --let's talk about this contract with Delta Airlines, American Airlines as well, designed by two Zac Posen. Two Delta employees now suing your company, claiming that the uniforms are causing medical issues.</p><p>GRIFFITH: Yes. Normally, we don't want to comment on any existing litigation, but I will like to clear up a couple of misconceptions in the press.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure.</p><p>GRIFFITH: First of all, we've outfitted about 65,000 Delta employees in the last year, which was I think pretty amazing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a pretty important contract.</p><p>GRIFFITH: Yes, but, you know, for a group of people that size, you're always going to have some issues and we've been dealing with every issue that's coming in from an extremely small percentage of people and there are things like the fit might not be right or they might be uncomfortable, and we've been able to deal with almost every issue that's come into us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm. So in terms of this lawsuit.</p><p>GRIFFITH: Well, listen, we have an unwavering commitment to Delta and their employees. As I said, we service almost 65,000 employees in the last year, and any issue that's come into us, we've either dealt with or in the process of dealing with, and we want to make sure that we've offered them alternatives so other uniforms other options.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are the priorities in terms of growth right now? Tell me where you see opportunities to move the needle on growth at Lands' End.</p><p>GRIFFITH: We have five pillars in our growth strategy. First is getting the product right. We want to make sure that the product that we have with the consumers is absolutely on point for them. And we've been doing that over the last of couple years. Second is being a uni-channel distributor which means I want to service the consumer wherever, whenever, and however they want to be serviced. Third's being a digital company. About 90 percent of everything that we sell is done through a click. Fourth, we want to make sure that we have a great infrastructure and that goes back to your point about reinvesting in technology, and, finally, we want to be a - - great place to works.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-hmm. And how do you set sales up? First quarter sales down 12-1/2 percent.</p><p>GRIFFITH: That was not anniversary, the Delta launched from a year ago. As I side before, e-commerce business was up eight percent with double digit increases in our stores.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you want to do more contracts like the Delta.</p><p>GRIFFITH: We have American coming up --</p><p>BARTIROMO: You have American Airlines as well, yes.</p><p>GRIFFITH: -- at the end of this year. Yes, we'll be launching American. We're pretty excited about that. But the thing that's, you know those things come and go, meaning you'll have a big launch and then you'll just be selling additional product throughout the coming years. However, the e- commerce business and the store business is really the base of our business right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So bottom line is you don't expect a slowdown coming.</p><p>GRIFFITH: We don't expect a big slowdown, unless except for things that are out of my control.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Like china.</p><p>GRIFFITH: Like China.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. All right. We'll leave it there. Jerome, great to have you on the program.</p><p>GRIFFITH: Cheers. Thanks a lot.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be watching. Jerome Griffith joining us there. CEO at Lands' End. Coming up, investors are watching trade for sure. What's at stake for a truce with China ahead of President Trump's meeting with China's Xi Jinping later this month. Stuart Varney with the prediction coming up next. And then all eyes on team USA, the U.S. women's soccer team ready for action, gearing up for first game at the women's world cup. We'll take you live to France for the very latest. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. U.S.-China trade tensions persisting ahead of this month's G20 summit. Joining me right now, the host of \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" Stuart Varney to weigh in. Good morning, Stu.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Would you mind if I make a prediction, Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Please.</p><p>VARNEY: I'm am going right out on a limb with this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK.</p><p>VARNEY: But seems to me that the pressure on both sides is so great that some kind of deal will happen in two weeks when President Xi meets President Trump at the G20 meeting. But I think it will be a very limited deal. I think there will be a handshake, there'll be smiles, people will feel good. I think the Chinese will agree to import a whole lot of American stuff, and America may decide to drop the tariffs or agree that no more tariffs in the future. But they'll keep talking within a framework to figure out how to handle intellectual property, and the forced transfer of technology.</p><p>That is a very limited deal, but I think it -- the market would like it, the economy would like it. And diplomatically, that would be a hit. What do you think? Am I way out on a limb with this one?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think it's going to be hard for the President to accept a deal that doesn't include at least China beginning to address intellectual property or beginning to address the forced transfer of technology because this administration has made such a big deal about this and even though many of us knew that the Chinese were stealing for so long, you know, nobody ever has pushed back, so given that the administration has pushed back so much on this, I don't think the President can do a deal with nothing about this. I get what you're saying.</p><p>VARNEY: True. True. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're talking about a limited deal, where they're going to buy more stuff, we're going to have better trade numbers, but nothing on the other -- the big ticket items.</p><p>VARNEY: I think they'll --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't think he'll be able to do that stuff.</p><p>VARNEY: No, I -- but I think there will be something --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: -- on the big ticket items.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Then that's different.</p><p>VARNEY: And an agreement to keep on talking --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Then that's different. If there' something like a promise --</p><p>VARNEY: -- get the details going, you'll have a framework, a positive framework, to figure out that side of the deal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, that would be the only way, I think. That would be the only way he could get this deal done, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY: But the opposite is no handshake, no smile, the meeting breaks up, everybody's angry with each other, that's a disaster.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: Certainly for our markets probably our economy and certainly for their market and their economy. So I don't see absolutely nothing happening.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: I do see a very limited deal which works for the market and for the economy. And works politically, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Well, we'll see. I mean, you know --</p><p>VARNEY: Only time will tell, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- or we companies seeing companies moving out of China and moving into Vietnam --</p><p>VARNEY: Sure. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: --and other areas, so there's that.</p><p>VARNEY: But it seems like the pressure is so great on both sides, the stakes are so high.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They are. Absolutely.</p><p>VARNEY: That it's awfully difficult to see them walking away with absolutely nothing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>VARNEY: I can't see that happening.</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, I get you. Yes, that would be a big issue for the markets for sure. I know you'll have more in this in 10 minutes, Stu. We'll see you at the top of the hour.</p><p>VARNEY: Certainly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: \"VARNEY &amp; CO.\" begins top of the hour 9:00 a.m. Eastern every day. Join Stuart right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. But first, we're checking out Team USA, the U.S. women's soccer team ready for action gearing up for the first game at the Women's World Cup. We'll take you live to France right after this break for the latest. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Team USA kicks of its quest for Woman's World Cup glory taking the field against Thailand and France today. FOX News Headlines 24/7 reporter Carley Shimkus is there ahead of today's big game. Carley, good morning to you.</p><p>CARLEY SHIMKUS, FOX NEWS CHANNEL REPORTER: Hey, good morning, Maria. It is a beautiful day here in Rennes, France. And speaking of beautiful, check out this gorgeous cathedral behind me. This is Rennes Cathedral. And fans have been buzzing around this area all morning, taking pictures in front of it before heading off to the big game against Thailand. Now Team USA is number one in the world, and they are also the defending World Cup Champions but their last international appearance actually ended in crushing defeat when Sweden beat them during the 2016 Rio Olympics.</p><p>So, a lot of these players are really out for redemption. And Coach Jill Ellis says she is very excited to see her players shine.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JILL ELLIS, HEAD COACH, TEAM USA: When the tournament kicks off and you watch the games, you know, the anticipation for your first match grows, so I think the players are, you know, ready, excited, hungry. You know, I think we feel prepared.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Now Team USA has a lot of strength, speed, skill, a deep roster. A lot of these players have also been playing together for a long time, 12 of the current players were also on the 2015 World's Cup Championship team but it is definitely going to be a long road ahead. They are playing Sweden on June 20th. They very well may play France as well. And a lot of people Maria say that that will be the most competitive game of the tournament if it happens.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, this is a big deal because they're such a good team also, and they're -- that they're number one.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Absolutely, they are number one. They actually have the most World Cup victories. They have three and they're going for four but they are the most successful team in U.S. or rather women's soccer history.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Awesome. Thank you. Carley, thank you. We're going to certainly be watching that. Carley Shimkus this morning in France. We got final thoughts of this all-star panel after this short break. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Well, the President is tweeting and apparently watching. He just wrote this. \"Maria, Dagen, Steve, and Stuart Varney, when you are the big piggybank that other countries have been ripping off for years to a level that is not to be believed, tariffs are a great negotiating tool, a great revenue producer and most importantly, a powerful way to get on to the next tweet. The President continues. Oh, we're waiting. We're waiting for -- come on, Mr. President. You left us hanging there. You know he likes tariffs.</p><p>FORBES: Tariffs are taxes and --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And they've worked so far for him.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes.</p><p>FORBES: We'll see, if it works for the American economy. And by golly, I don't want the democrats ever getting power and use tariffs of her ---</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well --</p><p>FORBES: -- green new deals and junk like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a good point.</p><p>VARNEY: Well, I think the President was emphasizing the point that tariffs are a good weapon to use when you want to get the other side to do something which they may not be willing to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>VARNEY: And in the case of Mexico, it worked. I think it's going to work to some degree with china. That was the point I was making in our conversation. Maria.</p><p>FORBES: And others we have that that because ticket items are the forced transfer of technology --</p><p>FREEMAN: Yes, and the intellectual property theft. We'll see if it actually moves the needle. Thank you, Mr. President, for watching. And Stuart Varney, I'll send it right over to you.</p><p>VARNEY: And good morning, Maria.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019061103cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9V-SH71-JB20-G2B8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7983\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 11, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC0001S8A</classCode><className>FORBES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>SIC2721 PERIODICALS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

Of the top 10 most richly valued public companies, just two were       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-tech-stocks-to-buy-this-year\">tech stocks</url>: Microsoft Corp.

In the last days of the 2010s, each of the top five most valuable public companies in the world is a U.S. tech company: </p><p>1. Apple: $1.18 trillion</p><p>2. Microsoft: $1.13 trillion</p><p>3.

Here are three reasons why big tech companies prospered in the 2010s: </p><p>-- Cloud computing</p><p>-- Streaming, on-demand and consumer choice</p><p>-- Convenience at a (hidden) price</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cloud computing.</emphasis> Three of today's top five most valuable public companies have prominent cloud computing operations, and that's no accident. Not only has demand for cloud computing been in a secular growth phase for years now, but it's extremely high margin. </p><p>Amazon's AWS is almost singlehandedly responsible for Amazon's rise to the level of dominance seen today, providing the profits that allow Amazon to take bold risks, expand into new markets, and compete with the likes of Walmart ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/wmt-walmart-inc\">WMT</url>) and Target Corp. (       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/tgt-target-corp\">TGT</url>) on price and delivery. </p><p>And Microsoft, for its part, would never have hit the $1 trillion level without the success of its cloud division, Microsoft Azure. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Streaming, on-demand and consumer choice.</emphasis> Entertainment was revolutionized by <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/tech-stocks-to-own-in-a-recession\">tech companies</url> over the last decade. Netflix (       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/nflx-netflix-inc\">NFLX</url>) started the trend of streaming video back in 2007, but the space had been concentrated until very recently. </p><p>\"Witness the recent emergence of Apple TV Plus and Disney Plus, and the sense of concern among traditional cable TV programmers and providers that they must make the transition -- or else,\" says Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst and Washington bureau chief for Bankrate.com. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Convenience at a hidden price.</emphasis>The most successful <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/7-tech-stocks-that-are-helping-us-live-longer\">tech companies</url> of the 2010s continuously sought to make their services more seamless and intuitive for consumers to use. Consumers thoroughly enjoy convenience. </p><p>\"These companies complete our sentences on our phones and emails, recommend us items to purchase, and remind us when we need to exercise,\" says Jason Schloetzer, professor at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business. </p><p>These features, however, aren't magic. They require \"a level of passive data collection that totals close to 2 exabytes each day,\" Schloetzer says. That's 80-plus years of HD video content, he adds. </p><p>\"So one way to think about the rise of 'Big Tech' is through their ability to woo us into generating vast amounts of passively-collected data, which these companies digitize, analyze, and eventually monetize in ways we largely do not understand,\" Schloetzer says. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Cambridge Analytica Scandal: Tech At Its Worst</emphasis></p><p>A prime example of this secret data monetization was the Cambridge Analytica scandal. </p><p>In 2015 and 2016, political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica secretly harvested private information on up to 87 million Facebook users, using it to target political ads in the 2016 presidential election. CA worked for the Trump campaign. </p><p>When the story broke in 2018 it caused an uproar; more than $100 billion was shaved off Facebook's market value, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg ended up getting grilled before Congress (for the first time). </p><p>Going forward, the public is forced to take Facebook's word that something like this won't happen again. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Pros and Cons of Trillion-Dollar Companies</emphasis></p><p>A euphoric IPO technically made PetroChina the first trillion-dollar company in 2007, though that unsustainable valuation would only last for days. </p><p>The 2010s saw the rise of the first reasonably valued trillion-dollar companies -- all of them tech stocks. Apple, Microsoft and Amazon are the three that have hit the mark. Alphabet, near $900 billion, is likely next. </p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">See:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/slideshows/7-of-the-best-socially-responsible-funds\">7 of the Best Socially Responsible Funds.</url>]</p><p>Make no mistake: for the everyday Americans who owned some of these stocks in their portfolio, the rise of big tech companies has been great. Even index investors have greatly benefited, as the rise of the so-called FAANG stocks, due to their large market caps, helped spark what turned out to be the longest bull market in U.S. history. </p><p>The downside? These stocks also play a prominent role in widening income inequality. The world's two richest people, Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, have each at times been worth over $100 billion due to the rise of AMZN and MSFT, respectively. </p><p>The enormous wealth of tech powerhouses also contributes to a worrisome increase in the power of these companies and their founders. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Corporation As Government</emphasis></p><p>In the 2010s, Silicon Valley companies amassed more power than, perhaps, any industry has before. Facebook and Twitter ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/twtr-twitter-inc\">TWTR</url>) were used extensively to spread disinformation, incite division and promote particular politicians ahead of the 2016 elections. In the 2010s, a genocide of the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar was stoked and amplified largely through Facebook. </p><p>The ability of social media companies in particular to affect the behavior of millions of citizens -- and therefore the fate of nations -- was first emphatically shown during the Arab Spring movement at the beginning of the 2010s. Protests were organized through Facebook and Twitter, and entire governments (e.g. Libya, Egypt) were overthrown. </p><p>It's partly why China, Iran and North Korea all consider <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-tech-stocks-to-buy-in-a-slowing-economy\">tech giants</url> like Twitter, Facebook and Google a threat to their national security. </p><p>In the 2010s, a trillion-dollar company, Microsoft, earned a higher credit rating than the U.S. government. Facebook began the decade a private company and ended with 2.2 billion users and a congressional hearing about whether its new currency would destroy the U.S. dollar. </p><p>That's power. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rethinking Antitrust</emphasis></p><p>The U.S. government has begun recognizing just how much power big tech companies have quietly amassed. In 2019, the Feds started investigating four giants -- Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple -- on antitrust grounds. </p><p>But going into 2020, much of antitrust law remains antiquated. Under what circumstances in the past could a company whose main service was entirely free (Facebook, Google) be considered a monopoly? This is new. </p><p>\"The law has not yet caught up with big data analytics and so mere compliance with the law is not sufficient to protect people in the big data era,\" says Dennis Hirsch of The Risk Institute at Ohio State University. \"Data ethics is about going beyond what the law requires in order to mitigate risks to individuals, and so to the company itself.\" </p><p>This may be true, but industry can't simply be trusted to police itself. Regulation must do the job, and it's behind the times already. Subverting laws and exploiting loopholes actually helped to create multibillion-dollar tech giants Uber ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stocks/uber-uber-technologies-inc\">UBER</url>) and Airbnb. </p><p>Moving forward, keeping up with tech will only become more challenging. </p><p>[<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">READ</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://money.usnews.com/investing/stock-market-news/slideshows/best-stocks-to-buy-for-the-5g-revolution\">7 of the Best Stocks to Buy for the 5G Revolution</url>]</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tech Promises and Challenges in the 2020s</emphasis></p><p>If governments across the world continue at their present pace then private companies (and high tech companies in particular) will increasingly influence the decades to come. </p><p>Regulators struggled and largely failed to keep up with issues like vaping, electric scooters, autonomous driving, ride-hailing, social media, privacy concerns and cryptocurrency.

Intel is still appealing its antitrust case, which began 15 years ago, even as it has become more powerful than ever in PC chips.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  And despite five years of scrutiny by European regulators, Google showcases its own services prominently, such as maps and reviews, in its search results.</p><p>  In the formal antitrust charges filed on Wednesday, the European Commission complained only about the results of Google's shopping searches, noting that investigators were examining other types of search. The agency also began  an investigation into how Google bundles its apps with its Android smartphone software, an inquiry that also isn't likely to reach a quick resolution.</p><p>  ''The remedy issues are great challenges for antitrust,'' said Harry First, a law professor at New York University who has written a book about Microsoft's antitrust troubles. ''These companies are big and smart and they know their businesses better than the regulators do.''</p><p>  The slow process of regulatory enforcement is often at odds with the speed at which tech companies must move, which means that even the $1.4 billion fine faced by Intel can seem like a tolerable cost of business to a company that has $14 billion in cash and liquid assets.</p><p>  Antitrust issues are not the only legal challenges facing American tech companies in Europe. Regulators and lawmakers are reviewing low-tax arrangements granted to Apple in Ireland and Amazon in Luxembourg, and privacy watchdogs are looking into how Facebook protects people's online data. Policy makers are also investigating whether American Internet platforms like Amazon have too much control over how Europeans gain access to online services.</p><p>  Even if regulators do not require substantial changes in how these companies do business, all of these fights impose a cost. In addition to negative publicity, legal costs and possible penalties, the cases are a distraction, forcing companies to defend an existing business model to regulators when perhaps they should be abandoning it because of a changing market.</p><p>  Rapidly changing technology -- rather than regulatory pressure -- has been far more important historically in weakening the dominance of big tech companies.</p><p>  ''All the successful firms in the PC and early Web businesses missed mobile or were late to it,'' said Timothy Bresnahan, a professor of economics at Stanford who worked for the Justice Department on antitrust matters and has also consulted for Microsoft, Intel and Google over the years.</p><p>Microsoft and Intel, focused on PCs, both missed the rise of tablet computers and smartphones, allowing companies like Apple, Google and Qualcomm to become dominant players in mobile devices.</p><p>  For Google, mobile apps are now nipping at the primacy of its lucrative web searches as cellphone users pull up Amazon or Yelp to search directly for products or restaurant reviews.</p><p>  In a blog post responding to Europe's charges, Google noted, ''Today seven out of every eight minutes on mobile devices is spent within apps -- in other words, consumers are going to whichever websites or apps serve them best. And they face no friction or costs in switching between them.''</p><p>  Still, the watchful eyes of regulators play an important role in keeping companies' power in check, and Google's competitors cheered the European Commission's actions, which have been much tougher than those of American regulators.</p><p>  ''Google engages in preferencing and manipulates search results so that consumers see content that benefits Google, not the best content for consumers,'' Stephen Kaufer, chief executive of TripAdvisor, a travel review site, said in a statement. ''Today's announcement by the commissioner is the first step to making search on Google better for consumers.''</p><p>Microsoft, which has played a leading role in organizing industry opposition to Google in Europe, was similarly pleased.</p><p>  ''Clearly every company needs to obey the same legal rules of the road,'' the software company said in a statement. ''Today's decision provides to Google a full opportunity to explain its views at a hearing, and the commission will then have the opportunity to decide whether European legal rules have been respected.''</p><p>  Of course, as Microsoft well knows, that is just the beginning of a long process. Microsoft tangled with European regulators off and on for 20 years, starting in 1993, before finally paying its last fine and ending its appeals.</p><p>  Some American tech companies have chosen an alternative approach.</p><p>  Facebook put itself under European regulatory scrutiny in 2010 by establishing a regional headquarters in Dublin. That means the privacy practices of the social network are generally overseen by Irish regulators, who have traditionally been less confrontational than those in other countries.</p><p>  ''We have an ongoing dialogue with our regulator, the Irish data protection commissioner, who oversees our compliance with the E.U. data protection directive as implemented under Irish law,'' said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman in London. ''We routinely review product and policy updates with them.''</p><p>  Europe has stricter privacy laws than the United States, and Facebook says that its conversations with Irish regulators have led to improvements for all of its 1.3 billion global users, including better tools to review and delete individual posts and clearer explanations of the company's privacy practices.</p><p>  Facebook argues that under European law, it is insulated from separate oversight by other European countries. Despite that, government watchdogs in at least six nations -- France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands -- have opened investigations into whether the company's new privacy policies comply with local rules.</p><p>  ''We have investigated Google. Now, it's time to focus on Facebook,'' said Mathias Moulin, deputy director of enforcement at the French data protection regulator. ''They are the leader in social networks.''</p><p>  Europe's highest court is also hearing a case that focuses on how Facebook moved European data outside the region. And a class-action lawsuit in Austria, which could lead to a fine of around $12 million, contends that Facebook has not respected the online privacy rights of its users.</p><p>Amazon, bowing to concerns raised by Edward J. Snowden's revelations of United States government surveillance of American tech companies, decided last fall to open a data center in Germany for its web services division. The company already had a data center in Ireland, but both German and European Union regulations have restrictions on storing some of their citizens' personal data across a national or regional boundary.</p><p>  ''German customers wanted a location on German soil, either for perception or legal reasons,'' Adam Selipsky, a vice president at Amazon Web Services, said at the time. So Amazon complied.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>DRAWING (DRAWING BY LIZ GRAUMAN/THE NEW YORK TIMES)       </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-296287150416</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FS8-FP11-JBG3-61GP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1221\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/technology/google-joins-its-us-peers-under-europes-scrutiny.html\">http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/technology/google-joins-its-us-peers-under-europes-scrutiny.html</url><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"04\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>April 16, 2015 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NEW YORK GIANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SAN FRANCISCO GIANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>INTC (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

One big advantage for Pai of a later vote is that his confirmation could face an easier time on the Senate floor if the order is still pending, the officials said. The number of comments in docket 17-108 stood at almost 21.9 million at our deadline Thursday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"While I have no doubt that many of the reply comments do not contain substantive legal or economic arguments, due process nonetheless requires the FCC to parse through them all,\" said Lawrence Spiwak, president of the Phoenix Center. \"While the FCC probably has its statutory un-reclassification argument figured out, which is the central legal question ... I'm not sure the FCC has decided, as a policy matter, how much authority over Title I services it wants to abrogate. There are quite a few stakeholders who have argued that while Title II was a bad idea, the FCC still has the power ... to monitor bad things on the Internet.\"</p><p>A former eighth-floor adviser said the big question is whether the FCC will retain any oversight: \"Pai probably wants to get rid of it, but that's harder for congressional Republicans to defend politically than if the FCC keeps a couple of baseline rules.\" The big question is \"whether the FCC identifies an alternative source of authority,\" for example, Section 706 of the Communications Act, \"to support any net neutrality rules,\" said a lawyer whose firm represents ISPs.</p><p>The FCC should act \"without undue delay but keeping all the necessary legal and procedural requirements,\" said an official with ties to the Trump administration. \"I would be surprised if it went later than the end of the year.\" Free State Foundation President Randolph May predicted a vote by year-end.</p><p>\"The FCC owes it to the entire internet ecosystem to carefully weigh both the econometric and ordinary course evidence supporting repeal of the 2015 Open Internet Order,\" emailed Abigail Slater, Internet Association general counsel. \"A careful weighing will debunk the argument that the 2015 Order has uniquely and severely impacted incentives to invest and innovate. Similarly, the cost benefit analysis supporting reversal of the 2015 order is thin, at best.\"</p><p>Advocates of keeping the 2015 net neutrality rules and retaining the classification of broadband as a Title II common-carrier service said the rules are working. Major ISPs and free-market oriented groups said Title II continues to harm investment. The FCC didn't comment.</p><p>Free Press said the rules are doing what was intended. \"Indicator after indicator shows the Net Neutrality rules and the legal framework on which they rest are working to promote expression, political organization, education, and innovation online,\" the group told the FCC. \"Amid all the spin, hyperbole, and ad hominem attacks on Free Press both by this Chairman and the cable and phone companies he favors, one thing is clear: neither the Commission's Notice, nor any broadband provider arguments offered in response to it during the initial comment period, articulated a 'reasoned explanation' for the undue and unwise change in course that the Notice proposed.\"</p><p>A number of big tech players also supported the 2015 rules. \"An open internet ensures that hundreds of millions of consumers get the experience they want, over the broadband connections they choose, to use the devices they love, which have become an integral part of their lives,\" Apple said. Netflix offered similar comments. MPAA said the FCC should avoid interfering with efforts to combat copyright infringement in any net neutrality regulations it \"maintains or adopts.\"</p><p>Among others who weighed in against a rewrite of the rules, the Electronic Privacy Information Center said the FCC has to propose something to protect an open internet, even if just concurrent jurisdiction with the FTC. The FTC \"lacks the ability and the political will to safeguard consumer privacy,\" EPIC argued: The FCC should launch a rulemaking on \"comprehensive internet privacy rules\" and not rely on industry guidelines and self-regulation.</p><p>Congress must step in, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce commented. \"The Chamber looks forward to working with both the Commission and Congress to achieve a long-lasting solution to maintaining a free, competitive, and open internet while removing overly-intrusive regulatory barriers to growth.\" Verizon called on the FCC to reclassify broadband. \"Market forces already generally compel broadband providers to abide by open Internet principles,\" Verizon said. \"There are significant potential harms from utility-style regulation.\"</p><p>Cisco supported the arguments of the major ISPs, its customers. \"The reduction of competition in this arena only harms consumers and undercuts the public interest; thus, the Commission can and should reverse the Title II Order's ban,\" Cisco said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PCF-S151-DYRJ-01MP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"835\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 01, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Shares of data storage and file sharing company Dropbox  exploded 14% on high volume, despite a lack of news. Dropbox declined to comment on the stock's move to TheStreet's Kinsey Grant, but that won't stop the speculation.</p><p>Sure, it's likely an insider buy or a rumor of a planned buyback that's driving the stock, but maybe the market is getting wind of something more substantial. Maybe it's that Dropbox, which only recently went public, is hearing some takeover chatter. Maybe it's not. But if the company was to be acquired, or open to an acquisition, you'd have to imagine the interest would be there. The company has relationships with a ton of big tech companies that could all use Dropbox in some way. According to its latest 10-Q, Dropbox has partnerships or \"integrations\" with Microsoft  , Adobe  , Apple  , Salesforce  , Atlassian, Slack, IBM  , Cisco  , VMware  , Okta  , Symantec  , Palo Alto Networks  and a variety of other vendors. The company also competes with Apple, Microsoft, Amazon  , Google  and Box  in the cloud storage realm. Microsoft, which has been highly acquisitive has been subject to speculation as a potential bidder, already, though Salesforce, which deepened its ties with DropBox through a $100 million investment just after the latter's IPO, also seems like a prime candidate. From the moment I personally used DropBox, it seemed like a no brainer for Apple. Steve Jobs seemed to think so too, but with a bit of a different attitude than other interested parties, according to reports of a meeting between the Apple founder and Dropbox founder <person><nameText>Drew Houston </nameText></person>in the early days of Dropbox.</p><p>You know what these two mergers (AT&amp;T-Time Warner<br/> and some form of Comcast  or Disney  and Fox  ) will do? Create industry powerhouses like we've never seen before, for one, but also create companies with extreme amounts of debt. The two most indebted companies in the world to be exact. That's according to Moody's and S&amp;P, which both weighed in on the merger today. Talking about Comcast's new Fox bid, Moody's said that while the combined company could have more than $170 billion in debt, the combined entities are also expected to generate considerable free cash flows \"which we believe would be sufficient to repay debt maturities as they come due, resulting in minimal capital market risk after closing if successful.\" Not such a big if, after the AT&amp;T-Time Warner bid was given the green light by regulators, but still something to note as \"secular pressures on linear pay TV and slowing cable industry growth\" could make things tough for Comcast in the future without this bump in cash flows. Conversely, Disney faces much less risk to its balance sheet, since its offer for Fox is in equity.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This is an excerpt from \"In Case You Missed It,\" a daily newsletter brought to you by TheStreet.  .</emphasis><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSC-14622943</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SJS-5YV1-F00X-J107-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">220623</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"491\"/><timeReceived>8:00 PM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc.

And Beyond Sport Global  Ambassador, FOX News Contributor, John Layfield back with us.  Good to see  you.  </p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  It's great to be here this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome.  Good morning.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, WALL STREET JOURNAL CHIEF ECONOMICS CORRESPONDENT:  Great  to be here.  Good morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Good morning Maria.  Born and raised New York  City, a lot of New Yorkers are very, very upset about the fact that this is  the third homegrown terrorist to inflict pain and suffering on New Yorkers  and others in the last 14 months.  And what are they doing about it?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  New York is -- has become not safe -- not safe as we thought.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  We took it for granted that there was no terror attack on the  city after 9/11 for many, many years but three and fourteen months, two in  less than two months, something has to be done.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, pretty incredible there.  also our top story on taxes,  this provision that we talked about yesterday in terms of individual  investors having to sell their big winners to get a bigger tax bill.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well this points to a problem I think a lot of investors and  individuals face as we go into year-end.  They're about to completely  overhaul the tax code and there's going to be about a week left to respond  if you want to get -- if you want to affect your 2017 taxes.</p><p>This is what you're talking about is changing the accounting for how you do  -- how you account for sales on -- gains on stock sales.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, a lot of changes there.  And we still don't have a  definitive idea of what this new plan will look like as they continue in  the conference.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not a reform, you're making it more complicated. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will talk about all that this morning.  Coming up, joining  the conversation, Former AOL Co-Founder, Revolution Chairman and CEO, Steve  Case is with us this morning.  House Homeland Security Committee Member and  New York Congressman, Peter King joins us.  And Entrepreneur Inventor, Joy  Mangano is here this this morning.  </p><p>You don't want to miss moments of it so do stay with us for a big show.  We  kick it off right here with this top story this hour, the Alabama Senate  race now goes to the voters.  Republican Senate Candidate Roy Moore and  Democratic Candidate Doug Jones laid out their closing arguments yesterday  in stops across the states.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MOORE:  Wrap in neck in people that don't want change in Washington, D.C.,  they want to keep it the same, keep their power, keep their prestige, and  keep their position and we got to change that.  If you don't believe in my  character, don't vote for me.  </p><p>DOUG:  Listen to people like Richard Shelby who has been a leader in this  state for four decades, he's been a state senator, he's been a member of  Congress, a United States senator, he can't vote for Roy Moore, he didn't  for Moore.</p><p>Said it would be bad for the Senate and would be bad for the image of the  State of Alabama.  I think in order to attract businesses to this state,  you've got to have a decent image.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Though the race is tied in some polls, the latest FOX News poll  puts Jones 10 points ahead of Moore who has been accused of sexual  misconduct against teenage girls when he was in his 30s.  Moore has denied  those allegations.  </p><p>Joining us right now to weigh in from Washington is House Freedom Caucus  Member, National Security Subcommittee Chairman, Congressman Ron DeSantis  of Florida.  Congressman, good to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>REP. RON DESANTIS, (R-FL) HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS MEMBER:  Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Do you think Alabama voters elected democrat today?</p><p>DESANTIS:  Well I think under normal circumstances the answer to that would  be absolutely not especially a very liberal democrat which Jones is and  he's not a good fit for the state.  Obviously these are different  circumstances.</p><p>And I was able to go down to Pensacola with the president this weekend and  I think he's looking at it just from a perspective of math in the Senate.   I mean you have 52 republicans right now, there's probably a handful of  them who are not reliable supporters for his agenda.</p><p>So getting to that 50 and 51 when you're doing reconciliation as we saw  with healthcare and the tax bill is a struggle and I think he sees if we go  down to 51 then man, you just lose any one senator can kind of dictate  this.   And so I think he wants to beef up the numbers, not lose the  numbers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I understand.  But do you want to do that with somebody  who you're not sure has molested young girls.</p><p>DESANTIS:  Well obviously it's -- when you're talking about these campaigns  and things happen decades ago, it's difficult.  I mean, I don't know, I've  read some of the articles, I've listened to his denials.</p><p>I mean, I don't know what to make of it.  I think he -- the Senate's being  clear, he's going to have to face some investigation where that goes if he  ends up getting elected.  I guess, we'll just have to see.  But it's going  to be he'll either not win or win, it will be a stormy first part of his  tenure.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's for sure.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  This is John Layfield.  Look, there's a difference between  campaigns and pedophilia.  I mean this is ridiculous how bad these  allegations are.</p><p>And do you really want to elect somebody who just going to go straight into  a House Ethics Committee investigation?  Shouldn't you done some  investigation and find out if there's any (INAUDIBLE) to these claims first  because you were opening up a terrible, terrible president if these  allegations are true.</p><p>This is beyond despicable if this is true and especially if it's true and  these guys -- these republicans are backing this guy.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well we need some due process though.  I mean, let's --</p><p>LAYFIELD:  We do need due process.  We need all the due process but the  allegations are so horrific that something should be done I believe before  this gentleman gets elected and if they're not sure, bring it out.  And if  they are sure, then he shouldn't be running.</p><p>DESANTIS:  Well it's interesting, I got involved in the Alabama race and  favor one of my colleagues Mo Brooks, he's a conservative congressman, has  a really strong record.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  That's right.</p><p>DESANTIS:  And had Mo been the nominee, you guys wouldn't be talking about  the Alabama Senate race.  The question would be whether he wins by 20 or  30.  And so I thought Mo had what it took and I thought he would have done  a good job.</p><p>And unfortunately he didn't make it to where we are right now but I saw it  pretty clearly from the beginning. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Congressman, I want to turn the conversation to taxes, there's  an important conference committee going on now in Washington, are we going  to see a compromise between the House and the Senate by the end of the  week?</p><p>And if so, what are the big change -- what's going to win out?  What are  going to be some of the big changes that come out of that?</p><p>DESANTIS:  Well this thing is very secretive, it's kind of like the college  of cardinals, I'm waiting for the black smoke to start to puff in.  Have  tax bill and maybe we'll get it, maybe we won't.  I don't know, I hope so.</p><p>The rumors are that we will but I don't have any firsthand knowledge of  that.  I think it's pretty clear we're going to get something by the end of  the year and I've always said that if we end up not being able to come to  an agreement in the conference committee then the default would be that the  House will pass the Senate Bill.</p><p>I think as you guys pointed out in the opening, there's some things that  are going to need to change in that if it's not done in the conference.  So  hopefully they can take care of some of those things like the first in,  first out in the conference committee and give us the product that we can  run on.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Because the Senate -- do you want -- as the Freedom  Caucus Member, do you want to just take the Senate plan as it is?  You want  the House to just accept the Senate plan because there's some things in  that plan.  Yesterday we were talking about a hundred percent tax. </p><p>DESANTIS:  Yes.  No, I don't.  But I'm just saying people say are you going  to get a bill and I say the worst case scenario would be that this House  would then pass the Senate Bill.  I don't see a scenario where we wouldn't  pass anything.</p><p>But you're right, you have the corky marginal rate in the Senate Bill for  some taxpayers, the first in, first out.  So there were some things that I  think --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But that's going to go away you think?  Does that go away this  week?</p><p>DESANTIS:  It has to go away.  I mean it's just bad.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Is that a lot of time to work with though, is there?  I mean  we're talking about getting all this done in just a few days.</p><p>DESANTIS:  Well there's a lot of similarities between the bills and  obviously there's some key differences.</p><p>The thing about the House Bill is we did not include the individual mandate  repeal.  I think we should have because that would have freed up about $340  billion extra and we came under the $1.5 trillion.</p><p>So you got about $400 billion you could have played with and I think you  could have really lowered tax rates with that and then I think our bill  would be the bill that people would say, \"We should do more like the  House.\"</p><p>The problem is by not doing that, if you run the numbers for middle income  taxpayers, the Senate Bill is better than the House Bill and so I think we  let some stuff on the field there.  But, yes, I mean you can -- I think you  can work it out.  </p><p>I think we're better on the business side, I think the Senate is better on  the individual side except for some of the corks that we mentioned.  So get  that done and then let's get something on the president's desk either this  week or next week.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We want to turn to national security right now, we are learning  the suspect in yesterday's attack in New York City came to the United  States from Bangladesh back in 2011 on a visa for children of siblings of  U.S. citizens.</p><p>So the White House says he would not have been on U.S. soil if the  president's immigration policy have been implemented.  Listen to this  Congressman.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  The president is  certainly concerned that Congress, particularly democrats have failed to  take action in some places where we feel we could have prevented this.</p><p>Specifically the president's policy has called for an into chain migration  and if that had been in place, that would have prevented this individual  from coming to United States.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman, what do you think, the president's immigration  policies, could that have prevented this?</p><p>DESANTIS:  Well in each individual case.  I mean you can argue but I think  as a whole clearly if you got rid of chain migration, if you were tougher  on some of the visas where people come over like the fiance visa for the  San Bernardino killer, you would prevent people from being here who are apt  to commit these things.</p><p>And here's a deal, this guy was a suicide bomber or would be suicide  bomber.  You have somebody who is willing to commit suicide to do a lot of  damage, it's very difficult to prevent that.  I mean it's easier to prevent  something if there's a ring of people that want to commit terrorism but  they may not necessarily want to commit suicide.</p><p>When you have the suicide bombers, once they're here, it's kind of a  ticking time bomb.  So I think preventing them from coming here, I think  that's got to be one part of a strong national security strategy.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well Congressman, what about actually surveilling these  neighborhoods because New York City has felt great pressure from the left  and civil liberties groups.  There was a report in 2007 about the homegrown  threat and radicalization in the west.</p><p>Again, backlash because it was called religious profiling and then the NYPD  used to have a demographics unit that would surveil Muslim neighborhoods  and mosques, looking for individuals, potential terrorists about how they  might seek underground black market employment or places to live, again,  shutdown because of pressure from the left.</p><p>And I think that every New Yorker has to be asking today and every American  citizen what are you doing to follow these individuals who were in this  country who were being radicalized.  The family of this individual was  upset with how some family members were treated by the police.</p><p>We have every right to be upset with the fact that nobody who knew this man  stepped up and said, \"Hey, he might be radicalized.  He might be planning a  terror attack.  He might be building a pipe bomb.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.  </p><p>DESANTIS:  Yes look, I mean that when there's reason to believe that  there's problems, I don't think you could be blinded by political  correctness.  I think you just have to face it.  Now, we're lucky we don't  have quite the problem Europe does.</p><p>I mean in Europe, you have certain communities that are very insular and  had a really breeding grounds for militant Islamic beliefs and then that  does lead to some of these guys to commit brutal acts of terrorism.  </p><p>In the U.S. we're not at that point but obviously if we are going to be  politically correct and if we're not going to deal with our immigration, we  can move further in that direction and that's not going to make the country  more secure.</p><p>And, yes, places like New York City are just going to be ground zero for  some of these people because it's such a symbol of American freedom.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Congressman real quick, a senior justice department official  who was demoted last week for concealing his meanings with people behind  the anti-Trump dossier had even close ties to Fusion GPS.  </p><p>FOX News is reporting that, of course, the firm behind the document, FOX  News is now confirming that that agent's wife actually worked for Fusion  GPS during the 2016 election.  What's going in terms of getting to the  bottom, what went on with Fusion GPS, Hillary Clinton, where is that  investigation Congressman?</p><p>DESANTIS:  So we have the Deputy Attorney General coming to the Judiciary  Committee tomorrow, Rod Rosenstein, he's going to have to answer all these  questions.  Christopher Wray would not provide a lot of the information,  the FBI Director.</p><p>If Rosenstein doesn't provide us the information we need then we are going  to move to cite him and Christopher Wray with contempt.  Maria, this whole  Trump-Russia thing wreaks of politics, you have collusion between the FBI,  potentially DOJ.</p><p>The Democratic Party and Fusion GPS for this dossier and this surveillance,  this thing stinks to high heaven, you look at the Mueller investigation,  it's like bringing in the legal department of the democratic national  committee.  They're all liberal democrats, they're partisan, this thing is  just out of control.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Congressman, we've had 21 special investigations since President  Carter, only twice has the (INAUDIBLE) person have been indicted.  Do you  think you're going to get to the bottom of this?</p><p>DESANTIS:  Well first of all, there's been no evidence of collusion, it's  about we're supposed to get to the bottom of, where is the collusion  evidence?  It's not there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Congressman, thanks so much.  We appreciate it.  We'll be  watching the developments.  Congressman Ron DeSantis.  </p><p>DESANTIS:  Thank you. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Uber and Lyft under fire this morning for  charging passengers extra money in the hours after yesterday's terrorist  bombing in New York, incredible.  Cheryl Casone with the details, Cheryl --</p><p>CASONE:  Yes Maria.  So Uber and Lyft are coughing up refunds to passengers  who got slapped with surge pricing as they tried to get into cars to flee  the Port Authority bombing yesterday.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of the blast especially which completely shut  down the Time Square subway station, users got hit with fares that were  jacked up two and a half times normal rates.  Surging occurs automatically  when there's increase demand in one area.  Both companies say they disabled  it within minutes of reading news of the explosion.  </p><p>Well a blow to President Trump, transgender recruits are going to be  allowed to enlist in the military beginning January 1st.  This after three  federal courts including one yesterday in Washington State ruled against  the president's order to ban transgender individuals from the military.   The Justice Department appealing the ruling to a Federal Appeals Courts.</p><p>Well a big retail deal I'll tell you about this morning, Francis Unibail- Rodamco is buying shopping mall operator Westfield for $15.7 billion in  cash and stock  So Westfield owns and operates about 35 shopping centers  here in the United States and in the U.K.</p><p>But this really shows the consolidation of global retailers.  Amazon and  online shopping obviously a huge threat.  Westfield shares down slightly  for the year.</p><p>Well, President Trump laying out an ambitious plan to get the United States  back to the moon and one day maybe Mars vowing that the United States will  remain a leader in space exploration. He signed the space policy Directive  One which establishes a foundation for a mission to the moon with an eye on  eventually going to Mars.</p><p>Former Lunar Astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Harrison Schmitt and current  astronaut Peggy Whitson join the president for the signing ceremony that  you're watching there on your screen.  And those are your headlines Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Interesting stuff Cheryl, thank you.  Coming up,  lawmakers are busier than Santa this year trying to deliver a tax plan by  Christmas.  We breakdown some of the possible hurdles, next.</p><p>And then ring the alarm, Beyonce fires back at a company that's using her  name for a brand of beer.  Back in a moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Let's take a look at the latest on Capitol Hill,  Christmas just two weeks away.  Lawmakers are eager to move the tax reform  bill along.  Heavy hitters on Wall Street including J.P. Morgan and Citi  Group have rallied on news of progress with this bill.</p><p>Many of you, the banks is one of the clearest beneficiaries of this tax  reform bill.  Want to bring in Research and Bank Analyst at Vertical Group,  Dick Bovey.  Dick, good to see you, thanks so much for joining us.  </p><p>DICK BOVE, RESEARCH AND BANK ANALYST, VERTICAL GROUP:  Thank you Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I know that you have an important report out on Fannie May  and Freddie Mac that government sponsored entities and the impact there.   So let's get to that in a second.</p><p>First though, broadly speaking, what is the tax reform implication for the  financial services sector in your view?</p><p>BOVE:  Well it's extraordinarily positive because the average bank in the  United States pays an interest rate -- I'm sorry, tax rate of 31 percent  and if they tie it to 22 percent, if you do the math, it immediately jumps  the earnings of the banks up by 16 to 18 percent.  So it would suggest that  these stocks are relatively cheap.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Okay.  So the banks then, you've got -- basically the banks  going to see 16 to 18 percent earnings growth just on the tax plan?</p><p>BOVE:  Yes.  In other words, simple math.  If you're paying 31 percent,  let's say you're paying $31.00 on every $100 of earnings that you have and  it now drops to $20.00 on every $100 of earnings that you have, you've made  a profit of $11.00 simply because of the tax cut.</p><p>And as you divide the $11.00 by the $31.00 you've got a nice 16 to 18  percent increase in your earnings simply because of the tax cut.  And there  are other benefits that will come in because there are certain tax benefits  which this bill still allows the banks to have like on low income  multifamily housing.  So the tax bill is wonderful for the banking  industry. </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Dick, the Senate version of this bill has a provision called  first in, first out where individuals who sell stocks have to sell their  oldest stocks first which could cause big capital gains hits for them.</p><p>Financial institutions who do this, mutual funds for instance don't have to  pay -- go by that same first in, first out provision.  Is that fair that  big financial institutions don't have to follow this provision that's going  to hurt individual investors?  </p><p>BOVE:  Depends on whether you're invested in them or not.  In other words,  from my perspective, rather than getting involved in the morality of the  bill, I'm just looking at what the bill says.</p><p>In the instance of these large financial institutions, everything has moved  in their favor.  In other words, in the last 12 months they've changed  their leadership of the financial stability oversight council and eight of  the ten people who are directors there were changed.</p><p>You got a new leader at the Fed, five of the seven chairs there will  change, new leader of the FBIC, new leader at the OCC, new leader at the  NCOA.  You got two out of the three people at the CFDC changing, new leader  at the CFPB, new leader coming in at the FHFA.</p><p>You have done for the first time ever changed every one of the leaders of  every one of the bank regulatory industries, back regulatory agencies in  the United States and that's going to be really, really good for the banks.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Dick, if we take out the private activity bonds which you have  in one version, does this hurt significantly the infrastructure bill that  the president wants to get passed?</p><p>BOVE:  Well I'm not an expert on the bill.  I've read the Senate version,  I've read the House version and I -- it's very hard for me to project what  is ultimately going to be the rate that the banks pay on what they do.  And  I'm not sure that I can answer that question.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well what about the Fannie May report that you just wrote?   Dick, you say that the GOP tax reform bill will force Fannie May and  Freddie Mac to seek money from the Treasury after wiping out their equity,  explain this please.</p><p>BOVE:  Well first off, Fannie May and Freddie Mac are companies which have  no equity, right?  In other words, if we just say Fannie May alone their  common equity is -$132 billion.  If we look at their total equity and if we  would do a proper accounting, their equity is negative -$9 billion.</p><p>All right.  If we do the tax cut which reduces the value of the deferred  tax asset, that will throw another $10 billion of negative equity on to  Fannie May.  So now you've got $19 billion in negative equity.  </p><p>At the -- in two weeks, two weeks from now, Fannie May is supposed to hand  over all of its capital to the U.S. Treasury which my belief is they're  going to refuse to do which is going to create somewhat of a conflict  between the Treasury and the FHFA.</p><p>So we go into the beginning of next year with a possibility that this  entity which has no equity, which has got negative equity is guaranteeing  $3.2 trillion worth of mortgages in the United States.  It's a (INAUDIBLE),  it's ridiculous.</p><p>In my view, Congress which has kept its nose out of this thing for the last  few years has got to come back in and something has to happen here.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Dick, isn't the equity the full faith and credit of the United  States government?  I mean it's not like these companies are going to stop  guaranteeing mortgage bonds because they've got the U.S. Treasury behind  them.  I mean do they even need equity in a situation like this? </p><p>BOVE:  They don't have the full faith in the United States government  behind them, that is an assumption that the market makes which is totally  incorrect.  There is no guarantee from the United States government that it  will back any of the debt of either one of the GSCs.  But they do have -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  But it did.  We had a financial crisis in 2007 to 2009 and  they got bailed out by the United States government.  I mean the proof is  in the pudding, isn't it?</p><p>BOVE:  Yes.  Well the assumption is there but the full faith in credit of  the United States government is definitely not there.  It is not there.   And that raises a different issue which is these are not legal investments.</p><p>These are mortgage backed security companies and therefore there's a whole  bunch of institutions which are required to buy legally backed investments  that own these things, that shouldn't be allowed to own them and they can  be sued for doing so if in fact the Congress says, \"We don't want it -- we  want to make sure that these bonds are okay.\"</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the shareholders were upset because under the Obama  Administration they took money from other places in the government -- I'm  sorry, they took money from Fannie and Freddie and they used it for other  places in the government which Steven MNuchin has confirmed.</p><p>BOVE:  Yes.  Well no, no.  (INAUDIBLE) about the fact that that's true.  I  mean even the highway bill takes money from Fannie and Freddie.  But what  is -- what is most, you know, important is, you know, the Trump  administration has this thing on a silver platter that they can hand to the  Democrats and embarrass the heck out of them because, basically, you know - - back, you know, in 2012 --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BOVE:  there was a report handed to the treasury saying these companies are  going to be profitable forever and the treasury immediately went out to the  public and said, we need to take over these companies because they are  losing money.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BOVE:  They lied.  They blatantly lied to the public.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  That's incredible.  Dick, thanks so much, we'll be  watching the developments here, great report.</p><p>BOVE:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Dick Bove joining us there.  Coming up, you may want to jump on  the Bitcoin bandwagon.  But the chairman of the SEC does not want you to  get taken for a ride.  His stern Bitcoin warning has Bitcoin prices lower  this morning.  We will tell you about it.  And then fame chef TV host Mario  Batali, on leave from The Chew and his restaurant empire after sexual  misconduct allegations, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us, happy Tuesday.  It is Tuesday, December 12th; your top  stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast, a red flag for Bitcoin  investors, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission warning  people about the risks of investing in a cryptocurrency.  </p><p>Broader markets this morning, well, we hit another record day on Wall  Street, yesterday.  Today, it looks like that extends.  Dow Industrials is  up another 20 points this morning, S&amp;P 500 also positive, the NASDAQ is  down a fraction.  Take a look at European indices, this morning.  We're  taking a look at live stories here.  The FT 100 is up a quarter of a  percent as is the CAC Quarante in Paris, the DAX Index is also higher by a  fraction.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were lower at the close, across the board  actually, worst performer was China.  Shanghai composite down one in a  quarter percent.  More bombshell sexual misconduct claims, celebrity chef  Mario Batali, now, stepping back from his empire after several women came  forward with allegations.  He is apologizing.</p><p>The Dallas Police Department facing a shortage of officers, why the city's  police chief says millennials are to blame.  And then a record price tag  for baggage fees, find out how much people spent to put their luggage on  board plus, Mattel, not playing around, the toy giant issues a warning of a  holiday sales.  Then one artist does not want people to be drunk in love.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Beyonce says she'll stick with lemonade, telling one brewer to  stop using her name in its beer.  All that coming up, but first, Bitcoin,  the hot topic from Wall Street to (INAUDIBLE) the cryptocurrency's wild  ride start of the year 1,000, got all the way up into the 20,000 range,  breaking 18,000.  What a wild ride.  A new warning, though, on investing in  Bitcoin this morning, the Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay  Clayton, raising the alarm for retail investors because Bitcoin is not  regulated by the agency.</p><p>In a statement yesterday, he writes this, there are tails of fortunes made  and dream to be made.  We are hearing the familiar refrain, this time is  different.  Uh-oh, when you hear this, time is different.  You get a little  nervous there, Jon, what do you make of the warning of the SEC chairman?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The irony of an SEC warning is, for people who are investing  in Bitcoin and crazy about the coin, that's exactly why they're crazy about  it because it can't be regulated.  It's outside of the regulatory system,  so I think they would look at something like that and say, you're proving  our point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Lawrence Baxter writes a piece in the Wall Street Journal today,  he's a law professor at Duke University, co-directs the global financial  market center.  He writes, I just have to read this, I want to rip it off  but it's just too good not to give him full credit for every word.  </p><p>At the first serious and likely coordinated move by governments to regulate  our bank, the digital currency, Bitcoin's price will crash to zero,  panicked owners will rush to exit and the bubble will burst.  Bitcoin  futures and options may just as well be based on pixies and ferries.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  I think the bubble will burst but I don't think it goes to zero.   Like, I don't --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You got to believe it's going to be regulated if this keeps up,  right?  I mean, but the Winklevoss twins (INAUDIBLE) regulated by the way,  but what were you saying?</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Look, you want to invest in a fiat currency, would you later  invest in Zimbabwe dollar or Venezuela Boulevard, which also fiat  currencies, are Bitcoin.  I don't think Bitcoin --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  But that's not a choice, John.  The choice is --</p><p>LAYFIELD:  When you talk about worthless currencies, fiat currencies  specifically, there's a lot of worthless currencies out there that are  being killed by hyperinflation.  Bitcoin is a bubble but there's a real  assets behind.  The real -- there's something real behind -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, it's called blockchain.  The technology will continue to  exist but maybe Bitcoin.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  We don't know that it's Bitcoin.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  But when you say that cryptocurrency is going to exist in the  future.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, but that's not -- the issue is, people betting on Bitcoin,  not --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  There are several cryptocurrencies.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Two dozen other cryptocurrencies that people are obsessed and  fixated and drunk in love, not drunk in love, but drunk in Bitcoin.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  My measure of whether there's something real to (INAUDIBLE)  the blockchain technology is really interesting is, are people buying and  selling real stuff with it, are you going out and doing your Christmas  shopping with Bitcoin?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, the Winklevoss twins are.  Yesterday, one of the  Winklevoss brothers told me that he bought Legos, and the other one said  that he -- oh, he bought tickets to go to space and that he said that  that's the only time --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's the perfect metaphor.  He bought tickets to go to  space.  Tell me where I can get that ticket.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  To go to space.  So I sat down with them yesterday.  They  explained why the cryptocurrency is not a fraud.  They said investors  should trust their currency exchange which is, of course, Gemini, watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TYLER WINKLEVOSS, CO-FOUNDER OF CONNECTU:  So Gemini's the world's most  regulated Bitcoin exchange, period, full stop.  We have surveillance.  We  have an information-sharing agreement with the CBOE.  They have it on  market surveillance.  We'll be doing cross-market surveillance.  So, we'll  be doing the same things that any other exchange as heavily regulated does,  and if someone does some funny business, then we will report them to the  appropriate regulatory bodies, so we are very confident that it'll be no  easier to manipulate Gemini or this contract than any other contract out in  the financial world.</p><p>CAMERON WINKLEVOSS, CO-FOUNDER OF CONNECTU:  So we think Bitcoin is gold  2.0, its store value and so today, it's about a $300 billion-dollar market  cap.  Gold is at $6 trillion.  So we think it could very well go up another  20 times from today, we have been saying this since when Bitcoin was a  billion-dollar market cap.  </p><p>We've been in Bitcoin for about five years, it's thrown about 300 times to  this point.  So, we think it's definitely realistic that it could grow and  disrupt gold and maybe even beyond that.  Bitcoin equals or surpasses gold,  so Bitcoin is -- gold is scarce, Bitcoin is actually fixed at 21 million.   Bitcoin's divisible to 100 million pieces.  It's way more portable, it's a  24/7 market.  I can send Bitcoin to you in your phone right now or anywhere  around the world, very easy to move.</p><p>T. WINKLEVOSS:  So, Gemini doesn't own Bitcoin --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, explain.</p><p>T.WINKLEVOSS:  in the sense that -- sort of, like, NASDAQ doesn't own  shares of Apple.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How many Bitcoins do you hold?</p><p>T. WINKLEVOSS:  We are not commenting on that.  We're, sort of, here to  talk about the Bitcoin features.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you sold any Bitcoin in your life, so far?</p><p>T. WINKLEVOSS:  We bought two things with Bitcoin in the past.  I think  Cameron bought some Legos.  We bought tickets to Virgin Galactic Space.   And unfortunately, we really overpaid because Bitcoin went up about 20 or  30 times and so we learned our lesson.  So, we don't spend our Bitcoin,  we're long-term holders of Bitcoin, we think it's a store value much more  than it's a currency.  </p><p>We think it's an amazing technology and for the first time, this Bitcoin --  this Bitcoin future's contract is the first of its kind in the world,  obviously, phase one, we thought of mainstreaming infrastructure was  building a regulated spot market like Gemini.  </p><p>Phase two is building more sophisticated financial products that allow Wall  Street institutions to get in.  The beauty of this contract is, you don't  have to touch Bitcoin to get Bitcoin exposure.  You buy it with cash and it  settles with cash at the Gemini 4:00 p.m. auction price.</p><p>And so, you can -- you know, you get in with cash, you get out with cash,  you get the exposure to Bitcoin without ever having to deal with it, to  store with it or even touch it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I really want to push back on the market cap thing because a lot  of Bitcoin enthusiasts and fanatics talk about, oh, its bigger market cap  than Citigroup or Visa.  That is a spurious comparison.  This is a --  essentially represents financial transactions, a market cap represents the  value of a business today and what people are willing to pay for its future  profits.  This isn't a business and this has no profits, Bitcoin.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a really important point.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  If you compare Visa, which the journal does today to Bitcoin,  let's do that, not in terms of market cap, there are about 340,000 Bitcoin  transactions every day.  There are 468 million Visa transactions every day,  that's a value comparison and that's why it's small potatoes.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Here's the problem that I have --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What I didn't like -- what I didn't like was the fact that he  would not tell us how many Bitcoins they own.  You can't say you're a  Bitcoin billionaire and then not say, oh, we're not commenting on how many  Bitcoin I own.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The problem that I have with this is, like, you listen to that  interview, and so much of it, frankly, sounds like a lot of mambo jumbo  store value.  Like, I can spend an hour taking that argument apart.  But  anyone out there listening to this, all they're thinking is, if I have  invested in this thing five years ago, I'd be rich right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's the only argument that people are listening to right  now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, another is, they see the move, and they say, well, iI just  got to get in it, no thought.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes, and all these nay-sayers like me are out there saying,  no, no, no, and then meanwhile, if you would actually ignore me and got out  and bought the thing, you'd be loaded.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  I think that's the bubble.  I agree if you completely  (INAUDIBLE) being a bubble, but I also think the cryptocurrencies have a  future and a special transaction fees.  I think we're going to see that but  it's going to be from the bottom-up, not from the top-down, like you see a  currency initiated.  This is going to come from retail stores and come up  once there's demand.  Unfortunately, the Virgin Galactic is not necessarily  the best example to use Bitcoin.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And then Cameron bought Legos.  OK.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's a great combination, Legos and space travel.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes, they're not running for office, clearly.  It's like, I  bought space --a trip to space.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's pretty funny, actually.  That is hilarious.  All right,  so, the consent is in, sell Bitcoin if you have it, that's the consensus </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sell it and get the heck out if you have it.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's not what I'm saying because if you had -- if you had  listened to that 10 years ago, you would be kicking yourself right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know, but, but, Jon.  I mean --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  But, but, but, yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  The question of Winklevoss twin should've been what point do you  sell it?  Because if (INAUDIBLE) with their forecast, they should know when  to sell it at some point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They said they are holding -- they are long-term holders.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I think you take a little tiny portfolio and you play with it  and then you just let it sit for a little while.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll take -- tell us what you think.  Send us a  tweet.  Coming up, Dallas has a shortage of those willing to protect and  serve.  Officials say millennials may be to blame for a police shortage.   And then Beyonce not behind the formation of beer, named in her honor.  You  got to hear the story, back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Happy Tuesday morning.  This morning, we are  looking at Futures indicating a mixed opening this morning.  Dow  Industrials up about 20 points right here, S&amp;P is higher but the NASDAQ is  lower by a fraction.  </p><p>A couple of names that we're watching that are on the move, Boeing  certainly one to watch.  The company raising its quarterly dividend by 20  percent to a $1.71 a share.  Boeing also announcing a new $18 billion share  repurchase program replacing the existing plan.  Shares of Boeing this  morning up one-and-a-half percent.  </p><p>We are watching Mattel.  The toymaker warning of week holiday sales just  two weeks before Christmas.  Mattel said that it expects gross sales to  decline by mid to high-single digits.  Shares of Mattel down better 45  percent this year alone.  </p><p>Another high-profile celebrity tripped up by charges of sexual misconduct.   Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now, Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes, Maria.  Celebrity Chef,  Mario Batali, is stepping down from his restaurant empire, following  accusation: he sexual harassed four women.  The women came forward to the  food Web site, Eater, alleging that Batali touched them inappropriately.   Batali issued a statement apologizing for his behavior saying he takes full  responsibility.  In response, though, ABC has suspended him from the show  \"The Chew\", and a food network show starring the chef has actually been put  on hold for now.  </p><p>Well, as the Dallas Police Department is working to make up for shortage of  police officers, the police chief is saying that millennials are partly to  blame for the problem.  Chief Renee Hall says, \"We have nights, weekends  and holidays, not attractive to millennials who wants all days off and to  be the chief in six months.\"  Kind of snarky there.  The City of Dallas  needs to hire about 250 officers during the next fiscal next.  </p><p>Well, baggage fees for the airline industry a hitting record last quarter.   The Department of Transportation says that passengers paid $1.2 billion.   That's up about 10 percent from the same time last year.  </p><p>And forget the ring, the queen herself, Beyonce, putting the copyright  claim on it.  Beyonce's lawyers are asking a brewery in Brooklyn to stop  selling their Beyonce-inspired (INAUDIBLE) that they call Bieryance.  The  owner says she was really disappointed that, you know, that she didn't take  the beer as a compliment.  She says, she was inspired to create it after  she missed a Beyonce concert, and that she's also a big fan of Beyonce.   And those are your headlines.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Thanks, Cheryl.  </p><p>CASONE:  You bet. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Coming up, the record market rally continues where you might  want to allocate funds now?  We're taking a look at market in investing  right after this short break.  We'll also take a look at small investors as  it relates to the tax bill.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Bitcoin buzz.  Futures of the cryptocurrency  started trading yesterday and they soared but futures are pulling back this  morning.  Take a look, joining us right now to talk markets is Sean O'Hara,  he is President of Pacer ETFs.  Good to see you, Sean. </p><p>SEAN O'HARA, PRESIDENT, PACER ETFS:  Thanks, Maria, for having me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you would have -- you think that there will be a Bitcoin  ETF?  </p><p>O'HARA:  I think there're several filed.  I think on the physical side, I  think there's a challenge.  You know, you have to be able to custody  something to be a fund in the ETF world.  And so, I think that will be the  challenge for that.  And then, I think if they ever past registration and  they have a listing standards issue, It's more likely you'll see something  in the futures area, which is right for challenges, as you know, because of  the price of future disconnects from the spot price.  And you get these  things we'd like to call contained going backwardization, and so you could  actually get the bet right and the direction of the underwire but still not  make money.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let's move on to just the broader markets here,  because we're looking at our market that is obviously in record-setting  territory once again, $6 trillion in market value gain.  What are you  seeing in terms of your clients right now?  Are they still bullish?  Where  are they putting their money?  </p><p>O'HARA:  This is my birthday today, by the way.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Happy Birthday, Sean O'Hara.</p><p>O'HARA:  I have a great birthday gift this morning.  Our AUM doubled from  today as from last year, so we got a pretty good year.  I think the money  is flowing into protection strategy --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  One-and-a-half billion AUM?  </p><p>O'HARA:  Yes.  About just a little under 1.5 billion.  The protection  strategy is that we offer the (INAUDIBLE) has been doing very well.  We've  seen a shift away from U.S. a little bit into international.  So, we have a  product based on Europe and global product with nice dividend attached to  it -- that's gathered some assets.  I think evaluation's in the U.S.  I  think there are ways to find bargains in the U.S.  If you look at like a  Land Researcher or Microsoft, which are two holdings in one of our ETFs.   You know, Microsoft trades at a reasonable evaluation, they generate $31  billion for the free cash.  They just raised dividend, 10 percent.  If you  really want to back to the Bitcoin conversation in play, buy technology  names to invest in, speculate in the other thing.  And so, use -- buy chips  and storage, if you will, as opposed to Bitcoins.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  You've been in finance for quite some time now.  </p><p>O'HARA:  Do I look that old?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  When you look at what's going on --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>O'HARA:  I'm sorry.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Does it look like a bubble, and what do you tell investors  about how to play it?  </p><p>O'HARA:  Of course, it looks like a bubble.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you talking about Bitcoin or the market?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Bitcoin.  </p><p>O'HARA:  Yes, I think that's the assumption that I made.  Of course, it  looks like a bubble.  It's kind of silly if you think about it.  I was  thinking about connecting the millennials and Winklevoss in Bitcoin.  And  so, you have these theoretical millennial billionaires who made this money  on bit point.  And the two things they buy or Legos in a ride on a  spaceship.  We're doomed if that's what the future looks like.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  To their credit, they do have a legitimate business that they're  really promoting.  It is a Bitcoin exchange.  And the pricing on the CBOE  Futures is based on the pricing done by Gemini.  So, that's -- I mean,  that's different.  They're betting on it but they're trying to make it an  established asset.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  </p><p>O'HARA:  My analogy was in the gold rush in 1850s, the people who really  made the money were the dry goods store.  And so, they are the equivalent  of dry goods provider today, as are the technology names.  And so, rather - - </p><p>HILSENRATH:  So, you're saying we got to be prepared to work for it and not  expect to get loaded overnight.  </p><p>O'HARA:  Exactly.  And I think that's the allure.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Sean, before you go, we got the Fed meeting today.  The two-day  meeting kicks off today -- today and tomorrow.  Feds' expected to raise  rates tomorrow, impact?  </p><p>O'HARA:  I think negligible.  I think what will happen with the fed is I  think they'll look at wage growth as opposed to other things to determine  whether or not they see inflation bubbling up.  And I think that's the only  real way you get any wage growth.  You know, there's this thing called  Morris Law in technology that is driven down the price of technology over  years.  There's a Morris Law for inflation taking place because of the  technology that maybe muting inflation.  And so, the real enemy of the Fed  is to try to tamp down inflations, and so I think they'll be cautious as  they look at that.  If we get some good-solid wage growth, which everybody  hopes, then I think they'll look more aggressively with raise rates.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Sean, I think you look good on your birthday, by the way.  </p><p>O'HARA:  Thank you very much.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Happy Birthday.  Dividend stocks have in been the factor bombs  because of low-interest rates.  Do you see that changing significantly with  the interest rating going up?  </p><p>O'HARA:  A little bit.  I think, you know, there is great yield out there,  there's a danger in buying high dividend paying stocks because they tend to  disappoint over time.  We would rather buy stocks in high free cash flow,  and free cash flow yield that pay dividends that can support them in  growth.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good analysis.  Sean O'Hara, good to see you, sir.</p><p>O'HARA:  Thank you very much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.

Good Tuesday morning, everybody.   Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Tuesday December 12th.</p><p>Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>The race is on in Alabama, polls open one hour from now.  Voters are  deciding between Republican Roy Moore and Democrat Doug Jones in the  highly-contested special election for the senate.  The very latest as each  candidate makes a last-ditch effort to drum up support.</p><p>Terrorism in New York -- authorities are searching for answers this morning  while Homeland Security reveals the Bangladeshi man suspected of detonating  a pipe bomb near New York City's port authority bus terminal entered the  United States through so-called chain migration.</p><p>The White House responded to the news saying that it would not have  happened under President Trump's immigration policy.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  This attack  underscores the need for Congress to work with the President on immigration  reforms that enhance our national security and public safety.  The  President is certainly concerned that Congress, particularly Democrats,  have failed to take action.</p><p>Specifically the President's policy has called for an end to chain  migration and if that had been in place, that would have prevented this  individual from coming to the United States.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We've got the very latest this morning from the scene coming  up.</p><p>Markets are mixed today.  Futures indicating a higher opening for the Dow  Industrials, up about 25 points right here.  S&amp;P 500 also up 1 point.  And  Nasdaq however is flat, negative by a point.</p><p>In Europe this morning, the major indices are higher across the board.  The  FT 100 up a fraction.  CAC 40 and the -- the CAC 40 is up a quarter of a  percent.  And the DAX index also up a fraction.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets were lower across the board, by the way, on the  heels of another record setter yesterday on Wall Street.  Shanghai  composite down one and a quarter percent.</p><p>Several former NFL stars hit with sexual misconduct allegations.  The  details as they are suspended from the NFL network.</p><p>And American Express says put the pen away -- why they are no longer  requiring signatures for purchases.</p><p>Plus users turning on Netflix as the streaming site reveals its top-watched  shows.  It also puts viewers on Blast for their binge-watching habits.  The  tweet that's sparking privacy concerns -- coming up.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to break it all  down: Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, the \"Wall Street Journal's\"  global economics editor Jon Hilsenrath; and Beyond Sport global ambassador,  Fox News contributor John Layfield.  Great to see you.</p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  It's great to be here.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Good  morning.  Great to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Good to be here with you.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Bitcoin -- that's the -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You're loving the bitcoin.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Yes, yes.  We can't stop talking about it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well -- </p><p>HILSENRATH:  $16,000.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I'm more into talking about the tax plan because I'm wondering  if this new provision in the Senate plan is going to create a selloff in  the stock market by year-end -- Jon.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, I think there's a real problem with year-end  tax planning right now because they're going to have a bill done in the  next week and a half and anyone who wants to position their 2017 taxes for  year-end, they don't know -- they are going to have a week to respond and  they're going to still be figuring out what's inside the bill.  There just  not a lot of time to work with here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there is this story in the Journal, right -- Dagen, about  the small investment community basically taking a look at this idea that  you have to sell your big winners first.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Top story in the Journal -- stock investors face  a new tax hit (ph).  This is the number one story that the Journal is  reporting.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Only Congress could turn simple math into calculus.  It was a  very simple tax policy and they -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It was simple.  What the heck happened?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  This provision that Dagen is talking about -- it's about first  in-first out, they only get $2 billion out of that over ten years.  It's  not clear why they need to do that when it's going to anger so many people.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we're going to talk about that this morning.  </p><p>And joining the conversation is AOL co-founder, Revolution chairman Steve  Case is here.  New York Congressman Pete King also joining the  conversation; and the inspiration of the acclaimed 2015 movie \"Joy\", the  self-made millionaire, inventor of the Miracle Mop Joy Mangano is with us  this morning.  You don't want to miss that.  We will find out her  entrepreneurial story.</p><p>But first our top story this hour.  The Alabama polls open one hour from  now.  Republican candidate Roy Moore, Democratic candidate Doug Jones  campaigned in Alabama yesterday in a last-ditch effort to gain support.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JUDGE ROY MOORE (R), ALABAMA SENATE CANDIDATE:  We are up our neck in  alligators.  We are up to neck in people that don't want change in  Washington, D.C.  They want to keep it the same, keep their power, keep  their prestige and keep their position.  And we've got to change that.  </p><p>DOUG JONES (D), ALABAMA SENATE CANDIDATE:  I'm not going to worry about the  fact that Roy Moore has been kicked out of office twice.  I'm not going to  worry about the fact that he took money from a charity.  And, you know  what, I believe those women in Etowah County but you know what, my party is  more important.</p><p>I am going to tell you, folks, it is time.  And I think we are going to see  it tomorrow.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining us right now from Washington is the \"Daily Caller\"  editor in chief Christopher Bedford.  Christopher -- good to see you.   Thanks for joining us this morning.  </p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR IN CHIEF, \"DAILY CALLER\":  Thanks for having  me.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  First topic -- your take on the Alabama Senate election?  </p><p>BEDFORD:  I think it's pretty hard to see Roy Moore not winning this  election today despite the fact he's had all these allegations that have  come out against him but voters there support him.  And you know, maybe if  the Democrats run a more conservative Democrat as opposed to someone who is  extremely liberal on abortion, on health care, on taxes -- they might have  had more of a fighting chance to unseat a Republican in this race.  But  it's really hard to see it.</p><p>And they are trying, though.  They are sending Barack Obama down.  They're  sending the former first lady down.  They're sending Cory Booker down.  A  lot of Democratic all-stars are going to try and change this but right now  the polls are generally, with a few outliers, looking like Roy Moore is  going to win.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Roy Moore -- I thought that it looked like Doug Jones was 10  points ahead according to a Fox News poll.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  I know, the Fox News poll was an interesting blast and everyone  has been talking about it for the last 24 hours.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>BEDFORD:  But if you look at the Real Clear Politics average of all the  polls, Roy is still holding up a few points ahead.  And that's the word I'm  getting on the ground and it's going to be wild if Fox News turns out to be  the outlier that makes everyone else look foolish in this crazy polling  world we have these days.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Christopher -- is part of this sentiment, you know, forget the  veracity of the claim, we don't have time to figure out if these  allegations are true.  Is part of this simply that you've seen in elections  in the western hemisphere like with Theresa May, with Brexit, with  President Trump -- people just don't like to be told what to do.  And is  that part of what's going on in Alabama?  </p><p>BEDFORD:  I think that's true.  The people in Alabama have really largely  been dismissed and attacked repeatedly by national news media and by  national political figures who sort of called them stupid or said how could  you support this bigot.  Or how could you support this molester?</p><p>And also places like the \"Washington Post\" and CNN have lost a lot of their  capital with Republican voters from years and years of unfair coverage even  just this last week of three massive retractions in the news.  Republican  voters and conservatives are less likely to believe them than ever.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, Christopher -- you're saying though if it wasn't the  \"Washington Post\" that broke the story about these women and their  allegations, that if it was some other publication who had done it, that it  would somehow have changed the way that people would vote in that state?  </p><p>BEDFORD:  It's possible.  You hear it repeatedly -- repeatedly, consider  the source.  I don't think that's necessarily always fair because the  source of these allegations are different women in the state of Alabama,  but since it's come out and especially after decades of not having come out  while Roy Moore has been a very public figure in Alabama, then the national  news media descends on the state, shows more interest in it than it has  since the 60s and they come out with all these allegations from people and  it comes from a source that's less trusted in the state, that definitely  hurt it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let me move on to what happened yesterday in New York.  New  York City is reeling from a bombing in Times Square.  The White House  responded to suspicion that the Bangladeshi suspect currently in custody  entered through U.S. chain migration.</p><p>This comes as Reuters is reporting that Bangladeshi police are questioning  the suspect's wife.  Christopher -- what's your take on this?</p><p>BEDFORD:  And it's not just chain migration, it's Donald Trump's other  bogeyman -- it's the diversity lottery.  The person who came in, came in  through a diversity lottery, a relative of his.  And this suspect here,  very likely suspect, since the pipe bomb went off in his pocket, was the  fourth removed family member to be able to -- the most distant removed  family member to be able to come through on this diversity lottery and then  through chain migration.</p><p>These kind of things, this is actually maybe almost a good thing for the  Republicans and for Donald Trump because it's the kind of terror attack  where no one was hurt except for the suspect.  We don't have a lose of  life.  You have someone who is clearly connected to ISIS and it makes too,  the President's point for him.</p><p>It's going to be difficult to defend this.  There are a lot of people on  the left that have been saying migration has got nothing to do with this.   Of course, it's got something to do with it, that's why he was here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  You would think so but you're not really hearing the  mainstream media connect the dots on that one.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Not yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, not yet.</p><p>Let me ask you about this dossier scandal because this is really something  that the \"Daily Caller\" has been doing such a good job on.  A senior  Justice Department official demoted for concealing meetings with the men  behind the anti-rump dossier, has personal ties to Fusion GPS.</p><p>This is a Fox News exclusive.  His wife worked for Fusion GPS in 2016  during the election.  Every day we get another point of conflict of  interest around this Russia probe, around Fusion GPS and Hillary Clinton.   Your take on this.</p><p>BEDFORD:  I wanted to withhold judgment for a while when it first came out  that a lot of these people at a point had donated to Democrats, a lot of  these investigators.  Because you want to say that these people are going  to do their jobs.  They're investigators.  They're professionals.</p><p>But every single day we are seeing more and more problems.  Or actually  it's actually -- Republicans are not getting answers in Congress when they  are asking the FBI, why weren't we told about this person with these  connections?  why do we have to find about this from the news media?  Why  is the FBI not reporting back to us about all of these conflict of  interests, really blatant ones.</p><p>I mean this guy was married to somebody at Fusion GPS.  That's a pretty  close connection right there.  And I think these kinds of things are going  to lead for a call for another special investigator and possibly Jeff  Sessions to appoint one to keep an eye on the investigators.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's not happening, though.  That's the thing.</p><p>I mean people want to see justice and that's -- what you're saying is still  not happening.  And there have been subpoenas out for information --  haven't there, Dagen -- from Congress.  There have been subpoenas out to  actually get information and there's stonewalling going on for years.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't know how do you -- how much taxpayer money though,  Chris, is it going to take to basically -- to use the President's phrase --  drain the swamp?  The more you find out about what goes to Washington, the  more disgusted the average American is about everybody in bed with everyone  -- you know, everybody in bed together.</p><p>There's back scratching and there's never any justice for the average  person.  There's never any conclusion that is satisfying to the taxpayer  who are footing these bills.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  One of the most annoying things you'll find about Washington,  D.C. is as soon as you go out and you go out for dinner or go out for a  drink, one of the first things someone asks you is so what do you do.</p><p>You don't get that in other cities because Washington, D.C. is so  interconnected, everyone is somehow working with everyone and they have an  interest in that.  The swamp is deeply connected with each other.  These  people have an active interest in keeping outsiders out of it.</p><p>And Donald Trump is actually causing massive disruption with these people.   It's causing chaos.  I mean all my neighbors' sons right now, they have all  this (INAUDIBLE) signaling about how they stand up and they were just  against Trump and let no man put hate in your heart.</p><p>Everyone around this city is resisting him.  And it's going to take a lot  of effort.  It's going to take a few years.  And I think we're going to see  a see a couple of fires, brush fires along the way before anything gets  done on the swamp.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So just to be clear.  Fusion GPS basically came up with  this dossier which was never verified and was a bunch garbage and that was  one of the justifications for wiretapping Donald Trump.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  That's what we're trying to figure out if that was one of the  justifications.  And right now what we are certain of is that it was full  of garbage that has caused massive disruption in the news media and then it  likely influenced the FBI and Department of Justice to move in on the Trump  administration.</p><p>And now we are finding out the FBI agents were intimately connected to it.   That does not look good for Mueller or his probe.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Well, one thing we do know is that Christopher Steele, the  former British intelligence agent who was paid by Fusion GPS and the  Democrats to work with Russians to put together this dossier that the FBI  was talking to him about putting him on the payroll.  We know that.  That  is a fact and that has been proven.</p><p>So, again, to Christopher's point -- is it going to be up to Bob Mueller  and his conflicted team?  I mean there are more conflict that we haven't  even covered today.  Is it going to fall to him to investigate the FBI  which he ran for 12 years?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How is he going to investigate the FBI, he ran it? </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And Jim Comey, his very close friend -- is it going to be up to  him and his team to investigate what went on with this dossier.  And to  Chris' point, you've got to have somebody else doing it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, we will see.  If we actually do get the special  prosecutor, another special prosecutor looking at it.  I don't know.  I  don't have a high expectation of that -- Chris.  But we'll see.</p><p>I want to get your take on this breaking news.  President Trump is tweeting  this morning.  Here is what he said.  \"Despite thousands of hours wasted  and many millions of dollars spent the Democrats have been unable to show  any collusion with Russia.  So now they are moving on to the false  accusations and fabricated stories of women who I don't know and/or have  never met.  Fake news.\"</p><p>Wow, the President coming up this morning, talking about the allegations  from the women who are trying to get a congressional investigation going  about inappropriate behavior, sexual inappropriate behavior.  Chris -- your  thoughts?  </p><p>BEDFORD:  It was wild to watch the White House press conference yesterday.   It was almost like it was coordinated amongst a blob of people who think  all the same.  We get a terror attack in New York.  We had tax reform  coming down.  We've got a special election tomorrow in Alabama.</p><p>And almost every one in the press wanted to talk about -- all they wanted  to talk about was these accusations.  The President so far has denied them.   Sarah Huckabee Sanders up there saying I speak for the President, the  President flat out denies this.</p><p>It does not mean it's not going to stop and when you see Democrats so  brutally cleaning out their own house of anyone who has been accused of any  kind of sexual misconduct, I see them as doing that to try and set  themselves up to retake the moral high ground and go hard after President  Trump over these accusations.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Well, Megyn Kelly had them on her show and then they did  a press conference after that.  You're right.  Christopher -- thank you.  </p><p>BEDFORD:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  We will see you soon, sir.  Christopher Bedford there.</p><p>Still ahead -- when it comes to a pen, you can leave home without it.  Why  American Express is ditching its signature requirements.</p><p>And then binge in the New Year -- Netflix revealing the most streamed shows  of 2017.  The surprising series that took the top spot.  Plus the new  privacy concerns sparked by a tweet from the streaming giant.</p><p>Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>When we told you yesterday about the outpouring of support for Tennessee  middle-schooler who went viral talking about bullying, now there are  questions about his mother's motives for posting that video.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details right now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Yes -- Maria.</p><p>So there were more than 22 million hits on Kimberly Jones' heartbreaking  footage of her son Keaton describing being called \"ugly\" at a school.   Someone even launched a go fund me campaign that raised more than $58,000.   But as attention spread so did interest in her.</p><p>She started her own go fund me page actually and then she slammed the  original fundraiser and they are questioning whether she's just trying to  make a quick buck off of her son.</p><p>Reports also began to emerge that she had posted multiple images of  confederate flags on her Facebook account.  Jones has since made her  Facebook page private.  </p><p>Well, American Express trying to stay competitive.  Starting next April,  the company will no longer require a signature regardless of the amount  you're spending.  Right now you have to sign for any purchase over $50.  Of  course, the latest credit cards have a computer chip for additional fraud  protection.  No signature required if you buy something online or on your  phone.  But it's been a strong year for American Express.  The stock is  actually up more than 30 percent.</p><p>Well, streamers that saw Netflix's tweet over the weekend were a little  creeped-out with how much the company seems to know about their viewing  habits.  Netflix tweeted this, \"To the 53 people who watched a Christmas  Prince every day for the past 18 days who hurt you question?\"  Well, the  tweet got a lot of laughs.  It was re-tweeted over 100,000 times but also  some backlash because viewers are thinking, hey, wait a minute, do I have  any privacy with you, maybe I don't.</p><p>All right, but all that viewership data proving useful to Netflix.  The  company has come up with its official \"shows we devoured\" list which means  a series was viewed more than two hours per day.</p><p>The list is surprisingly topped by -- this is interesting -- \"The True  Crime\" spoof \"American Vandal\".  Followed by the Brazilian series \"3  Percent;  the controversial \"13 Reasons Why\", \"Anne with an E\" and  \"Riverdale\".  The most popular streaming day in 2017 was actually New  Year's Day.  Netflix stock up sharply so far this year.</p><p>And no, Dagen -- \"Narcos\" wasn't on that list or \"The Crown\".</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Neither was \"House of Cards\".  </p><p>CASONE:  I don't know what to say.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have you seen any of those shows on that list -- Cheryl?</p><p>CASONE:  No.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Neither have I.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I haven't either.</p><p>CASONE:  What's wrong with me?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I haven't seen any of those shows.</p><p>CASONE:  Am I a nerd?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  How is that possible?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I don't know.  Something is deeply wrong with me.  I did.  I'm  almost done -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I have not seen any of it -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jon?  What are these shows?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'm almost done with the second season of \"The Crown\".  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How is it?  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  It's not as good as the first season, shall we say.  It's a lot  about Prince Philip -- kind of boring.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's like \"House of Cards\" -- it wasn't as good as it  got older.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  No.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  And now Foghorn Leghorn is gone.  I'm talking about Kevin  Spacey.</p><p>I'll say -- I'll say.  I'm Frank Underwood.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Is Foghorn Leghorn even around anymore?  What a great reference.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  I'll say - I'll say -- I'll say.  There you go.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, harassment there, then you have harassment scandals  hitting the NFL Network as well.</p><p>We'll take a break.</p><p>When we come back, the fallout after three of the network's analysts  received suspensions over new allegations there.</p><p>And then the Ball brothers making a fast break to an unexpected  destination.  Get this -- Lonzo Ball's two youngest sons are going pro just  weeks after UCLA suspended one for shoplifting on a trip to China.  When  the basketball players will be traveling to Lithuania -- that's next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Former NFL players are suspended from the NFL Network over sexual assault  allegations.</p><p>Jared Max with the story now -- Jared.  </p><p>JARED MAX, FOX NEWS SPORTS:  Maria -- good morning.</p><p>Hall of Fame running back Marshall Faulk, along with fellow NFL Network  analyst Heath Evans and Ike Taylor have been suspended by the NFL Network  after all three were named in sexual misconduct lawsuit by a former NFL  Network wardrobe stylist.  Jami Cantor who was with the company from 2006  until October 2016.  She filed a wrongful termination suit this October.   Yesterday filed a further complaint.  It alleges sexual harassment and  assault.</p><p>Cantor claims that Faulk groped and fondled her, inappropriate text  messages sent from the others.  In addition to inappropriate texts from  Donovan McNabb, former NFL quarterback and colleague of Cantor's at the  time plus NFL Network executive Eric Weinberger.</p><p>McNabb now with ESPN yet to receive potential punishment.  Weinberger,  president of \"The Ringer\" placed on indefinite leave.</p><p>Monday night football south Florida, Tom Brady going for ninth straight win  in ninth straight division title but very Brady celebration pre-empted by  the Miami Dolphins defense.</p><p>Brady intercepted twice by Xavien Howard last night.  Worst game for Brady  statistically in four seasons.  Jay Cutler three touchdowns for Miami which  held New England to 25 rushing yards and didn't allow the Patriots to  convert a single third down.  That hasn't happened in 26 years.  Dolphins  win it 27-20.</p><p>You know that old saying, if at first you don't succeed, at stealing Louis  Vuitton sunglasses on a basketball trip to China, then get suspended by  UCLA indefinitely -- try, try again to play ball in another country.</p><p>LiAngelo Ball and his younger brother LaMelo Ball are going to be playing  ball together.  The two younger brothers of L.A. Lakers rookie Lonzo Ball  and also the son of LaVar Ball have signed a one year contract to play for  a pro team in Lithuania called Prienu Vytautas.</p><p>LaMelo was only 16.  He was a junior in high school.  He dropped out.   LiAngelo ball is now 19 years old and probably in need of a new pair  sunglasses after that whole mess which became an international incident.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Lithuania.  </p><p>MAX:  Yes.  Yes.  And it's not really about money because they're not going  to paid that much.  There's reports that maybe guys make about $500 a  month.  Now you actually get a tax break certainly playing over there.  But  it's really about spreading the Big Baller brand.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Probably the last we're going to hear of them athletically.</p><p>MAX:  Boy, you wonder, they're still kids.  And the coach is said to be the  LaVar Ball of Lithuania.  I don't know that means.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- a buffoon that over-hypes himself.</p><p>MAX:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Hey, how is the Olympics?  Going high-tech.  Humanoid  robot Hubo just carried the 2018 Olympic flame.  Hubo was given the honor  yesterday in South Korea as part of the journey the torch will make before  the games start in February.  This is one of the 85 robot volunteers  assisting in the Winter Games.  Pretty cool.</p><p>MAX:  Maria -- he looks a little bit -- was it the movie \"Short Circuit\" I  think back in the 80s?  He looks a little bit or a little R2D2.  Check this  out.  There was new research from McKenzie (ph) that says that as much as  one-third of American workforce could be out of work of 2030 because of  automation.  That 400 million to 800 million people globally could be  displaced.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>MAX:  Maybe some of these robots should have some defects in them so we can  keep ourselves employed.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a real concern.  </p><p>MAX:  Yes.  I mean, you know, we laugh about it now but the next 17 year  what holds?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, it's incredible that they've come up with that -- that  it's 2030 that that's when they'll be that pervasive, robotics everywhere.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  I'm a little skeptical of arguments like that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You are?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  There were reports like that out ten years ago saying that all  of our jobs were going to be outsourced to India.  And you know, like  radiologists -- we still have plenty of radiologists.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But they're doing prostate cancer surgery robotically.  I mean  the robotics have been very important and a great growth story for health  care.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  It's very important but they're not taking away all the  doctors.  That's my point.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know that they are displacing doctors.  Exactly,  exactly.  Yes.</p><p>MAX:  Can they tell me who is going to win the Super Bowl?  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They might.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  You need a flux capacitor for that.  </p><p>MAX:  Exactly. -- 88 miles an hour.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  That's right.</p><p>MAX:  With Bill Belichick behind the wheel or answering questions from  reporters.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Nice \"Back to the Future\" reference -- and \"Back to the Future\"</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Thank you very much.  What happened with Tom Savage and the  concussion.  How did Houston Texas miss that?  </p><p>MAX:  Well, the NFL is really dropping the ball.  There's investigations  going on because the quarterback -- he shouldn't have been allowed to come  back into the game.  All of the concern of head safety.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  And so it was a missed concussion protocol.  They're talking  about revamping and they dismissed -- </p><p>MAX:  It seems like not everybody has their left hand and right hand  working together all the time.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, a lot of players game that system too, don't they.  They  get their baseline down so that when they do get hurt they don't get pulled  out.  </p><p>MAX:  It doesn't seem like it's all on the same page yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Jared -- thank you.

That's coming up.</p><p>And then merger mania, AT&amp;T gearing up for its federal fight over the deal  to acquire Time Warner.  We talk to AOL co-founder and Revolution chairman  Steve Case about what the wave of mega mergers means for the business.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us.  Happy Tuesday.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  It is Tuesday,  December 12th, your top stories right now 7:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>21st Century Fox looks like is losing a bidder for some of its assets.  The  Wall Street Journal reporting Comcast, Comcast is stepping down, no longer  pursuing a deal for key entertainment and media businesses, Disney is still  eyeing a deal.  It's anybody's guess if maybe Comcast steps away because  the deal with Disney is more likely.  The very latest on the major mania in  the media sector.</p><p>Futures this morning show markets will open higher.  Dow Industrials at the  high of the morning right here, up 40 points.  S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq also  higher by a fraction.</p><p>In Europe, similar story money moving into equities this morning, European  indices higher across the Board.  FT 100 up a quarter of a percent.  CAC  quarante up almost one half of a percent and the Dax Index up almost a  quarter of a percent.</p><p>In Asia overnight, different story.  Markets were lower across the board at  the close.  Worst performer, China.</p><p>We are watching oil prices this morning.  They are rising as a key European  pipeline was shut down for repairs.  Crude oil now at 58.41 a barrel.</p><p>A southwest flight was diverted over a cigarette.  Get this.  A passenger  caught smoking in the lavatory then he makes death threats to the entire  flight.  The story coming up.</p><p>And then Merriam Webster, out of its word of the year.  Find out the  dictionary's pick, coming up.  What do you think it might be?</p><p>Plus, a healthy way to eat Girl Scout cookies.  Yoplait now offering thin  mint-flavored yogurt.  All those stories coming up first this morning.</p><p>And first, our top story this half an hour.  Will mergers reshape the media  business?  According to the Wall Street Journal, Comcast confirmed  yesterday it is no longer in the race to pursue movie and television assets  from 21st Century Fox, leaving Disney as the only serious bidder.</p><p>Meanwhile, AT&amp;T gears up for its fight against the Department of Justice  over its bid to acquire Time Warner, they say, we want this and we're not  going to sell anything to get it.</p><p>Joining us this morning is AOL cofounder, former CEO, the current chairman  and CEO of Revolution, Steve Case.  Steve, it's good to see you.</p><p>STEVE CASE, CEO, REVOLUTION:  Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  And you were around when we  saw the last bout of last of mergers in media and telecom and that was  obviously a big move for a lot of these companies making these companies  bigger.  The $164 billion AOL-Time Warner merger was the largest in  history.</p><p>What do you make of the current M&amp;A climate?  What are you seeing out  there?</p><p>CASE:  Well, you say, it does feel like Deja Vu all over again.  It's a lot  of same discussions happened 20 years ago about the role of content versus  distribution.  Do you need to be integrated, in particular the battle back  then was the debate between this content king or distribution king.</p><p>It's pretty clear that the consumer is king and the platforms, the Amazon  or Netflix or Facebook that have direct connections to consumers are the  once that are advantage.  As a result, Disney is basically saying they're  going to pull back from Netflix and do their own direct to consumer  offering.  I think they're trying to bulk up, whether it'd be the Fox  assets or other assets to have a credible offering to go directly to  consumers.  So it's someway this is similar battles that we were hearing 20  years ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you think?  So you think the consumer is king, but once  again, people are really bidding up content, because -- look at Amazon  right now, it's a little different, and, by the way, I can't believe it was  20 years ago.  You're right.  It was 20 years ago.</p><p>Amazon willing to pay out billions and billions of dollars for original  content, is that where this is going?  Where people are going to start  doing more original content or using the sale of established content for  example Fox, the Simpsons, you know, so many great shows, this is us, among  those being talked about, is that where the value is?</p><p>CASE:  Well, I think the value as I said is with the services that have  direct to consumer offerings.  So, how do you bundle together something  that's credible which is a mix of brands and content people are already  familiar with as well as some original content.</p><p>Again, this is not a new idea.  HBO, 30 or 40 years ago really was  pioneering that highly leverage some of the movies that are already made  but invest in original content, Sopranos or other kinds of things to  differentiate.  So we're continuing to see that move forward.</p><p>So the only difference is now that there's a new companies that didn't  exist 20 years ago Netflix, Amazon, Facebook, et cetera, Apple as well  existed but wasn't really focused so much on media content.  So the battle  will continue, and the ones that really have that consumer connection,  direct consumer connection are likely going to be the winners.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Those companies have their own investment arm.  You look like  an Amazon, it's acquiring.  It's got an investment arm, acquiring  technology companies.</p><p>Let's talk about the fight over net neutrality.  I mean, Apple cofounder,  Steve Wozniak and the man known as the father of the internet, Vint Cerf  are leading a new push to prevent the FCC vote on Thursday.</p><p>The group of internet experts are calling on congress to stop the FCC from  overturning rules that prevent internet providers from throttling or  outright blocking online content.  Your thoughts.</p><p>CASE:  It is also as an old debate.  It's sort of like that.  Prince song  from 1999, the debates in the 90ss around open access.  Now the debate is  around net neutrality.  As a core, it's how do you play the internet as  platform for innovation particularly allow disruptive start-ups  entrepreneurs all over the country to start innovating and not just have  the incumbents kind of lockdown their elites.</p><p>So I'm very concerned about net neutrality.  I share the view of some of  the people who wrote this week saying we need to make sure that the  internet remains open for innovation and we err on side of making sure  things are tilted in favor of those disruptive, those entrepreneurs that  are really trying to launch new things not the existing incumbents trying  to kind of protect their lead.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And there's this push to invest in the heartland.  Your company  launching a $150-million fund, focused on investing in start-ups away from  the coast in the middle of the country.  This is really interesting,  especially when you look at backers including big names like Eric Schmidt,  Jeff Bezos, Meg Whitman, Howard Schultz.  Tell us what your thinking is and  these tries of the rest fund.</p><p>CASE:  Well, I think the -- well, there's great innovation in places like  Silicon Valley, and New York City, and Boston.  Right now, the vast  majority of venture capital goes to those cities.  Last year, 75 percent of  went to just three states, California, New York and Massachusetts.  So the  other 47 states, fight over 25 percent, yet there is great entrepreneurs  all over the country building great companies.</p><p>There is not a lot of venture capital attention.  So this Rise of the Rest,  we launched about four years ago.  It's now accelerating, as you mentioned.   We launched last week this new fund and we've got about three dozen of  Americas most iconic, respected entrepreneurs and investors, and  executives, and families all joining us saying they believe in the idea of  Rise of the Rest.  They believe there are great entrepreneurs everywhere.   They believe there are great investment opportunities everywhere and I hope  is what capitalize more focus on middle of the country start-ups and will  result in great breakout successes in those communities, also in the  process create a lot of jobs, and more hope in those communities.</p><p>A lot of people wake up in the morning, feeling like they're anxious about  the future.  They're not sure what the role of technology is going to be in  their family and their community.  I want to make sure, by backing startups  everywhere, they are creating jobs everywhere, that will really change that  dynamic.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's interesting because it's like you look around the world,  everybody wanted to be the Silicon Valley, right?  Even in Russia, they  created this culpable project and yet there are little mini Silicon Valleys  innovation hubs throughout the country.  You look at Biotech Upstate New  York.  There's all of these little hubs everywhere, where you actually can  tap into real innovation happening not necessarily just Silicon Valley.</p><p>CASE:  Absolutely.  And we've seen that we now there are 33 cities on a  rise.  The rest road trips that will three, three and a half years.  8,000  miles by bus, so we've been to places like Pittsburgh where a lot of great  things are happening with the robotics because of Carnegie-Mellon, buffalo,  some of the Biotech things that trade a lot of things around mobility New  Orleans.  A lot of things around Ag tech, Louisville and St. Louis around  Ag tech, farming.</p><p>We're seeing innovation happening all over the country.  We're trying to  change the dynamic on with this rise of the rest to make sure their  entrepreneurs in those places have access the capital to grow and scale  their companies.</p><p>It's long and understood that creativity is wildly dispersed.  Opportunity  is not and really trying to level the playing field so everybody,  everywhere who has an idea really has a shot at American dream.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Some of these companies though are more powerful than they ever  have been.  When you look at the big five, the FANG companies, right?   Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, they have so much power, given all of  the data, and the information that they have, about us, all.</p><p>Do you think the regulatory market changes the regulatory environment  changes for technology, given the fact that this is a completely different  industry, than just 10 years ago or five years ago, Steve?</p><p>CASE:  Yes, I think it's beginning to change.  We start seeing that the  last couple years in the European Union.   Brussels got a backing, has  starting to slow some of the things happening with some of the big tech,  and we're seeing a growing backlash in this country as well.</p><p>People are proud of what's happening in Silicon Valley, but also nervous  about some of the implications, and including here in Washington, D.C.,  there's a lot more focus obviously even some congressional committees  looking into what was the role of Facebook or other things even in the  election.</p><p>So it now become so much more central in terms of our everyday lives.  Had  such a big impact on our economy.  It's not surprising that there's more of  a focus on the role of big tech if you will.  And do I think Silicon Valley  needs to be careful.</p><p>Last decade, as you well know, Wall Street sort of been the bad guy, I  think Silicon Valley is at risk of becoming kind of the new bad guy where  people love some of the products and service that come from Silicon Valley.   They are a little nervous about some of the steps -- some companies in  Silicon Valley are taking.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what I was asking, because you know, in the last 10  years, we saw the financials basically sit on cash, they were unwilling to  do anything with their money, because they didn't know what regulation was  around the corner, then you had Dodd-Frank.  You wonder if that's going to  happen to the technology sector.  Now, they're the big spenders.  Will they  be the big spenders in the future if they've got congressional oversight  that's much tougher than they saw in the past?  And then, of course, Steve,  there's bitcoin.</p><p>So you're obviously a student of this industry for a long time 25 years,  even more.  What do you think of bitcoin, Steve?</p><p>CASE:  Well, I think it's exciting one though, but take this in their core  technologies around block chain.  But again, it does feel a little bit like  20 years ago where there's a phenomena, a mania almost around dotcom.  Now,  here's a little bit of a mania particularly on the trading side around  bitcoin and ICOs, things like that.</p><p>So think the core technology of block chain ability to track things I think  is very important, but I think there is a little bit too much speculation  right now and will be interesting to see how things settle.</p><p>I saw even yesterday, as he stepped in to stop ICO, an initial coin  offering that was happening and this idea that you can raise capital in an  unregulated way which has happened recently.  I don't think that is  sustainable.</p><p>So I think we have to separate what's happening in terms of the core  technologies like block chain and what's happening in terms of speculation,  around that, whether it be bitcoin and ICOs.  I think that we need to be a  little more careful than we've been in recent months around thinking about  that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Winklevoss brothers yesterday said that this is regulated  but I suspect if this action keeps up with bitcoin, it's going to be  regulated a lot more.</p><p>CASE:  I think it's no question.  It got talked about and I book in the  third.  There's next wave of industries and the role of policy regulations  playing a deeper role whether it'd be financial services or health care, or  some smart cities important aspects of our lives.  There's going to be more  regulations.</p><p>Entrepreneurs hate hearing that particularly in Silicon Valley, but I think  it's going to be true and we're going to see that with bitcoin as well,  there's no question, the regulators not just in this country but around the  world are going to make sure they have adequate protections in place to  make sure these technologies, these platforms can have a positive impact on  the market as opposed to kind of have potentially some unintended  consequences that could be negative.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great insights, Steve.  We'll be watching the Rise of the Rest  fund.  Always great to talk with you, sir.  Thank you.</p><p>CASE:  Thanks, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll see you soon.  Steve Case there.</p><p>Still ahead, smoking leads to a fiery confrontation on Southwest Airlines  flight.  A passenger threatens to kill everybody onboard after crews asked  her to put out her cigarette.  The frightening footage that ended in felony  charges.  That's next.</p><p>And then scouting for new flavors.  Yoplait teams up with Girl Scouts for a  twist on yogurt, back in a minute.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Breaking news right now.  San Francisco mayor,  Ed Lee has died.  Cheryl Casone with the story now.  Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE:  We're just getting some new details into this, Maria.  Lee died  early this morning, according to his office.  The \"San Francisco Examiner\"  says that Lee died after suffering a heart attack while shopping at a local  Safeway store near his home.  He was pronounced dead at Zuckerberg San  Francisco General Hospital early this morning.</p><p>Lee was a big supporter of San Francisco as sanctuary city.  He strongly  defended that controversial policy after Kate Steinle was murdered in 2015  by convicted felon who was deported five times.</p><p>Mayor Ed Lee dead at the age of 65.</p><p>Well, a 24-year-old woman has been arrested after she threatened to kill  passengers on a Southwest Airlines flight from Portland to Sacramento.   This happened after she was caught smoking in the airplane bathroom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  I swear if you don't -- I will -- kill everybody on  this -- plane.  I will kill everybody on this -- plane.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Well, she was physically restrained by crew and passengers until  the plane was able to safely land in Sacramento.</p><p>Well, amid the spike in reports of sexual assault and harassment in the  news lately, feminism is Merriam Webster's word of the year for 2017.  The  dictionary says the word was the top lookup throughout the year starting as  early as January during the women's march on Washington, shortly after the  inauguration.</p><p>Well Girl Scout cookies are not going to be available for a few months,  darn it.  But thankfully, Yoplait yogurt is coming out with something to  satisfy the cravings.  Girl Scout cookies that come in yogurt form.  Later  this month Yoplait is releasing new flavors inspired by the different  cookies, thin mint, peanut butter chocolate, and caramel coconut.  Yes,  please.  Those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  I'll take it.  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>Coming up next, AR, a reality?  We will talk to the company that succeeded  with augmented reality where major technology threatened to fail.  Wait  till you see this, next.</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  With the holiday shopping season in full swing,  now, one of the hottest gifts out there, is augmented and virtual reality  headsets.</p><p>The company has taking the lead in bringing AR glasses to the market is not  Google, by the way, it is a company based out of Rochester, New York  called, Vuzix.</p><p>So joining me right now is founder and CEO of Vuzix, Paul Travers.  Paul,  good to see you.</p><p>PAUL TRAVERS, CEO, VUZIX:  Maria, thanks for having us.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>So, how was Vuzix able to do what other huge tech companies were unable to  do for so many years in terms of glasses?  We want to look at the  spectacles here.</p><p>TRAVERS:  Well, all these other guys are making things that are massive  quite frankly and Vuzix makes lightweight wearable, all-day long kinds of  devices.  We started the enterprise.  We actually have to go all the way  back to the defense market.</p><p>The defense guys, Special Forces guys, asked if we could make Oakley-style  subclasses.  Nobody likes to look like a nerd when they put this stuff on.   If you look at VR market today, all these things are giant sort of -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They're really big on your head.  Let me check these out.  See  how light they are.  Can I try this on?</p><p>TRAVERS:  Yes, please do.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you have two models here on set.  This one is the M300?</p><p>TRAVERS:  That's actually the Blade.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Oh, this is -- OK.  So this is the Blade.</p><p>TRAVERS:  Yes.  And it's B to C and consumers, those kinds of things.  With  those glasses on, you want to take your phone out of your pocket?  Put  those glasses on, you'll be able to -- Sam, thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What I like is that I don't feel like a geek.</p><p>TRAVERS:  And you don't look like one either.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I don't know about that.  But tell me what this Blade does.</p><p>TRAVERS:  So with your phone in your pocket.  Imagine you're walking down  the street and there's a Pokemon Go character that's up to the right,  everybody knows Pokemon Go.  Millions of users in a week.  The Pokemon Go  character comes up, you look and through the glasses you see this character  sitting on a street or you're getting directions and the directions are in  your glasses.  A phone call comes in, you can answer with the glasses on.   It's beginnings of leaving your phone in your pocket.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  OK.  So I don't have to take my phone out with this.   This is going to show me -- let's do the other model. This one is the M300  Enterprise Class smart glasses.  This is for enterprise, tell us.  Put  those on.  Let me know what it's for.</p><p>TRAVERS:  That's correct.  So these guys are worn like this, around your  neck when you're in a warehouse situation that put glasses on, and this  becomes effectively the barcode scanner.  So instead of taking a handheld  barcode scanner, going over to the box -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Here, here's the barcode scanner.</p><p>TRAVERS:  Actually in this particular case, Sam, we're operationally --  well, let me actually run it here.  So I'm looking through these glasses  and you can see, this is nothing more than a blueprint.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ooh, look at the screen.</p><p>TRAVERS:  Through the glasses, you can see there's literally a multistory  building sitting here that's not real.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What we're seeing on that screen is what you're seeing in your  glasses?</p><p>TRAVERS:  That's correct.  That's correct.  So you can imagine so many  applications where this can become a valuable tool.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  you made the analogy earlier, if you're on a plane, on your --  unloading the baggage from a plane.</p><p>TRAVERS:  Yes.  We worked with folks like SATS at Changi Airport and they  have the gate folks wearing these glasses.  The pallet comes by, on the  side of pallet, a few barcode, barcode kind of a thing.  Through these  glasses you see all of the information about where that pallet goes on a  plane.  What section of the plane it belongs in.</p><p>If it doesn't belong on that plane, they will have a red marker on the  outside of it and just like this building that's not real or marker is not  real, but digitally, they can put it in remove it ad at the same time -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  They know where the baggage goes on the plane.</p><p>TRAVERS:  They can turn around a plane in one half, the amount of time  compared to how they do it today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's very cool.  So Vuzix recently entered into a supply  agreement with Toshiba.  Tell us about that.</p><p>TRAVERS:  I can tell you a little bit about that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Come on.</p><p>TRAVERS:  Well, it's very exciting for me, actually.  It's one of the  largest, probably orders that smart glasses have seen, quite frankly.   Toshiba is a major player in the laptop space.  They're coming out with a  line of products that are wearable, etch-oriented and they're buying smart  glasses from Vuzix.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really?  Cool stuff.</p><p>TRAVERS:  We learn a lot more about that here.  It's a multimillion-dollar  contract for Vuzix and sometime here in the first quarter, Toshiba will be  sharing a lot more.  What is the world and 3D?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I feel that if you don't have augmented reality or A.I. or some  sort, you're going to be left behind, because every industry is using it at  this point.</p><p>TRAVERS:  We have companies getting -- doing things 500 percent ROI, It's  really hard to ignore.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool stuff.  Paul, thank you so much.</p><p>TRAVERS:  You're welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see you, Paul from Vuzix there.</p><p>Still ahead, inventing inspiration.  We will talk to a self-made Joy  Mangano about her widely popular home shopping network empire.</p><p>And the acclaimed 2015 movie loosely based on her life, starring Jennifer  Lawrence.  Back in a minute.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Tuesday morning.  Welcome back, everybody.

Welcome, everybody.   Thank you so much for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday,  December 12.  The top stories right now, 8:00 A.M. in the East Coast,  decision day in Alabama.  Polls are open as voters decide between  Republican Roy Moore and Democrat Doug Jones in the highly contested  special election for the Senate.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When people in your own party say they won't vote for  you or support you, that's a big giveaway.  It's amazing at some point we  got to stop looking like idiots to the nation.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Politic is a person of destruction.  They tried to  destroy Donald Trump and they tried to destroy Roy Moore.  You saw how they  did this.  There's nothing too low for these people to do.  They don't know  a bottom, right?  When we go high, they only not go low.  There's no bottom  to how low they'll go.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The very latest as each candidate makes the last ditch effort  to drum up support coming up.  Terrorism in New York, authorities are  searching for answers this morning.  A Homeland Security has revealed that  the Bangladeshi man suspected of detonating a pipe bomb near New York  City's Port Authority's bus terminal yesterday.  He entered the United  States through chain migration.  The White House responded to the news  saying, it would not have happened under President Trump's immigration  policy.  We've got the very latest from the scene.  </p><p>Markets this morning are higher expecting a higher opening for the broader  averages.  This is the high of the morning right here, Dow Industrials up  51 points quarter of a percent higher, S&amp;P 500 is up a fraction, but the  NASDAQ is down a fraction.  In New York this morning, markets look like  this again higher across the board, for FT 100 up a quarter of a percent,  CAC Quarante up half of a percent, the DAX Index also higher.  In Asia  overnight, markets closed lower pretty much across the board.  China was  down one and a quarter percent, Nikkei Average down a third of a percent.  </p><p>Hack attack, the latest cybersecurity concerns as hackers reportedly get  away with millions from U.S. and Russian banks, and fill it up but with no  premium, why AAA is calling the fuel a waste of money.  All those stories  coming up this morning and joining me to talk all about it is Fox Business  Network is Dagen McDowell, the Wall Street Journal's Global Economic Editor  Jon Hilsenrath, and Beyond Sport Global ambassador, Fox News contributor  John Layfield is here, great to see you.</p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  It's great to be here.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Great show so far.  Yes.  I thought premium gasoline was the  way to go all the time, but, you know, we're being told otherwise.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN HOST:  Well, the car manufactures maybe were in cahoots  with the gasoline companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because it's more expensive.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Yes.  It's a great Gilmore expense and they always tell you to  put in your high-performance vehicles.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  It depends on what car you're driving.  My Corolla it doesn't  matter what you put in it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  It doesn't matter?  OK.  That sounds good.  All right.  Hey,  that's one of the safer cars out there, the Corolla, right?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  That's good -- that's good to hear.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.  Cool.  This stop story right now, polls are open in  Alabama.  We have a special live team coverage this morning across the  state.  Hillary Vaughn is covering Republican Roy Moore and Jeff Flock is  following Democratic candidate Doug Jones.  Let's take it up with you  Hillary in Montgomery, Alabama.  Good morning.  </p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FBN CORRESPONDENT:  Hey, good morning, Maria.  Polls have  been open for just three minutes.  We've already seen a few people go  inside and just a few hours as Judge Roy Moore and his wife, Kayla, will  ride on horseback to the polls to go vote.  This is something they do every  year when they vote.  Last night, Moore hit a stump for the first time in  days to face a crowd of about 200 gathered at a barn in Midland City,  Alabama.  Him and his wife took turns fighting back against negative  reports in the media.  Moore's wife, Kayla says that their lives have been  infiltrated and says that people who are behind the flurry of allegations  need to be held accountable.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  All this mess is going to be over tomorrow.  If you  don't believe in my character, don't vote for me.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  Moore was joined by band and his gang of conservatives to rally  Alabamians and remind them that Judge Roy Moore is the Republican pick, and  his opponent is a Democrat.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  You've been in business with them for 25 years, how  come we're not proud of it, right?  You were delegates for Obama.  How come  we not proud of that?  If, by the way, if you believe in it, embrace it.   Don't try to run to something different.  That's what he's doing.  And it's  never the issue is you never -- they never want to debate the issues  because they understand.  They debate the issues, they lose.  So they  always try to run as conservative as they can get.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUGHN:  There was a surprise guest last night, Captain Bills Daly who  served with Moore in Vietnam says he can vouch for Moore's character and I  was able to catch Moore on his way out from the event.  I said, I asked him  how he's feeling headed into Election Day.  Today, he told me he feels  wonderful.  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Bye, Hillary.  Thank you.  We will follow that, and, of course,  Jeff Flock is on the other side of town Birmingham, Alabama.  Jeff, how is  it going over there?</p><p>JEFF FLOCK, FBN  REPORTER:  Rockwood Baptist Church where Doug Jones lives.   It's a town in Mountain Brook.  It's a Birmingham suburb and that's where  he'll cast his vote and I'm thinking about, oh, maybe 25 minutes or so at  least that's what we're told, big campaign push last night, you know, Doug  Jones famously a federal prosecutor, you know, the president said he is  weak on crime while he was a federal prosecutor who secured the convictions  of two of the KKK members in the 1963 Birmingham Church bombing.  </p><p>He's also an avid hunter big supporter of the Second Amendment, so firing  back a bit at perception may be that he is not a moderate Democrat,  campaign with Charles Barkley last night.  It will be important to get the  black vote out.  Not -- a huge number of black folks in Alabama but those  seem to be fired up, we visited Selma yesterday and I'll tell you, the  community there is fired up for Doug Jones, Charles Barkley campaigning  with Doug Jones yesterday said I can't even believe Roy Moore is in this  race and essentially what this comes down to is an referendum on Roy Moore,  Doug Jones yesterday with Charles Barkley.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  This is partly a message.  It's a referendum not just  on the issues that we've got but it is -- it's who we are, and what we're  going to tell our daughters and is Alabama going to stand with our  daughters and our granddaughters that we will believe them, we will respect  them no matter when they come forward and just as important.  It's a  message to our sons that this kind of -- this kind of conduct is not  acceptable.  It is not acceptable in the halls of Congress and it's not  acceptable in the State of Alabama.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FLOCK:  He tweeted out last night, Maria, or I think this morning actually  earlier this morning, we are on the right side of history.  We'll see which  side history comes down on today, big turnout expected at this polling  place, I don't know, Laurie, are you able to show those folks standing  over?  Maybe you see the parking lot already filled with cars, people, Doug  Jones signs OK about the -- I think it's got to be 30 feet away from the  door, but this is his community, and big turnout here, and of course, a big  turnout will be essentially to both sides in this race, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So we've got special coverage tonight, Jeff, do we know when we  will actually know who actually wins?  What time we've got the special  election coverage tonight beginning in 8:00 P.M. Eastern live right here on  the Fox Business Network for the Alabama Special Election, what do you  think?  When will we know?  </p><p>FLOCK:  Well, this is -- this is really tough because, you know, unlike  polls even in the presidential race where the polls sort of all lined up  kind of together, this we got the Fox News poll which shows Doug Jones is  up by 10 points.  We've got another poll out this morning that shows Moore  up by 10 points, so my guess to you is that, you know, the plan to stay up  late here on Fox Business.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Jeff.  Thank you so much.  We will be watching that,  and of course, our live coverage will follow the race live from Alabama.   Joining us now member of the House Homeland Security and Financial Services  Committee is Congressman Peter King of New York.  Congressman, good to see  you, sir.  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>REP. PETER KING (R), NEW YORK:  Thank you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What do you expect out of Alabama today, sir? </p><p>KING:  I think it's been very close.  That's right.  I just think many  Republicans, I would not vote for Roy Moore if I were down there.  I think  that he should have given more serious answer to the charges against him  and so again, that's just my opinion on that.  I agree with Senator Shelby.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  So Senator Shelby basically said, we can't have this guy  in a position of leadership.  And yet, President Trump did robocalls for  him.  I mean, you know, he's basically saying look, we need that vote.  </p><p>KING:  Yes.  I -- listen, I understand that.  I really -- is -- it's been  bouncing the equities here and I just feel due to the fact that it didn't  vow children and fact that he -- I thought he gave almost a cavalier answer  to it.  To me, again, just raises series issues.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, Congressman, we want to bring this breaking news  outright because the president is tweeting right now, and here's what he  says, listen to this, congressman.  Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand,  a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office  begging for campaign contributions not so long ago and will do anything for  them is now in the ring fighting against Trump.  Very disloyal to bill and  crooked used congressman.  Wow.  Your reaction? </p><p>KING:  Well, I have good working relationship with Kirsten Gillibrand.   Obviously, we disagree on a number of issues.  I think the president be  better advised not to get into fights with all these people.  He's the  President of the United States and he's just giving more credence and  credibility to people like Senator Gillibrand, and to me as the president  politically, he should just stay above that battle.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, I mean Gillibrand is basically empowering the women who  say that the president when he was not even candidate but just a civilian  touch them or did, you know, misconduct -- sexual misconduct and she wants  a congressional investigation, would you be onboard with that? </p><p>KING:  Not at this stage.  I think more evidence would have to come out  and, again, this isn't the court right now.  A number of these people have  actually -- at least one of them I know has brought a lawsuit against  President Trump.  The president has denied it and it's a dangerous path to  go down where we can be constantly bringing president into court, on the  other hand, if they do have credible charges to make I think the president  should answer them.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Don't you think if the Republicans lose the majority in 2018, I  don't know if that's going to happen, but they could, that there will be  investigation after investigation, including impeachment from the left to  try to just keep him in court all day long every day to stop his agenda? </p><p>KING:  Yes.  And I do think it's a dangerous precedent.  That's one of the  reasons why I actually voted against the impeaching of President Clinton.   You -- a president can't be tied down in court all the time.  Obviously, if  there are serious charges, if it's a serious allegations, if it certainly  involves, you know, abuse of his office put to be getting tied down in  court when it has to negotiate with foreign leaders going around the world.   Right now, we have North Korea with all these issues and to me, it's a very  dangerous precedent, and for the most part, the president should not be in  court.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Dagen, I want to turn to National Security.  Congressman,  we got to get your take here because we're learning the suspect in  yesterday's attack in New York City came to U.S. from Bangladesh in 2011 on  a visa from children of siblings of a U.S. citizen.  The White House says,  it would not have been allowed in U.S. soil if the present immigration  policy had been implemented.  Dagen, you're being -- you're hearing from a  lot of New Yorkers right now, they're afraid </p><p>MCDOWELL:  And quite frankly, Congressman, they are angry.  They are angry  that this is the third terror attack by a homegrown jihadist in 14 months.   Two attacks in less than two months, the first of which on Halloween killed  individuals most of whom were tourists visiting the city.  They feel like  that's not enough is being done to protect them.  What do you say to them?</p><p>KING:  Well, the NYPD is best in the world and the fact is, this is the  reality we have to face that we need more surveillance.  We need more  intelligence.  The only way you can stop attacks like this is to have  intelligence, you know, when you have 6 million people on the U.S. city  subway system every day, 6 passengers, there is no way to --  there's no  magnetometers.  There's no way to frisk.  There's no way to ask for I.D.   The only way you got to be able to stop these attacks is by getting more  intelligence that involves having sources in the community, involves  surveillance, it involves not being totally correct, and that is the main - - the only way you can help to stop these.  </p><p>On the other hand, this is reality we face that we are at war with Islamist  terrorism.  They are at war with us, and, unfortunately, too many people in  the media and then politics don't want to face up to that.  And  unfortunately, in a few days this attack is going to be forgotten and when  -- and you're also seeing reports in paper about the police being too  heavy-handed or the FBI being too heavy-handed when it comes to surveying  potential terrorists or, look, it's the community.  Let's face it.  The  threat from Islamist terrorism is going to come from Muslim communities.   We need surveillance in those communities.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  A program, the demographics unit was disbanded after it  was revealed by the associated press that it exists and that was  surveillance of Muslim communities and mosque trying to figure out where  these would be terrorists were working getting jobs living and that's now  gone because of a pushback from the left, and I would say to mayor and  governor of this state that luck is not a law enforcement strategy, and  they were lucky yesterday.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  We're all lucky by the way, yes.  He heard himself hurt  himself more than anybody else that's for sure.  Congressman, let's move on  to taxes here.  Lawmakers scrambling to write the final tax bill this week.   You are a no vote on the house bill, what -- what's your take on what stays  and what goes?  Are you going to get any relief in terms of the salt issue  that's been one of the things that you've been out front on? </p><p>KING:  So far, no, you know,  we have $10,000 property tax but that really  is not enough for people in my district, and also, the fact is state income  tax is not included.  I know they're talking about doing something on the  state income tax because of the high-income tax in California but you have  to choose one or the other property tax or state income tax, and again, to  a place like Long Island, that would be devastating because, again, just  having one $10,000 exemption where it's not unusual to have combined  property of a property state income tax for 20 to 30, 35,000, again, it  would have a -- to me, a unjustifiable impact on the northeast that the  redistribution of wealth in the northeast other parts of the country is  getting a tax cuts for the rest of the country at expense of hardworking  people in New York.  </p><p>JON HILSENRATH, GLOBAL ECONOMICS EDITOR, WALL STREET JOURNAL:  Congressman,  do you think people are going to move out of states like New York and  California as a result of this?  Do you hear that kind of thing from your  constituents? </p><p>KING:  Yes.  It was already some of that but I do know for instance of  businesses that are talking of moving.  I was talking to someone yesterday  about -- it was a business think move to Long Island.  They decided not to  because of the --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Money -- well, you said nacho you said.  All right.  Well,  money is mobile we know that.  Congressman, good to see you, sir.  Thank  you so much.  </p><p>KING:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Peter King here.  We'll be right back right here.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, now, a new group of Russian speaking hackers  targeting banks in the U.S. and Russia, Cheryl Casone on in it details and  headlines.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN HOST:  Yes.  Big headline here, Maria, a Moscow-based  cybersecurity firm says that hackers will steal at least $10 million from  banks here in the United States and in Russia over the past year and a  half.  They mainly targeted small banks in Utah, New York, and California.   The hackers reportedly broke into the bank's card payment systems, opened  some accounts, and then used ATMs to take out money.  Well, Matt Lauer is  facing more fallout after being fired from NBC over multiple claims of  sexual misconduct.  Fox Business has learned that Lauer could lose a $9  million ranch in New Zealand due to a good character clause.  Good  character is a requirement of the New Zealand office which tracks land  purchases by foreign investors trying to buy on the island.  Officials  there said that they are aware of the allegations against Lauer and it  contacted his representative for more information.</p><p>Well, AAA is telling drivers, don't waste your money on premium gas for  cars that recommend using the fuel that don't require it.  Basically,  according to new research, premium gasoline can cost drivers between 20 to  25 percent more than regular offer an improvement of less than 3 percent on  fuel economy, so saying it's not worth it.  Automakers sometimes advertise  higher horsepower figures that they attain using premium gasoline to  attract high-performance car enthusiast, no.  Maybe just save your money.  </p><p>And then finally this, unless you don't want to spend some money on Oreo  debuting three strange new flavors.  They want fans to pick their favorite.   Here's your options, guys.  Cherry Cola Oreos, Kettle Corn Oreos, and then  Pi[LATIN SMALL LETTER N WITH TILDE]a Colada Oreo Thins.  These new flavors invented by Oreo fans online.

The flavors go on  there on January 1 Chocolate Hazelnut Oreo Cookies and Spicy Hot Cinnamon- flavored Oreos are going to be hitting shelves in addition to last week's  big segment on Fruity Pebbles Oreos with you, Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Cool stuff.  Thanks, Cheryl.  Coming up, managing  your money.  Why some Americans could face major financial issues headed  into the New York Year, that's next.  Then a shave above the rest, details  on a new startup that is taking on the Dollar Shave Club by marketing  cheaper razors to women.  That's coming up later this hour, back in a  moment.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Well, the New Year means new resolutions.  For  most people, money management is not on the list this time around, only 27  percent of Americans say, they will make a financial resolution this year.   That's down from the 43 percent who promised to do so in 2014 according to  Fidelity Investments.  Joining us now is Ramsey Solutions financial expert,  author of Retire Inspired, Chris Hogan joining us once again.  Chris, good  to see you, sir.  </p><p>CHRIS HOGAN, AUTHOR, OF RETIRE INSPIRED:  Well, thank you, ma'am.  It's a  pleasure to be with you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you surprised by this that on the list this year people are  not necessarily focused on their financial well-being for the New Year? </p><p>HOGAN:  I really am surprised.  I mean considering, Maria, the times we're  in.  Credit card debt top in 2017, a trillion dollars.  If we take a look  back, student loan debt has increased 150 percent over the last decade and  if we're not saving either, I mean if you start to look at it, one in four  Americans don't have a single dollar saved.  So to look at the New Year and  decide that you're not going to do anything different, you're going to keep  doing what you've always been doing.  That is large to me and it scares me  for people's financial well-being.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Chris, it's Dagen McDowell, people -- one thing that we repeat  every year is we get lured into these sales promotions from retailers.   That's part of the problem.  It's to get them while supplies last, buy now,  you can't wait.  It's going to disappear.  That's part of the psychological  issue that we struggle with every time this year.  </p><p>HOGAN:  Oh, it really is.  I mean listen, these stores are good.  They're  excellent at marketing.  They know how to get our attention because around  the holidays, this is where we make the excuse to do more financially crazy  and to go deeper into debt.  So I want people to really wake up go into  these stores with a game plan, don't let their last-minute sale knock you  off your budget, so be intention and, Dagen, I got a cure for this.  Only  go in to buy what you plan to buy and only spend cash.  I promise you, you  will not go over debt and you won't come out in there with things you don't  need.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Hey, Chris, we've been talking about Bitcoin a lot this  morning, you know, you talked a lot about saving and preparing and  planning, and a lot of our viewers who are out there saying, boy, if I  invest in Bitcoin a couple years ago, I'd be rich right now.  What do you  say to people out there looking at an investment crazed like Bitcoin about  whether they should get in or stay out of something like that?  </p><p>HOGAN:  Well, I'm glad you used the word crazed because as you look at it,  your financial future is not something you want to bank on or gamble on  something that could be a hit or miss.  I tell people all the time, focus  on the things that you know.  For example, we know that there are stores  out there that exist, we can go drive by the parking lot and see that  they're full, right?  We got stores Wal-Mart and all these stores out  there, so people are buying things, and they know stores, they know  businesses that are growing.  So I talked about grow stock mutual funds  being able to look and understand that I have an opportunity to invest in  smaller companies, medium companies as well as large.  But I'm not going to  go the route of any kind of crazed or any kind of fad looking at gold,  looking at Bitcoin things of that nature.  That's not something I'm going  to follow because I know what I want to do and I know that people I'm  trying to provide for later in life.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  You don't think it's worth dipping your toe in and taking a  little bit of a bet on something like that? </p><p>HOGAN:  I think the way Americans most Americans are sitting right now,  they're not in a financial position to do any kind of dipping of anything.   What they have to do is start dodging these sales that are in stores and  start to digging into their budget and getting more intentional.  So I tell  people, get yourself out of debt, build up an emergency fund then you can  start to look at investing.  So it's going to depend on your nest egg as  well as your risk tolerance, but I want you to be wise witch what you're  dealing with.  But, you know, I coached to people that had dipped into  things and tried things, and ended up losing 75 to 85 percent of their  money because they were following a trend.  Let's buck trends and let's  follow things that are proven to work.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Hey, Chris, it's John Layfield.  Look, as crazy as it sounds, a  lot of people don't know how to save.  You talked about game plans, what's  number one thing you would do to somebody who has never saved money who is  part of that have 25 percent who doesn't have one dollar saved, what's the  number one thing you do for them for a game plan to save for this year?  </p><p>HOGAN:  Great question, John.  I say the number one thing is to sit down  and understand your income coming in, and your expenses going out.  We've  got to start to be grown up enough to tell a want that it needs to wait.   We've got to cut things back.  We got to stop eating out.  Scale back and  start to build up a thousand dollar emergency fund and if people can do  that, it changes the game.  They start to realize, you know what, maybe I  can do this and after saving then I want you to get more of your money back  by attacking debt.  Now, we teach people attack smallest to biggest and  when people start to do that, their confidence grows.  And so around this  time of the year, I would tell people this, you want to make a financial  resolution?  Get plugged into financial peace university.  It's a nine-week  course that we teach where you can go sit down with other couples and other  individuals that are in same situation you are, and you start cheering each  other on, and starting to believe that you can do this.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Just do it, right?  Just do it.  </p><p>HOGAN:  That's right.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Chris, thank you so much.  Great advice as always.  We  appreciate it.  See you soon.  Thanks, Chris Hogan.

But first, topping this half an  hour, inspirational inventor, you probably know Joy Mangano from her wildly  successful products on Home Shopping Network, HSN, and her life story was  brought to the big screen back in 2015 with the movie Joy starring Oscar  winner, Jennifer Lawrence. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JENNIFER LAWRENCE, AMERICAN ACTRESS:  Who showed you the mop?  Who sold it  to you?  Who taught you how to use it?  And who convinced you that it was  great after you thought it was worthless? </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Now Joy is telling her story in her own words, in her new book,  Inventing Joy. Dare to Build a Brave &amp; Creative Life. With me right now is  entrepreneur and inventor, Joy Mangano.  Joy, it's great to see you.</p><p>JOY MANGANO, AMERICAN INVENTOR:  Hi, Maria.  What a time in life for  entrepreneurship, don't you think? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.  And you have such a fantastic story.  Here is your  book.  Inventing Joy.</p><p>MANGANO:  Ys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It has to be hard for you to start and push through on  something as simple as a mop. </p><p>MANGANO:  Exactly, right.  Well, as you'll see in the book, you know, a no  is not a no, there are some counterintuitive philosophies that I have in  the book.  And the resiliency through the 30 years of building a business.   Now $3 billion later.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.</p><p>MANGANO:  Amazing, right?  But the book will inspire and delight everybody.   Everybody that wants to change their life and it's the formula.  It's my  blueprint for success.  I live by it every single day. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And well, the movie about your life inspired you to write the  new book.</p><p>MANGANO:  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Usually the other way around. </p><p>MANGANO:  Exactly, exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, you wrote the book because you wanted to make for people  understand exactly how you did it. </p><p>MANGANO:  Well, you know, it is funny, because after the movie came out,  I've been standing in front of America for 25 years talking about the  features and benefits of products, right?  And so when movie came, people  had a touch point for everybody, amazing, Jennifer Lawrence, Robert De  Niro, you know, Bradley Cooper.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's true.</p><p>MANGANO:  And, so, what I realized is people wanted to know the road that  how I got to success, on all levels.  Not only in business personal and all  that.  So hence I said now it's my time to really give back and the book is  that blueprint but true story.  So when I learned it, you'll learn.  It  feel like I'm talking to you, next to you, reading the story and you  absolutely will have all my lessons of success in business for sure and  throughout the rest of your life. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What was your hardest challenge?  What was the toughest thing  that you faced trying to get people to understand what you were doing and  to get your mop out there? </p><p>MANGANO:  Exactly, right, because it's, you know, what do you do joy?  You  know, if I set at inventor when I was a young mom, they would have put me  in the corner at the cocktail party.  So, you know, I think the biggest  challenge is as everybody has is getting starting.  You feel like -- you  don't have to be good to get started, you just absolutely have to have that  passion that belief in yourself and put start at something, start with  something -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  But you also --</p><p>MANGANO:  -- that you want to do. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You need money, Joy.  So how did you get money? </p><p>MANGANO:  You -- well, there are various ways and don't have to do it all  at once.  People think you have to mortgage the house, you have to give up  your job, none of the above if you pace yourself.  But if you don't take  that first step and keep going, you know it is funny, to this day, I still  hear no, you know. You think that by now they think I get it.  And so, you  know, one of the counterintuitive philosophies is that no is not a no, a no  to me is a time -- it's starting point where you say wait a minute, why did  I hear that no, what do I have to change, what path do I have to follow to  get it to be a yes or to be moving forward still. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So did you call on the same people when no was no, or did you  try to get other people involved? </p><p>MANGANO:  That's a very good question.  It depends because if you get a no  here, you might find a yes there or you might reassess and go back.  And  whether it's a product, whether it's a service, whether it's everything and  anything is a product whether it's a service, whether you're a doctor,  whether, you know, anything.  So you never lose sight of your viewer, your  consumer, your customer and you always -- I always fight for that customer  whether it is quality, pricing, I never lose sight that that is the  smartest person out of all of us for me. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How did you -- I mean, the movie was -- the movie was accurate,  100 percent? </p><p>MANGANO:  The movie -- well, yes, and I --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Because -- I mean, you didn't have anybody helping you.  I  mean, you didn't have any employees --</p><p>MANGANO:  You're right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- according to the movie.  So, how did you produce this mop to  have it ready for sale on home shopping world?</p><p>MANGANO:  Right.  Well, the movie was accurate and everything except maybe  me jumping into a soap opera.  I don't think I physically get that. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK.</p><p>MANGANO:  But that resilience story, that story of, you know, where you --  where it's -- where there's an obstacle or wall where you have to find a  way to the left of it, the right of it, over it, or under it and it really  was I look back at that path, I talked about that and we all experience  that, you and your career as well.  There are, you know, where you are  sitting today, you might not have envisioned that 20 years ago, right? </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right. </p><p>MANGANO:  But it's -- so you have to be able to grow with that path and let  it keep leading you but the minute you stop anything, there is a 100  percent chance, 100 percent chance that nothing will happen.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  So you just never stopped, never give up? </p><p>MANGANO:  Right.  Nope.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And back to the money that you needed a financial support, you  used your own money or -- right? </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MANGANO:  I did.  I had a little help from my family.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>MANGANO:  You know, people say don't lean on your family, I say the  opposite.  Family is there surround yourself with people.  You know, if you  have as an adult a lot of times grow up, when we're kids, we're fearless in  a lot of ways.  But we grow up and we say to ourselves, no, no, no, you  can't do that, you can't change your career, you can't do that.  You -- I  found that surrounding myself with those positive light bright people  really helped me keep when I said to myself I don't know, you got that  little push from somebody around you and that, you know, is -- and family  is a natural phenomena that's around us where we can turn to. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So the book is called Inventing Joy, it's not just a play on  words, it's exactly your inspirational message, right?  </p><p>MANGANO:  Yes, exactly.  This book, anybody, young, old, male or female,  successful beyond their years or just starting out from college, it will  inspire every single one, it is my blueprint, it's the success formula, I  followed and follow today.  And it's a true story. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So it's a great read.  Your big -- your big break was Home  Shopping Network, HSN. </p><p>MANGANO:  It was -- actually QVC which will -- which will be QVC, HSN, as  you well know, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  So QVC was the big break. </p><p>MANGANO:  It was, it was.  And that was something I absolutely had no -- I  didn't even know the three letters, right?  But there I ended up, hello on  a stage in front of 100 million homes talk about the mop.  It was -- it  truly was depicted perfectly in the movie.  That was my life moment of  transformation for me. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  So when you were mopping, you just got the idea, you  know, I should sell this, this is a good idea that you just came up with? </p><p>MANGANO:  Right.  If it was that simple that would be great.  But it was -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  How did you even get the courage to say, I'm going to go on QVC  and go sell this mop? </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MANGANO:  Actually, that wasn't the goal, the goal was to just make a  really great mop so that you wouldn't have to use your hands, right?  To  make the mop better, more innovate.  And it took me a while to do that.   And I literally demonstrated in person at three markets in fairs and so on  and so forth.  My dream was to get it in Kmarts across country.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's so great.</p><p>MANGANO:  But what did I do?  I ended up in a whole other industry, right?   But -- now you can find in its retail. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Fantastic.  Check out the book, Inventing Joy.  Joy Mangano,  it's great to see you.</p><p>MANGANO:  Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  Joy Mangano there.  We will  take a break.  When we come back, the biggest public order of Tesla's  electric semi truck. Why Pepsi is buying of the big rigs for its fleet.   Then the new official beer of the Boston Red Sox.  How Sam Adams state a  home run to represent their hometown team.  That's next.  Back in a minute.</p><p>MANGANO:  Great.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Could a deal with PepsiCo cause Tesla to pop?   Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange right now  looking at stocks.  Nic, good morning.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN HOST:  Good morning, Maria.  And could this be  really a trend for many companies?  We've already seen, Wal-Mart, J. B.  Hunt Transport, Sysco Foods signing up for the new Tesla truck.  Right now,  we're seeing Tesla up about one-third of one percent.  Pepsi is a little  bit lower.  And the news is that Pepsi is ordering 100 Tesla electric semis  for their fleet. </p><p>They have about 10,000 big rigs to bring in your Mountain Dew and your  Doritos, but this is all part of a plan, a key part of this plan to reduce  gas house green emission -- the greenhouse gas emissions over the supply  chain over a period of time.  A total of at least 20 percent by the year  2030.  And Tesla is really saying, look, our big rigs are going to compete  against those time-tested diesel trucks.  We're going to have cargo  capacity, the range, and be able to do it with our electric big rig.</p><p>All right.  Let's move on to another story, go to the big game, you had the  baseball game at Fenway Park, how about a beer?  Well, this one is all  about Sam Adams becoming the official beer for the Boston Red Sox.  The  parent company is Boston Beer, it's relatively unchanged this morning, but  it's the first crack forward to have such a deal.  It's eight years to the  year 2025, and they'll have the signage and iconic Fenway Park, and right  field and have a lot of opportunities in New England as well -- Maria. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Nic, thank you so much.  Unibail, Europe's largest  commercial property company will soon be the world's largest mall owner  with the takeover of Australia's Westfield.  Joining us now, host of  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY,\" Stuart Varney, taking a look at this.  Hey, Stu, good  morning.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST:  Would you want to be the world's largest mall  opener in a retail environment like this?  I'm not so sure I would.  You  know, Maria, look, I've been droning on about this all year, but I am  absolutely fascinated by the impact of Amazon.  I happen to be walking  around New York City yesterday, and I poked my head in the front door, some  of these doors of the apartment buildings, all of them were piled high with  Amazon boxes.  A friend of mine was out at a shopping mall in suburban New  Jersey, it wasn't exactly but it wasn't very busy.  That tells the tale, I  think. </p><p>And now, you've got these two companies, Uniball -- Unibail, I should say,  buying Westfield for $16 billion.  Europe buying this Australian company  looks like the safety in numbers as the Amazon threat approaches.  I just  think this is all wrapped up into one big story about the changing look and  feel of suburban America, in particular.  I think that's what it's all  about.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's amazing.  And you know what, it's global, that's what's  interesting here.  Amazon's -- the reach has been incredible and it's  global.</p><p>VARNEY:  Amazing.  It's just amazing.  You know, this apartment -- I looked  at several apartment buildings and I'm sure you have, too.  They're piled  high.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  They are.  You're right.</p><p>VARNEY:  The doorman's job is not to vet people coming in and going out.   No.  It's to distribute Amazon boxes.  That's what they're doing.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And to -- and to secure them, people are stealing them.</p><p>VARNEY:  I hear that, too.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  People are going around apartment buildings and stealing  Amazon boxes.</p><p>VARNEY:  What an effect, huh?  What an effect?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Incredible.  Stu, I know you'll have a lot more in about 10  minutes.  We'll see you then.</p><p>VARNEY:  I promise, I will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour, join Stuart and his  guests.  I will join you as well, Stu.  I'll see -- I'll see you a little  later at the top of the hour.  First, though, breaking news right now, the  suspect in yesterday's New York terrorist attack has been charged.  Akayed  Ullah is facing criminal -- is facing charges for criminal possession of a  weapon, support act of terrorism and making a terroristic threat.  More on  those charges just being brought down this morning, coming up.  Plus,  cheaper razors for women, that is the sales pitch from a new start-up that  delivers straight to your door.  We'll talk with the co-founders of Billie,  coming up next.  Back in a moment.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  It is a woman's world.  A new product is taking  over the dollar shave market and it is aimed just for women.  Joining us  now are the co-founders of Billie; Georgina Gooley and Jason Bravman.   Georgina and Jason, great to see you.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>GEORGINA GOOLEY, CO-FOUNDER, BILLIE:  Thanks for having us.</p><p>JASON BRAVMAN, CO-FOUNDER, BILLIE:  Thank you.  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And so, you brought the razors here on set.  First, tell us  about Billie.</p><p>GOOLEY:  Yes.  So, Billie is a female first shave and body brand.  When we  look at the shaving category, it seems a lot of companies where they  actually give men a better shave experience and women were sort of this  afterthought in the category, so we wanted to come in, give women a really  premium experience, and at a very affordable price.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And Jason, the company just announced $1-1/2-million round of  seed funding, how will that help you grow?  Where do you -- where do you  put that money?</p><p>BRAVMAN:  Yes.  So, we're really excited about it.  So, it's really just  about bringing the product to customers, making sure that people know about  it, focusing on marketing and making sure we have enough inventory to  satisfy all the demands.  So, we launched about 30 days ago, about one  month ago, and we did -- we've been overwhelmed by the response, and just  really pleased by everything. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Is it a subscription?</p><p>GOOLEY:  It is a subscription model, but the way we designed it was really  to make the customers happy.  So, you can choose one, two, or three months,  sort of, frequency.  And we have some body care products that you can  actually add to the subscription as well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, the subscription you use subscribing to get new razors or  what?  Or, you've got everything you need, everything else?</p><p>GOOLEY:  Yes.  So, your starter kit basically comes with -- yes, this  fillet handle, the blade, an extra blade, and then we have this really cool  magnetic holder, so this keeps the razor out of the shower puddle, and it  actually attaches through -- with a magnet, so we keep your blade good.   Ongoing, you get four replacement cartridges, so for $9.00, four  replacement cartridges delivered at your frequency.</p><p>BRAVMAN:  And so, if you think about this -- we sell four blades for $9.00.   If you went to the local store to buy something like this, it would be  $20.00 or $25.00.  And so, that was really the reason that we did this.   Existing razors are too expensive, so we're half the price of incumbents  and the convenience of having it direct to your door, just makes this super  easy for the consumer.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Where did the name, Billie, come from?</p><p>GOOLEY:  Yes.  So, you know, we love this idea of Billie 100 years ago was  predominantly a man's name, even the way it felt, and now it's  predominantly a woman's name.  And so, we love this as a metaphor for the  shaving category with sort of taking it over from the men and bringing it  over to the women. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.  That's cute. </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do women tend to -- or do shavers tend to dispose of their  blades too soon?  And how -- I mean, how long would one -- does one of your  blades last?</p><p>GOOLEY:  Yes.  We save to, you know, to get the maximum sort of lubrication  in that aloe shave.  So, if that we have every seven shaves, you should  replace your blades.  I think, you know, historically, women don't change  their blades as often because they are so expensive.  And so, our hope is  that you can really now have a really great shave experience every single  time because we are pricing this so affordably.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  So, for people out there looking to start their own business,  what are the biggest challenges and what's your advice to them on getting  started?</p><p>BRAVMAN:  Yes.  I mean, I think it's just about identifying a problem,  right?  So, for us, it was the fact that these were overpriced.  So is the  fact that women were overlooked in this category, so everyone seemed to  focus on men in this specific category.  So, identifying a problem, and  then just being super conscious on what consumer wants.  And so, every step  of the way, no matter what we design, it was asking, you know, what our  consumers want, what are problems that they're facing, and how can we solve  those problems effectively for them, and having a little price point and  putting it right to the door always helps.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Do you need to encourage women to shave more?  And I don't --  I'm not -- because men can get away --</p><p>HILSENRATH:  The answer is no.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really?</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Men, you know, can skip -- you know, if you skip a shave, people  at work can tell but with women, not so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  It's hard --</p><p>GOOLEY:  Yes.  No, I mean, our whole -- our whole (INAUDIBLE) is not  telling women that they should shave or they have to shave more or anything  like that.  It's just if you choose to shave, you shouldn't be overcharged  for that.  And so, you can do it with Billie.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And you got -- you got this pink tax, and tell us about that.</p><p>GOOLEY:  Yes.  Yes.  So, you know, as we were digging into the category,  looking at the pink tax where products and services are marked up,  potentially, 10 to 15 percent.  And razors and dry cleaning are actually  the worst offenders of this pink tax.  So, we thought, you know, this is a  great sort of opportunity to really come in, raise awareness about the pink  tax, and let customers know -- let women know that they should be buying  from companies that are fair to them.  And so, we made sure that not only  are our blades half the price of the incumbents, they're also priced in  line with men's razor subscription.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, that's where the cost is.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  How tough is it to get funding now?</p><p>GOOLEY:  Yes.</p><p>BRAVMAN:  Yes.  I mean, I think, you know, it's really about the idea,  right?  So, in any market, if you have a great idea, if you get consumers  excited about what you're doing, then you can get funding.  You know, I  think, you know, it's not hard, it's not easy, you just have to really make  sure they're delivering a great product.</p><p>GOOLEY:  I think our whole goal is every step of the way just focusing on  executing and trying to show a product and show the brand and show that  customers like us.  And then, hopefully, the funding follows once you can  really prove out your product market in.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But I mean, the real expense in terms of shavers is the blades,  right?  The constant replacing of them.</p><p>GOOLEY:  Right.  Exactly.</p><p>BRAVMAN:  Yes.  So, I think one thing that we thought is now we're making  them less expensive, making them better.  And so, we -- all the blades are  surrounded by this aloe shave soap, and so, it's very differentiated from  kind of a men's blade and the men's experience.  You go into the shower  early, it (INAUDIBLE) all over your skin.  All the blades are made in  America, super premium blades, and so, it's a really smooth experience.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Cool stuff.  Congratulations, guys.  Great to see you both.</p><p>GOOLEY:  Thank you so much.</p><p>BRAVMAN:  Thank you so much.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Georgina Gooley, Jason Bravman there.  We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Have a great day, everybody.  Here's Stuart Varney and \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  Over to you, Stu.</p><p>VARNEY:  Thank you very much, Maria.  All right.  The cops say he tried to  kill New Yorkers.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2017 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2017 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It is decision day in Israel, one that will test the political endurance of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu once and for all. Now, polls have shown his Likud Party and Benny Gantz's Blue and White Party, neck and neck.</p><p>Now you see Mr. Netanyahu there along with his wife, casting his vote at one of 10,000 polling stations set up across the country. He could either serve a record fifth term, or be pushed out by the former military chief who is promising a new path for Israel. He also cast his vote earlier in the day.</p><p>Now, CNN's Oren Liebermann is following all the developments from Jerusalem. He joins us now and Oren, this is a hotly contested election. What does the path to victory look like for Netanyahu and for Gantz?</p><p>OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is very much playing the underdog card in the closing days of the election. Just yesterday, he came out and said that his government, his strong right-wing government, as he calls it, is a few seats behind and is in danger of collapsing and being replaced by what he calls a softer, a weak left-wing government.</p><p>As you pointed out, the polls show this much closer. So either Netanyahu's Likud Party has different information from their internal polling or he just wants to play the underdog card because it has served him so well in the past, especially in 2015, where he was pulling behind. And then in the last days of the election, surged into the lead.</p><p>He has been out in full force. He voted here in Jerusalem and then has been making stops trying to rally his voters as well as posting quite a few messages on social media -- Twitter, Facebook -- all to try to get big voter turnout here.</p><p>Meanwhile, his rival, his former Chief of Staff, Benny Gantz voted earlier today just northeast of Tel Aviv in an area called Rosh Ha'ayin. That was early this morning, then he too, has been making the rounds, making sure those in his Party are also out there trying to rally the vote. Neither one of these guys thinks they have it locked up.</p><p>It will also of course, depend on who can build the coalition, but that's later. For now, it's just trying to make sure that one of those two biggest parties -- Netanyahu's Likud Party or his rival, Benny Gantz's Blue and White Party -- comes out with a lead and they'll be working up until the polls closed at 10:00 p.m. tonight.</p><p>Then the exit polls come, and that will be our first chance, Kristie, to have an idea of where these stand. They are notoriously inaccurate. But shortly thereafter, we'll start getting actual results and we'll see who's really in the lead.</p><p>LU STOUT: And then comes the task of building a coalition government. So in regards to coalition building, who has the edge and could Netanyahu's looming corruption indictments complicate that process?</p><p>LIEBERMANN: Right now, it looks like Netanyahu has the edge in building a coalition. There are a number of smaller right wing parties that have either openly pledged support for him or lean in that direction, which gives Netanyahu a comfortable margin and it looked like, up until just a few days ago, he was okay with that. He was okay with not coming out with the biggest party because he had what looked like an easy path to a coalition.</p><p>He just shifted strategy in the last couple of days, and now he wants the biggest party, even at the risk of cannibalizing votes from other right- wing parties. Why is that such a big risk? Because he may put some of those right-wing parties he needs under the electoral threshold and then he would essentially be shooting himself in the foot.</p><p>But that's been the strategy he is going for now, trying to suck up, trying to get as many of those right-wing votes as he can to make sure he comes out ahead at the end of the night. There about seven hours of voting left here. This is one of those polling stations here. It has been busy and it will continue to be so until the polls close.</p><p>LU STOUT: All right, so all eyes on Netanyahu and whether he can fend off his rival. Oren Liebermann reporting live. Thank you.</p><p>Mr. Netanyahu is also thanking one of his biggest allies, Donald Trump, for declaring Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps a quote, \"foreign terrorist organization.\" The U.S. President announced the decision on Monday saying that the Guard actively participates, finances and promotes terrorism.</p><p>[08:05:08] LU STOUT: Iran quickly fired back by designating the U.S. as a state sponsor of terrorism and American troops in the Middle East quote, \"terrorist groups.\"</p><p>Iran's President slammed the U.S. declaration as a mistake while praising the RGC for fighting terrorism and for guarding the nation. Ramin Mostaghim is a reporter for \"The Los Angeles Times.\" He joins us now from Tehran. Ramin, welcome back to the program. Thank you for joining us.</p><p>RAMIN MOSTAGHIM, REPORTER, LOS ANGELES TIMES (via Skype): Thank you. Thank you for having me.</p><p>LU STOUT: Just how significant is this move? This terrorist designation tit for tat, what impact is it going to have on Iran?</p><p>MOSTAGHIM: On Iran, economically is going to be hard, I mean, painful and already started to devaluations and it kicks off the devaluation of local riyals against the hard currency including dollars. And I think the soaring prices will be -- will add up to the pains of the common people in the streets. That is the economic side of it, but at the same time, reformist are rallying behind the IRGC, the pro-government and hardliners also are rallying behind the IRGC as a hero elite forces and they try in a couple of days, the day of the IRGC -- National IRGC Day -- they just want to lionize these IRGC as an elite force who just supports the guys in Tehran, the pillars of the Islamic Revolution.</p><p>But I mean, the reformists also are trying to convey this message to the world and public opinion that whatever happened, Trump's designation of the IRGC as a terrorist group was a sort of a gift dedicated to Netanyahu on a golden plate adjust on the eve of the election in Israel.</p><p>So from that point, reformists are trying to say that it's was a gift by Trump to his own ally and crony, blue eyed boy Netanyahu and are bracing for bad days to come and try just to find a way to get rid of this, I mean, impasse and I mean, difficult situations, and are hoping that trade and barter with neighboring countries, with Iraq, Turkey, Russia, and anywhere that can - they can omit and delete dollar as exchange money will be helpful for them, but it is going to be harmful, I mean, painful and it hurts the economy of Iran.</p><p>But at the same time, it's a good chance for IRGC to lionize itself and reformists to rally behind IRGC at the same time to show this national solidarity against the great Satan as they call American administration.</p><p>LU STOUT: Got it. So this U.S. terror declaration, it will have ripple effects across the region. It gives the Republican Guards an opportunity to as you say, lionize itself, but will also cause economic pain there in Iran. Ramin, unfortunately, we'll have to leave it at that, but thank you very much for your analysis and for joining us here on the program.</p><p>U.S. President Donald Trump is meanwhile back home in the United States, he is getting rid of top officials at the Department of Homeland Security as his frustration over illegal immigration grows. The head of the U.S. Secret Service, Randolph Alles announced his resignation on Monday, just a day after the Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was forced to resign. And sources tell CNN, at least two more officials have been named as possibly heading out the door.</p><p>Now since Mr. Trump's inauguration, there have been a wave of departures from Cabinet officials to White House staffers, some leaving in firings, others in resignations. Have a look at that graphic on your screen there. It has led to flurry of temporary hires. Homeland Security alone has had at least three senior positions filled by people in an acting role.</p><p>Our senior Washington correspondent, Joe Johns joins us live from the White House, and Joe, President Trump is clearing out the top ranks at Homeland Security, the purge is on, who is next?</p><p>JOE JOHNS, CNN SENIOR WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: Anybody's guess quite frankly, Kristie, you can call it a purge. You can call it a wave. You've got a bunch of people headed for the exits at the Homeland Security Department, as the President essentially decides that he's going to go in a different direction.</p><p>Now, this is an administration that has been known for upheaval, not all that unusual. But what's been a bit extraordinary over the last 24 hours or so is the backstory, the reporting from some of my colleagues here at CNN suggesting that the President of the United States has been giving orders to some of his subordinates telling them to disobey or at least ignore the law.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[08:05:01] JOHNS (voice over): One official calls it a near systematic purge at the Department of Homeland Security. Secret Service Director Randolph Alles ousted by President Trump a day after he forced Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to resign.</p><p>The official tells CNN two other top officials are likely headed out soon. The moves angering the most senior Republican in the Senate. Chuck Grassley expressing his concerns to \"The Washington Post\": \"The president has to have some stability. He's pulling the rug out from the very people that are trying to help him.\"</p><p>Stephen Miller, the President's hardline senior advisor, influenced at least some of the changes.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KATHLEEN RICE (D-NY): How about Stephen Miller asked him to appoint him as the Secretary of DHS? Let him explain to the American people why he wants to go back to ripping babies out of their mothers' arms. Own it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHNS (voice over): The change is a clear sign the President intends to intensify his anti-immigrant policies. CNN has learned that the White House now wants to force migrants at the border into a binary choice: stay together in detention or be separated from their kids.</p><p>The zero-tolerance policy that resulted in mass separations last year was roundly criticized, but CNN has learned in recent months, President Trump has been pushing to resume and expand the policy, even for legal asylum seekers, believing it deters migrants.</p><p>A senior official adding, \"He just wants to separate families.\" Adding, \"The President refuses to understand that the Department of Homeland Security is constrained by the laws.\"</p><p>In a meeting with top officials two weeks ago, a source present at the meeting tells CNN the President was, quote, \"ranting and raving\" and ordered top aides to close the port of El Paso, Texas. Secretary Nielsen warning the move would be dangerous. Two sources in the room say the President responded, \"I don't care.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHNS: Today, President Trump is expected to meet with the President of Egypt here at the White House which on any other day would probably be the big headline, but not this day for one reason because the Attorney General is on Capitol Hill testifying. People here would very much like to hear what he has to say about the Mueller report that still hasn't been released -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: And Joe, I know that we will be talking about that with you tomorrow. John Johns live from the White House, thank you.</p><p>Now, the bumpy day for the U.S. Secret Service didn't end there. A hearing for a Chinese national charged with bluffing her way to Donald Trump's Florida resort exposed weaknesses in the very agency designed to protect the U.S. President.</p><p>Yujing Zhang is facing criminal charges for allegedly breaching security at Mar-a-Lago last month and she was carrying malware, devices to detect hidden cameras and thousands of dollars in cash. The judge ordered her to remain in custody for at least another week.</p><p>You're watching NEWS STREAM and still ahead, Carlos Ghosn says he is a victim of conspiracy, what the jailed executive is saying in a new one video, next.</p><p>Plus the Hollywood actress Felicity Huffman faces up to 20 years in prison for alleged role in a wide-ranging college admissions scam. The apology she's given and more just the head.</p><p>[08:15:30] LU STOUT: Broadcasting live from Hong Kong, welcome back. This is NEWS STREAM.</p><p>Now, the British Prime Minister Theresa May is scrambling to secure another extension to the Brexit process. Mrs. May has been in Berlin today for talks with Angela Merkel ahead of an emergency Brexit Summit on Wednesday.</p><p>Later the Prime Minister heads to Paris for talks with President Macron as the threat of a no-deal Brexit on Friday edges ever closer. Let's get the very latest from our senior international correspondent, Atika Shubert in Berlin, and Atika, Prime Minister May, she has been meeting with Chancellor Merkel there in Berlin to help muster up another Brexit delay. How is this all going to play out?</p><p>ATIKA SHUBERT, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, this is the million dollar question. Now, we don't know exactly what was said because no press conference was held. But it did get off to a bit of an awkward start because the British Prime Minister arrived a few minutes early and that meant that the German Chancellor was not actually on the red carpet to greet her.</p><p>The last time Prime Minister May came to Berlin, she was actually locked in her car. So this time, she just sped right in and was left waiting in the lobby for a little while. Well, Merkel finally arrived and brought her outside for the traditional photo op.</p><p>It started awkwardly, we don't know what happened inside. But most likely, she asked for that extension. Of course, Britain wants that June 30th extension. This is not something that Germany and the E.U. have generally agreed to. However, there is some flexibility for perhaps a longer extension, as long as the U.K. participates in the E.U. election, something that has already been put forward by the British Conservative Party. So that's possibly a good sign.</p><p>The problem here is that for Germany just support any extension, it needs to have some sort of confidence, some sort of sign that in fact, this withdrawal agreement for Brexit will eventually be passed somehow some way.</p><p>And right now, there is no guarantee that that can happen. So where does the British Prime Minister go from here? Well, she'll have to go to Paris talk about it with the French President, Emmanuel Macron and then see if she has managed to convince all 27 E.U. members when they meet for that emergency meeting tomorrow in Brussels.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, these are critical last minute talks. Brexit day, just four days away. Atika Shubert live in Berlin. Thank you.</p><p>Another headache for the E.U. is developing at this moment. President Trump has just tweeted that the U.S. will slap tariffs on $11 billion worth of E.U. products after the World Trade Organization ruled that he E.U. subsidies for Airbus cause adverse effects for the U.S. The move threatens to further escalate the trade dispute between the U.S. and the E.U. We will have more on the story on \"First Move\" with Julia Chatterley coming up in about 45 minutes.</p><p>Carlos Ghosn accused Nissan execs of backstabbing in a new video statement out earlier today. The former Nissan boss repeated his claim of innocence saying executives at the Japanese carmaker conspired to remove him from power. Ghosn is in custody right now awaiting trial on several counts of financial misconduct.</p><p>Anna Stewart joins us now. She has got more on the story for us and Anna, Ghosn, he has been on this campaign to prove his innocence. What more did he say in this video statement?</p><p>ANNA STEWART, CNN REPORTER: Quite a bit, and it was -- what was really striking here isn't just what he says and I'll come on to that. But actually, it's how he said it. He was defiant. He was calm. He was very clear throughout. And despite having his hair slightly grayer and a face that was slightly thinner from his initial arrest back last November, he seemed pretty strong despite the recent months' experience.</p><p>Now, he wanted to give a press conference this week to explain himself, but he pre-recorded this message in case he couldn't make it, of course his re- arrest at the end of last week on a separate charge of siphoning off $5 million from a Nissan payment to an overseas dealer means that he can't make that. But in this message, he says he is innocent. He says he still loves Japan. He still loves Nissan. And then he explains what he says are the reasons behind all these charges.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLOS GHOSN, FORMER NISSAN CEO: The third point I want to tell you that this is a conspiracy. This is not about specific events. This is not about again, greed. This is not about dictatorship. This is about a plot. This is about conspiracy. This is about backstabbing, that's what we're talking about. And why? So you can say why this happened? Why it happened because there was first a fear that the next step of the alliance in terms of convergence and in terms of moving toward the merger would in a certain way threaten some people. Or eventually threaten the autonomy of Nissan.</p><p>[08:20:12] STEWART: Serious allegations against Nissan who have not commented on this video today. Now, to give you some context, I mean, I was in Tokyo this time last year and rumors and speculation about the potential for a merger between Renault and Nissan abounded there, neither company would speak about it.</p><p>There was a very complicated corporate structure here. Essentially, Renault own over 40 percent of Nissan. Nissan only own 15% of Renault, and in addition to that the French government have just over 15 percent of Renault giving them a huge sway. They are the biggest shareholder, so there's always been this tension that exists. No comment from Nissan and we'll have to see whether we get anything more from Carlos Ghosn and his lawyers as the days go by.</p><p>LU STOUT: Anna Stewart on the story first. Anna, thank you.</p><p>Now to the U.S. where three women in the U.S. State of California already are suing Uber. They say that they were raped by drivers who posed as employees for the ride-sharing company. They are also accusing Uber of failing to warn customers of a string of past assaults and are taking the lawsuit to the Los Angeles Superior Court.</p><p>Let's bring in Drew Griffin. He joins us from Atlanta with more. And Drew, walk us through the lawsuit. What it alleges and what the women are seeking?</p><p>DREW GRIFFIN, CNN SENIOR INVESTIGATIVE CORRESPONDENT: Kristie, these are about attacks that took place in the Los Angeles area of California. Nine people sexually assaulted within a five mile radius of West Hollywood by fake Uber drivers between September 2016 and February of 2018.</p><p>This is from a lawsuit from these three women. Uber allegedly failed to warn customers after law enforcement told Uber of at least five assaults by these fake drivers in the part of Los Angeles that houses several popular nightclubs.</p><p>Two men were arrested for attacking women in separate cases, one already sentenced to eight years in prison. The lawsuit claims that Uber has egregiously chosen to hide and minimize its safety problem. It alleges that Uber makes it easy for predators to obtain print-at-home Uber labels to deceive passengers.</p><p>Now the LAPD declined to comment. The LA Sheriff's Department could not be reached for comment, but Uber told us that it hasn't seen the copy of this lawsuit yet, Kristie, but a spokesperson said in a statement, \"We have been working with local law enforcement including the LAPD to educate the public about how to avoid fake rideshare drivers for several years.\"</p><p>This suit comes after a University of South Carolina student, Samantha Josephson was kidnapped and killed here in the U.S. when she got into a vehicle she mistakenly thought was an Uber. We should note that a CNN investigation in April 2018 found 103 Uber drivers, real Uber drivers in the U.S. were accused of sexually assaulting or abusing their passengers in four years prior.</p><p>Uber has yet to release its own internal reporting on this, Kristie and how many of its real drivers have been accused or charged in sexual assaults -- Kristie.</p><p>LU STOUT: And Drew you've updated the story how Uber has a problem, a big problem with sexual abuse. You mentioned that investigation from April last year. That's when you brought this to our attention one year ago. Since then, do you think Uber has adequately changed the way it handles his cases?</p><p>GRIFFIN: Well, we can tell you for sure that the problem still exists. Uber has tried to tighten up its background checks, conduct annual checks on drivers. Also to try to educate the public more, put a device on its app which is sort of an emergency button if you feel threatened, you can press that button and it immediately tells authorities and perhaps your loved ones exactly where you are.</p><p>But the problem persists, and as Uber sets to go for its IPO, the company is still refusing to release its own tallies of internally, of sexual assaults being reported by its customers.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, Uber needs to be more transparent on this issue ahead of its IPO. Drew, we thank you for this steadfast reporting on Uber. Take care. Drew Griffin there.</p><p>Now U.S. Federal prosecutors, they want prison time for the actress, Felicity Huffman and other parents who are pleading guilty to cheating in order to get their children admitted to the country's most selected universities.</p><p>Now, Hoffman, who starred in the show \"Desperate Housewives,\" she has agreed to plead guilty to paying $15,000.00 to a fake charity to facilitate cheating for her daughter on college entrance exams. Now, the actress faces up to 20 years in prison.</p><p>The prosecutors, they have recommended a much lesser sentence. Our U.S. correspondent Brynn Gingras is following developments from New York. She joins us now and Brynn, the defendants -- we mentioned Felicity Huffman -- they are wealthy, high profile individuals, a lot of attention - global attention on this case. How much prison time could they ultimately serve?</p><p>BRYNN GINGRANS, CNN U.S. CORRESPONDENT: Yes, I mean, the government in this case has been very clear that they're not going to sort of separate each defendant and make up -- depending on how much they contributed to this scam make up some arbitrary number.</p><p>[08:25:05] GINGRAS: They said anywhere between six months and almost two years is what they're going to recommend to the judge.</p><p>Now, when in terms of Felicity Huffman, again, she's one of 13 parents now who say they will plead guilty to what they're accused of doing, their connection with this scheme. They said they are going to recommend the lower end of that for Felicity Huffman.</p><p>So ultimately, it's up to a judge. We don't know if she'll actually see prison time at this point. But it is possible and the same is true for the rest of the defendants. Remember, 50 people in all were connected to the scam. So there are other people who still are waiting out and seeing what happens if they're going to continue with a not guilty plea.</p><p>I just talked to an attorney who represents one of the coaches connected to this. He says his client is not guilty. They're going to continue the course. However, the clock is ticking. We know that the government has said that they will bolster charges against some of these defendants, if they don't take a plea.</p><p>So there are money laundering charges that some have had tacked on to this case. So we'll see what happens in the very near future. But I have to tell you, Felicity Huffman released a statement. Again, she was one of 13 player parents to plead guilty most recently, and hers was a pretty impressive statement. It was a very long and I want to read part of it for you, Kristie, she said, quote, \"I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues, and the educational community. I want to apologize to them, and especially I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children, and do so honestly.\"</p><p>That was only part of statement, and in it, she also said that her daughter had no idea that she paid $15,000.00 to the mastermind of this scheme to help bolster her test scores. But yes, we're going to see what happens and very near new future.</p><p>Really quickly, I want to mention USC, which has been one of the largest schools tied to this, they're taking a case by case interest in each student who might be tied to this. They said that they will take into account these plea agreements by some of these parents when considering whether or not to allow the students to stay in their school. So we'll see what happens.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, one of those USC parents, Lori Laughlin, we're still waiting to hear her latest reaction yet. Brynn, we'll leave it that. Thank you so much.</p><p>You're watching NEWS STREAM. Keep it here because up next, all nine leading activists behind Hong Kong's Occupy Central Umbrella Movement are awaiting sentencing. We speak with a pro-democracy lawmaker who is going to give us her take on the verdict and the feature of democracy in the city.</p><p>[08:30:01] LU STOUT: I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. You're watching NEWS STREAM and these are your world headlines.</p><p>Israelis are voting right now in a closely watched election. Benjamin Netanyahu cast his ballot a short time ago. He could other either serve a record fifth term is Prime Minister or be pushed aside by his main rival, former military chief, Benny Gantz. We saw him vote a short time ago as well.</p><p>Two more deaths have been reported at the side of protests outside Sudan's military headquarters in Khartoum. This brings the death toll to 10 since Saturday. Opposition sources say that the protesters were shot by National Security Forces. It is the fourth day of dissidence calling for the removal of President Omar Al Bashir.</p><p>Malaysian official say the wife of disgraced former Prime Minister Najib Razak was arrested and released earlier today. Rosmah Mansor will face charges in court on Wednesday. She is accused of soliciting and receiving bribes. The trial against her husband began last week.</p><p>In Hong Kong, the future of this city uncertain for many locals, especially after the pro-democracy Umbrella Movement ended back in 2014. Earlier, the Hong Kong District Court handed down guilty verdicts for all nine leading activists of the protests. But despite the possibility of facing jail time, they are not giving up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over): The biggest pro-democracy protest in the history of Hong Kong, the Umbrella Movement that took place in 2014 ended with guilty verdicts for all nine leading activists of the protests.</p><p>Among them, legal scholar Benny Tai; Sociology Professor, Chan Kin-man; and retired Pastor Chu Yiu-ming were convicted of a range of public nuisance offenses, concluding when the city's most politically charged trials in years, but the activists are not backing down.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TAI: Together, will continue to strive for Hong Kong's democracy and we will proceed on and we will not give up.</p><p>CHAN KIN-MAN, SOCIOLOGY PROFESSOR: I still believe in the power of love and peace, and I have no regrets for what I have done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT (voice over): Hong Kong democracy advocates, human rights groups, and even politicians in the U.K. and the U.S. quickly condemned the convictions, saying, \"The convictions are sending a terrible message that will likely embolden the government to prosecute more peaceful activists, further chilling free expression in Hong Kong.\"</p><p>The 79-day street occupations also called Occupy Central came on the back of shrinking political freedoms in this special administrative region.</p><p>On August 31, 2014, Beijing decided that Hong Kong's Chief Executive will be elected by popular vote, but only after each candidate has been approved by the Chinese government, rejecting the city's full democracy seen as a crucial political tipping point for the Hong Kong people.</p><p>Under the One Country Two Systems arrangement, Hong Kong enjoys a high degree of autonomy and freedoms. But in recent years, critics say China has begun to walk back on its commitment, stoking fears about the future of the former British colony as activists who have become known as the Umbrella Nine face punishment.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: And Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmaker, Claudia Mo joins us now. Claudia, thank you for joining us. What is your reaction to the convictions and what message do they send?</p><p>CLAUDIA MO, CONVENOR, DEMOCRATIC CAMP, HK LEGISLATOR: Well, this is clearly political prosecution and persecution, just like any autocratic regime, they are using judicial means as political weapon to shut down dissent. They want to shut down Hong Kong as what we call what we're being known as the city of protest.</p><p>They're trying to send this chilling effect around the entire society that watch out if you are an activist, you do behave or else. Now, they are trying to make Hong Kong disappear from the map.</p><p>LU STOUT: Now, China's Foreign Ministry has responded as spokesperson said it firmly supports the convictions adding this quote, \"I also want to remind people from other countries who are holding one-sided understanding that the verdict was indicative of shrinking freedoms in Hong Kong, which were illogical and baseless.\" Claudia, what do you make of that?</p><p>MO: That's a load of crap. I mean, what they're trying to do is so obvious. This is political retribution. The Umbrella Movement certainly made China look rather bad three or four years ago, and they need somebody to pay back.</p><p>[08:35:05] MO: And they're trying to make this a huge political lesson for Hong Kong, especially our young. Now, included in the nine defendants are two existing legislators.</p><p>Now, previously, Beijing and Hong Kong governments together have successfully ousted six of our democratic legislators. Now, they are likely to get rid of two more. How about that? We're already very outnumbered at the local legislature.</p><p>LU STOUT: After today's convictions, again, these nine activists found guilty five years after the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests. The sentencing will come out are the tomorrow or even later, in terms of sentencing. What are you expecting?</p><p>MO: Now the maximum penalty, I was told is seven years. But then seven years, obviously sounds too much, right, for a rioting charge. Previously, a young activist of ours was sentenced to six years. So I'm expecting at least half -- just half of that number, but then for -- I don't know.</p><p>I mean, one, two years, maybe less. I just don't know because the whole thing is so political. Obviously, we all knew that if you break the law for political purposes, you're not going to use that as a mitigating factor. But then, we are talking about civil disobedience and it's passive and it's peaceful and I hope the sentencing will be light, ultimately.</p><p>LU STOUT: Claudio Mo, we thank you for joining us. Take care.</p><p>MO: Thank you.</p><p>LU STOUT: You are watching NEWS STREAM, and still ahead right here on the program, the \"New York Times\" CEO. Part two of our interview, he warns publishers against signing up to Apple News Plus, find out why, next.</p><p>LU STOUT: Welcome back. Now Facebook and Google will face questions about policing white supremacist content on their platforms in the coming hours. The U.S. House Judiciary Committee hearing, it comes after the massacre of 50 people at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand was live streamed on Facebook. The committee says, it will explore what social media companies can do to stem white nationalist propaganda and hate speech online.</p><p>Big tech's role in the media industry is also facing growing scrutiny. It's a subject I discussed in part two of my interview with \"The New York Times,\" CEO Mark Thompson. Under his watch, \"The Times\" has accumulated millions of digital subscribers, but he has warned publishers away from working with big tech too closely. Most recently, ahead of the launch of the Apple News app, and I began by asking him, why?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MARK THOMPSON, CEO, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Well, I want to say, each publisher must make their choices. And by the way, you know, we all live and learn. Choices may change over time, all of us.</p><p>But we know there are some very good examples from the story of the music industry and the early story of R&amp;D, you know, our good friends at Netflix that just be careful of giving your crown jewels to someone who may turn out to be a competitor.</p><p>Maybe in some ways, superficially attractive because there's an immediate flow of revenue from it.</p><p>[08:40:04] THOMPSON: But in the end, what we're selling is experiences and we want people to experience the \"New York Times\" by and large on our digital assets that we want them to come to us and we want to have a direct relationship. We can reach people around the world with our own digital assets.</p><p>LU STOUT: Yes, but Apple is not just a major platform, it is a massive platform, 1.4 billion iOS users around the world, that must be tempting.</p><p>THOMPSON: Sure, Facebook 2 billion, Google, I don't know, but billions. These vast platforms have got enormous audiences. But you know, if you don't have a direct relationship with your user, if you don't, you can't speak to them. You can't e-mail them. They don't know exactly who you are, you don't know them. I don't know, you have to discount massively.</p><p>LU STOUT: For all those reasons you just listed, that's why at the \"New York Times,\" you've kept a tactical distance away from Apple News, away from Facebook, you mentioned fake news. Facebook has a massive problem with fake news, as well as on the back of Christchurch, a problem with graphic content, extremist content, et cetera.</p><p>We know that Mark Zuckerberg, he is writing an op-ed saying, \"Regulate us. Go ahead.\" Is Facebook -- is it beyond hope? It has become too big to be regulated?</p><p>THOMPSON: Look, I think we're in the early stages of answering that question. For this, I believe from -- including from recent conversations with Mark that they are, in their own terms trying to grapple pretty seriously with these issues. I mean, I believe that there is work afoot inside Facebook to try and address these issues. We've yet to see the fruits of that.</p><p>And I want to say, \"Look, they may not. It may be that they can't get to where we want to get.\" I think we've all got to be careful, though, of swinging from a period of thinking that the major digital platforms could do no wrong. They were run by geniuses. They were just making the world a better place to thinking that they're all the work of the devil.</p><p>I mean, the truth is probably always laying somewhere between those two extremes. So in a funny way, I think we're all -- this is the very -- still the early stages in these technologies. We're still struggling towards some kind of balanced view of what's going on.</p><p>And I would say that the platform where we've had the most traction I would say on these topics over the last few years has been Google and I think, although it's not enough for us yet, we'd still like more. We've had quite the beginnings of a fruitful dialogue with Google about ways in which they can help publishers and also help individual users really figure out what they're doing and where the news comes from.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: \"New York Times\" CEO, Mark Thompson there and that is NEW STREAM. I'm Kristie Lu Stout.

Either Google reaches agreement with Australian news companies or it may take its bat and ball and go home. Based on its behaviour in Spain in 2014 and other parts of Europe recently, there is a strong prospect that Google will walk away from any arrangement and opt not to display news organisations' content in search. It could decide not to rank their stories or not show story excerpts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You may think Google has the upper hand in this dispute, that with 90 per cent of the desktop search market and 98.21 per cent of the mobile search market, it can dictate to Australian media.</p><p>Experts say Google also has much to lose by walking away, and that there's a viable plan B for Australian media if it does.</p><p>Facebook is saying little yet about the code, however Google is recoiling. It has responded by prominently promoting an open letter by Australia managing director Mel Silva. You can access it from a direct link on its Australian search home page. If you use YouTube, you may have encountered pop-ups warning that Australia's access to search is at risk.</p><p/><p>Apart from the money, Google is worried about a requirement to notify news organisations of upcoming changes to its search algorithms; news organisations want warnings of how changes to search will impact their rankings and business.</p><p>Ms Silva's letter warns that Google may have to share its user data with news organisations. The ACCC says that's untrue. \"Google will not be required to share any additional user data with Australian news businesses unless it chooses to do so,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/response-to-google-open-letter\">says the ACCC in an open letter in response</url>.</p><p>The draft code requires Facebook and Google to bargain with news organisations over three months, and if there's no agreement, a deal will go to final-offer arbitration. An arbitrator will decide which side offers a fairer deal, and adopt its approach. This forces both sides to be reasonable.</p><p>\"I can't speculate what will happen next, because we don't really have a precedent for this particular situation,\" says Associate Professor Fiona Martin, from the University of Sydney's Department of Media and Communications, </p><p>\"However I think the ACCC is right to move to try and get Google to negotiate with new media companies. There's a need for regulation to control monopolies.\"</p><p>She says Google has much to lose from no agreement. She says it enjoys direct value from advertising displayed next to news content, and gleans information from users of news that can improve ad targeting. \"I think that platforms are getting more value out of publishing news than news companies are getting out of the platforms.\"</p><p/><p>Dr Martin says if Google opts out of search in Australia, it would lose its advertising monopoly, with other vendors filling the void on alternative sites that aggregate mainstream news content. It won't be able to promise advertisers ubiquitous exposure.</p><p>She says Australian news organisations could break free of Google if necessary. But they'd need to be \"very agile\". One approach is for mainstream media to build news aggregation sites of their own, and heavily promote them.</p><p>In January, News Corporation (the ultimate owner of The Australian) launched an early Beta version of a news aggregation site called <url normalizedValue=\"https://knewz.com/\">Knewz</url> that draws news from hundreds of sources both within and outside the corporation. </p><p>Stories link directly with original publishers. The content is US focused, but it's a sample of what is possible.</p><p>At the time, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/news-corp-readies-news-app-to-address-publishers-concerns-about-google-and-facebook-11566497094\">The Wall Street Journal reported</url> that the site could potentially give News Corp more leverage in its relationship with Google and other platforms.</p><p>\"We are exploring this with the goal of recognising and rewarding the provenance of journalism, and to drive traffic and data to publishers - including subscription sites - so their original work is respected,\" says James Kennedy, a spokesman for News Corp in the report.</p><p>Dr Martin says an alternative aggregated news platform could work if it was developed as an open platform, with wide-ranging participation but with membership restricted to valid news publishers to keep away conspiracy theorists and propaganda publications.</p><p>\"If there's a willingness from a lot of interested parties, and if it's an open source project, it's got a better chance of survival.\"</p><p>She said Google's scare tactics in its open letter threatening disaster didn't resonate with Australians. \"No one cares, Australians aren't accessing those messages.</p><p>\"In the wake of the Facebook Cambridge Analytica debacle, people are rightly concerned about the transparency of Google and Facebook and big platforms.\"</p><p>As to the message that Google put out about a big media company wanting your data. She says it forgets it's a big media company itself.</p><p>Dr Martin says ACCC chairman Rod Sims has proven to be a very successful regulatory activist and has promoted the importance of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/inquiries-ongoing/digital-platforms-inquiry\">the digital platforms inquiry to Australians</url>.</p><p/><p>Associate Professor Rob Nicholls from the University of NSW Business School says the ACCC has learned the lessons from Spain in 2014 and from France this year and has given Google \"a pretty stark choice\".</p><p>\"The choice is comply with the mandatory code, which would have been voluntary if you had done the negotiation, or exit.\"</p><p>Dr Nicholls says Spain directed Google to pay for content and Google simply stopped ranking local media stories in search. However over time readers went back to searching newspaper sites directly.</p><p>\"People just get used to searching for news on news businesses websites, so they go to the various media platforms in Spain, their own websites rather than use Google for searching news.\"</p><p>Some surveys report that the Spanish media suffered a loss of patronage after Google stopped ranking its stories, however others say the reports are overblown.</p><p>\"For years, critics have attempted to make the case for why the EU should not adopt a similar law, arguing that the Spanish law and resulting Google News closure were disastrous for Spanish news publishers, with some publishers experiencing double-digit drops in web traffic,\" says <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsmediaalliance.org/google-news-shutdown-in-spain-not-as-bad-as-google-would-have-you-believe/\">The News Media Alliance in a report last year</url>.</p><p>\"Over the long-term, data showing online website traffic trends for Spanish news sites from 2014 up to 2019 seem to have remained largely unchanged, with the total number of unique monthly visitors actually increasing with many publishers.\"</p><p>Dr Nicholls says local media sites have benefited from increased traffic. \"There's a lot higher usage of news media businesses websites in Spain than there is in other European countries, because Google doesn't search.\"</p><p>He says France has told Google and Facebook to negotiate with news businesses and if they don't, they will be \"pinged\" for misuse of market power.</p><p>He too sees big risks for Google if it walked away from a deal in Australia, and says there is scope for an aggregated news service to replace Google searches for mainstream news.</p><p>\"Specialist search engines gain popularity very rapidly if they're good. The advertising sales can be higher because you've got a demographic that is essentially searching for real information. The value of the advertising from those sites can be higher.\"</p><p>He says newspapers and other news organisations would have the resources to heavily promote an aggregated news search engine. \"The cross promo opportunities are really high.\"</p><p>He says the possibility that an alternative news aggregation site could work isn't lost on Google. \"The reason that you (Google) lobby hard and perhaps try and get a different demographic to make submissions to the ACCC ... is because you recognise that there's a threat. Essentially their monopoly is being challenged.\"</p><p>He says Google would also know that what the ACCC achieves in Australia could impact agreements for payments to news organisations in other countries.</p><p>He believes Google could explain the impact of changing algorithms to news organisations without giving all details away about algorithms.</p><p>Time is now ticking away for Google on this, with consultation on the draft code closing on Friday.</p><p>The government says it will pass legislation promptly, and once it does, it's game on to reach a deal. The scene is set for a massive showdown on this in coming months, with a likelihood of Google walking away, unless the big tech firm from Mountain View rethinks its position.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Apple's also fell, losing nearly 4% during the trading session amid production concerns related to its newest iPhone models. The iPhone-maker's stock closed Nov. 19 at $185.86 per share.</p><p>Rounding out the so-called FAANG tech stocks, Amazon shares lost about 5% Nov. 19, closing at $1,512.29 apiece, while Netflix tumbled 5.45% to close at $270.60 per share. Google LLC parent Alphabet's stock ended the day down 3.82%, closing at $1,027.42 per share. More broadly, the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average each fell by over 1% on Nov. 19, while the Nasdaq lost about 3%.</p><p>Facebook has pushed back against the Times' portrayal of its management, saying in a recent blog post that the report contained several inaccuracies, including the timing of when company executives learned about a campaign by Russian operatives to spread misinformation on its platform ahead of the 2016 U.S. election and how involved CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg had been in key decisions to address the spread of false information on the company's social network. The company also refuted claims in the article that it had sanctioned a strategy by an outside public relations firm to plant negative stories about its competitors, including Google and Apple. Still, the report has generated calls in some corners to re-examine how Facebook is regulated.</p><p>Meanwhile, investors digested a Nov. 19 Wall Street Journal report indicating that Apple had reduced orders for new iPhone Xs, iPhone Xs Max and iPhone Xr models, all of which were unveiled in September, amid lower-than-expected consumer demand and production issues. Forecasts for the iPhone Xr have been especially problematic, the report said. The iPhone Xs, iPhone Xs Max and the iPhone Xr resemble the company's flagship iPhone X but vary in size and pricing. The iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max, which retail for $999 and $1,099, respectively, began shipping in September.

From its all-seeing vantage point as a network operator, the cable company, with NebuAd's help, planned to collect data on customers' movements on the Internet and use it to generate sophisticated ads tailored to fit individual subscribers' interests. The partnership would make Charter the first cable company to plunge into the fast-moving world of \"behavioral advertising\" -- an industry dominated until then by search engines and online ad networks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It soon became clear, however, that more was at stake in the deal than Charter's pursuit of a new revenue stream. Customers balked, and digital privacy advocates warned Congress that permitting broadband operators to monitor and sell subscriber usage records not only would jeopardize the Internet's reputation for being a largely anonymous delivery system, but also could violate electronic wiretapping law.</p><p>Internet service providers currently function largely like postal carriers, delivering messages and data from sender to receiver without opening them up to see what's inside. The technology Charter intended to use, known as deep-packet inspection, would have permitted them to read those e-mails and other collections of data. And unlike search engine companies such as Google and Yahoo, Internet service providers could connect that data to personal information about their own customers -- names, addresses and even banking records. Those companies could also tap into their customers' entire streams of Internet communication, not just what they found using a search engine. </p><p>Charter worked to reassure critics that it would not mine for that kind of data, but digital privacy advocates argued that once a service provider had such surveillance capacity, abuse was inevitable. Both the House Energy and Commerce and the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation committees held hearings and started pressuring Charter to drop its deep-packet plan. And the St. Louis-based company did so last June, mainly because the backlash had prompted many of NebuAd's prospective clients to back away, essentially forcing the fledgling company out of business. </p><p>It looked then as though an in-depth congressional intervention into the still self-regulated $23.4 billion Internet ad industry had been put off to some distant point in the future. But now that day appears to be drawing near. Although Internet service providers remain on the sidelines for now, Google and Yahoo are barreling ahead with ever more sophisticated tools to capture marketable information about their users. At the same time, the Obama administration says it wants to see a digitalization of more personal information, such as health records, theoretically making even more intimate data accessible online. </p><p>As a result, momentum is again building in Congress to write a law protecting the privacy rights of Internet users. Captaining the effort is Virginia Democrat Rick Boucher, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Communications, Technology and the Internet. He plans to introduce legislation to curb commercial intrusions of online privacy this summer. North Dakota Democrat Byron L. Dorgan, who led the Senate's hearings on the topic last year, is considering a similar move. </p><h>The Customized Come-on</h><p>Telecommunications analysts expect that when the Boucher bill is unveiled, it will trigger a series of confrontations among big-tech players -- first over whether the behavioral ad community will dig in against any new legal restrictions, and then over what kind of new laws or regulations are needed.</p><p>While the issue may be new to many in Congress, behavioral advertising has been around for more than a decade. Web companies and advertisers started out by using \"cookies\" -- bits of code that Web browsers generate to identify each computer on which that browser is installed -- to follow consumers' activities on those browsers. At the outset the practice seemed more annoying than threatening, but like most Web features, it became much more sophisticated over time. By the mid-1990s, search engines and Web browsers stepped advertising up a notch by tying marketing to search keywords. Later, Web-based e-mail services from Google, Yahoo and others started searching their customers' e-mails for keywords that prompted thematically related advertisements to appear on the screen beside the e-mail in-box.</p><p>Such come-ons can be unnerving, but many people were willing to dismiss them as a fairly benign consequence of using a free e-mail service. It was only when NebuAd's deal focused attention on broadband providers -- and their far greater access to subscriber Internet activity and personal data -- that opposition started getting broad political traction. </p><p>\"Folks in the privacy community were already talking about this stuff, but it was the Internet service provider model that finally caught the eye of legislators and the public,\" said Alissa Cooper, the chief computer scientist at the Center for Democracy and Technology, a privacy advocacy group.</p><p>While broadband providers have stepped back from behavioral advertising for now, Web-based search engines are plunging ahead. In March, Google started to develop profiles gauging users' interests and potential spending patterns. For instance, by following search terms and tracking where searchers go among the hundreds of thousands of Web sites that participate in the company's AdSense program, the search engine can readily peg a person as a political junkie or a potential homebuyer  and target what ads they see accordingly. </p><p>When Google unveiled its most recent behavioral advertising plans, it gave users the right to see and edit their Google-generated profiles. It also gave them a way to avoid being tracked entirely. The trouble, privacy advocates say, is that many people aren't paying close enough attention to notice. </p><p>According to polling by the Consumer Reports National Research Center, nearly two-thirds of Internet users are convinced that what they do online is private and not shared without their consent. And a majority believe -- wrongly -- that companies collecting information must identify themselves and disclose their reasons for gathering data, together with any plans to share information with other organizations.</p><p>\"Many consumers have misconceptions about the information available about them and how commonly it is sold by companies without their knowledge,\" said Joel Kelsey, a Consumers Union telecommunications policy analyst. Such mistaken assumptions, he said, reflect a broader desire among users to retain control of their personal information online. </p><h>A Self-Regulating Market?</h><p>Preserving that sense of control is a chief aim of the legislation Boucher is contemplating. His goal, he says, is to make the consent process as overt as possible. \"Every Internet user has the right to disclosure of what information is being collected about them and how it is used,\" he said. \"And they should have the opportunity to act on the information.\"</p><p>Much of the debate behind the scenes on Capitol Hill is about whether to legislate a requirement that behavioral advertisers must obtain a consumer's consent before monitoring online conduct. But privacy advocates contend that such an \"opt in\" would be meaningless if it were obtained by forcing people to frustratingly point and click their way through screens of fine print. </p><p>While lawmakers wrestle with online privacy protections, industry interests will be vigilantly defending the market benefits of behavioral advertising. </p><p>In these early phases of skirmishing over prospective legislation, the telephone and cable lobbies, which represent the country's largest broadband providers -- such as AT&amp;T Inc. and Comcast Corp. -- are staking out a laissez-faire position. They argue that if they go into the behavioral advertising business they will do a good job policing themselves on privacy issues because it's in their own interest to maintain customer trust. What's more, they contend, Internet interests can develop more smartly designed privacy applications than those likely to be inspired by federal legislation. </p><p>Industry advocates point to the recent battle over social-networking site Facebook's ill-fated attempt to change its privacy policy as a case study in user policing. When Facebook Inc. revised its terms-of-service agreement with users to forever secure profile information for advertising purposes -- even after they had stopped using the site -- a sharp-eyed blogger cried foul, and more than 40,000 subscribers successfully petitioned the company for a reversal. The petitioners also got a formal apology from founder Mark Zuckerberg, who said the site's philosophy \"is that people own their information and control who they share it with.\"</p><p>Still, whatever Congress moves to do will be pegged to growing public awareness of threats to online privacy. \"It's clear that the technology exists to monitor where consumers go and what they do on the Internet. It's also clear that a lot of companies are looking to monetize it,\" says Jessica Rosenworcel, senior communications counsel for the Senate Commerce panel. \"What is less clear is what consumers are aware of and what they're comfortable with.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOR FURTHER READING:</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Boucher and online advertisers, CQ Weekly, p. 704; Obama's high-tech priorities, 2008 CQ Weekly, p. 3187; online policy challenges, 2007 CQ Weekly,  p. 2017. </emphasis></p><p>Source: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CQ Weekly</emphasis><br/>The definitive source for news about Congress.<br/>\u00a92009 Congressional Quarterly Inc.

However, deepfakes are rapidly becoming part of the zeitgeist.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There is good reason for this. Deepfakes hit all of the buzz words. They epitomise disruptive technological development, representing an innovative and readily understandable way that AI can be used to create something we are all familiar with.</p><p>Deepfakes also capture the public imagination. The BBC TV series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Capture</emphasis>, for example, released at around the time of iProov's survey in late 2019, was premised on the potential to frame someone using undetectable deepfake CCTV footage.</p><p>Deepfakes have also been catapulted into the limelight by the global political landscape. In the post-Cambridge Analytica fake news era, with the US presidential campaign in full swing, the threat posed by deepfake electioneering has caught the attention of governments and regulators alike, resulting in a slew of new laws and initiatives to combat the threat. Add to this heady mix the vexed question of regulating big tech and social media and making it responsible for the content it hosts and it's no surprise that deepfakes are getting attention.</p><p>In terms of the threats deepfakes pose, the ability to detect synthesised media content is critical. The digital identity and document verification market could be worth $15 billion by 2024, according to Goode Intelligence research, so there is money to be made here.</p><p>Deepfakes are beginning to represent security risks to private companies and individuals. In August 2019 insurer EulerHermes reported that AI software had been used to imitate a CEO's voice and successfully request a fraudulent fund transfer of \u20ac220,000 from the CEO of a group company. Companies such as iProov offer technological solutions to biometric authentication. Deeptrace is another, offering a comprehensive deepfake detection tool for monitoring, detection and mitigation.</p><p>Big tech also needs to be able to detect the threat. This will become particularly important as the regulatory landscape tightens up and pressure to \"tag\" synthesised content on digital platforms increases. Indeed, big tech, academia and industry bodies are acting and collaborating to tackle the issue.</p><p>Facebook, the Partnership on AI, Microsoft, and academics from Cornell Tech, MIT, University of Oxford, UC Berkeley, University of Maryland, College Park, and University at Albany-SUNY have all come together to build the Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC), launched in 2019.</p><p>The DFDC has the stated aim of catalysing more research and development in this area to spurr researchers around the world to build innovative new technologies that can help detect deepfakes and manipulated media. The DFDC includes a data set and leaderboard, as well as grants and awards, to spur the industry to create new ways of detecting and preventing media manipulated via AI from being used to mislead others.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/></p><p>The DFDC represents an interesting example of \"open innovation\", essentially crowd-sourcing innovation with the intention of creating open source solutions. Facebook states that it has invested $10 million in the project. Challenge participants submit their code into a black box environment for testing. Open proposals are eligible for challenge prizes and must abide by the open source licensing terms. Closed proposals are possible and will be proprietary but those participants will not be eligible to accept the prizes. $1 million in prizes is available and the competition ends 31 March 2020.</p><p>Part of the challenge in reliable deepfake detection is the availability of datasets. Big tech has the data capability and the financial weight and it appears willing to use that for detection challenges. Google released a dataset of synthetic speech in support of another international challenge, this one on automatic speaker verification (fake audio detectors). After the challenge the dataset was made freely available to the public. Google has since released a large dataset of visual deepfakes which have been incorporated into the new FaceForensics benchmark (which Google co-sponsors). This dataset too is now available, free to the research community, for use in developing synthetic video detection methods on the FaceForensics github page.</p><p>To be useable the datasets need to be obtained with proper consent. Google reports that it paid consenting actors to record hundreds of videos and then, using publicly available deepfake generation methods, created thousands of deepfakes from these videos. Similarly Facebook was at pains to point out that it commissioned the DFDC dataset in the same manner and that no Facebook user data was used in this dataset. </p><p>With the financial and other pressures and incentives driving deepfake detection technology development, the need for datasets and the contrast between the big tech's open source versus the specialised tech companies closed proprietary technology models, it remains to be seen where all of this will land. One thing is for sure, any bad actors intent on using deepfake technology will be trying to stay one step ahead in this particular race.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Joanna Conway is a partner, and Oriana Williams an associate, at technology and digital specialist law firm, Kemp Little LLP</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMPTG-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMPTG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC0-FYB1-JCDG-R1X0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172297</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"898\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Incisive Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Computing</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33179\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 4, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009A40</classCode><className>EULER HERMES SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS524126 DIRECT PROPERTY &amp;

That was 2018, and 2019 won't be any easier for the big tech companies: The so-called Techlash - a word created from technology and \"backlash\" - has only just begun.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From the European Union's investigations into Amazon and Facebook to potential data protection laws in the US, wherever you look, the laissez-faire policy on technology comes to an end.</p><p>The list of regulatory disputes to come in 2019 is long. With so many locations, it's easy to lose sight of the big picture. That's why there are four tech forecasts here that should determine the year 2019:</p><p>1. Technical nationalism</p><p>The days when technology was supposed to save the world are over. National legislators are more interested in how tech companies help them, either by paying more taxes, as in France, or by the government supporting local technology companies and investing in their jobs and know-how.</p><p>It is also to be expected that politicians will take a closer look at who buys local tech companies. The battle for talent, intellectual property and investment is growing as the digital industry grows in importance. And the era of digital collaboration will reach its limits once national governments adopt their own laws for the Internet age.</p><p>2. Data as toxic good</p><p>Data is the oil of the 21st century. This sentence has long since become a clich\u00e9. Now that stricter data protection rules have come into force in Europe, the huge data pot is becoming less attractive. Nevertheless, it still feeds the digital advertising industry and keeps the digital economy running as a cash cow.</p><p>Competition authorities are already investigating whether the Facebook, Google, and Amazon data collections violate competition law. The first fines under the DSGVO are expected to be imposed in the second half of the year. As new data breaches and hacker attacks come to light every day, these huge data treasures could become a problem child for companies.</p><p>3. The public wakes up</p><p>It has been shown that parliamentarians are much more critical of technologies than their technology-oriented voters. In the new year, consumers are also increasingly losing confidence in the Silicon Valley groups. In view of the increasing regulatory pressure, this development is likely to gain further momentum. Of course, the tech giants don't immediately lose their customers. But from Lyon to Los Angeles, people are asking themselves what role companies should play in their everyday lives. The fact is that the optimistic curiosity that has surrounded the tech industry for years is being lost.</p><p>4. Fake News column more</p><p>Elections are scheduled for May in the EU and India, with a record number of voters. In 2019, the biggest test to date of how social media companies and governments worldwide deal with fake news will take place. Online trolls - both those who want to make fast money and those funded by foreign governments - have evolved and adapted their strategy to stay one step ahead. They now use messaging services like WhatsApp, which are hard to monitor because of built-in encryption, and unregulated social media sites like Instagram, whose user policies don't adapt fast enough to fraudsters.</p><p>A word to remember for 2019: Deep fakes - deceptively real looking pictures or videos of celebrities saying or doing horrible things. Behind this are artificial intelligence and machine learning. And: Will the stream of fake news decide another election? You can hardly predict that. After all, the reputation of politicians and tech groups is equally at stake. If they fail, especially in connection with elections, this should further polarise the electorate.</p><p> In cooperation with POLITICO  </p><p>Note: This article has been translated automatically.</p><p> Translated from English by Anna Friedrich. </p><p><link service=\"ATTACHMENT\"><marker>Document original</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"ASVWE20190107DWBEHPWIRTSCHAFTCS5LRQP91TEXT\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"14993\"/></locatorParameters></locator></link></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic/></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DIEWEN-161692907</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DIEWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V9G-5CK1-DY2B-S1F3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">465485</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"645\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Axel Springer SE All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Die Welt (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12658\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>Ausg. 5</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 7, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Hany Farid knows Barack Obama better than anyone - except, perhaps, the former president's wife. He has dissected every tic, every subtle sharpening of his crow's feet, his gaze towards the floor that inevitably comes before he delivers bad news. In all, Farid has catalogued 576 hours of footage of Obama speaking - equal to 3\u00bd weeks of video - sliced it into 10-second chunks and studied it as if it were the Zapruder footage of JFK's assassination.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Farid is not a stalker. The professor at the University of California, Berkeley, is one of the world's foremost digital forensics specialists, and his deep dive into Obama's face is part of a frantic effort to combat a menace as devastating as anything since the dawn of the internet: deepfakes, or videos altered using artificial intelligence (AI), which show people doing and saying things they haven't.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since the technology emerged in a dark corner of the web two years ago, it has advanced in leaps and bounds. What was once the preserve of Hollywood studios is now available to anyone with a decent graphics processor and internet connection.</p><p>\"Anything can be faked,\" laments Farid, sitting in his spartan office inside the School of Information, a grand brick building in the shadow of Berkeley's famed bell tower. His work on Obama, a common target, led him to invent a new detection method. But it is an uphill battle. \"This technology is something you can now just download from GitHub [a popular online community that hosts free open-source software]. It will run for a few hours or a day, and it will just generate it for you automatically. Eventually it's going to be something you can just download in an app,\" Farid says. \"That's where we're headed.\"</p><p>In China, one already exists. Zao, which was released earlier this year, transplants a user's face to surprising effect onto actors in famous films: Leonardo DiCaprio in Titanic, for example.</p><p>Deepfakes are most commonly employed, however, to place the faces of A-list female stars such as Gal Gadot, Emma Watson and Ariana Grande onto hardcore pornography. According to research from Deeptrace Labs, a Dutch cyber-security company, about 96% of all deepfake videos are pornographic. But the potential uses reach beyond the seedy side of the web and are already leaking into politics, society and even business.</p><p>In the past few months, videos have appeared online to showcase the technology's power. Boris Johnson was seen to endorse Jeremy Corbyn in the election; the US comedian Bill Hader morphed into Tom Cruise on a late-night talk show and Mark Zuckerberg confessed his grand plan to manipulate the masses. \"The more you express yourself,\" said the Facebook billionaire in a doctored video from June, \"the more we own you.\"</p><p>Faked videos themselves are only part of the problem. The growing ease with which they are made dents our faith in a much deeper way. Andrew Gully, a technical research manager at Jigsaw, the division of Google tasked with fighting the darkest elements of the internet, explains: \"The most dangerous, insidious thing about deepfakes is not necessarily whether people will believe them or not, it's the fact that they hack everybody's understanding of what is true and what is not.\"</p><p>The result is what many in the field refer to as the \"liar's dividend\": anyone can plausibly claim that any recording - a video that would otherwise end a political campaign or career, for example - is fake. \"Our historical belief that video and audio are reliable records of reality is no longer tenable,\" writes Giorgio Patrini, the founder of Deeptrace Labs.</p><p>And so a quiet arms race is unfolding. On one side is a rapidly growing community of hobbyists, developers, fraudsters and political opponents who recognise the power of deepfakes to swing an election, embarrass a lover or manipulate financial markets. On the other side are artists, academics, Big Tech platforms and civil society organisations that are racing to come up with tools - and laws - to counter the problem.</p><p>Dan Coats, then the US director of national intelligence, warned this year that the technology will surely be deployed in the misinformation wars, \"to augment influence campaigns directed against the United States and our allies and partners\". It is hard to imagine that the American war machine will not be availing itself of such a powerful cyber-weapon. Indeed, it has already tried.</p><p>Misinformation is not new, nor is using the tools of the day to disseminate it. The newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst reportedly told an artist working for his New York Journal back in 1897: \"You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war.\" In the 1990s, Photoshop made it easy to doctor pictures. Russian bot armies helped sow division via fake social media accounts in the 2016 US presidential election.</p><p>Farid argues, however, that the deepfake phenomenon is different. \"Video was the last bastion of trust,\" he says. \"Ten years ago, if in a court of law you presented me with a three-minute video of somebody doing something, I'd say it was nearly impossible to fake. I can't say that any more. How do you have democracy if you don't have shared facts?\" What makes it even more dangerous, however, is social media, which provides a distribution platform that is unique in human history. \"We've got 1bn uploads to Facebook a day, 500 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, a couple of billion tweets a day,\" Farid says. \"The landscape is very, very complicated.\"</p><p>Adam Schiff, the Democratic congressman who led the Trump impeachment hearings, recently warned developers of deepfake technology: \"This is a Pandora's box you're opening.\"</p><p>It all began on Reddit. On November 2, 2017, a user with the handle \"deepfakes\" created a forum on the social media and discussion group website and uploaded pornographic videos with the digitally transplanted faces of female celebrities such as Scarlett Johansson. Reddit took down the forum three months later, but Pandora's box had been cracked.</p><p>Today, deepfake development is a cottage industry. According to Deeptrace Labs, more than 100,000 people spread across 20 known deepfake forums are toiling away, day in, day out, uploading code libraries for free, allowing others to tweak, improve and share algorithms that are, at an astounding speed, getting better at automatically crafting faked videos. Portals have cropped up to offer custom deepfakes for as little as $3. All they require is 250 pictures of the chosen person and two days of processing. A customised voice-cloning service sells synthetic audio for $10 for every 50 words. We're all vulnerable, explains Britt Paris, an assistant professor of informatics at Rutgers University, New Jersey. \"With thousands of images of many of us online, in the cloud and on our devices, anyone with a public social media profile is fair game to be faked.\"</p><p>In practical terms, it is almost always women who are targeted. \"That the new technology's first notable amateur output depicts one woman engaged in a sex act without her consent highlights how the use of technology can be wielded as harassment or harm individuals,\" Paris says. There are a growing number of cases where \"regular people\" are being targeted. The Indian investigative journalist Rana Ayyub, for example, was the victim of a brutal online smear campaign that saw her appear in a faked pornographic video.</p><p>Even to one of its founding fathers, the speed with which deepfake technology is being democratised is surprising. Hao Li, a professor at the University of Southern California who has been dubbed the world's \"top deepfake artist\" by the MIT Technology Review, was drawn into this world by tragedy.</p><p>On November 30, 2013, Paul Walker, the square-jawed star of the Fast &amp; Furious film franchise, was driving at nearly 100mph when he ploughed into an electricity pylon in Santa Clarita, California. His Porsche Carrera GT nearly sheared in two and burst into flames. He and his passenger died, and the Hollywood producers had a problem.</p><p>Shooting for the latest instalment of the film series, Furious 7, was only half complete. So they called Li, who had begun to make a name for himself for his ability to digitise faces. \"It was a cool project,\" Li recalls. \"There were already a lot of people making movies with realistic digital humans, but the thing that was really new was Walker was young, people knew what he looked like and the settings weren't dark. It was always pretty bright.\" Li, who wears his bleached hair in a mohawk that cascades down the side of his head, had the added challenge of creating a digital Paul Walker that would be convincing to audiences watching the film on 90ft cinema screens.</p><p>In short, he had little room for error. So Li assembled a team and went about developing an on-set facial-tracking system to composite Walker's face onto the body of one of his two brothers or a stuntman acting out his part. He created new ways to get algorithms to do what previously would be painstakingly carried out by animators.</p><p>It worked. Li's digital confection was in more than 200 scenes, and no one was the wiser. Furious 7 grossed $1.5bn. \"You need a project like that to show it is possible. You needed a budget like that,\" he says.</p><p>Creating a walking, talking digital likeness of Walker took months and millions of dollars. The Star Wars franchise has since been able to regenerate the characters played by Peter Cushing and Carrie Fisher. Today, many of the core technologies that Li developed have been refined and are now out in the wild, available for free download.</p><p>Big Tech is belatedly scrambling to rein it all in. In September, Google Research and the Google division Jigsaw released to the public hundreds of deepfake videos featuring paid actors that the companies themselves had produced. The goal, says Jigsaw's Gully, was to provide researchers with material on which to train detection tools. \"We have a pretty strong geopolitical nexus to a lot of the work we do,\" Gully says. \"With deepfakes in particular, the potential malicious use cases became clear.\"</p><p>Dessa, a Toronto-based AI start-up, has created one of the world's best synthetic voice systems. Its computer-generated Sir David Attenborough can wax lyrical about the Serengeti, or tell you to wash the dishes. But what really got Dessa noticed was <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fakejoerogan.com\">www.fakejoerogan.com</url>, a website that plays algorithmically manufactured audio clips that are indistinguishable from the bombastic podcast host Joe Rogan.</p><p>Dessa pulled it offby training its RealTalk speech generator with hours of Rogan's shows. In a statement, Dessa co-founder Ragavan Thurairatnam says it was an attempt to \"get the public to take notice of just how realistic deepfakes were becoming, and to understand the tremendous implications at hand for society as a result\". He adds: \"The unfortunate reality is that, at some time in the near future, deepfake audio and video will be weaponised.\"</p><p>Thurairatnam speaks from experience. One of Dessa's biggest fans is the CIA, which asked to buy the technology. What it wanted to do with it was not clear. Dessa politely turned the US spy agency down.</p><p>Washington is not just viewing it as a weapon; it is putting up defence as well. In 2016, Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (Darpa), the Pentagon's research arm, launched Media Forensics, or MediFor, to fund researchers working on ways to catch manipulated imagery. The initiative predated deepfakes, but the technology is now its primary focus.</p><p>Facebook is also tackling the problem, announcing in September the $10m Deepfake Detection Challenge in partnership with Oxford University, MIT, UC Berkeley and other esteemed academic institutions. Under the scheme, it too will create a dataset of faked videos, offering cash prizes for participants who come up with the best ways of exposing them. Farid applauds the efforts, but says such schemes point to the gravity of the situation. \"What do you do when you can't solve a problem? You create a dataset, and have someone else solve it,\" he says.</p><p>Indeed, despite efforts around the world, the ability to produce deepfakes is evolving far faster than our ability to uncover them. Nick Dufour of Google Research likens it to the Red Queen hypothesis in biology, which explains how species stave offextinction. \"When you have two species interacting in the same environment, they're always co-evolving. One is driving the other, and we're seeing a similar kind of thing here. Detection methods that worked well last year don't work that well any more.\"</p><p>There is a reason for this. Take \"face swaps\", a common form of deepfake. Most are produced using generative adversarial networks, or gans. These systems contain two competing neural networks, known as the generator and the discriminator.</p><p>The generator network's job is to produce a convincing image for every frame of footage - replacing Jennifer Lawrence's face with Steve Buscemi's, for example. Meanwhile the discriminator network compares the faked footage with real video and hunts for flaws, or \"artefacts\" as they are known in the field. The systems work in a tight loop, whirring away and learning from each other until the artefacts are smoothed out and the system produces a passable fake.</p><p>The problem is that the primary method of exposing doctored content relies on discriminator tools that are at the heart of how many deepfakes are generated - and they are self-improving. \"If you have this detector, you can basically train another one to fool it,\" Li says. \"At some point it has to converge to something where you get every pixel right, and it's practically impossible to detect.\"</p><p>We are not at perfection yet, and that is reason for hope, says Gully. Watch a typical deepfake and you can tell that something is off. Perhaps the image is blurry around the edges. Or, as is often the case, the person's mouth moves in ways that don't align with the words they are saying. (The lips not touching when someone says a word starting with \"B\", \"P\" or \"M\" is a telltale sign.) In those rough edges lies opportunity, which is why so much time and money is being poured in now, before the process becomes too advanced - and truly automatic. \"There tends to be a bit of hyperbole out there that someone would be able to create a large amount of deepfakes at scale and with ease,\" Gully says. \"There's still a tremendous amount of tuning and tweaking that one really has to do in order to create something that's ultra-realistic.\"</p><p>The Pentagon is not complacent. In recognition that it is falling behind, Darpa this year launched a follow-on effort to MediFor called Semantic Forensics, or SemaFor. In its solicitation for bids, it admits that \"purely statistical detection methods are quickly becoming insufficient for detecting falsified media assets\".</p><p>The goal of this new initiative is to create a class of tools that look at deepfakes more holistically. Rather than focusing on minute \"artefacts\", they might step back and check for subtle inconsistencies that are common in deepfakes, such as mismatched earrings. The underlying conceit is that a producer of a deepfake would need to get every detail right, while only a single mistake would need to be detected to expose it. In military speak, those failures \"provide an opportunity for defenders to gain an asymmetric advantage\".</p><p>This digital deception arms race brings to mind the inspiration for the Red Queen theory: Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass. Seeking to explain this strange new place, Looking-Glass Land, the Red Queen tells Alice: \"Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.\"</p><p>eremy Corbyn had had enough.</p><p>JAfter a bruising campaign, the Labour leader finally decided to throw in the towel. In a video address last month, he urged all party members to back Boris Johnson, \"a prime minister that works for the many and not for the few\".</p><p>The video, published weeks before the December 12 election, was created by Barnaby Francis, who works under the pseudonym Bill Posters. The British video artist is behind some of the best-known deepfakes, including a viral Zuckerberg clip this summer in which the Facebook founder refers to his \"control of billions of people's stolen data\".</p><p>Francis says the Corbyn stunt had a clear goal: to expose how ill-suited Britain's \"Victorian\" regulations are for a society in which AI-generated videos threaten to catapult us into a post-truth world. \"We hacked the personas of UK politicians to make a visceral point - that these new forms of computational propaganda need to be understood and restricted,\" he says.</p><p>In the tech giants' long war against regulation, deepfakes may prove to be their Waterloo. The internet has been built on two pillars. The first is a purist technoutopianism, which holds that if you can build something, even if it is a frighteningly powerful tool, you should, because technology is inherently good. The second is a clause in the 1996 Communications Decency Act, called section 230, which has allowed the techno-utopians to pursue their wildest ambitions without any worry that they will be held legally responsible if it all goes pear-shaped. Specifically, section 230 absolves tech companies of any liability for content posted on their sites by others. It is the foundation upon which Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Google and YouTube have built their empires.</p><p>When section 230 was passed, fewer than 10% of American or British adults even had access to the internet. As the web morphed into a utility at the centre of billions of people's lives, Big Tech clung to section 230 for dear life, because the alternative, being liable for what 2bn individuals might post on your site, was too scary to countenance.</p><p>That hands-offapproach to policing their own domains has become increasingly problematic, leading to bizarre episodes such as the one that unfolded on Facebook this summer. A video of Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, purported to show her slurring her words, apparently drunk. The footage was a so-called \"shallow fake\" because it was not digitally altered, simply slowed down. YouTube removed it.</p><p>Facebook refused to take it down, however, because it somehow did not violate terms of service that expressly prohibit posting \"misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent\" content. Zuckerberg tied himself into knots in October, admitting that he was worried about an \"erosion of truth\" while defending the company's decision to let politicians lie in political ads on the platform.</p><p>What happens when we can all fabricate video with a few swipes on an easy-to-use app? When deepfakes are generated in their millions? Farid, who testified before Congress this summer, is hopeful that peeling back section 230's blanket immunity has become one of those rare issues where both parties agree.</p><p>\"If we don't change the way we think about social media's responsibility with respect to news, political campaigns, civil unrest, online revenge porn and so on, this is all for nothing,\" he says. \"The margins are really thin. Most nations are very divided. If you release something 48 hours before an election, it doesn't matter if we figure out it's fake - it's going to work.\" n</p><p>Deepfakes most commonly place the faces of A-list female stars onto hardcore pornography.

Zuckerberg and Facebook have long been hostile to greater scrutiny and regulation, preferring to develop the social network in an opaque greenhouse of secret algorithms and advertising formulas far away from public or corporate scrutiny.</p><p>But Zuckerberg knew this week he had to welcome the concept of greater regulatory oversight of Facebook as a part of his public contrition for all that had gone wrong with his company during the past two years.</p><p>\"My position is not that there should be no regulation. The real question is what is the right regulation,\" Zuckerberg said when asked why his company should be trusted to self-regulate. During his second day of congressional testimony on Wednesday, he conceded regulation of the tech sector was now \"inevitable\".</p><p>The 33-year-old billionaire even claimed it was \"certainly worth discussing\" whether US tech giants should be subjected to far stricter privacy laws such as those that will be introduced in Europe next month.</p><p>The irony is that tech giants have been spending growing amounts of money to lobby Washington against regulating their industry. Google spent more last year than any other US company to influence the White House and congress. Amazon also lifted its lobbying spend in Washington by 16 per cent to $US13 million ($16.7m), Apple lifted its budget by 51 per cent to $US7m and Facebook's lobbying bill rose 32 per cent to a record $US11m.</p><p>However, Zuckerberg has little choice but to swallow some bitter pills in an effort to restore his credibility and that of Facebook in the face of scandals over the misuse of data, the company's cavalier attitude to privacy and allowing nefarious players from Russian intelligence to neo-Nazis to exploit the platform.</p><p>The question is whether Zuckerberg's unreserved apology to congress for his mismanagement of Facebook can be believed. As Thune said: \"After more than a decade of promises, how is today's apology different?\" The Washington Post this week published a long list of Zuckerberg's public apologies since 2003 including ones from 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010 and 2014, and then the recent slew over the Cambridge Analytica data breach scandal.</p><p>\"It reads like a record on repeat,\" the Post said.</p><p>\"Zuckerberg, who made 'move fast and break things' his slogan, says sorry for being naive, then promises solutions such as privacy 'controls', 'transparency' and better policy 'enforcement'. And then he promises it the next time. All the while, Facebook's access to our personal data increases and little changes about the way Zuckerberg handles it.\" Zuckerberg defends himself by claiming that many of these mistakes were inevitable given the frenetic growth of Facebook, which after 14 years of existence hosts about 2.2 billion daily users worldwide.</p><p>\"We have made a lot of mistakes in running the company. I think it is pretty much impossible to start a company in your dorm room and grow it to be at the scale we are now without making some mistakes,\" he told congress.</p><p>\"Overall we are going through a broader philosophical shift in how we approach our responsibilities as a company. For the first 10 or 12 years as a company I viewed our responsibility as primarily building tools, and if we could put those tools in people's hands then that would empower people to do good things.</p><p>\"What we have learned now across a number of issues, not just privacy but also fake news and foreign interference in elections, is we need to take a more proactive role and a broader view of our responsibility. It's not enough to just to build tools, we need to make sure they are used for good.\" This time Zuckerberg insists he is not the boy who cried wolf and that he really is sorry. In his appearance on Capitol Hill, Zuckerberg not only apologised for his own mistakes, he also went further than he has previously towards accepting responsibility for what appears on Facebook rather than insisting it is a neutral technology, as he has done in the past.</p><p>\"I agree we're responsible for the content, but we don't produce the content,\" Zuckerberg said. \"When people ask us whether we're a media company or a publisher, what they're getting at is: do we feel responsible for the content on our platform? I think the answer is clearly yes.\" But Facebook and other big tech companies are fearful that congress may consider repealing legal protections dating back to the 1990s that mean tech giants generally cannot be held legally responsible for the bad behaviour of those who use their platforms.</p><p>Congress recently voted to end the legal immunity for websites that facilitate online sex trafficking. This has led to speculation that it may go further and chip away legal protections for companies such as Facebook that do not properly police their platforms.</p><p>\"I think it is a wake-up call,\" Thune said when asked about the issue. \"In the future tech companies have to understand that it's not the wild west and they have to exercise responsibility.\" As expected, Zuckerberg was assailed from all sides during two days of often hostile questioning by Senate committees and then by house committees.</p><p>In calm and measured tones, he explained how Facebook waded into each scandal and how he bore ultimate responsibility. He also described a raft of new measures he has introduced that he believes will prevent the future abuse of Facebook.</p><p>Zuckerberg described the series of errors Facebook made in not pursuing the analytics firm Cambridge Analytica in 2015 to ensure that it had erased the data on 87 million users that it had improperly obtained. He also admitted this week that his own data had been compromised as a result of the controversy. \"We considered it a closed case,\" he said. \"In retrospect, that was clearly a mistake. We shouldn't have taken their word for it.\" As a result, he said, Facebook would trawl through \"tens of thousands\" of third-party apps to make sure there was not another Cambridge Analytica out there. The process raises the possibility that Facebook will uncover more examples of misuse of its data in the months ahead.</p><p>Zuckerberg used his testimony to outline a range of measures to better identify bad players such as the Russian trolls who used Facebook to plant disinformation aimed at influencing the 2016 US presidential election in favour of Donald Trump.</p><p>\"We were too slow to stop Russian interference and we're working hard to get better,\" he said.</p><p>\"I don't want anyone to use our tools to undermine democracy, that's not what we stand for.\" Zuckerberg also was hit with questions about whether Facebook was too left-leaning and was guilty of censoring conservative political views.</p><p>During a fiery five minutes, Texas Republican Ted Cruz took Zuckerberg to task, accusing Facebook of a \"pervasive pattern of political bias\" against conservatives.</p><p>Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook's home base of Silicon Valley in California was \"an extremely left-leaning place\" but denied that Facebook has acted as a booster for liberal politics.</p><p>\"Our goal is certainly not to engage in political speech,\" he said. \"I'm very committed to making sure Facebook is a platform for all ideas.\" The broad view in Washington after Zuckerberg's two days of testimony was that he did as well as could be expected and that he didn't inflict further damage on Facebook's reputation.</p><p>The well-coached Zuckerberg was appropriately contrite, unfailingly polite in the face of hostile questioning and more forthcoming than he has been in the past with his answers.</p><p>But he still failed to properly explain his company's business model, leaving many members of congress visibly confused.</p><p>Senators also appeared sceptical that the new measures Zuckerberg introduced to safeguard personal data, improve piracy and police Facebook against abuse would work.</p><p>The question now is: what will congress do? The public mood for better regulation of Facebook is higher than ever.</p><p>A Gallup poll this week found that 43 per cent of Americans are \"very concerned\" about Facebook's invasions of privacy - an increase of 13 per cent since 2011, when Gallup conducted a similar poll.</p><p>But members of congress, particularly Republicans, traditionally have been adverse to imposing corporate regulations on the tech sector. Some of them are content to leave it to the government's chief privacy regulator, the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>The FTC is already conducting an investigation into Facebook's privacy practices and whether the tech giant may have breached its 2011 deal with the agency concerning user privacy.</p><p>But potential legislative options include trying to apply antitrust powers to police the misuse of data by companies such as Facebook. Congress also could pass laws requiring such companies to fully disclose how they collect, share and use consumer data.</p><p>Each of these options is fraught with legal and ethical minefields and may be difficult to win bipartisan agreement on.</p><p>As such, new laws to regulate the tech sector will take many months, if not years, to pass, by which time they may be redundant in the face of the fast-moving tech industry and tech trends.</p><p>The mostly aged members of congress also are not a tech-savvy bunch and are poorly placed to debate meaningful regulation of the tech giants.</p><p>In their questions this week, many congressmen betrayed a surprising lack of understanding about how Facebook works.</p><p>At times Zuckerberg was forced to explain how the social network operates, in the same basic way a grandchild may use with their grandparents.</p><p>But certainly the mood, even among many Republicans, is that more needs to be done to rein in Facebook.</p><p>As Republican senator John Kennedy of Louisiana put it during a testy exchange with Zuckerberg, \"I don't want to have to vote to regulate Facebook but by god I will.\" Democratic senator Bill Nelson of Florida was no less blunt. \"If Facebook and other online companies will not or cannot fix these privacy invasions, then we will,\" he said.</p><p>Zuckerberg's testimony this week has only highlighted the need for reforms to make Facebook and other tech giants accountable for the social and civic consequences of their creations.</p><p>Cameron Stewart is also US contributor for Sky News Australia.</p><p>2003: Mark Zuckerberg creates FaceMash, which lets fellow Harvard students vote on attractive classmates 2004: Zuckerberg launches thefacebook.com, a social network that allows users to create basic profiles including personal information and photos.

And some interesting breakthroughs have begun to emerge that could make AI accessible to many more businesses and organizations. What is the big data problem? It's the challenge of getting enough data to enable deep learning[1], a very popular and promising AI technique that allows machines to find relationships and patterns in data by themselves. </p><p>(For example, after being fed many images of cats, a deep learning program could create its own definition of what constitutes 'cat' and use that to identify future images as either 'cat' or 'not cat'. If you change 'cat' to 'customer,' you can see why many companies are eager to test-drive this technology.) Deep learning algorithms often require millions of training examples to perform their tasks accurately. But many companies and organizations don't have access to such large caches of annotated data to train their models (getting millions of pictures of cats is hard enough; how do you get millions of properly annotated customer profiles \u2014 or, considering an application from the health care realm, millions of annotated heart failure events?). On top of that, in many domains, data is fragmented and scattered, requiring tremendous efforts and funding to consolidate and clean for AI training. In other fields, data is subject to privacy laws and other regulations, which may put it out of reach of AI engineers. This is why AI researchers have been under pressure over the last few years to find workarounds for the enormous data requirements of deep learning. And it's why there's been a lot of interest in recent months as several promising solutions have emerged \u2014 two that would require less training data, and one that would allow organizations to create their own training examples. Here's an overview of those emerging solutions.Hybrid AI modelsFor a good part of AI's six-decade history, the field has been marked by a rivalry between symbolic and connectionist AI. Symbolists believe AI must be based on explicit rules coded by programmers. Connectionists argue that AI must learn through experience, the approach used in deep learning. But more recently, researchers have found that by combining connectionist and symbolist models, they can create AI systems that require much less training data. In a paper presented at the ICLR conference in May, researchers from MIT and IBM introduced the 'Neuro-Symbolic Concept Learner[2],' an AI model that brings together rule-based AI and neural networks. NSCL uses neural networks to extract features from images and compose a structured table of information (called 'symbols' in AI jargon). It then uses a classic, rule-based program to answer questions and solve problems based on those symbols. By combining the learning capabilities of neural nets and the reasoning power of rule-based AI, NSCL can adapt to new settings and problems with much less data. The researchers tested the AI model on CLEVR[3], a dataset for solving visual question answering (VQA). In VQA, an AI must answer questions about the objects and elements contained in a given picture. AI models based purely on neural networks usually need a lot of training examples to solve VQA problems with decent accuracy. However, NSCL was able to master CLEVR with a fraction of the data.Few-shot learning and one-shot learningThe traditional approach to cut down training data is to use transfer learning[4], the process of taking a pretrained neural network[5] and fine-tuning it for a new task. For instance, an AI engineer can use AlexNet, an open-source image classifier trained on millions of images, and repurpose it for a new task by retraining it with domain-specific examples. Transfer learning reduces the amount of training data required to create an AI model. But it might still require hundreds of examples, and the tuning process requires a lot of trial and error. In recent months, AI researchers have been able to create techniques that can train for new tasks with far fewer examples. In May, Samsung's research lab introduced Talking Heads[6], a face animation AI model that could perform few-shot learning[7]. The Talking Heads system can animate the portrait of a previously unseen person by seeing only a few images of the subject. After training on a large dataset of face videos, the AI learns to identify and extract facial landmarks from new images and manipulate them in natural ways without requiring many examples. Another interesting project in few-shot learning is RepMet[8], an AI model developed jointly by researchers at IBM and Tel-Aviv University. RepMet uses a specialized technique to fine-tune an image classifier to detect new types of objects with as few as one image per object. This is useful in settings such as restaurants, where you want to be able to classify dishes that are unique to each restaurant without gathering too many pictures for training your AI models.Generating training data with GANsIn some domains, training examples exist, but obtaining them poses virtually insurmountable challenges. An example is health care, where data is fragmented across different hospitals and contains sensitive patient information. This makes it even more difficult for AI scientists to obtain and handle data while also remaining in compliance with regulations[9] such as GDPR and HIPAA. To solve this problem, many researchers are getting help from generative adversarial networks (GANs)[10], a technique invented by AI researcher Ian Goodfellow in 2014. GANs pit a generator and discriminator neural network against each other to create new data. Since their inception, GANs have become a hot area of research and have helped accomplish a number of remarkable feats such as creating realistic faces[11] and videos[12], and triggering a deepfake crisis[13]. But GANs can also help reduce the human effort required to gather annotated examples for training deep learning algorithms. Researchers at National Taiwan University recently created a GAN that generates electronic health records[14] to train AI models. Since the generated EHRs are purely synthetic, AI engineers who use them to train their models won't need to obtain special permissions or worry about falling afoul of privacy laws. More recently, researchers at Germany's University of Lubeck introduced a new method[15] to use GANs to synthesize high-quality medical images such as CT scans and MRIs. This new technique is memory efficient, which means it doesn't require the vast computing resources only available to large AI labs and big tech companies. Many fear that with the rise of deep learning, companies and organizations that have access to vast amounts of data will dominate. While it's hard to predict how long it will take for less-data-intensive AI models to transition from research labs to commercially available options, what can be said for sure is that as these and other similar projects emerge, we can become more hopeful that deep learning innovation will not remain limited to the likes of Google and Facebook.

But apparent bargains could turn out to be expensive if earnings expectations take a turn for the worse next year as the United States continues its trade dispute with China.</p><p>Since Apple's November forecast for a weaker-than-expected holiday shopping quarter and other reports of sluggish demand for iPhones, analysts have cut estimates for the Cupertino, California-based company's December-quarter net income by almost $1 billion.

Netflix's price/earnings multiple has dropped to 68, its lowest since 2015.</p><p>Newly enacted corporate tax cuts supercharged U.S. earnings this year, but their effect on profit growth will end in the December quarter, leading analysts on average to predict S&amp;P 500 earnings per share next year will rise 8 percent, compared to 24 percent in 2018, according to IBES data from Reflnitiv.</p><p>\"The question going into 2019 is, Are you seeing enough of a pullback in those sectors that led that would entice investors to accept the lower valuations as an opportunity?'\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial in Newark, New Jersey.</p><p>Since the U.S. stock market abruptly dropped in early October, Apple has lost a quarter of its value, and last week it relinquished its title as Wall Street's most valuable company to Microsoft.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

It might have addressed the state\u2019s chronic shortfall in education funding and looming pension deficit. It would have poured $3 billion a year into Oregon\u2019s public coffers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even in defeat, Oregonian/OregonLive readers voted Measure 97 the state\u2019s biggest business story of 2016.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We asked readers to rank the Top 5 Oregon business stories, and the failed ballot initiative handily topped Portland\u2019s dire housing crisis, Macy\u2019s decision to leave downtown Portland, and the thousands of Intel job cuts that are remaking Oregon\u2019s largest private employer. Here\u2019s their verdict:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. Measure 97</p><p>Public employee unions hatched Measure 97 as a plan to solve Oregon\u2019s persistent funding shortfalls, noting correctly that the state\u2019s businesses have one of the lowest tax burdens in the nation. Advocates pitched the initiative as a bid to make large companies pay their \u201cfair share\u201d by levying a tax on sales.</p><p>Seeking to parse the difference between a tax on sales and a sales tax proved to be a losing issue with voters, though. The unions picked a fight with the companies best positioned to wage the battle and were handily outspent in the most expensive initiative campaign in Oregon history.</p><p>The result was a crushing defeat, with Measure 97 trounced by 16 percentage points.</p><p>Still, Measure 97 will remain a major business story in 2017 as lawmakers wrestle with the state\u2019s funding deficit and businesses contemplate their role in coping with the shortfall.</p><p>2. Portland\u2019s housing crisis</p><p>Portland led the nation in rising home prices for much of the year, and rents continued to climb far faster than wages.</p><p>That\u2019s been clear for years to anyone who\u2019s bought or rented a home, or noticed all the for-sale signs spreading along residential streets.</p><p>But the issue crystallized for many this year as more people dove into a brutal housing market and tenants faced another round of rent hikes or were forced to move. And it wasn\u2019t long before a response began to take shape.</p><p>Portland voters approved a $258 million housing bond in November, dedicating a stream of revenue to building or preserving housing units affordable to low-income residents.</p><p>And this week, after the Legislature lifted a state ban on inclusionary zoning in March, which allows cities to require affordable units in market-rate housing developments, Portland approved a citywide mandate that will take effect next year.</p><p>Voters in the city also signaled their frustration in part by ousting City Commissioner Steve Novick \u2014 the first dismissal of an incumbent in 24 years \u2014 and backingpolitical novice Chloe Eudaly. The bookstore owner\u2019s campaign sprang from an online community she\u2019d built around angst over rising rents.</p><p>Housing affordability may dominate the conversation next year, too.</p><p>House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland, has said she wants to restrict evictions without cause, lift the state\u2019s ban on rent-control laws and limit rent increases. Portland\u2019s mayor-elect, Ted Wheeler, said he would pursue similar measures.</p><p>3. Macy\u2019s exits historic downtown store</p><p>In November, Macy\u2019s confirmed what many in the real estate world already knew: It will sell its store in the historic Meier &amp; Frank Building in downtown Portland, and close this spring.</p><p>The decision marks the end of an era for the building, which has housed a department store \u2014 first Meier &amp; Frank and later Macy\u2019s \u2014 since 1909.</p><p>\u201cA bit of Oregon history is lost,\u201d said Gerry Frank, whose great-grandfather helped start Meier &amp; Frank in 1857. \u201cIt was a great institution. It was the heartbeat of Portland, and people came from all over the state of Oregon to shop there.\u201d</p><p>The onetime Meier &amp; Frank flagship store still inspires nostalgia among many Oregonians, who recall the Georgian Room restaurant, the oversized clock and the seasonal Santaland. Film legend Clark Gable once worked there, selling ties.</p><p>Macy\u2019s parent company bought Meier &amp; Frank in 2005, and the store was remodeled and rebranded in 2007.</p><p>Now, the five floors that Macy\u2019s occupies will become the property of KBS, a California real-estate investment group, for $54 million. The firm hopes to renovate the lower half of the building to feature street-level retail and creative office space.</p><p>4. Intel layoffs and restructuring</p><p>The world\u2019s largest chipmaker set about remaking itself in 2016, reducing its dependence on the fading PC market to focus on data centers and, to a much lesser degree, emerging technologies such as drones and autonomous cars.</p><p>The result was a wrenching transition that eliminated 15,000 jobs between May and September, with cutbacks potentially continuing into 2017. Most employees left through buyouts or early retirement programs, but at least 2,300 U.S. workers lost their jobs to layoffs \u2014 including 784 in Washington County.</p><p>Intel\u2019s layoffs skewed older, with workers over 40 more than twice as likely to lose their jobs as younger ones.</p><p>Accompanying the transition, Intel overhauled its executive ranks. Last year it hired a new president, Murthy Renduchintala, from communications chipmaker Qualcomm. In 2016, it hired a new chief information officer, a new chief financial officer, and a new vice president for the nascent Internet of Things business.</p><p>Amid all the upheaval, Intel forecasts sales will grow 6.1 percent in 2016, its best results since 2011. Shares were up about 7 percent for the year \u2014 10 percent if you adjust for dividends paid. That tracks with 11.1 percent growth in the S&amp;P 500 during the year.</p><p>5. Billion-dollar deals (tie)</p><p>The Portland area\u2019s aging cluster of big tech companies is on the cusp of extinction.</p><p>The Silicon Forest got its name from a concentration of electronics hardware companies, most of which grew out of Tektronix. As their technologies aged, though, and electronics manufacturing moved to Asia, the regional tech industry couldn\u2019t keep up.</p><p>The selloff began in 2007, when Tektronix itself was sold to an East Coast conglomerate. It picked up in 2014, when TriQuint Semiconductor was acquired by a rival for $5 billion in stock.</p><p>Then, in 2016, the Silicon Forest really unloaded. This year alone, Cascade Microtech ($352 million), FEI Co. ($4.2 billion), Lattice Semiconductor ($1.3 billion), Mentor Graphics ($4.5 billion) and Electric Lightwave ($1.4 billion) all found new owners (some deals will not close until 2017).</p><p>The issue isn\u2019t that these aging tech businesses sold out \u2014 they were old, serving narrow markets, and some were under intense investor pressure to deal. The issue is that Oregon tech has produced no other large companies to take the place of businesses started 20, 30 or 40 years ago.</p><p>As the tech industry moved away from Oregon\u2019s specialty in hardware and manufacturing in the years following the dot-com bust, the state initially lacked the expertise to compete in the emerging fields of software and internet services.</p><p>Those skills came, in time, and Oregon tech employment is at its highest point in many years. But the state\u2019s tech landscape is now dominated by out-of-state companies that established Portland outposts to capitalize on the city\u2019s relatively low operating costs.</p><p>If Oregon\u2019s only advantage is price, though, what happens if the tech economy turns south \u2014 or if Portland gets so expensive that the city is no longer a bargain?</p><p>5.

While recognizing how powerless our institutions have become in the face of Big Tech's massive lobbying power, there's an idea that's gaining traction as a viable approach to curb the societal and economic impacts of tech monopolies. The idea is to restore the core of a healthy internet ecosystem: interoperability and the revival of open protocols. Lawmakers, policy experts, and even Twitter, are advocating for tech companies to open up their platforms to enable other services and start-ups to enter the playing field. </p><p>There are different approaches to doing so and varying layers of interoperability that are possible. The overarching goal, however, would be to get rid of the worst aspects of tech monopolization and bring about a new era of competition and innovation. As a writer and nonprofit tech entrepreneur who has focused on projects promoting digital justice and community networks, I became interested in these ideas. Why do we need to extend interoperability into the application layer? How do we create new Internet standards that open up our networks and platforms in ways that invite new features and applications that better respect our individual and collective rights online? As I examined the three most likely scenarios being discussed, I realized that we had much to learn from the past. We need to revive the power of standards bodies, and ensure that they stay relevant and effective by observing known principles about how to successfully govern a commons. A Brief Overview of Interoperability and Competition What made the early Internet so exciting was how quickly it changed. Different services like bulletin board systems (BBS), email, and Internet relay chat (IRC) came about and allowed people to communicate in ways that were impossible before. That rich ecosystem of tools and services were enabled by downstream innovation. New applications and features could be built with existing technologies with or without permission from the prevailing tech companies. Yes, there were plenty of lawsuits against these start-ups back then. But people were still willing to take the risk, and there were investors that wanted to back them up. There were less onerous laws hindering experimental technologies. Perhaps most importantly, much of the Internet ran on open protocols and standards. The academics and others who initially designed the protocols wanted to build a relatively free ecosystem, so they made it possible for services to interoperate with each other. Standards bodies like the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) established shared protocols in the name of the collective interest. These institutions have helped companies and organizations come together and set rules based on agreed upon needs, making them transparent and representative of the interests of more than one stakeholder. At standards bodies, companies sit alongside non-profit organizations, educational institutions, policy experts, and academics. But standards bodies have grown increasingly inefficient and exploitable. Not only were they always slow and under-resourced, tech companies grew powerful enough to bend them to their will[1] or ignore them altogether by building walled gardens with no interoperability built into their platform (besides providing some public APIs with varying[2] levels[3] of consistency). In the era of Move Fast and Break Things, there was little patience for the kind of multi-stakeholder dialogue and decision-making that is required to build and conform to shared technical standards. There has been little incentive for tech companies to play well with others. Not only that, it's become the norm for tech monopolies to destroy any competition. Laws that regulate the internet such as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act[4] (DMCA) and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act [5](CFAA) have had a chilling effect on the types of innovation that was characteristic of the early internet. These regulations can be weaponized by big players to crush new start-ups over even the most trivial violations. If they don't sue them, tech companies can easily buy them out or throw all their resources into imitating the services of their smaller competitors[6] until they crush them. Now most people communicate, get news, and publish their work through closed platforms run as web services. When people think of the Internet, they think about the platforms, not the protocols that run beneath them and make them work. To many, email is Gmail, chat is Slack, and discussion forums are Facebook. Of course the underlying protocols are still core to the Internet's functionality. But these closed platforms severely lack the traits of interoperability. As we've become dependent on them, our digital lives have been left at the mercy of companies whose primary goal is to enclose as much of the Internet's infrastructure as they can get away with. Especially when it comes to social networks, their ability to mediate every aspect of our relationships and interactions online has come at an immense cost to our right to free expression, privacy, and access to knowledge. Possible Paths Towards an Interoperable Internet There are those who are calling for a revival of antitrust enforcement to break up the tech monopolies. But federal agencies in the U.S. such as the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) move too slowly and are under-resourced[7]. And then there are others who say that breaking up the tech companies is entirely the wrong approach \u2014 that we need to build protocols to again make the Internet more interoperable as it was in the early days. The European Commission, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Mozilla, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, and others are calling for a revival of interoperability as means to address Big Tech's dominance over the Internet. Among them they present three possible ways this could come about, with or without state intervention. 1) State Antitrust Enforcement Through litigation or legislative action, the state could require companies to make their platforms more open and interoperable. Mozilla's Chris Riley asserts that the agency best suited to take this on would be the FTC[8], which has the explicit mandate to protect consumer protection and enforce U.S. antitrust laws. Harold Feld of Public Knowledge calls for an entirely new agency empowered to oversee any implementation[9] of any proposed law enforcing digital platform competition, given the specific technical complexities of enforcing such a law. There is precedence for this in Europe. The European Commission brought a case against Microsoft in the early 2000's[10] that resulted in the company being required to release information enabling competing software to interoperate with Windows desktops. The U.S. and Europe have their own approaches to antitrust, of course. Interoperability enforcement would look very different depending on which state(s) had the mandate to move forward with this type of action. 2) Established Platform Companies Seek Standardization One of the big players could willingly embark on a path to build open protocols. In December, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey announced Blue Sky[11], an initiative to help develop an open and decentralized standard for social media. In his Twitter thread about the project, Dorsey says that Twitter would fund further development of an existing decentralized standard or as he says, \"create one from scratch\". Many responded to him asking about ActivityPub \u2014 the protocol behind Mastodon, the federated alternative to Twitter. Why wouldn't Twitter invest its resources into that? Dorsey responded that it might be possible, but that it's up to the Blue Sky team to decide whether that protocol would be best. It's worth pointing out that ActivityPub has already gone through discussions at the W3C[12] and is officially a recommended standard. It makes sense that a major platform would want to decentralize their platform, the most obvious reason being to relieve themselves of the responsibility over content moderation. The second reason is to fortify itself against even bigger competitors, like Facebook, that threaten to enclose even more of the Internet. 3) Building Open Protocols from Scratch Within the last seven years there's been an explosion of decentralized protocols, dealing with everything ranging from currency and commerce to social media and decision-making. We are way beyond the proof of concept stage. There are all kinds of ways to build decentralized protocols \u2014 based on gossip, distributed files, blockchains, or federated databases. The issue isn't whether decentralization is technically feasible. The issue is that there are so many ways to do it and how each protocol is appropriate for different use cases. Developer and writer Jay Graber compared a few of the most well-known decentralized social network protocols[13]. She explains the pros and cons of each protocol and how they operate. Protocols that put users in full control over their data and identity in a network can be too technically challenging for the average user. Protocols that rely on append-only logs, such as secure scuttlebutt, make it impossible to edit or delete posts. Federated networks can carry many of the same user-friendly features as centralized networks, but still leave the server administrators hosting the network with the same challenges \u2014 such as overseeing content moderation and platform security. So while protocols can be more neutral than platforms they still contain biases. This Is a Human Problem, Not a Technical One We'd expect this team not only to develop a decentralized standard for social media, but to also build open community around it, inclusive of companies ...ganizations, researchers, civil society leaders, all who are thinking deeply about the consequences, positive and negative. \u2014 jack (@jack) December 11, 2019[14]If we're talking about interoperability, we're talking about public Internet infrastructure. Open protocols and standards are part of a digital commons, and a commons thrives when people use and maintain it together. As economist Elinor Ostrom declared in her Nobel Prize winning work, commoning is a social practice[15]. What Ostrom asserted[16] was that the success or failure of a commons, or what she called a \"common-pool resource\", rested on \"how a group of principals who are in an interdependent situation can organize and govern themselves to obtain continuing joint benefits when all face temptations to free-ride, shirk or otherwise act opportunistically.\" For any type of commons, it's the relationships between those governing and relying on shared resources together that's central to its success. Standards bodies were in many ways an implementation of Ostrom's eight principles for a commons[17] \u2014 what she found were the basic elements needed for a commons to be governed sustainability and equitably. Thus Dorsey's call to build an \"open community\" around a new social media protocol is encouraging. It suggests the need to build organizations that keep various stakeholders engaged in an open dialogue about how we make social networks open and interoperable. This is the promise of a functional standards body. When they're robust and effective, they can play a critical role in ensuring that the Internet remains free, open, and equitable. Overcoming the Challenges It's exciting to see this resurgence of energy for greater interoperability. But I'm not going to let myself get too hopeful. Anyone involved in this project needs to prove that this is going to be done right. Whether due to state-driven antitrust enforcement, tech companies' self-motivation, or from the bottom up with a new decentralized protocol, the manner in which protocols come about will be critical. There are foreseeable issues with all three paths towards interoperability. Even if the government were to regulate companies, the state is feeble in the face of overpowering influence from corporate lobbyists. The revolving door that exists between private industry and public oversight bodies nearly guarantees a compromised process. Companies can't be trusted either. Independent developers have been continually burned by companies being unpredictable and negligent regarding the availability of public APIs \u2014 not to mention the hundreds of other ways they've violated public trust. Finally, nearly all of the decentralized web protocols were built by lone geniuses who collectively represent one demographic. If new protocols are to address the needs of diverse online communities, more types of people will need to be involved in their development. Internet interoperability cannot be a project embarked on for the sake of profit, power, or someone's ego. Who is or is not in the room when critical decisions are being made about the protocol will make or break whether it will succeed in bringing about a more interoperable internet. We ought to learn from experts who know what it takes to govern shared resources together. If we're serious about re-building the Internet as public infrastructure, we need to be prudent enough to assemble the types of organizations that can steward the Internet protocols of the future. \u2014 Further Reading European Commission, \"Competition Policy for the Digital Era[18]\" (April 2019)  Mozilla's \"A framework for forward-looking tech competition policy[19]\" (September 2019) Jack Dorsey, a twitter thread on Twitter's bluesky project[20] George J.

Dear president, dear deputy assistant secretary, dear excellencies and distinguished guests, dear ladies and gentlemen, let me express my gratitude to the organizers for being invited to this conference. It is my first time not only in Taiwan, but also my first time in Asia - and yet, I was given the privilege to give you the keynote speech and kick off this wonderful event. I am truly grateful for this, it is an honor. It is also my first time I will be giving such a long speech - I don't think I have ever spoken for forty minutes in one piece. I didn't know people are giving such long speeches, at least since Fidel Castro is not with us. I will try my best not to be too boring. As I mentioned, it is my first time on this continent, and therefore I feel the need to introduce myself properly. My name is Jakub Kalensk\u00fd, and I work for the US think tank Atlantic Council, you can see my profile here:<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/about/experts/list/jakub-kalensky\">https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/about/experts/list/jakub-kalensky</url>[2] I have been working in the field of disinformation since 2015, when the European Union formed the team East StratCom, which is a task force designed to counter Russia's ongoing disinformation campaign. As one of the efforts, we were trying to raise the awareness about the Kremlin's information aggression, and I was the team's lead for that. You can find the work of my previous team on the EUvsDisinfo website, and I will have a chance to mention our work further during the speech:      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://euvsdisinfo.eu\">https://euvsdisinfo.eu</url>/[3] In the Atlantic Council, I am again working on countering disinformation, and given it is a think tank and not a government institutions, we have a chance to communicate a bit more freely in certain regards. We are publishing articles and studies, and we are also promoting the work of other experts in this field on the DisinfoPortal. In case you would be interested, you can subscribe to our newsletter. If there's anyone who would like to cooperate with us, we are always open to new partnerships and new cooperation      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://disinfoportal.org\">https://disinfoportal.org</url>/[4] For quicker and less elaborate messaging, or simply for reading recommendations about the disinformation campaign, you can follow my Twitter account:      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/kalenskyj\">https://twitter.com/kalenskyj</url>[5] As I mentioned, I have been working on Russia's disinformation campaign, since I studied Russian and I know the Russian information space a bit. I have to admit I am not the top expert on the disinformation campaigns of other actors in the world. However, according to a recent study from the Princeton University, Russia is responsible for 72 per cent of all the foreign influence operations in the world - meaning all the other actors combined are responsible only for one third of what Russia is doing. It appears that increasingly, other actors in the world are adapting Russia's tactics and using the weapons that the Kremlin has been using in the past five years. I hope that the experience with this number one information aggressor will be applicable also to other information aggressors of this world. I will try to describe what are the mechanisms of the Kremlin's disinformation campaign, why is it a problem, and what can we do against it. I have elaborated these topics in my recent testimony for the US Congress, so if you want to get back to some of this, and find some more information with links to other materials on this matter, let me refer you to the testimony that we published on the DisinfoPortal:      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://disinfoportal.org/testimony-jakub-kalensky\">https://disinfoportal.org/testimony-jakub-kalensky</url>/[6] Despite talking only about the Kremlin's disinformation campaign, I sincerely hope that describing some of the mechanisms and achievements of this campaign can be helpful also here; and that some of the recommendations I have to offer might work also in other regions and against other actors. My wish would be that you would not repeat some of the mistakes we have done in Europe. I am afraid that we have underestimated the problem, and that the disinformers are achieving results that will not be easily fixed. The information aggressors are not only increasing their audience, but they are also more frequently finding 'domestic' actors who are helping them to spread their disinformation campaign. More and more visible European politicians are helping the Kremlin launder their disinformation campaign, which thus receives new legitimacy and reaches new audiences. We see that the disinformers are becoming more and more aggressive. The famous troll factory moved into three times bigger office spaces. The Kremlin's disinformation campaign is exported to new places, including Africa or Indonesia. Other actors are using similar weapons. Spreading lies and fear and hatred, manipulating audiences, and undermining and destabilizing societies - all this information warfare is apparently the favorite weapon of the last few years, and preparations are made to make it the favorite weapon of the years to come. We see that the counter-measures that Europe has undertaken so far are simply not working. Documenting the threat, communicating the threat, and talks about strengthening media literacy or about social media fixing the problem in fact do not solve the issue, these measures do not make the threat go away. They merely mitigate the consequences of the disease, and the disease symptoms; but they do nothing against the virus, they only force the virus to adapt to new circumstances. We see that the approach so far is insufficient, I would even say that it has failed. There is much more that needs to be done, and that should have been done three or four years ago. It is sad to say that, but currently, the West is losing the information war against the Kremlin -mostly because we in the West do not realize we are indeed in such a war, what this war has already cost us and what will it cost us in the future, and that we need to fight back to defend our values against an aggressor that is trying to undermine us. However, we have all the tools and capabilities that are necessary for countering these hostile information operations. All we need to do is to start using them. Unfortunately, in many places in Europe, the political leadership is not even aware of being in a conflict. We still need to explain that this information confrontation is a new reality, and that the adversary is hostile, aggressive, and ruthless. My speech will have three parts: First, I will try to describe what is the infrastructure and mechanism of the Kremlin's disinformation campaign. Second, what are its achievements. And finally, what are the possible solutions and recommendations against this threat. In Europe, we could see an aggressive export of Kremlin's disinformation campaign since the war in Ukraine began in 2014. There were obviously some isolated incidents before, but the massive information aggression that is going on on a daily basis, this is something that we see only since the beginning of year 2014. NATO's top military commander Philip Breedlove called the disinformation campaign around the annexation of Crimea'the most amazing information warfare blitzkrieg we have ever seen in the history of information warfare' - and since 2014, the blitzkrieg has evolved into a persistent, ongoing manipulation in dozens of languages, using thousands of different channels day after day after day. Be it the Anschluss of Crimea, or the invasion of Ukraine, or murder of hundreds of civilians of the flight MH17, or the Russian war crimes in Syria, and Russian assassinations in European countries - you would see the same misleading and lying disinformation machine that whitewashes Russian crimes and tries to disable any counter-action against these crimes. Many official documents of the Russian Federation, like military doctrine or information security doctrine, describe the confrontational approach in which information aggression is used regardless of the peace-war status. Theoretical articles by Russian military leadership discuss 'leaking false data' and 'destabilizing propaganda' as parts of their toolkit. This attitude is also publicly pushed by the very top of the Kremlin. Vladimir Putin's spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, openly says that Russia is in a state of 'information war.' The pseudo-journalists dutifully serving the regime go along with this agenda. The head of the Russia Today TV channel, Margarita Simonyan, describes her network as an 'information weapon,' a parallel to the Ministry of Defense. The Kremlin's chief propagandist Dmitry Kiselyov has been even more explicit: 'Today, it is much more costly to kill one enemy soldier than during World War II, World War I, or in the Middle Ages. () [But] if you can persuade a person, you don't need to kill him.' Russia is probably the only country in the world where the regime's 'journalists' justify their job as a less costly alternative to killing people. The subordinates of Kiselyov and Simonyan follow these instructions and, day after day, they keep spreading lies. No matter how many facts are presented about the Russian invasion of Ukraine; Russian war crimes in Syria; the murder of nearly three hundred civilians on flight MH17 by Russian-made and Russian-operated weapons; about the Russian assassinations in Europe, like the one in Salisbury, England; about the state-sponsored doping in sports events; about the Kremlin's information operations and cyberattacks targeting elections all around the globe; or any other event that is of importance to the Kremlin; no matter how many facts are presented, the Kremlin's disinformation ecosystem will continue lying, misleading audiences, and spreading disinformation stories and false counter-accusations. And the regime in the Kremlin rewards these lies. Three hundred pseudo-journalists who were spreading false stories that there are no Russian troops in Crimea, and thus helped the annexation of the peninsula, received medals from President Putin for their 'objective' coverage. Sixty Russian journalists received military awards for participating in the war in Syria. Journalists are receiving military awards. The Kremlin makes it clear that these 'journalists' are simply part of the Russian Army. But the Russian space is only the very beginning of the disinformation campaign. The lies of the official Russian state media get spread and multiplied in other languages. First, via a network of language mutations of Kremlin's official pseudo-media like Russia Today or Sputnik. Second, similar messaging gets replicated by a massive network of websites telling their readers 'we are the only independent alternative to the lying mainstream media' - but what they do in fact is just repeating the same lies that the Russian disinformation ecosystem spread two days ago. There are dozens of these websites in almost every European language, hundreds of them in total. So we have already the top of the Kremlin, their civil servants and embassies and other state representatives spreading the same lies, the official state media spreading the same lies, the state media in other languages spreading the same lies, and also some fringe, pseudo-media and blogs in dozens of languages spreading the same lies. But that is not the end of the campaign. All this gets amplified by the social media operations directed from the infamous troll factory in Saint Petersburg, and it gets multiplied via a network of trolls and bots, across multiple platforms, not only Facebook and Twitter but also YouTube and Instagram and Reddit and 4chan and many others. Similarly, these disinformation stories get posted in many discussion forums, for example in comments' sections under articles in solid media outlets. And after these seeds are sown and the campaign works in this controlled information environment for some time, it later penetrates further, into the uncontrolled, natural environment. Yuri Andropov, the chief of the KGB and later the leader of the Soviet Union, described the mechanism of disinformation as planting opium seeds, one by one, watering them day after day until they bear fruit - at which point already new people start taking care of the plant and cultivate it themselves. Thus, the disinformation messages planted in the controlled information environment later get repeated in the natural environment, by domestic actors - be it paid agents, or fellow travelers, or simply useful idiots. And we already see that even many high level politicians in Europe repeat the typical lies of the Kremlin's disinformation machine - be it politicians in Hungary, Italy, Czech Republic, France, Germany and many other countries. In the 80s, the KGB tried to spread the disinformation campaign that it was the CIA that created AIDS, and they had spent several years of work and significant resources to hide the information source and pretend that the campaign did not come from Soviet Russia. In the over-developed information environment today, similar information laundering that hides the source of the disinformation can happen much more quickly, and with a much higher frequency. New lies get repeated in multiple languages before we even realize that this new message is a lie. To summarize what is the infrastructure of the disinformation ecosystem: it is founded in the theoretical documents of the Russian Federation, elaborated by the top of Russia's military, and performed dutifully by the whole of the state apparatus, including embassies all over the world and the secret services, and by the thousands of pseudojournalists serving the regime. The messaging gets multiplied by a huge online army of fringe outlets, so-called alternative media, bloggers etc. This machine is further amplified by targeted online operations and social media manipulations, and by pro-Kremlin actors in Europe, be it corrupt individuals who spread Kremlin's lies for money, ideological fellow travelers who are attracted by the Kremlin's dictatorship, or just useful idiots who do not even understand that they are spreading disinformation - but because of their ignorance, they get exploited by the Kremlin's disinformation machine. We were not paying enough attention to these signs - to these official documents, to the outrageous statements of Russian public figures, to the daily export of blatant lies disregarding obvious facts, and to the European high-level politicians and other influential opinion-makers who were repeating the Kremlin's lies. The disinformation campaign has worked basically unopposed for a long time, and it has achieved significant results that will be very hard to mitigate. What is the aim of the disinformation campaign? The most important strategic goal is to weaken Russia's adversaries, be it on the most strategic level, where we would see weakening of international organisations like the European Union and NATO, or weakening on a more local level - like governments or general audience in a particular country. This weakening is done via information operations aimed at destabilizing societies and misleading both decision-makers and the general public. To achieve this goal, the disinformers are picking the most sensitive topics that create the strongest emotions, that polarize the society the most. These topics can vary from country to country, but they are most often related to the fear of others, fear of other people - be it people from another country, people of a different race, people of a different sexual orientation, or just people from a rural area as opposed to people from the cities, or people with a different income, education, or socioeconomic status. The disinformation campaign also amplifies the dividing lines between 'the elites' and 'the people' - where 'elites' are always plotting against 'the people'. The disinformers frequently demonize and denigrate 'the others' (be it other nations, or other races, or other socioeconomic groups) to create fear and hatred, since people shaken by these strong emotions can be manipulated more easily. The Czechoslovak defector Ladislav Bittman once likened the work of disinformers to a work of an 'evil doctor',who makes a precise diagnosis of the maladies afflicting their 'patients' - but then trying to make their weaknesses and illnesses worse. Another part of this campaign is delegitimizing any solid source of information - like the mainstream media, or scientific achievements, or honest journalists, or other people who are searching for truth in think tanks and NGOs. That's why you would see many attacks against solid media outlets and against NGOs. That's why you would see spreading of conspiracy theories, including those threatening peoples' health, like the strong anti-vaccination campaign - because it undermines the trust into solid sources of information. 'Don't listen to the mainstream media, don't listen to the government, don't listen to the people in the capital - they are all lying to you, they are trying to mislead you for their own benefit and for their secret plans, it is only us, the independent alternative sources, telling you the truth!' If you can persuade people they shouldn't trust doctors and scientists and solid journalists, it is easier to persuade them they should also vote against their own interests. The organizers of the disinformation campaign also denigrate those who are counter-acting these goals, those who are uncovering the Kremlin's crimes and those who do not give in to the Kremlin's aggression. They spread defamations against people who defend the fact-based world // ordered by the rule of law - be it journalists, or politicians, or even whole countries. That's why you would see a disinformation campaign e.g. against Ukraine, or the Baltic States, or against Western politicians and institutions, against organisations like my own Atlantic Council, or against White Helmets in Syria, against journalists investigating Russia's hostile aggression. And on the contrary, the disinformers will try to promote those politicians and those public figures that help the Kremlin's goals - people who weaken the rule of law and the democratic order, people who promote lies and conspiracies, people who oppose international cooperation of democratic nations that Russia is so afraid of, and people who defend the many Kremlin's crimes and violations of law. We have seen these tactical measures being used during many European and American elections and referenda. The information aggressors were abusing the topic of racial minorities in the US presidential campaign. They were feeding the hatred towards migrants in Europe. On a daily basis, they are inciting hatred towards LGBT people, or against the EU, against other countries, against one's own government and institutions, against solid media, or against the whole liberal and democratic order in general. Over the years when millions of messages in thousands of channels in dozens of languages get spread with the same strategic objective, you start seeing results. That brings me to the question: How successful is the disinformation campaign? We are approximately in the half of the speech. I hope you are not falling asleep yet. As with any kind of campaign, measuring the success of it is difficult. According to researcher Kevin McCauley, the KGB did not even measure the impact of its campaign - all that mattered to them was that the campaign penetrated the enemy's information space, meaning that e.g. an article pushed by the Kremlin got published in a Western outlet. One of my friends talking about private business campaigning said that the advertisers know well, that half of their campaign does not work - they just don't know which half, and therefore they have to try it all. It is probably the same mindset that the disinformation organizers have. They know it is not one measure that makes the difference. It is not one article or one politician spreading their message that will manage to manipulate the information environment. It is the sum that matters. It is like the drop of water falling on a stone, which does not make a hole because it is strong, but because it is persistent, and it keeps falling for years on the same spot. Similarly, the disinformation campaign has to have many drops falling on the same sensitive spot in order to make a difference. What we see in some of the opinion polls, the messages of the disinformers find their audience. There are many people who believe lies, be it the lies about the war in Ukraine, the war in Syria, about the poisoning of Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, and about other Russian crimes. And if you can make people believe these obvious lies, it is easier to make them believe the less obvious, but no less damaging lies - like that their government and their media are in fact working against the people. We see that people manipulated by disinformation can threaten other peoples' lives. A man in America who believed that there is a pedophile conspiracy in a pizza restaurant drove several hundred miles and shot a gun in that restaurant - a result of a disinformation campaign you might know as Pizzagate. A Czech pensioner tried to stage a terror attack, he wanted to derail a train and make it look like it was conducted by Muslims, so that he would incite hatred against Muslims - since according to him, Czechs were not hating Muslims enough and they did not appreciate the threat that Muslims are posing to the Czech Republic. There are close to no Muslims in Czech Republic, and they never threatened anyone's life - it was this brainwashed pensioner believing in a pan-European conspiracy that brings in Islamic terrorists who threatened dozens of lives. The anti-vaccination campaign that Russian sources also spread threatens lives of millions of people on this planet. And apart from these life-threatening examples, we see that many elections and referenda that were targeted by the Kremlin's disinformation campaign ended the way that the Kremlin wanted to. Be it the Dutch referendum about the Association Agreement with Ukraine that weakened the EU. Be it the UK Brexit referendum that weakened not only the EU but also the UK for years ahead. Be it the US and Czech Presidential elections, or the Italian parliamentary elections - in all of these cases, the candidates who are more favorable to Kremlin's interests succeeded, and they continue promoting Kremlin's interests as we speak, years after the elections. According to Professor Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the Russian influence operations were likely the decisive factor of the US 2016 election campaign. According to the historian Timothy Snyder, Kremlin's influence was essential also in the French and Austrian Presidential elections. In my testimony, I have found at least 16 electoral processes targeted by Kremlin's disinformation campaign only in Europe since 2014 - and I am pretty sure that the list is not exhaustive. There is one more effect that is even harder to measure, especially because Russian disinformation campaign is not the only factor helping this effect, and there are also other factors going in the same direction - but the Kremlin tries hard to achieve this result. People in the West gradually distrust their own governments, their institutions, their media, they even distrust facts and reality. You could see families broken apart because the parents do not trust their children. The consumers of disinformation are living in a parallel reality, and this parallel reality where they know whom to blame is more important for them than facts and evidence, and they are even angry at people who are bringing these facts and evidence against lies and manipulations, even if they are their closed ones. I have several examples of that in my family. Thanks to the patient, daily work, the organizers of the disinformation campaign gain new information about our audiences every single day, which enables them to fine-tune the messaging based on the reactions of our audiences. They also raise new speakers who will multiply their lies for them, spreading them among further audiences, giving the messages new legitimacy. With each day the disinformation campaign is working, the audiences get penetrated deeper and deeper. And the longer the campaign goes on, the more people begin to accept it as the new normal. We have seen this effect in the recent European Parliament elections, where some of the researchers even claimed that nothing of importance happened. The only reliable number we have says that the Kremlin's disinformation ecosystem produced twice as many disinformation messages before the May 2019 elections compared to the same period in 2018 - and yet, some people say 'it was nothing special'. People are getting used to the daily presence of Russian lies. To summarize this part: we can see results affecting opinion polls, results affecting how the general public perceives certain events, and thus affecting what policies the state adapts. We see affecting of election campaigns resulting in significant shifts of votes. We can see effects threatening peoples' lives. We can see effects resulting in an apathy, in giving up on facts, people stop caring what is truth and what is a lie. Or, in a worse case, people start hating facts and hating those who try to show them the facts. We can see many effects of the disinformation campaign. And we can see that underestimating this campaign was one of the most naive and reckless things that we in the West could have done in decades. At this point, I will switch from the rather grim description to the more optimistic part - I will try to describe how can we counter the threat of disinformation, what can and should be done against it. What is also optimistic is that we are slowly getting towards the end of the speech, this will be its final part. In the last years, I have identified four lines of work in countering hostile disinformation. I am deeply convinced that we need all four of them, since picking just one or two of them is precisely the failure that we in Europe have been doing, and we can see that it is simply not enough. First, it is documenting of the threat, so that we can get better understanding of it. Second is raising awareness about it, so that more people know about the threat. Third is repairing the weaknesses that the disinformers exploit - be it low media literacy, the social media environment, or simply the differences between various socioeconomic groups. And finally, fourth, is punishing of the information aggressors - something that is not done very often, but something I am sure we have to be doing, otherwise we will never stop the information aggression. Documenting the threat and educating audiences about the threat will never make it go away - just like simply documenting the number of crimes will not help us to decrease the number of crimes, we will actually have to catch the criminals in the end. Each of these four strategic strands can be filled with various tactical measures, that can be undertaken by governments, civil society, private business, and also by the media. The specific mixture obviously depends on the local environment and on the level of understanding and determination in the given society. As for documenting the threat, it is something that the previous team of mine, the East StratCom in Brussels, has been doing. On the EUvsDisinfo website, you could find a database of 6,000 disinformation cases in dozens of different languages. In various countries, you could see various governmental teams involved, as well as think tanks and NGOs, or journalistic projects. Our own Atlantic Council is doing a lot of this work either through the DisinfoPortal, or through the work of Digital Forensic research Lab. However, my feeling is that the comprehensive monitoring task is best done by governments, since they have much bigger resources, and since it is closely connected to security. But despite several years of experience, we see that even the monitoring task is not performed sufficiently. We still do not have essential data about the disinformation campaign, mostly because there are not enough resources for teams like East StratCom. We still don't know how many channels the disinformers control, how many messages per day they spread, how many people they target. Because of that, we cannot even properly say whether there is an increase or decrease of a disinformation campaign in a particular country. We have impressions, but we lack solid data. We see fragments of the disinformation ecosystem, but we do not see the whole picture. We need much more monitoring to understand what is happening in the information space, what is the disinformation ecosystem doing, how it evolves. And it is also necessary to document who are the people targeted by the disinformation campaign, how many are they, how many people believe the particular disinformation messages, who are they, is the number increasing or decreasing. We have to conduct regular opinion polls about that. Only if we measure that regularly, only then will we know how big part of the society is actually infected by the disinformation virus, how successful are the information aggressors, whether they are getting more or less successful, and whether our countermeasures work. The second line of work is raising awareness.It is again a line of work my previous team was working on, and we are also doing it with the Atlantic Council via publishing articles and studies, and through public speeches like this one. In many countries you would see many different initiatives - the Swedes are probably leading in raising awareness among the government officials and journalists, the Ukrainians probably have the most projects done by their vibrant civil society. This line of work is very closely connected to documenting. Only if we collect the data about the disinformation campaign, only then do we have solid data that we can talk about. If we expose a disinformation message soon enough, we have a chance to vaccinate the audiences against particular disinformation viruses. If we manage to raise the awareness high enough about particular disinformation sources - be it the pseudomedia, or other speakers - we don't even need to discredit each and every of their messages, we can just point out to an already discredited source, which is obviously more time-effective. In this line of work, we need activity from every part of the society - from the governments, journalists, NGOs, media, and private business. Each of these actors has different target audiences, and we need to raise awareness among as many as possible. Men in suits have only a limited audience, we need other actors who reach out to other people. In Czech Republic, we have a young influential Youtuber raising awareness about fake news and media literacy among teenage audience. In Lithuania, they have a comedy show similar to John Oliver that parodies Russian propaganda. These are formats that reach audiences that governments won't reach. The more formats, the better the chance for success. There are some good examples in Europe from several governments, the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency is trying to educate civil servants, the Czech Ministry of Interior is trying to do the same. The best example is probably from Lithuania. Two and a half years ago, the Kremlin disinformation campaign tried to spread a disinformation that NATO soldiers raped an underaged girl in Lithuania. A mayor of a small town immediately sensed that something is not right, he alerted the Lithuanian Armed Forces StratCom - which is one of the best teams in the world for countering disinformation - and this team investigated the story and prepared a reaction with a lightning speed. There was a similar story in 2016 in Germany, and it resulted into thousands of people demonstrating against the government. When the disinformers tried the same thing in Lithuania, the information system was prepared for that and the first story in the media was not that a little girl was allegedly raped, but that there is another information attack on Lithuania. But to get to such a level of awareness, you need a great team with proper resources, with political backing, and years of patient work. Such a level of awareness does not come overnight. Third line of work, Repairing weaknesses.The information aggressors are rarely inventing new weaknesses in our societies. More often, they are using the existing ones. By repairing the weaknesses that the disinformers exploit, we raise the chance for a successful defense against disinformation. Some of these weaknesses will be repaired by proper documenting and communicating about what the disinformation campaign is doing. But more systemic weaknesses will need more engagement from other specialists. Media literacy is definitely one of the weaknesses that get exploited and that need to be repaired. Education of the whole population will probably be more a role for the government, but also media can try and adhere to the highest possible journalistic standards, and the private business can promote the work of solid media, and ignore the toxic, disinformation-oriented space. Other weaknesses that get exploited are the differences between various socioeconomic groups. We will never overcome all these differences, there will always be people who are more rich than other people, there will always be a younger and an older generation, people with higher and lower education, people from bigger cities and from villages. Overcoming the differences in a society should be a part of any sensible policy, but it will also help to make the target that the disinformers aim for smaller. Less polarization and less friction between different social groups means less space for the disinformers. And on the contrary - exploiting the weaknesses, polarizing and antagonizing one part of the society against another, that makes the job of disinformers easier. Another weakness that is exploited is the social media environment. There is much more that the big tech companies can do, and they should start by stopping promoting the disinformation-oriented outlets, deranking it from the search results, labeling the content as toxic. They should also disable the sophisticated information operations that the social media platforms get abused for. However, we will always have some weaknesses, and that means the information aggressors will always have some weaknesses to exploit. Therefore, it is necessary to start systematically punishing the disinformers.It is in the nature of the aggressor to be aggressive. If we want to stop aggression, we must punish it and do our best to dissuade any further incidents. This is not an appeal to create new rules or new laws. In many cases, we just need to use the already existing ones. However, we are still not doing this enough. How can it be done? It is necessary to name and shame those who are part of pro-Kremlin disinformation campaigns, either wittingly or unwittingly. It cannot be normal or acceptable to spread and repeat Kremlin lies about Ukraine, Syria, MH17, about the alleged crimes against humanity that Europeans and Americans supposedly conduct. Individuals who are helping the Kremlin to spread these lies should be named and shamed - by the media, politicians, NGOs, academics, and anyone else. The most aggressive and most visible propagandists should be sanctioned. On the European Union sanctions list, there is only one 'journalist', Dmitry Kiselyov, who is something like Vladimir Putin's Joseph Goebbels. Another pet journalist of Putin, Vladimir Solovyov, uses his show to spread hatred against the West several times a week, yet he freely enjoys the pleasures of luxurious villas in Italy. And there are dozens more who deserve to be on the sanctions list. Punishing the most visible propagandists and periodically adding new individuals who participate in Kremlin disinformation would send a clear signal that we do not tolerate the spreading of lies and hatred. Those who propagate lies and hatred about our world in order to break it down simply should not enjoy all the benefits our system and our values offer. Similarly, the disinformation-oriented organisations must be sanctioned. Then, the Western companies would have to pull their ads from the disinformation outlets. It is mind-blowing to see companies from democratic countries among the top advertisers on Russian TV that tries every day to destroy democracy. A quote ascribed to Vladimir Lenin said, 'The capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them.' Those companies that are buying advertising time in Russian media are doing exactly that. Democratic countries and politicians should limit access to the disinformation-oriented outlets and cut them off, with no accreditation, no access to press conferences, no statements for them, and no answers to their questions. These restrictions would make it clear that they are not media, as they themselves admit, but weapons in an information war, as noted above. Estonia made the correct decision not to allow Russian pseudo-reporters to cover an EU foreign ministers' meeting in 2017, and I find it horrible that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in European, and the European Federation of Journalists reproached the Estonians for this. This is the equivalent of professional medical doctors defending the right of quacks and charlatans to harm people with bogus treatments. European countries should also be inspired by the US example and have such media register as foreign agents. In many countries, it is possible to use existing laws and regulations to force pro-Kremlin pseudo-media to adhere to industry standard. In 2016, Lithuanian authorities punished a Russian TV channel for inciting hatred based on nationality. At the beginning of this year, a Latvian broadcast regulator temporarily restricted a Russian TV channel because of hate speech and incitement of war. This May, Lithuania kicked out the head of Lithuanian Sputnik since he is considered a threat to national security. Britain's media regulator, Ofcom, has punished RT several times already, primarily for not upholding media impartiality. The pro-Kremlin disinformation ecosystem regularly spreads lies, defamation, false accusations, and false alarms\u2014I believe there are many cases when they might violate the laws or regulations of different countries. In order to be able to identify those who deserve to be punished, it is also necessary to conduct official investigations, similar to the one conducted by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. This is an area where the United States is far ahead of Europe\u2014the Americans are investigating the attack on their democracy, and a proper investigation is the necessary prelude to a just punishment. Despite the long list of European elections and referenda that have been targeted by Kremlin disinformation in the past five years, I am not aware of a single similar investigation in Europe. We Europeans are basically saying that we do not care whether someone attacks our democracy, we will not react. As a result, logically, we thereby invite further aggression. I would strongly advise that you do not make the same mistake. Punishing the information aggressors will have one more desirable effect: it will deter other potential aggressors. We already see that other state and non-state actors are adopting the Kremlin's playbook, apparently because they have calculated that the weak reaction of Western societies is nothing that would deter them. A resolute punishment of the number one information criminal would send a clear signal to other potential criminals. In closing, there is a lot we can be doing against the organised information manipulation, against this ongoing, daily, persistent disinformation carpet bombing. And we do not need to abandon any of the values that we as free and democratic societies have. We just need to understand that these values have to be defended. That there are aggressors who are trying to destroy these values, and that we must not allow them to operate freely. If we in the free world wake up, there is still a way how to save it. It just needs hard work and at least half of the determination that the aggressors have.

The House Financial Services Committee announced back on Wednesday as we read in the Libra coin news[1] that he will testify on October 23rd. </p><p>The hearing is titled ''an examination of Facebook and its impact on the Financial Services and Housing Sectors'' and Zuckerberg will be the only witness. While the details are really vague, the press releases show that the Committee Chairwoman Maxine Waters has already drafted the ''Keep Big Tech Out Of Finance Act'' and she also previously called for FAcebook to stop all further developments of Libra until the lawmakers' concerns were addressed: 'The draft legislation prohibits large platform utilities, like Facebook, from becoming chartered, licensed or registered as a U.S. financial institution. The bill also prohibits large platform utilities from establishing, maintaining, or operating a digital asset that is intended to be widely used as medium of exchange, unit of account, store of value, or any other similar function as defined by the Federal Reserve.' This month's hearing will be the third one held by the Congress where Zuckerberg has to defend Libra since both the House Financial Services Committee and the Senate Banking Committee both discussed the future of the crypto project this summer. Facebook blockchain lead[2] David Marcus already testified on the benefits that the project can bring in the future. During his hearing, the lawmakers were noticeable skeptical about the efforts that Facebook is making and they even pointed out to the company's past track record with data privacy and other issues as major concerns. The regulatory backlash that surrounds Libra constantly also concerned FAcebook's launch partners and some even started going away from the project. PayPal[3] for example, pulled out of the 28-member association last week. Mastercard and Visa are also reportedly concerned about the massive impact that the project can have on financial stability worldwide. According to the reports that we have in our blockchain news[4], the senators Brian Schatz and Sherrod Brown, both of which are members of the Banking Committee, warned the visa CEO saying that they are participating in an association that could open them to further regulatory scrutiny.

We learned just prior to going on the air tonight NBC Newshas been able to confirm that <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>has signed an order calling for mostly clandestine U.S. forces to support the rebels in Syria.</p><p>__________________________________________</p><p>CBS EVENING NEWS                      CBS 6:30 PM                    AUGUST 1, 2012 __________________________________________</p><p>SCOTT PELLEY:  The Senate today debated a bill that would improve America's cybersecurity.  The Department of Homeland Security says we have seen a 20-fold increase in computer attacks recently.  So we asked Bob Orr how vulnerable are we?</p><p>BOB ORR:  After 24 years with the FBI, many spent as the bureau's cybercop, Shawn Henry has come face to face with the Internet threat. And he's worried.</p><p>ORR:  (From tape.)  Is a serious cyberattack against some critical system in the U.S. inevitable?</p><p>SHAWN HENRY (Former FBI Agent):  (From tape.)  I think that it is very, very likely.</p><p>ORR:  (From tape.)  Near term?</p><p>HENRY:  (From tape.)  I'm quite frankly surprised it hasn't happened yet.</p><p>ORR:  Every day, U.S. government and private computer systems are being probed by cyber thieves and state-sponsored hackers from China and Russia.</p><p>HENRY:  (From tape.)  There are estimates that there are attempted breaches in the millions of times per day.  They'll just continuously knock until they find an edge to get in.</p><p>ORR:  (From tape.)  Do they get in?</p><p>HENRY:  (From tape.)  They get in regularly.</p><p>ORR:  In 2011, Henry led the FBI in breaking up an international hacker ring that had infiltrated four million computers, including some at the U.S. space agency, NASA.</p><p>The head of the U.S.Cyber Command estimates corporate and government losses may already total $1 trillion and many companies don't even know they've been hacked.</p><p>HENRY:  (From tape.)  When I was with the FBI, our agents routinely went out and knocked on the doors of major companies and told them that their networks had been breached.  And the reason we knew their networks had been breached was because we found their data outside their network in the course of another investigation.</p><p>ORR:  Senator Joe Lieberman is behind the new bill aimed at tightening cyberdefenses.</p><p>ORR:  (From tape.)  You've seen what the government analysts say about this.  How grim is the picture they pain?</p><p>SENATOR JOE LIEBERMAN (I-CT):  (From tape.)  Well, the picture is dangerous.  Somebody can attack us through cyberspace and really do us much or more damage than the terrorists did on 9/11 by knocking out the power grid for weeks, by incapacitating all of our banks.</p><p>ORR:  Lieberman's bill seeks to protect those critical networks by encouraging companies to share sensitive threat information and requiring them to report all cyberattacks.</p><p>HENRY:  (From tape.)  I think our time is running short and I think it's important that people take this seriously today.  We can't wait for the physical implications.</p><p>ORR:  Now, despite those dire warnings, some businesses still oppose the new cyber bill, calling it more unnecessary government regulation.  And vote-counters, Scott, say Lieberman in fact may not have the political muscle he needs right now to push the measure through.</p><p>PELLEY:  Bob, thank you.</p><p>___________________________________________</p><p>SPECIAL REPORT WITH BRET BAIER         FNC 6:00 PM                     AUGUST 1, 2012 ___________________________________________</p><p>BRET BAIER:  Now to America's military.  The prospect of massive and some contend crippling defense cuts grows closer each day.</p><p>Tonight, national security correspondent Jennifer Griffin looks at the potential fallout in terms of jobs and the election.</p><p>JENNIFER GRIFFIN:  Looming defense budget cuts go into effect on January 2nd if Congress can't find a compromise to reduce the deficit.</p><p>Private defense workers would likely face layoffs.  In California alone, 109,000 defense contracting jobs are on the line.  They would all receive pink slips just days before the November election.</p><p>By federal law, employers must notify workers 60 days before layoffs are about to occur under the WARN Act.  In 2007, Senator Barack Obama co-sponsored efforts to strengthen that law, quote, \"We must give the WARN Act teeth, to ensure that workers are not left in the lurch without a job or a paycheck.\"</p><p>Yet on Monday the Department of Labor, with full knowledge of the president, said that government contractors do not need to issue pink slips to those who might lose their jobs, quote: \"To provide such notice would be inconsistent with the purpose of the WARN Act.\"</p><p>Defense contractors say the White House is trying to intimidate them into not issuing the pink slips, which would arrive in mail boxes of tens of thousands of voters just a few days before the November election.</p><p>SENATOR KELLY AYOTTE (R-NH):  (From tape.)  They don't want the American people to know that people are going to be laid off, that our national security is at risk.  He doesn't want voters to know that all these folks are going to be laid off.</p><p>GRIFFIN:  The acting OMB director was grilled by the House Armed Services Committee today about the Labor Department's move.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE MIKE TURNER (R-OH):  (From tape.)  It's not worth the paper it's printed on.  It may be the desire of the administration that no one do that, but it certainly isn't reality.  It's a fiction.</p><p>JEFFREY ZIENTS (Acting OMB Director):  (From tape.)  Can I respond?  What concerns me is that we have five months to do balanced debt deduction.</p><p>TURNER:  (From tape.)  My question is regarding the president --</p><p>ZIENTS:  (From tape.)  And there's a refusal to acknowledge that the top 2 percent have to pay their fair share.</p><p>TURNER:  (From tape.)  Sir, sir, my time -- sir --</p><p>GRIFFIN:  A game of political brinksmanship again being played on Capitol Hill.  Defense companies say they face potentially huge lawsuits from disgruntled workers if they don't send out those pink slips in November to warn employees how the looming budget cuts will affect them.  Bret.</p><p>BAIER:  Jennifer Griffin live at the Pentagon tonight.  Jennifer, thank you.</p><p>BAIER:  The head of Cyber Command says computer attacks increased 20-fold on the U.S. between 2009 and 2011.  That's 20 times the attacks in just two years.  The government receives a call about a cyber intrusion every 90 seconds.</p><p>Counterterrorism Advisor John Brennan told reporters today that it is imperative the Senate pass pending cybersecurity legislation.</p><p>BAIER:  Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is urging the military there to step up the battle against rebels in that country.  Heavy fighting is still reported in the large city of Aleppo and Assad is still in hiding.  He has not been since in public since a bomb killed four of his top advisors.  Assad made the appeal in a written statement.</p><p>BAIER:  Moments ago, the House of Representatives in D.C. passed a bill calling for more sanctions against Iran.  The vote was 421 to six.  The measure expands existing penalties, dealings with the bank, uranium, and oil.</p><p>__________________________________________</p><p>THE SITUATION ROOM                    CNN 5:00 PM                    AUGUST 1, 2012 __________________________________________</p><p>CANDY CROWLEY:  Now imagine a day when robots replace human troops in combat.  It may sound like a science fiction movie, but Pentagon correspondent Chris Lawrence shows us.</p><p>CHRIS LAWRENCE:  Welcome to robot boot camp.</p><p>ALAN SCHULTZ (Naval Research Laboratory):  (From tape.)  So this is the Desert High Bay.  On the floor we have sand.  It's about 2.5 feet deep.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Where robots dig for bombs in bone dry deserts or endure the heat of a humid rain forest.</p><p>SCHUTLZ:  (From tape.)  There are places where you'll sink into the mud three or four feet.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  They learn to block out battlefield sounds.</p><p>SCHULTZ:  (From tape.)  There's more around you --</p><p>LAWRENCE:  (From tape.)  Yes, and there's gunfire there, gunfire there.</p><p>SCHUTLZ:  (From tape.)  Right.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Or dive under water to detect mines all under one roof in the nation's capital.</p><p>In other words, what looks and honestly feels like a humid dense rain forest somewhere deep in Southeast Asia is really just the other side of an air-conditioned lab right here in Washington, D.C.</p><p>Remember, Navy SEALs aren't built in air-conditioned labs.  So why should its robots get a pass?  At the Naval Research Lab's newest center, they can tweak the temperature from nearly 400 degrees to 50 below.</p><p>GREG TRAFTON (Cognitive Scientist):  (From tape.)  Computers have perfect memories.  People do not.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  So they're starting to develop robots that can respond to real troops, the kind that get exhausted or anxious and make mistakes.</p><p>MAN (Robot Researcher):  (From tape.)  The fire is in the center on the floor.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Meet Lucas (sp), who is training to fight fires on board a Navy ship.</p><p>MAN (Robot Researcher):  (From tape.)  Hello, Lucas.</p><p>LUCAS (Robot):  (From tape.)  Hello.</p><p>MAN (Robot Researcher):  (From tape.)  The fire in compartment three has been contained.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  He tells Lucas there is a fire in compartment five.</p><p>MAN (Robot Researcher):  (From tape.)  Wait for Laura then follow me there.</p><p>LUCAS:  (From tape.)  Okay.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  But look what happens when Laura gets mixed up.</p><p>LAURA (Robot Researcher):  (From tape.)  Let's head to compartment three.</p><p>LUCAS:  (From tape.)  There must be a misunderstanding.  You think that compartment three is not under control, but it has been contained.</p><p>TRAFTON:  (From tape.)  You want the robot to understand that people can make those mistakes.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  The military wants robots that don't have to be commanded every step of the way, that can take at least some initiative in battle.</p><p>SCHULTZ:  (From tape.)  I used to joke around that if a robot were 100 percent autonomous, it would be in Miami sipping motor oil on the beach.</p><p>LAWRENCE:  Maybe 50 percent autonomous is plenty.  Chris Lawrence, CNN.</p><p>__________________________________________</p><p>MORNING EDITION                        NPR 7:10 AM                     AUGUST 1, 2012 __________________________________________</p><p>STEVE INSKEEP:  This week, the Senate is considering a plan to improve cybersecurity. Its advocates say they want to prevent computer hackers from going after the power grid or other vital infrastructure in this country. Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski contends a cyberattack could be worse than the freak storm that hit the nation's capital this summer.</p><p>SENATOR BARBARA MIKULSKI (D-MD):  (From tape.)  It took us five days to get the utilities back on because of the utility company. But what happens if our destiny is outside of our control, that the cyberterrorists have turned off the lights in America and we can't turn them back on.</p><p>INSKEEP:  Okay. Sounds pretty dire, but lawmakers do not agree what to do about it. Here's NPR's Martin Kaste.</p><p>MARTIN KASTE:  Like everything else in Washington these days, cybersecurity is about the familiar argument of big government versus little government.</p><p>PAUL ROSENZWEIG:  (From tape.)  There's nothing wrong with setting standards. There's everything wrong with thinking that the federal government is the right person to set the standards.</p><p>KASTE:  Paul Rosenzweig dealt with cybersecurity in the Bush administration. He's wary of the Senate bill because it would allow Homeland Security to codify best security practices for Internet providers, utilities and financial institutions. Rosenzweig says nimble tech companies would find themselves taking direction from a slow-moving bureaucracy.</p><p>ROSENZWEIG:  (From tape.)  So we are absolutely guaranteed that the standards we come out with 36 months from now will be addressed to systems that are two generations old.</p><p>KASTE:  Big tech companies and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce also warn of the cost of government-mandated security measures. So the bill's sponsor, Senator Joe Lieberman, recently agreed to make the standards voluntary. And he says he doesn't understand why the weaker bill is still viewed as burdensome.</p><p>SENATOR JOE LIEBERMAN (I-CT):  (From tape.)  I mean, this is no more regulation of business than local building codes are regulation of business. We regulate building construction so people in the building are safe.</p><p>KASTE:  But that analogy doesn't work for Jose Nazario, senior manager for security research at Arbor Networks. He says the problem with setting a building code for cybersecurity is that the basic conditions can change overnight.</p><p>JOSE NAZARIO:  (From tape.)  You know, this is like building a foundation with concrete and the next day finding out that concrete's actually flammable. That's the scenario that you're facing in cybersecurity.</p><p>KASTE:  Even though minimum security standards wouldn't prevent the next hacking innovation, Nazario says they would push negligent companies to protect themselves from known dangers. Nazario also likes the fact that companies would be able to share suspicious Internet traffic with the government. The idea is earlier detection of threats.</p><p>But that, too, is controversial. Civil liberties groups say it could become a back-door form of surveillance. They especially hate the information-sharing in the House version of the bill passed in the spring. But Sharon Bradford Franklin, of the nonpartisan Constitution Project, says the Senate has tightened that up.</p><p>SHARON BRADFORD FRANKLIN:  (From tape.)  Now the limitations on law enforcement use are much narrower. And really, overall, they're trying to make sure that the bill, as a cybersecurity bill, is focused in on cybersecurity purposes.</p><p>KASTE:  Still, with the legislation now on the floor of the Senate, civil liberties groups are keeping a wary eye out for amendments that would broaden government access to Internet traffic, in the name of preventing a cyber-9/11.</p><p>Martin Kaste, NPR News.</p><p>RENEE MONTAGNE:  And members of Congress, this week, are head- lining rallies meant to inspire public outrage, outrage over potential cuts to Pentagon spending. Military contractors say they could lose a million jobs if Congress goes ahead with across-the-board spending reductions known as sequestration. As NPR's Larry Abramson reports, the fuss is about budget cuts that were never intended to actually happen.</p><p>LARRY ABRAMSON:  For months now, House Armed Services Committee Chair, Buck McKeon, has been predicting chaos will result from the $50 billion in Defense cuts scheduled for January. The Republican leader's Web site features ominously scored videos like this one, in which a businesswoman from McKeon's home district in California warns that the sky could fall.</p><p>POLITICAL AD:  (From tape.)  To lose contracts of this nature could eradicate the Antelope Valley as we know it today.</p><p>ABRAMSON:  McKeon's message is that <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>is to blame for this devastating prospect. Of course, both Republicans and Democrats agreed to let automatic cuts set in, if Congressional negotiators could not agree on reductions on their own.</p><p>On Monday and Tuesday, three Republican senators visited a series of rallies in areas heavily dependent on defense spending. At their first stop, Senator Lindsay Graham told a crowd in Tampa that a key military base in their town would face a hammer blow.</p><p>SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC):  (From tape.)  Bottom-line, MacDill Air Force Base is toast if this goes through.</p><p>ABRAMSON:  Actually, the Pentagon has refused to say exactly what will be cut. But Republicans appear convinced they will gain political advantage from dire prognostications. At the Tampa rally, New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte, said only the president can save the day.</p><p>SENATOR KELLY AYOTTE (R-NH):  (From tape.)  I'm very concerned that we won't be able to resolve it without presidential leadership. And you would think that that's the foremost responsibility to the American people of being commander-in-chief.</p><p>ABRAMSON:  But not everyone is buying the idea that defense spending cannot be touched. Gene Jones of SarasotaFlorida, a member of Florida Veterans for Common Sense, came to the rally to call for lower Pentagon spending.</p><p>GENE JONES:  (From tape.)  We're weakening America. This wasted, extravagant defense budget is weakening America. We need to get that under control.</p><p>ABRAMSON:  At another anti-sequestration event just outside Washington, D.C., a few hundred defense workers gathered in a hotel ballroom and donned bright red T-shirts that said: Two-million jobs are at risk. That's one estimate of how many defense and non-defense jobs could fall to across the board cuts.</p><p>David Drabkin, who works for Northrop Grumman, stood out in his pink seersucker suit.</p><p>DAVID DRABKIN:  (From tape.)  To let a salami slice cut take effect in January, it's going to be hard on everybody.</p><p>ABRAMSON:  Drabkin says he is worried about his industry. But he says he's more concerned about the uncertainty created by the threat of cuts. Congress, he says, has to agree on a budget plan, that's their job.</p><p>DRABKIN:  (From tape.)  When I was a fed, before I retired, if I didn't get my budget in on time, they'd have fired me. I wouldn't have gotten paid.</p><p>ABRAMSON:  Defense contractors say federal law requires they send layoff notices out by November, if Congress hasn't come up with a solution. This week, the Department of Labor said, no you don't - the situation is too uncertain for such warnings.</p><p>Democratic Congressman Adam Smith's answer to the mess: Turn the sequestration switch off.</p><p>REPRESENTATIVE ADAM SMITH (D-WA):  (From tape.)  Yes, we still need to deal with the deficit. But obviously this manner of dealing with it isn't going to work.

Or more accurately, it's one of the best examples of the complete insanity that was the dotcom bubble. Pets.com had a Super Bowl ad and a Macy's Parade float but no real revenue. They lost $147m in the first nine months of 2000 but still managed to IPO (the stock originally traded up from $11 when it IPO'd in February of 2000 before the whole thing came crashing down a few weeks later). While just one of many examples, this seems to be what investors envision when they think of an overzealous venture market. The term I've heard frequently is \"frothy.\" Many investors believe that venture investing and specifically tech venture is once again becoming \"~frothy\" and that we should be weary of some sort of repeat of Pets.com. The purpose of the below writing is to highlight all of the reasons why the landscape is very different now. Arguably, just about the only similarities are that all the companies both then and now have websites and that venture investing remains an optimist's endeavor.</p><p>Let us first define the space and make some basic assumptions. For the sake of this writing, venture can be defined as early stage private equity capital in companies. In this case, we'll narrow it even further to companies with a heavy technology component to their business model (fin tech, software, social media, e-commerce, et al) so we're really talking about tech venture. As for assumptions, first let's acknowledge that venture is an equity play and an illiquid one at that, so some stability at the broader economic level is important. If you believe that another 2008-like experience is around the corner, then none of the below will make a lot of difference. Second, let's assume you can successfully (either directly or via a fund manager) execute a venture strategy. Among other things, this requires that you can: 1) identify and invest in good products and businesses, 2) invest at a decent valuation, 3) invest with others that are likely to improve the probability of success (more on this below). Clearly, this is easier said than done and there are innumerate books, articles, and fund managers who have ideas about how to do it best. What I have seen much less of is an objective look at venture in the context of where we are in the cycle today and what the landscape of today's private markets looks like, so here it goes.</p><p>Landscape</p><p>Private markets have grown substantially in recent years, both in dollars and in the number of companies. In the late 90's, investment banks big and small made tremendous amounts of money taking companies public. The information age offered the public unprecedented access to markets. Going public was all the rage. Got an idea and a website, we got capital for you! Since the bust, the trend has gone the other way. First, the bust created a distrust in the process, the bankers, and companies as a whole. If you want to go public now, you need to have every base covered, you need to be a slam dunk. Second, proliferation of private equity funds (venture included) created an additional level of private capital for companies, pushing the IPO further down the timeline. Third, volatility in public markets (even absent the major hiccups of 2000 and 2008) has made for truncated timeline expectations for investors. That quarterly or monthly performance focus is not necessarily congruent with the growth cycle of a mid-stage growth company. CEOs are not ignorant of that fact and subsequently weary about jumping into public markets. Last, increased regulatory scrutiny has added to the cost of doing business at the public level and incentivized many a potential IPO to wait it out a bit longer (see: Airbnb, Facebook).</p><p>On the other side of the equation, improvements in technology and communication have done wonders for entrepreneurs, especially since the 2008 crisis.</p><p>a) It is much cheaper now to start a business (tech) than it was in the late 90's/early 2000's. Improvements in information technologies have cut costs across the spectrum from marketing to accounting.</p><p>b) Online communication isn't just cool, it's necessary. There are something on the order of 50 times more internet users now with 180x the bandwidth and 6x the amount of time spent online. Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin allow for transmission of ideas and business initiatives faster than ever before.</p><p>c) It's easier to get capital to start a business. While the traditional model of getting a loan from a bank is not what it used to be, necessity breads ingenuity and the cash strapped period around the 2008 crisis brought the world things like crowd funding, Angel List, etc. Additionally, stories like the guy who designed Facebook's mural at their office, which they paid for with stock and now he's a millionaire abound, peaking the interest of virtually every 30-something with a little expendable capital. Even convertible debt financing has alleviated the need for less active angel investors to get into the weeds (and legalese) of equity financing for early-stage tech companies.</p><p>Taken in total, private markets are growing in both depth and breadth. Fewer companies are IPO'ing later and the result is much deeper private markets. The breadth of the markets have also increased as cheaper start-up costs combine with greater access to capital. While none of this may translate into improving the chances of an individual start-up, it does mean there are a greater nominal number of opportunities for investors in private markets to capitalize.</p><p>With the above as a backdrop, one might assume that the capital chasing these markets (and funds dedicated to such) are at all-time highs. That assumption would be inaccurate. Every chart there is shows a spike in the dotcom era in capital chasing venture that is orders of magnitude higher than before or after. While funds and dollars are still in what one might call a normal range, the opportunity set is decidedly bigger. It's worth noting that a frequent argument is that venture firms have just gotten bigger and bigger is bad in venture. The numbers however do not support all of that argument. On average, the change in the size of funds has been negligible. The firms that have gotten bigger have by and large done so on the back of good performance and success. As a larger firm, there are a few factors that make the game a little different, but not all of them are bad. First, deploying more capital requires either later stage investments (which provide lower returns but should also translate to high probabilities of success) or investments in more projects (thus the influx in seed-staged funds and incubators such as Y Combinator). The challenge with the latter is that many of the liquidity events that happen for successful early-stage companies are not done at a level that would be enough to move the needle for a very large fund. Said differently, adhering to Peter Thiel's maxim of investing in companies that could return your whole fund is even more difficult. On the bright side, venture investing has a large self-fulfilling component to it if you're a large \"name\" fund. In other words, customers and future investors alike are more inclined to believe in and support a company because it has Sequoia or Andreessen Horowitz as an investor. This is also true because some of venture is hanging around long enough to figure out how to be successful and the support of deep pockets and seasoned advisors clearly makes that more likely. All in, while there is data to support a negative correlation between fund growth beyond a certain point and returns on average, it is fairly evident which firms are really average and which ones are still highly successful. It's worth paying attention to the latter group. The little feeder fish that trails the successful great white does well too. Navigating the Path</p><p>The path to venture success is simple in concept and difficult in practice.</p><p>1) Deal-sourcing: There is a belief going around that the guys in Silicon Valley are just funding each other's deals. Whether this is true or not, it is true that there is a lot of inside baseball in venture investing. There are two key steps to good deal sourcing: a. Seeing the deal: Leveraging the network of those that are connected to the best deals is imperative. Therefore, either piggy-backing off of or bringing a big name into a deal is a decent way to go. The other source is deep ties to the operators themselves, which can be achieved through dedicated staff--Andreessen model--or via the side door like Bain Consulting and Bain Capital (no relation to this author). b. Winning the deal: The prettiest girl at the ball gets asked to dance a lot, why would she say yes to you? Again, this is where cultivating good relationships with the entrepreneurs can get you a long way. CEOs often want help and a little solicited advice, which is what has propelled Y Combinator to wins with such companies as Airbnb and DropBox. They've built something from the ground up whereas heavy handed \"advice\" is not often appreciated.</p><p>2) Identifying the path to exit: With IPOs happening later, how will you monetize your success story? Again, it comes back to relationships, but in this case it is relationships with the prospective buyers. Roughly 95% of all venture-backed tech companies with successful exits are the result of an acquisition by one of about ten major companies. These are all household names at this point: Google, Yahoo, Cisco, Microsoft, Facebook et al. Many of these companies are cutting R&amp;D budgets in favor of outside acquisitions (see: Facebook's $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp). It takes a lot of time to develop talent and projects in-house and there's no guarantee the mousetrap you build is the best. In the fast moving technology space, many let the venture world be your R&amp;D department and just pick the best stuff. This is happening across the major tech firms. Therefore, if you run a venture fund, it makes a lot of sense to develop very good relationships with the corporate development/acquisition people at these companies. If you knew what the Google team thought of Waze in 2010 when they raised $25m or 2011 when they raised $30m, you might have tried harder to get into those rounds. What's amazing is how much the big tech firms will actually tell you about what they like and might acquire.</p><p>The venture world is maturing. Gone are the days of funding Pets.com with successful IPOs. Given the number of tech start-ups out there and the number of people who understand technology enough to be dangerous, the days of picking winners based purely on technological acumen are going away as well (too many options and less edge). Much as the hedge fund world is now pretty much devoid of \"two guys in a room with a Bloomberg,\" the venture world is likely to lose \"two kids from Stanford who know how to code\" venture funds. The successful venture firms are run by adults\"\"guys who wear suits, and have spent years building the relationships described above that are now required to navigate the path to exit. Those firms exist now and rather than being \"frothy\" the venture cycle is in the early innings. Eventually the cycle will repeat or at least rhyme. You'll begin to see IPOs happen earlier again as Gen Y and the Millennials amass escalating amounts of disposable income and demand exposure. When the risk gets transferred to the public sector and retail is the end buyer, it might be time to get worried, but how long until that happens? Companies are now going from inception to $1 billion in revenue in less than five years (Zulily, Ali Baba, etc.) so the venture cycle is accelerating and growth in the US more broadly is on a measured, but steadily upward, slope. There's money to be made in the new venture landscape and lots of it. In the words of Eric Schmidt, as quoted by Sheryl Sandberg: \"If you're offered a seat on a rocket ship, don't ask what seat. Just get on.\" See also: All columns by Adam Bain</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABSRET-3423054</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABSRET2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FX4-TB61-JD1P-T1W5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">425280</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2014\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Pageant Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Absolute Return</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"46678\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate month=\"01\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>January 2015</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Major averages all closed below intraday bests and traders reported the first noticeable signs of pre-holiday type action.\u00a0</p><p>\"We're seeing some decent activity but it's quieting down after the feeding frenzy the last couple of weeks,\" said Jim Volk, co-director of institutional trading at D.A. Davidson in Portland, Ore. \"I think it's been consistently busier because institutions are putting money to work. Every once in a while we see some profit-taking and a lot of big stocks are down today. But they're still buying telecom and B2B and tech, while a lot of other stuff goes begging.\"\u00a0</p><p>The market: Join the discussion on TSC Message Boards.\u00a0</p><p>In the profit-taking department, Volk mentioned Qualcomm (QCOM:Nasdaq), which closed off 2.3% at 485 7/16 after rising as high as 522 1/8 in the first five minutes of trading. (The stock was slumping hard after hours on disappointment with news of Qualcomm's sale of its handset business.)\u00a0</p><p>Among news-driven declines, Lucent (LU:NYSE), 3Com (COMS:NYSE) and Corel (CORL:Nasdaq) each suffered big drops.\u00a0</p><p>Lucent declined 3.6% to 76 5/8 after trading as low as 73 1/2. Some cautious comments by the firm in a 10-Q filing with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission prompted analysts at J.P. Morgan and Warburg Dillon Read to question Lucent's growth prospects.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, 3Com lost 8.9% to 48 7/16 after trading as low as 43 5/8. Although its earnings bested expectations; the company also posted sluggish sales growth last night. Finally, Corel declined 29.3% after warning about a profit shortfall for the fourth-quarter. Corel's decline was exaggerated because the stock had risen sharply in previous weeks amid the excitement over anything related to the Linux operating system.\u00a0</p><p>After rising as high as 3948.48 in the opening moments of trading, the Nasdaq Comp's momentum waned through the rest of the morning. But after bottoming at 3878.06 shortly before lunchtime, the tech-bolstered index rallied back through most of the afternoon to finish up 25.95, or 0.7%, to 3937.10. The close is the Nasdaq's 28th record in the past 38 trading days.\u00a0</p><p>In addition to 3Com and Corel's losses, the Comp had to overcome weakness in bellwethers such as Cisco (CSCO:Nasdaq) and MCIWorldCom (WCOM:Nasdaq). Giving the index a lift were tech giants such as Oracle (ORCL:Nasdaq), Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq), and Yahoo! (YHOO:Nasdaq), as well as momentum favorites such as Internet Capital Group (ICGE:Nasdaq) and Commerce One (CMRC:Nasdaq).\u00a0</p><p>Reflecting the mixed tone within tech today, TheStreet.com Internet Sector index declined 10.97, or 1%, to 1148.10. TheStreet.com Red Hots index rose 4.78, or 1.1%, to 422.33. The 20-stock index tracks action in particularly volatile stocks and is meant to measure so-called hot money. (You can check quotes on the Red Hots index and its component stocks at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thestreet.com/redhots\">http://www.thestreet.com/redhots</url>.) </p><p>Meanwhile, the Dow closed up 3.06 to 11,203.60 after trading as high as 11,260.18 and as low as 11,181.89.\u00a0</p><p>The blue-chip proxy got a big lift from Eastman Kodak (EK:NYSE), which rose 8.2% after naming a new CFO. Additionally, Procter &amp; Gamble (PG:NYSE) rose 4.3% to spur the Dow.\u00a0</p><p>The index was most restrained by American Express (AXP:NYSE), J.P. Morgan (JPM:NYSE) and Honeywell (HON:NYSE).<br/>\u00a0<br/>Recent Laggards Lift S&amp;P\u00a0</p><p>Given the uncharacteristically uneven performance of big tech stocks, the S&amp;P 500 turned to some recently punk names to help it secure its second-straight record. The index closed up 2.56, or 0.2%, to 1435.99 after trading as high as 1440.02 and as low as 1429.05.\u00a0</p><p>In addition to the aforementioned Dow components, the (previously) unsung heroes included Safeway (SWY:NYSE) and a slew of drug makers, including Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY:NYSE) and Pfizer (PFE:NYSE). The American Stock Exchange Pharmaceutical Index jumped 2.2%.\u00a0</p><p>Today's move comes amid talk by some market players that the yawning gap between the performance of growth and value stocks will begin to close. However, the S&amp;P Barra Growth Index rose 0.3% to an all-time high of 876.6 today, continuing to outperform the S&amp;P Barra Value Index, which dipped 0.1%.\u00a0</p><p>\"There's been a really interesting dynamic at work in the market this last three, four weeks, which is that people have gotten a lot of positive reinforcement from investing in tech stocks,\" said Jon Olesky, head of block trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter . Tech has \"turned out not to be the leadership, but the only aspect of the market that's working.\"\u00a0</p><p>Thus, the continued gains by growth stocks is not surprising, especially given investors' reluctance to incur capital gains before year-end or \"give back\" performance, he said. \"A lot of this right now is very much related to the calendar.\"\u00a0</p><p>The Russell 2000 closed up 2.15, or 0.5%, to 477.94 despite another session of negative breadth.\u00a0</p><p>In New York Stock Exchange trading, 852.9 million shares were exchanged while declining stocks led advancers 1,692 to 1,417. In Nasdaq Stock Market action, 1.46 billion shares traded while losers led 2,254 to 1,914.

The $15 billion in notes were sold at a yield of 6.233%, with a coupon of 6.125%. The bid-to-cover ratio, which measures the total number of bids against what was offered, was 2.10, which means interest for the auction wasn't as low as expected.\u00a0</p><p> The Heard on the Street column in The Wall Street Journal took a look at the stock of Juno Online (JWEB:Nasdaq), which jumped more than four times in value after the company announced Monday that it will provide full Internet access at no charge, while also increasing its advertising spending.

In response, Mr. Trump accused Twitter of stifling speech and declared that he would put a stop to the interference.</p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to make it easier for federal regulators to argue that companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter were suppressing free speech when they suspended users or deleted posts. The tech companies have had \u201cunchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences,\u201d he said.</p><p>But Twitter has doubled down. Late Wednesday, it added fact-checking labels to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-executive-order-social-media.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Spotlight&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">messages</url> from Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China\u2019s foreign ministry who had claimed that the coronavirus outbreak may have begun in the United States and been brought to China by the U.S. military.</p><p>Twitter also added notices on hundreds of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-executive-order-social-media.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Spotlight&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">tweets</url> that falsely claimed a photo of a man in a red baseball cap was Derek Chauvin, an officer involved in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-executive-order-social-media.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Spotlight&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">the death of George Floyd</url>, an African-American man who died this week after being handcuffed and pinned to the ground by police. The Twitter label alerted viewers that the image was \u201cmanipulated media.\u201d </p><p>The skirmish between Twitter and Mr. Trump shows that a backlash against large tech companies, which had receded in the initial phases of the pandemic, is now back in full force. The Justice Department has also recently signaled that it is preparing to bring <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-executive-order-social-media.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Spotlight&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">an antitrust case</url> against Google, perhaps as soon as this summer.</p><p>The executive order \u201cseems designed to punish a handful of companies for perceived slights,\u201d said Jon Berroya, chief executive of the Internet Association, a lobbying group representing many of the major tech companies. \u201cIt stands to undermine a variety of government efforts to protect public safety and spread critical information online through social media and threatens the vibrancy of a core segment of our economy.\u201d</p><p>A Twitter spokeswoman said that the tweets modified on Wednesday contained \u201cpotentially misleading content\u201d and that the fact-checking was consistent with the company\u2019s approach this month.</p><p>In a series of tweets on Wednesday, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-executive-order-social-media.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Spotlight&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">Jack Dorsey</url>, Twitter\u2019s chief executive, also said he would not back down from the fact-checking effort. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information,\u201d he wrote.</p><p>The executive order aims at protections granted to technology services <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-executive-order-social-media.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Spotlight&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act</url>. The law gives tech companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter broad immunity from liability for content created by their users.</p><p>As Mr. Trump and other conservative figures have claimed that social media companies are biased against them, Republican lawmakers have proposed modifications to the statute. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri has argued that to maintain Section 230 protections, social media services should be required to submit to a third-party audit to ensure their content moderation systems are politically neutral.</p><p>Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon who wrote the law, said Mr. Trump was threatening Section 230 to \u201cchill speech and bully\u201d the big tech companies into giving the White House more favorable treatment.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s clearly targeting Section 230 because it protects private businesses\u2019 right not to have to play host to his lies,\u201d Mr. Wyden said in a statement. \u201cEfforts to erode Section 230 will only make online content more likely to be false and dangerous.\u201d</p><p>The executive order is likely to face legal challenges.</p><p>Harold Feld, the senior vice president of Public Knowledge, a policy nonprofit group, said the order appeared to be intended to limit speech on social media that disagreed with the president. That was \u201cliterally the worst case scenario that the authors of the First Amendment were afraid of,\u201d he said.</p><p>Twitter\u2019s confrontation with Mr. Trump has also opened new fissures in Silicon Valley. Mr. Dorsey has doubled down on fact-checking tweets, but Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s chief executive, has distanced his social network from that effort.</p><p>\u201cI just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn\u2019t be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-executive-order-social-media.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Spotlight&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">Mr. Zuckerberg said</url> in a taped television interview that ran Thursday morning on Fox News.</p><p>His comments were at odds with some of his own company\u2019s actions. In the past, Facebook, too, introduced fact-checking labels, using third-party services to review potentially false information. The approach has been scattershot and uneven, and critics have argued that third-party fact checkers have been unable to keep up with the billions of pieces of content on the social network.</p><p>Facebook has also said it would not allow posts that facilitated voter fraud or misinformation intended <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-executive-order-social-media.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Spotlight&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">specifically to suppress voting</url>.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re talking about this as if it\u2019s about fact-checking, but it\u2019s not,\u201d <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-executive-order-social-media.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Spotlight&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">said</url> Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters for America, a left-leaning media watchdog. \u201cIt\u2019s about whether platforms will facilitate fraud that undermines civic engagement.\u201d</p><p>In a statement, Facebook said it opposed modifying Section 230 because that would \u201crestrict more speech online, not less.\u201d</p><p>On Twitter, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-executive-order-social-media.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=Spotlight&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage\">Mr. Dorsey fired back</url> after Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s comments became public before they were aired.</p><p>\u201cThis does not make us an \u2018arbiter of truth,\u2019\u201d he said of his decision to fact-check tweets. \u201cOur intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves.\u201d</p><p>Kate Conger reported from Oakland, Calif., and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.</p><p>PHOTOS: Twitter\u2019s headquarters in San Francisco.

It was Wednesday, not Thursday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CORRECTION APPENDED</p><p>Twitter continued fact-checking posts even as President Trump threatened to limit protections for social media companies.</p><p>OAKLAND, Calif. - Twitter continued to add new fact-checking labels to hundreds of tweets, even as the Trump administration issued an executive order to curtail the legal protections that shield social media companies from liability for the content posted on their platforms.</p><p>Twitter's move escalated the confrontation between the company and President Trump, who has fulminated this week over actions taken by his favorite social media service.</p><p>Twitter on Tuesday had appended fact-checking labels for the first time to two of Mr. Trump's tweets about mail-in ballots, rebutting their accuracy. In response, Mr. Trump accused Twitter of stifling speech and declared that he would put a stop to the interference.</p><p>On Thursday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to make it easier for federal regulators to argue that companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter were suppressing free speech when they suspended users or deleted posts. The tech companies have had \"unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences,\" he said.</p><p>But Twitter has doubled down. Late Wednesday, it added fact-checking labels to messages from Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry who had claimed that the coronavirus outbreak may have begun in the United States and been brought to China by the U.S. military.</p><p>Twitter also added notices on hundreds of tweets that falsely claimed a photo of a man in a red baseball cap was Derek Chauvin, an officer involved in the death of George Floyd, an African-American man who died this week after being handcuffed and pinned to the ground by police. The Twitter label alerted viewers that the image was \"manipulated media.\" </p><p>The skirmish between Twitter and Mr. Trump shows that a backlash against large tech companies, which had receded in the initial phases of the pandemic, is now back in full force. The Justice Department has also recently signaled that it is preparing to bring an antitrust case against Google, perhaps as soon as this summer.</p><p>The executive order \"seems designed to punish a handful of companies for perceived slights,\" said Jon Berroya, chief executive of the Internet Association, a lobbying group representing many of the major tech companies. \"It stands to undermine a variety of government efforts to protect public safety and spread critical information online through social media and threatens the vibrancy of a core segment of our economy.\"</p><p>A Twitter spokeswoman said that the tweets modified on Wednesday contained \"potentially misleading content\" and that the fact-checking was consistent with the company's approach this month.</p><p>In a series of tweets on Wednesday, Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, also said he would not back down from the fact-checking effort. \"We'll continue to point out incorrect or disputed information,\" he wrote.</p><p>The executive order aims at protections granted to technology services under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. The law gives tech companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter broad immunity from liability for content created by their users.</p><p>As Mr. Trump and other conservative figures have claimed that social media companies are biased against them, Republican lawmakers have proposed modifications to the statute. Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri has argued that to maintain Section 230 protections, social media services should be required to submit to a third-party audit to ensure their content moderation systems are politically neutral.</p><p>Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon who wrote the law, said Mr. Trump was threatening Section 230 to \"chill speech and bully\" the big tech companies into giving the White House more favorable treatment.</p><p>\"He's clearly targeting Section 230 because it protects private businesses' right not to have to play host to his lies,\" Mr. Wyden said in a statement. \"Efforts to erode Section 230 will only make online content more likely to be false and dangerous.\"</p><p>The executive order is likely to face legal challenges.</p><p>Harold Feld, the senior vice president of Public Knowledge, a policy nonprofit group, said the order appeared to be intended to limit speech on social media that disagreed with the president. That was \"literally the worst case scenario that the authors of the First Amendment were afraid of,\" he said.</p><p>Twitter's confrontation with Mr. Trump has also opened new fissures in Silicon Valley. Mr. Dorsey has doubled down on fact-checking tweets, but Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, has distanced his social network from that effort.</p><p>\"I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn't be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,\" Mr. Zuckerberg said in a taped television interview that ran Thursday morning on Fox News.</p><p>His comments were at odds with some of his own company's actions. In the past, Facebook, too, introduced fact-checking labels, using third-party services to review potentially false information. The approach has been scattershot and uneven, and critics have argued that third-party fact checkers have been unable to keep up with the billions of pieces of content on the social network.</p><p>Facebook has also said it would not allow posts that facilitated voter fraud or misinformation intended specifically to suppress voting.</p><p>\"We're talking about this as if it's about fact-checking, but it's not,\" said Angelo Carusone, president of Media Matters for America, a left-leaning media watchdog. \"It's about whether platforms will facilitate fraud that undermines civic engagement.\"</p><p>In a statement, Facebook said it opposed modifying Section 230 because that would \"restrict more speech online, not less.\"</p><p>On Twitter, Mr. Dorsey fired back after Mr. Zuckerberg's comments became public before they were aired.</p><p>\"This does not make us an 'arbiter of truth,'\" he said of his decision to fact-check tweets. \"Our intention is to connect the dots of conflicting statements and show the information in dispute so people can judge for themselves.\"</p><p>Kate Conger reported from Oakland, Calif., and Mike Isaac from San Francisco.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000007161168</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6014-0NF1-DYR7-C0N4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1109\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 30, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;
