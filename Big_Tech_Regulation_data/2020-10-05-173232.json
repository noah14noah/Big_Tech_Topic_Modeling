What can we expect if this year's...</p><p>By James Mackintosh   In just seven days, $1 trillion vanished from the value of seven of the big U.S. growth stocks. One trillion dollars. Investors unexpectedly getting a lot poorer has had nasty repercussions in the past. What can we expect if this year's wild excess around disruptive technology stocks continues to deflate?    In extreme cases, bursting bubbles sometimes trash the entire economy, as with Britain's 1846 Railway Mania, Japan's 1989 property-and-equity bubble or the pre-2007 housing-and-structured-debt bubble.    The good news is that the tech excess -- I hesitate to call it a bubble -- hasn't been accompanied by an investment boom financed by new stock or debt. There are exceptions, such as Tesla, which need regular injections of new cash and would have to slow their expansion if markets turned against them. But there's no reason why Apple, Amazon or most of the rest of Big Tech would have to cancel projects even if their stock prices halved.    The bad news is that there are plenty of other ways that falling stock prices can hit both the economy and the rest of the market.    Past bubbles have been followed by a mix of financial disruption, higher household savings and sudden changes to corporate behavior as the stock market shifts its incentives. A continued fall in tech stocks carries some of these risks.    If investors have borrowed heavily to buy an asset and it falls fast, they become forced sellers, accelerating its decline. If they lose enough, or they have other borrowing, they may sell other holdings, leading to falls elsewhere in the market. There's little sign of this so far; while growth stocks have plunged almost 9.6% from this month's high, according to Russell 1000 indexes, disregarded value stocks are down less than 4%.    Still, margin lending is high -- it's been higher only from late 2017 through to the recession panic of late 2018, according to figures from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. So this remains a risk if tech carries on down.    While Apple, Amazon and the like won't need to slash spending even if their shares crash, worthless employee stock options would make them less attractive to work for. Equally, the venture-capital-backed ecosystem of the West Coast will become less appealing if tech startups don't have the exit route of an overvalued IPO. Knock-on effects of a crash on wildly overpriced San Francisco property could hurt the local economy.    Yet, the broader economy is at much less risk today than at the time of past bubbles. Companies that couldn't issue new stock after the dot-com bust went to the wall. Big telecoms businesses that had borrowed far too much to build global fiber and mobile networks failed or slashed investment when they couldn't refinance and demand turned out to be much lower than expected -- just as with the railways in 19th-century Britain. Amazon, Alphabet and Apple have been financing their expansions internally, so have no need to scale back as their stock falls.    And falling stock prices have a much smaller impact on consumer spending than housing slumps. The wealth effect -- consumers who feel richer spend more -- was obvious in the years leading up to the 2007-08 financial crisis as borrowers remortgaged to spend, backed by higher house prices. But stock prices don't have that same effect, partly because we're used to them going up and down, but mainly because so few people now own stock directly.    It's true that since the financial crisis far more people have been punting on share prices thanks to free trading at Robinhood and the lack of sports to bet on. But it's hard to believe that enough people became so much better off -- and now worse-off -- that they will make economically significant cuts to spending in order to save.    One final risk that I didn't mention, because I don't know how to assess it, is psychology. When the market leaders fall, traders and investors (and the momentum-driven market bots) might just become more cautious, hurting everything. So far this hasn't happened, with many of the lockdown losers rising strongly this month even as the year's big winners went into reverse. At one extreme, all 22 of the S&amp;P 500 stocks up more than 50% by the end of August fell this month. At the other, all five S&amp;P stocks up more than 10% this month had fallen by more than a third in the year to August.    All of the above assumes that the tech rout gets worse, which is far from a given. Blow off the froth of the late-summer excess and the big growth stocks are still expensive compared to history. But consider the superlow yields on Treasurys and the ability of many of them to ride out a weak economy and they are much more justifiable -- at least so long as yields stay low and the economy weak.

To get them really worked up, make the topic internet regulation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the week since the Federal Communications Commission released a plan to scrap existing rules for internet delivery, more than 200,000 phone calls, organized through online campaigns, have been placed to Congress in protest. An additional 500,000 comments have been left on the agency's website. On social media sites like Twitter and Reddit, the issue has been a leading topic of discussion. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  In some cases, views on the sweeping change, which would repeal landmark regulations meant to ensure an open internet, have turned into personal attacks. The agency's chairman, Ajit Pai, said threatening calls and emails had poured into his home and his wife's work. An image of a protest poster with his children's names was posted online and spread widely. Ethnic slurs aimed at Mr. Pai, whose parents immigrated from India, littered his Twitter feed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  There are also echoes of the 2016 presidential election, with accusations that not all of the reaction is coming from Americans. The federal agency is for the first time dealing with a powerful technology foe as automated software, known as bots, appears to have sent many comments to the site, according to data researchers.</p><p>  And at least 400,000 comments about the issue since April on the F.C.C. site appear to have originated from an apartment in St. Petersburg, Russia, the agency said. It is unclear whether the emails did originate from there, or were made to look as if they did.</p><p>  But none of that has overshadowed the heated reaction to the agency's proposal.</p><p>  ''There doesn't seem to be middle ground on this issue,'' said John Beahn, a lawyer at Skadden Arps who specializes in regulation.</p><p>  At the center of the debate is whether telecom companies like AT&amp;T and Verizon should be able to charge internet sites for delivering their data to consumers' homes. In 2015, the F.C.C. voted to prohibit those charges, in a policy often called net neutrality.</p><p>  But Mr. Pai, a Republican nominated for the chairmanship by <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>said the regulations were heavy-handed and prevented telecom companies from pursuing new business models. His proposal, by stripping away the existing rules, would allow telecom companies to charge websites to deliver their data at higher speeds.</p><p>  In a speech on Tuesday, Mr. Pai addressed some of the concerns that have been voiced since he released his proposal, pointing specifically to comments by celebrities like Cher and Kumail Nanjiani of ''Silicon Valley.'' He said their tweets warning that his rules would lead to authoritarianism and a handout to big cable companies were ''utterly absurd.''</p><p>  ''I'd like to cut through hysteria and hot air and speak in plain terms about the plan,'' Mr. Pai said, adding that the plan would bring back the regulation-free policy that helped the internet thrive. He said big tech companies might be a bigger threat to online speech than telecom companies.</p><p>  The proposal is expected to be approved at a meeting of the five F.C.C. commissioners on Dec. 14. The two other Republican commissioners have already expressed their support for Mr. Pai.</p><p>  The 2015 rules also elicited strong interest. The F.C.C. site was overwhelmed with comments after a monologue from the late-night host John Oliver went viral online. Some people who wanted the stronger rules blocked the driveway of the chairman at the time, Tom Wheeler, to try to persuade him to change the agency's plan.</p><p>  Big web companies like Google and Netflix played activist roles as well, supporting the stronger rules. They argued that telecom companies should not be able to split sites into fast lanes and slow lanes, because that would allow them to become a sort of gatekeeper for information and entertainment. In addition, they say, it would hurt start-ups without the money to pay for the faster lanes.</p><p>  Mr. Pai, who opposed the rules as a commissioner in 2015, gave broad outlines of his plans early this year. For months, comments to the F.C.C. website piled up, to more than 20 million. President Barack Obama's clean power plan, perhaps his biggest policy change at the Environmental Protection Agency, attracted 4.3 million comments over six months.</p><p>  But the intensity has increased even more since Mr. Pai released the details of the proposal -- perhaps in part because few people expected him to try to strip all of the existing rules.</p><p>  ''We never expected this,'' wrote Craig Moffett, an analyst at the research firm MoffettNathanson.</p><p>  Lawmakers, celebrities, founders of start-ups and consumers have continued to hash out the debate into this week.</p><p>  Conservative groups like FreedomWorks and the Competitive Enterprise Institute praised the rollback. The radio host Rush Limbaugh defended Mr. Pai's plan on Monday in an online post. He dismissed concerns by supporters of the rules, whom he described as liberal ''millennials and tech bloggers.''</p><p>  ''What the tech bloggers and the left don't like is that there are options and that there is a freedom in the marketplace and that people can choose superior service if they're willing to pay for it,'' Mr. Limbaugh said. ''And if somebody's willing to pay for superior service, the providers had better provide it.''</p><p>  Public interest groups like Free Press and organizations like Mozilla, the nonprofit behind the popular Firefox browser, said they were prepared to file suit against the plan as soon as the vote on Dec. 14.</p><p>  ''The action hit a nerve because the internet is central to the vast majority of people's daily lives, and so people were very eager to understand what was happening over the weekend,'' said Denelle Dixon, chief legal officer for Mozilla.</p><p>  The reaction from the biggest tech companies, however, has been noticeably subdued. Instead of forceful pleas from their executives, like those in years past on this issue, they are largely speaking through their trade group, the Internet Association, which has expressed disappointment over Mr. Pai's plan.</p><p>  ''Internet companies are firm supporters of the 2015 Open Internet Order and will continue our push for strong, enforceable net neutrality rules going forward,'' said Noah Theran, a spokesman for the Internet Association. ''We are reviewing the draft order and weighing our legal options.''</p><p>  Taking their place are start-ups such as Airbnb, Twitter and Reddit, which joined dozens of smaller start-ups on Monday warning Mr. Pai that the rules would hurt innovation and the economy.</p><p>  Sorting out the real individual commenters from fake or automated accounts is far more tricky. The F.C.C. said it did not have the resources to investigate every comment on its site.</p><p>  Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, said that after a six-month investigation, his office had found that the identities of tens of thousands of state residents were fraudulently used to post comments to the F.C.C.</p><p>  ''If law enforcement can't investigate and (where appropriate) prosecute when it happens on this scale,'' Mr. Schneiderman said, ''the door is open for it to happen again and again.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Ajit Pai, the F.C.C. chairman, said he was targeted by threats and ethnic slurs after the agency sought to repeal net neutrality rules.

CHILD protection charity has called for more social media regulation following a huge spike in online child grooming offences.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Crimes involving communicating a sexual message to a child have increased by more than 80 per cent in five years in Scotland, the NSPCC revealed.</p><p>Figures it obtained using Freedom of Information laws show 651 offences of communicating indecently with a child were recorded by Police Scotland in the last year, compared to 354 crimes in 2014/15 - an increase of 84%. </p><p>There was a 12% rise in the year to April 2020, with the NSPCC warning there could be a sharper increase as a result of the unique threats posed by coronavirus. </p><p>The child protection charity is now calling on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to urgently press ahead with legislation to help prevent offenders from using social media to target children.</p><p>An analysis by the NSPCC of data of an equivalent crime from police forces in England and Wales revealed Facebook-owned apps were used in 55% of cases, from April 2017 to October 2019, where police recorded information about how a child was groomed. </p><p>This data was not available from Police Scotland.</p><p>In February, UK digital minister Matt Warman promised to publish an Online Harms Bill during the current parliamentary session following proposals set out in a White Paper. </p><p>This would see independent regulation of social networks with potential criminal sanctions if tech directors fail to keep children living in the UK safe on their platforms. </p><p>However, frustration is growing at delays to the legislation.</p><p>The NSPCC is now calling on the Prime Minister to deliver an Online Harms Bill, that sets out a duty of care for tech firms to make their sites safer for children, within 18 months.</p><p>It wants Mr Johnson's Government to publish a roadmap that sets out the timescales for a world-leading Bill to go through Westminster as a matter of urgency.</p><p>Chief Executive Peter Wanless spoke to Mr Johnson at a \"hidden harms\" round table last week and highlighted how coronavirus has created a perfect storm for abusers.</p><p>He urged the Prime Minister to ensure there is no unnecessary delay to legislation.</p><p>Mr Wanless said: \"Child abuse is an inconvenient truth for tech bosses who have failed to make their sites safe and enabled offenders to use them as a playground.</p><p>\"Last week the Prime Minister signalled to me his determination to stand up to Silicon Valley and make the UK the world leader in online safety. </p><p>\"He can do this by committing to an Online Harms Bill that puts a legal duty of care on big tech to proactively identifysafety risks.</p><p>\"Now is the time to get regulation done and create a watchdog with the teeth to hold tech directors criminally accountable if their platforms allow children to come to serious but avoidable harm.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Shapiro, an economist who recently did an analysis of the value of data. ''That's what it's like for the big internet companies. It's a sweet deal.''</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  But there is a growing collection of people seeking ways to alter that arrangement. As a disparate group of academics, economists, technologists and lawmakers, their politics range from moderately liberal to free-market conservative.</p><p>  They are pursuing different paths. Some have done research to put a value on personal data, as a way to inform public debate on how to broker a better deal for the online proletariat. Others propose recognizing the data as a tradable asset or as labor, to help create an efficient market for the data and return more digital wealth to individuals and society.</p><p>  Last month, Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, co-sponsored a bill that would require the big internet companies to regularly inform users of what personal data they collect and to disclose the value of that data.</p><p>  ''I'm not sold on what the approach should be,'' said Mr. Warner, a former technology investor and a frequent critic of the tech giants. ''But the status quo -- this massive imbalance of power -- cannot stand.''</p><p>  The rising calls for a better data bargain come during an intensifying backlash against Big Tech and its handling of user data. Lawmakers and regulators in several countries are investigating the companies' market power, their role as gatekeepers of communication and their handling of data, especially in failing to protect users' privacy.</p><p>  On Wednesday, Facebook agreed to new layers of oversight and a record fine to settle privacy violations. It also acknowledged that it was under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission for antitrust concerns. And on Tuesday, the Justice Department said that it would begin examining the internet giants' domination over the market to determine whether they had sought to stifle competition.</p><p>  Not everyone agrees that free services paid for with advertising and data are a bad bargain for consumers. The consumer benefit from free internet services was estimated to be more than $100 billion in the United States alone, according to a 2012 paper co-written by Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management.</p><p>  That figure would be far higher today, given the growth of online offerings. ''Consumers do get a huge amount of value from those services,'' Mr. Brynjolfsson said.</p><p>  But the advocates for a new deal on data are gaining momentum as more is known about how the big internet companies use personal information.</p><p>  Giving information to Google, Facebook or Amazon, for example, is not just a signal of interest or preference, but also the raw material for targeting ads, steering online behavior and training artificial intelligence systems like facial recognition.</p><p>  Consumers are often unaware of the many uses of their data. So far, privacy concerns have been the main focus of scrutiny. But the attention of lawmakers is starting to turn to the concentration of data wealth in the hands of a few companies.</p><p>  A goal of the legislation introduced last month by Mr. Warner and Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, is ''to give consumers some sense of the value of the data they are giving up,'' Mr. Warner explained.</p><p>  How much personal data is worth is a tricky calculation. Estimates vary widely, depending on assumptions. The recent study by Mr. Shapiro's consulting firm took several factors into account, including the falloff in online advertising efficiency when people opt out of data collection.</p><p>  The study estimated that the corporate payoff -- mainly to big tech companies -- from collecting the personal data of Americans online was $76 billion in 2018, and that it would rise sharply in the future.</p><p>  If the government collected a 50 percent fee from companies using Americans' personal data, Mr. Shapiro said, it could contribute significantly to rebuilding the nation's infrastructure or supporting social safety net programs. If paid out to individual users, it would be a check for $122 a person last year. The study was done for Future Majority, a research center for the Democratic Party.</p><p>  Policymakers are struggling with how government action and market forces might be employed to check the power of the data-fueled technology giants.</p><p>  In Colorado, Chris Hansen, a Democratic state legislator and a former energy consultant, brings an electrical energy perspective to the issue.</p><p>  ''These massive tech companies have close to data monopolies,'' Mr. Hansen said. ''Do we need something like data public utility commissions? I don't know, but I do think it's a question worth considering.''</p><p>  In Canada, Michelle Rempel, a Conservative member of Parliament from Calgary, is doubtful that government regulators can ever keep up with the largest tech companies, with their far greater expertise and resources. Government, she said, will have to intervene, but more as a designer of basic rules than as a regulator. ''The goal should be to help build a fair market for data,'' Ms. Rempel said.</p><p>  Those market-building rules, according to policymakers, include clear ownership rights so individuals control their data, and requirements that companies allow personal data to be easily sent to other services at a consumer's request. Such steps, they say, could open the door to a flourishing community of data market makers, aggregating individuals' data and negotiating sales.</p><p>  Already, there are a few start-ups for voluntarily collecting, securing and selling personal data like Meeco and UBDI (Universal Basic Data Income). They typically employ blockchain technology for security and to control access to data. Though potentially promising, they are fledgling upstarts so far, without a lot of users or data.</p><p>  Glen Weyl, an economist at Microsoft Research, who advocates uprooting ''standard capitalism'' with radical market-based solutions, is a leading proponent of valuing ''data as labor'' and nurturing market makers he calls ''mediators of individual data.''</p><p>  These organizations, Mr. Weyl said, might specialize in different kinds of data -- buying, travel, health, hobbies, for example. They could, he added, negotiate a fair price for access to data provided by groups like patients with the same ailment or language translators whose work could improve artificial intelligence systems.</p><p>  ''This is about using market design and technology to shift the balance of power,'' Mr. Weyl said.</p><p>  Interested in All Things Tech?

We hand it over willingly for free services. But the biggest economic windfall goes to the tech giants like Google and Facebook. Their corporate wealth is built on harvesting and commercializing the information supplied by the online multitudes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cImagine if General Motors did not pay for its steel, rubber or glass \u2014 its inputs,\u201d said Robert J. Shapiro, an economist who recently did an analysis of the value of data. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s like for the big internet companies. It\u2019s a sweet deal.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But there is a growing collection of people seeking ways to alter that arrangement. As a disparate group of academics, economists, technologists and lawmakers, their politics range from moderately liberal to free-market conservative.</p><p>They are pursuing different paths. Some have done research to put a value on personal data, as a way to inform public debate on how to broker a better deal for the online proletariat. Others propose recognizing the data as a tradable asset or as labor, to help create an efficient market for the data and return more digital wealth to individuals and society.</p><p>Last month, Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, co-sponsored a bill that would require the big internet companies to regularly inform users of what personal data they collect and to disclose the value of that data.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sold on what the approach should be,\u201d said Mr. Warner, a former technology investor and a frequent critic of the tech giants. \u201cBut the status quo \u2014 this massive imbalance of power \u2014 cannot stand.\u201d</p><p>The rising calls for a better data bargain come during an intensifying backlash against Big Tech and its handling of user data. Lawmakers and regulators in several countries are investigating the companies\u2019 market power, their role as gatekeepers of communication and their handling of data, especially in failing to protect users\u2019 privacy.</p><p>On Wednesday, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/technology/facebook-ftc-antitrust-investigation.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">Facebook agreed</url> to new layers of oversight and a record fine to settle privacy violations. It also acknowledged that it was under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission for antitrust concerns. And on Tuesday, the Justice Department said that it would begin       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/technology/justice-department-tech-antitrust.html\">examining the internet giants\u2019</url> domination over the market to determine whether they had sought to stifle competition.</p><p>Not everyone agrees that free services paid for with advertising and data are a bad bargain for consumers. The consumer benefit from free internet services was estimated to be more than $100 billion in the United States alone, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9ff9/bec84357dacc286b570937a955f358a9a8b5.pdf?_ga=2.186600937.1988189739.1563914315-476915562.1563914315\">a 2012 paper</url> co-written by Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management.</p><p>That figure would be far higher today, given the growth of online offerings. \u201cConsumers do get a huge amount of value from those services,\u201d Mr. Brynjolfsson said.</p><p>But the advocates for a new deal on data are gaining momentum as more is known about how the big internet companies use personal information.</p><p>Giving information to Google, Facebook or Amazon, for example, is not just a signal of interest or preference, but also the raw material for targeting ads, steering online behavior and training artificial intelligence systems like facial recognition.</p><p>Consumers are often unaware of the many uses of their data. So far, privacy concerns have been the main focus of scrutiny. But the attention of lawmakers is starting to turn to the concentration of data wealth in the hands of a few companies.</p><p>A goal of the legislation introduced last month by Mr. Warner and Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, is \u201cto give consumers some sense of the value of the data they are giving up,\u201d Mr. Warner explained.</p><p>How much personal data is worth is a tricky calculation. Estimates vary widely, depending on assumptions. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://assets.futuremajority.org/uploads/report-for-future-majority-on-the-value-of-people-s-personal-data-shapiro-aneja-march-8-2019.pdf\">recent study</url> by Mr. Shapiro\u2019s consulting firm took several factors into account, including the falloff in online advertising efficiency when people opt out of data collection.</p><p>The study estimated that the corporate payoff \u2014 mainly to big tech companies \u2014 from collecting the personal data of Americans online was $76 billion in 2018, and that it would rise sharply in the future.</p><p>If the government collected a 50 percent fee from companies using Americans\u2019 personal data, Mr. Shapiro said, it could contribute significantly to rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure or supporting social safety net programs.

We hand it over willingly for free services. But the biggest economic windfall goes to tech giants like Google and Facebook. Their corporate wealth is built on harvesting and commercializing the information supplied by the online multitudes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Imagine if General Motors did not pay for its steel, rubber or glass - its inputs,\" said Robert Shapiro, an economist who recently did an analysis of the value of data. \"That's what it's like for the big internet companies. It's a sweet deal.\"</p><p>But there is a growing collection of people seeking ways to alter that arrangement. As a disparate group of academics, economists, technologists and lawmakers, their politics range from moderately liberal to free-market conservative.</p><p>They are pursuing different paths. Some have done research to put a value on personal data, as a way to inform public debate on how to broker a better deal for the online proletariat. Others propose recognizing the data as a tradable asset or as labour, to help create an efficient market for the data and return more digital wealth to individuals and society.</p><p>Last month, Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., co-sponsored a bill that would require the big internet companies to regularly inform users of what personal data they collect and to disclose the value of that data.</p><p>\"I'm not sold on what the approach should be,\" said Warner, a former technology investor and a frequent critic of the tech giants. \"But the status quo - this massive imbalance of power - cannot stand.\"</p><p>The rising calls for a better data bargain come during an intensifying backlash against Big Tech and its handling of user data. Lawmakers and regulators in several countries are investigating the companies' market power, their role as gatekeepers of communication and their handling of data, especially in failing to protect users' privacy.</p><p>On Wednesday, Facebook agreed to new layers of oversight and a record fine to settle privacy violations. It also acknowledged that it was under investigation from the Federal Trade Commission for antitrust concerns. And on Tuesday, the Justice Department said that it would begin examining the internet giants' domination over the market to determine whether they had sought to stifle competition.</p><p>Not everyone agrees that free services paid for with advertising and data are a bad bargain for consumers. The consumer benefit from free internet services was estimated to be more than $100 billion in the United States alone, according to a 2012 paper co-written by Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at the MIT Sloan School of Management.</p><p>That figure would be far higher today, given the growth of online offerings. \"Consumers do get a huge amount of value from those services,\" Brynjolfsson said.</p><p>But the advocates for a new deal on data are gaining momentum as more is known about how the big internet companies use personal information.</p><p>Giving information to Google, Facebook or Amazon, for example, is not just a signal of interest or preference but also the raw material for targeting ads, steering online behaviour and training artificial intelligence systems like facial recognition.</p><p>Consumers are often unaware of the many uses of their data. So far, privacy concerns have been the main focus of scrutiny. But the attention of lawmakers is starting to turn to the concentration of data wealth in the hands of a few companies.</p><p>A goal of the legislation introduced last month by Warner and Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., is \"to give consumers some sense of the value of the data they are giving up,\" Warner explained.</p><p>How much personal data is worth is a tricky calculation. Estimates vary widely, depending on assumptions. The recent study by Shapiro's consulting firm took several factors into account, including the falloff in online advertising efficiency when people opt out of data collection.</p><p>The study estimated that the corporate payoff - mainly to big tech companies - from collecting the personal data of Americans online was $76 billion in 2018 and that it would rise sharply in the future.</p><p>If the government collected a 50 percent fee from companies using Americans' personal data, Shapiro said, it could contribute significantly to rebuilding the nation's infrastructure or supporting social safety net programs. If paid out to individual users, it would be a check for $122 a person last year. The study was done for Future Majority, a research centre for the Democratic Party.</p><p>Policymakers are struggling with how government action and market forces might be employed to check the power of the data-fueled technology giants.</p><p>In Colorado, Chris Hansen, a Democratic state legislator and a former energy consultant, brings an electrical energy perspective to the issue.</p><p>\"These massive tech companies have close to data monopolies,\" Hansen said. \"Do we need something like data public utility commissions? I don't know, but I do think it's a question worth considering.\"</p><p>In Canada, Michelle Rempel, a Conservative member of Parliament from Calgary, is doubtful that government regulators can ever keep up with the largest tech companies, with their far greater expertise and resources. Government, she said, will have to intervene but more as a designer of basic rules than as a regulator. \"The goal should be to help build a fair market for data,\" Rempel said.</p><p>Those market-building rules, according to policymakers, include clear ownership rights so individuals control their data, and requirements that companies allow personal data to be easily sent to other services at a consumer's request. Such steps, they say, could open the door to a flourishing community of data market makers, aggregating individuals' data and negotiating sales.</p><p>Already, there are a few startups for voluntarily collecting, securing and selling personal data like Meeco and UBDI (Universal Basic Data Income). They typically employ blockchain technology for security and to control access to data. Although potentially promising, they are fledgling upstarts so far, without a lot of users or data.</p><p>Glen Weyl, an economist at Microsoft Research, who advocates uprooting \"standard capitalism\" with radical market-based solutions, is a leading proponent of valuing \"data as labour\" and nurturing market makers he calls \"mediators of individual data.\"</p><p>These organizations, Weyl said, might specialize in different kinds of data - buying, travel, health, hobbies, for example. They could, he added, negotiate a fair price for access to data provided by groups like patients with the same ailment or language translators whose work could improve artificial intelligence systems.</p><p>\"This is about using market design and technology to shift the balance of power,\" Weyl said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HAMSPC-2019072755186742</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HAMSPC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNM-YFB1-JDH1-C2YN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">247363</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1142\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers, Ltd.

But while the sentiment is understandable, the free market is far more likely to tame these giants without any government intervention.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[ibd-display-video id=3322599 width=50 float=left autostart=true]</p><p>We can remember when everyone was promising that the internet would unleash competition by lowering barriers to entry and often by cutting out the middle man. But in some ways the opposite has happened, as three companies wound up controlling the lion's share of online advertising and commerce.</p><p>That, in turn, has generated growing interest in breaking these companies up, or heavily regulating them as monopolies.</p><p>This past week, for example, a new coalition called \"Freedom From Facebook\" launched a petition calling on the Federal Trade Commission to spin off Facebook  (FB) subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger into competing networks.</p><p>\"Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg have amassed a scary amount of power,\" the group says. \"It buys up or\u00a0bankrupts potential competitors\u00a0to protect its monopoly, killing innovation and choice.\"</p><p>Amazon  (AMZN) is also coming under fire for its sheer size \u2014 it is on track to become the first company in history to reach $1 trillion in value.</p><p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart, recently said that Congress should look into breaking up Amazon because it's \"destroying jobs, and it's destroying value in the (retail) sector,\" adding for good measure that \"it's anti-competitive, it's predatory, and it's not right.\"</p><p>[investors-newsletters-signup /]</p><p>New York University professor Scott Galloway argues that breaking up these and other big tech firms \"could unleash another 20 to 30 years of unbelievable innovation and shareholder growth.\"</p><p>Calls to regulate and break up big companies are not new.

It had a massive retail presence, and a massive mail order catalog (the internet of the day) business. Today it is barely breathing.</p><h>Creative Destruction</h><p>The government never did break Microsoft up. But new competitors like Google  (GOOGL) and Apple  (APPL) fundamentally reshaped the marketplace in ways that severely hampered it.</p><p>Another way to look at it is this: Of the 500 companies that made the Fortune 500 list in 1955, only 53 remain on that list, notes economist .</p><p>Only two of the companies that ranked in the top 10 in 1955 are still on the list. And of the top 10 companies today, four didn't even exist in 1955.</p><p>It's a virtual certainty that decades from now, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple and others will have gone the way of Microsoft or IBM or Sears or Zenith Electronics or Kodak or Bethlehem Steel.

The FTC is generally hamstrung in its ability to write new rules, for example, and it isn't always able to fine tech companies for their first privacy or security offenses.</p><p>\"It would be helpful to have Congress clarify the FTC's authority around privacy and data security,\" she said. \"It would be helpful to have civil penalty authority.

They'll be expected to monitor phenomena such as the fast-growing footprint of companies such as Amazon.com and the security practices of the entire tech industry.</p><p>Already the agency faces its first high-profile test - an investigation into Facebook's recent privacy mishaps. In March, the FTC announced it would scrutinize Facebook's entanglement with Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that improperly accessed names, \"likes\" and other personal information of about up to 87 million of the social site's users. If the FTC finds that Facebook erred, it could result in massive fines and send an early message that it is able and willing to police the country's tech behemoths.</p><p>\"Will the new FTC have the will to take on today's challenges aggressively?\" said Jessica Rich, the former director of the agency's Bureau of Consumer Protection. \"The FTC really is underresourced. So if it steps up and takes on the challenges, it still will have a limited amount of resources to do that.\"</p><p>The FTC's purview is vast. It reviews hospital mergers, responds to consumer reports about robo-calls and ensures that products labeled as \"Made in the USA\" are manufactured here. That stems from its more-than-a-century-old mandate to promote competition and penalize those who engage in unfair or deceptive practices.</p><p>In recent years, though, the FTC has evolved into the U.S. government's primary regulator of the tech industry. Although the country may lack a single, federal online privacy law, the agency still has managed to tap its powers to punish tech giants such as Facebook, Google, Twitter and Uber for failing to protect the sensitive information they amass about their users.</p><p>Despite an expanding workload, the FTC's authorities and resources haven't changed much. Its budget this fiscal year is $306 million - or about a third of 1 percent of the revenue that Google earned in 2017. With those limited funds the agency maintains a workforce of about 1,140 - roughly 300 fewer workers than it had almost four decades earlier, according to FTC records.</p><p>\"The FTC simply can't pay what many technologists make in not even the top echelons of companies,\" said Rich, who is now the vice president of consumer policy and mobilization at Consumer Reports.</p><p>During an interview before she departed, McSweeny praised the agency for its track record, including major settlements with companies such as Volkswagen for allegedly defrauding drivers.</p><p>Still, Rich said the FTC faces major structural challenges, which she and her predecessors long have highlighted without much success. The FTC is generally hamstrung in its ability to write new rules, for example, and it isn't always able to fine tech companies for their first privacy or security offenses.</p><p>\"It would be helpful to have Congress clarify the FTC's authority around privacy and data security,\" she said. \"It would be helpful to have civil penalty authority. I think it would be helpful for the agency to have regulatory authority.\"</p><p>Those strictures now fall to Simons, who officially assumed the title of FTC chairman Tuesday after serving as an antitrust litigator at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison for clients such as Microsoft and Sony. It's not his first tour of duty in the federal government: Simons worked at the agency as director of the Bureau of Competition from 2001 to 2003. His office declined to make him available for an interview.</p><p>To start, the agency is under pressure to penalize not only Facebook but also other tech companies that mishandle consumers' data.</p><p>\"The FTC largely failed during the Obama years to address the most pressing challenges,\" said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which brought the complaint that led to the FTC's settlement with Facebook in 2011. \"The evidence of that is made clear every day.\"</p><p>Others would like to see the FTC under its new leaders take a closer look at companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google for potential antitrust concerns. Regulators around the world increasingly are fearful that Big Tech is too big - especially in Europe, which is still probing Google's business practices. In the United States, the FTC hasn't brought such a major case since its own probe of Google - an investigation it closed in 2013 by leaving the company intact.</p><p>\"We're in an era in which we have massive consolidation happening throughout virtually every sector of the economy, and we've had over the last two decades the rise of the tech industry,\" said Ganesh Sitaraman, co-founder of the nonprofit Great Democracy Initiative, a new policy group founded by two former aides to Sen.

They'll be expected to monitor phenomena such as the fast-growing footprint of companies such as Amazon.com and the security practices of the entire tech industry.</p><p>Already the agency faces its first high-profile test - an investigation into Facebook's recent privacy mishaps. In March, the FTC announced it would scrutinize Facebook's entanglement with Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that improperly accessed names, \"likes\" and other personal information of about up to 87 million of the social site's users. If the FTC finds that Facebook erred, it could result in massive fines and send an early message that it is able and willing to police the country's tech behemoths.</p><p>\"Will the new FTC have the will to take on today's challenges aggressively?\" said Jessica Rich, the former director of the agency's Bureau of Consumer Protection. \"The FTC really is underresourced. So if it steps up and takes on the challenges, it still will have a limited amount of resources to do that.\"</p><p>The FTC's purview is vast. It reviews hospital mergers, responds to consumer reports about robo-calls and ensures that products labeled as \"Made in the USA\" are manufactured here. That stems from its more-than-a-century-old mandate to promote competition and penalize those who engage in unfair or deceptive practices.</p><p>In recent years, though, the FTC has evolved into the U.S. government's primary regulator of the tech industry. Although the country may lack a single, federal online privacy law, the agency still has managed to tap its powers to punish tech giants such as Facebook, Google, Twitter and Uber for failing to protect the sensitive information they amass about their users.</p><p>Despite an expanding workload, the FTC's authorities and resources haven't changed much. Its budget this fiscal year is $306 million - or about a third of 1 percent of the revenue that Google earned in 2017. With those limited funds the agency maintains a workforce of about 1,140 - roughly 300 fewer workers than it had almost four decades earlier, according to FTC records.</p><p>\"The FTC simply can't pay what many technologists make in not even the top echelons of companies,\" said Rich, who is now the vice president of consumer policy and mobilization at Consumer Reports.</p><p>During an interview before she departed, McSweeny praised the agency for its track record, including major settlements with companies such as Volkswagen for allegedly defrauding drivers.</p><p>Still, Rich said the FTC faces major structural challenges, which she and her predecessors long have highlighted without much success. The FTC is generally hamstrung in its ability to write new rules, for example, and it isn't always able to fine tech companies for their first privacy or security offenses.</p><p>\"It would be helpful to have Congress clarify the FTC's authority around privacy and data security,\" she said. \"It would be helpful to have civil penalty authority. I think it would be helpful for the agency to have regulatory authority.\"</p><p>Those strictures now fall to Simons, who officially assumed the title of FTC chairman Tuesday after serving as an antitrust litigator at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison for clients such as Microsoft and Sony. It's not his first tour of duty in the federal government: Simons worked at the agency as director of the Bureau of Competition from 2001 to 2003. His office declined to make him available for an interview.</p><p>To start, the agency is under pressure to penalize not only Facebook but also other tech companies that mishandle consumers' data.</p><p>\"The FTC largely failed during the Obama years to address the most pressing challenges,\" said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, which brought the complaint that led to the FTC's settlement with Facebook in 2011. \"The evidence of that is made clear every day.\"</p><p>Others would like to see the FTC under its new leaders take a closer look at companies such as Amazon, Facebook and Google for potential antitrust concerns. Regulators around the world increasingly are fearful that Big Tech is too big - especially in Europe, which is still probing Google's business practices. In the United States, the FTC hasn't brought such a major case since its own probe of Google - an investigation it closed in 2013 by leaving the company intact.</p><p>\"We're in an era in which we have massive consolidation happening throughout virtually every sector of the economy, and we've had over the last two decades the rise of the tech industry,\" said Ganesh Sitaraman, co-founder of the nonprofit Great Democracy Initiative, a new policy group founded by two former aides to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). \"And in large part the FTC has not been doing its job sufficiently to enforce our antitrust laws.\" </p><p>In perhaps a sign of his approach, Simons told Congress earlier this year that the U.S. government may have been \"too permissive in dealing with mergers and acquisitions.\" He said the FTC needs to \"devote substantial resources to determining whether its merger enforcement has been too lax.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:tony.romm@washpost.com\">tony.romm@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-115d6dba4fdf11e884a0458a1aa9ac0a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S81-MB41-DYX1-H007-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"992\"/><timeReceived>10:58 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 5, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>AMZN (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

The question at hand is whether the big technology firms are using their clout to crush their rivals and stifle competition. Witnesses can expect a grilling from all sides. </p><p>Although American policymakers are more polarised than ever, their fondness for tech-bashing is remarkably bipartisan.Growing antitrust scrutiny stems in part from the sheer size of the tech firms. The big five\u2014Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft\u2014are cumulatively valued at $4.2trn, representing one-seventh of America's total stockmarket value. Over the past 12 months they have amassed $180bn in pre-tax profits, equivalent to roughly a tenth of all profits generated by American publicly-traded companies.The firms' giant cash piles have helped fuel a flurry of acquisitions. In 2011 Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5bn. Three years later Facebook splashed out $18bn on WhatsApp, a rival messaging firm. In 2016 Microsoft acquired LinkedIn, a professional-networking site, for $24bn. The following year Amazon snapped up Whole Foods, a posh grocer, for $13.6bn. The firms have splurged some $92bn of cash in the past five years (as well as additional billions in stock) buying up smaller rival firms (see chart).That is not the only thing to have aroused the suspicion of regulators and politicians. In the past two years Alphabet, Google's parent company, has been stung three times by EU regulators, to the tune of \u20ac8.25bn ($9.27bn), for anti-competitive behaviour in the fields of online-shopping search results, its mobile operating system and advertising. This month France announced a new digital-services tax on big tech companies. Several other European countries are considering similar levies. Meanwhile, America's Federal Trade Commission is reportedly planning to hit Facebook with a $5bn fine for data-privacy violations.To fight back, Silicon Valley has turned to K Street. Since 2014 the big five tech companies have spent some $265m lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Alphabet, Google's parent company, is one of the biggest spenders. In 2018 alone, the search giant spent $22m on lobbying. That hasn't muted growing calls for action. Just try typing 'Should Google' into the firm's own search bar. The first autocomplete response is 'be broken up'. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-ECNM1180071563296966964251762100117</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECNM-118007</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK9-8CK1-F03R-N41F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"426\"/><timeReceived>5:09 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Economist: Graphic detail</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001U7O</classCode><className>MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The question at hand is whether the big technology firms are using their clout to crush their rivals and stifle competition. Witnesses can expect a grilling from all sides. Although American policymakers are more polarised than ever, their fondness for tech-bashing is remarkably bipartisan.</p><p>Growing antitrust scrutiny stems in part from the sheer size of the tech firms. The big five--Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft--are cumulatively valued at $4.2trn, representing one-seventh of America's total stockmarket value. Over the past 12 months they have amassed $180bn in pre-tax profits, equivalent to roughly a tenth of all profits generated by American publicly-traded companies.</p><p>The firms' giant cash piles have helped fuel a flurry of acquisitions. In 2011 Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5bn. Three years later Facebook splashed out $18bn on WhatsApp, a rival messaging firm. In 2016 Microsoft acquired LinkedIn, a professional-networking site, for $24bn. The following year Amazon snapped up Whole Foods, a posh grocer, for $13.6bn. The firms have splurged some $92bn of cash in the past five years (as well as additional billions in stock) buying up smaller rival firms (see chart).</p><p>That is not the only thing to have aroused the suspicion of regulators and politicians. In the past two years Alphabet, Google's parent company, has been stung three times by EU regulators, to the tune of E8.25bn ($9.27bn), for anti-competitive behaviour in the fields of online-shopping search results, its mobile operating system and advertising. This month France announced a new digital-services tax on big tech companies. Several other European countries are considering similar levies. Meanwhile, America's Federal Trade Commission is reportedly planning to hit Facebook with a $5bn fine for data-privacy violations.</p><p>To fight back, Silicon Valley has turned to K Street. Since 2014 the big five tech companies have spent some $265m lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Alphabet, Google's parent company, is one of the biggest spenders. In 2018 alone, the search giant spent $22m on lobbying. That hasn't muted growing calls for action. Just try typing \"Should Google...\" into the firm's own search bar.

The question at hand is whether the big technology firms are using their clout to crush their rivals and stifle competition. Witnesses can expect a grilling from all sides. Although American policymakers are more polarised than ever, their fondness for tech-bashing is remarkably bipartisan.</p><p>Growing antitrust scrutiny stems in part from the sheer size of the tech firms. The big five--Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft--are cumulatively valued at $4.2trn, representing one-seventh of America's total stockmarket value. Over the past 12 months they have amassed $180bn in pre-tax profits, equivalent to roughly a tenth of all profits generated by American publicly-traded companies.</p><p>The firms' giant cash piles have helped fuel a flurry of acquisitions. In 2011 Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5bn. Three years later Facebook splashed out $18bn on WhatsApp, a rival messaging firm. In 2016 Microsoft acquired LinkedIn, a professional-networking site, for $24bn. The following year Amazon snapped up Whole Foods, a posh grocer, for $13.6bn. The firms have splurged some $92bn of cash in the past five years (as well as additional billions in stock) buying up smaller rival firms (see chart).</p><p>That is not the only thing to have aroused the suspicion of regulators and politicians. In the past two years Alphabet, Google's parent company, has been stung three times by EU regulators, to the tune of E8.25bn ($9.27bn), for anti-competitive behaviour in the fields of online-shopping search results, its mobile operating system and advertising. This month France announced a new digital-services tax on big tech companies. Several other European countries are considering similar levies. Meanwhile, America's Federal Trade Commission is reportedly planning to hit Facebook with a $5bn fine for data-privacy violations.</p><p>To fight back, Silicon Valley has turned to K Street. Since 2014 the big five tech companies have spent some $265m lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Alphabet, Google's parent company, is one of the biggest spenders. In 2018 alone, the search giant spent $22m on lobbying. That hasn't muted growing calls for action. Just try typing \"Should Google...\" into the firm's own search bar. The first autocomplete response is \"be broken up\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECOCOM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECOCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK9-83K1-F03B-T009-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">251202</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"421\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Economist Newspapers, NA, Incorporated All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Economist.Com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37727\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001U7O</classCode><className>MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

a report has recommended.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The call comes amid growing concern over people's privacy online.</p><p>During the 12 days of Christmas, more than 2,000 profiles of every internet user in the UK - a total of totalling at least 118 billion for the UK - will have been sent out to hundreds of advertisers, according to analysis by British think tank New Economics Foundation .</p><p>Internet giants such as Facebook and Google rely heavily on advertising revenue.</p><p>Although users agree to share this data by accepting their terms and conditions, it is thought that many people do not actually read them.</p><p>\"Our digital selves have become marketable products and large companies are collecting and sharing data, our data, to make a profit at any cost,\" said Duncan McCann , researcher at the NEF.</p><p>\"Until legislation catches up, the adtech industry and the tech giants will use increasingly invasive services to advertise to us while compromising our data.</p><p>\"This is a critical moment where we must intervene to ensure that the core business model of the digital age is not centred on ubiquitous surveillance and the provision of personalised advertising.</p><p>\"Our proposal will disrupt the business model of big tech and force companies to use our personal data responsibly, without compromising our privacy.\"</p><p>The report, entitled Blocking the Data Stalkers, details how tech firms use bid requests for advertisers to assess the value of showing an advertisement whenever a user clicks on a link.</p><p>It warns that the information generated about a person when they click on a link could include sensitive information such as their sexuality or political beliefs.</p><p>The think tank also claims that there are loopholes in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force in May to address data protection and privacy.</p><p>It argues that the law is flawed because it requires individuals to take action, such as giving consent or lodging a complaint with the watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office.</p><p>In 2018, 44% of all spending on advertising will be online - estimated to be worth 237 billion dollars (\u00a3187 billion), rising to more than 50% by 2020.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

How good do you think the -algorithms will be in China? It has the biggest data set in the world and can do whatever it wants with it while the Western nations are left to figure it out all for themselves. That's where the danger lies and that's why we need a clear public, private partnership on this.\"With no clear global consensus on data privacy, Mr Gregoire warned that fragmentation would leave Western nations at a distinct disadvantage. \"You can protect the data but you don't want to stifle innovation, which is a recipe to change, and those who change quickly win, and China is well poised on that front,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-c82ad912411e11e8823007c04818ea9425c2aff00a72d0b7ed4dc29f146ef430</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S42-9HB1-F0JP-W0H8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"608\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 17, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000248A</classCode><className>CA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>CA (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DG3K</classCode><className>DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLLK</classCode><className>DIGITAL ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001207</classCode><className>NEW ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLLK</classCode><className>DIGITAL ECONOMY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

new laws on online political advertising; and a global framework for privacy and data protection regulation.</p><p> Mr Zuckerberg's call for new regulation comes as the so-called Big Tech companies - major tech firms including Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft - are facing increasing scrutiny from governments, spurred by antitrust and data privacy concerns.</p><p>United States presidential candidate and Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren last month became the latest politician to call for action against Big Tech.</p><p>  Arguing that Big Tech firms \"have too much power over our economy, our society and our democracy\", Senator Warren proposed that these firms with global revenues of US$25 billion (S$33.9 billion) or more that offer platforms - such as Amazon Marketplace, Google Search and Apple's App Store - should not be allowed to participate in their own platforms .</p><p> This is to ensure fair play in business, which ultimately benefits consumers.</p><p> For instance, music streaming service Spotify last month brought an antitrust complaint against Apple over its App Store platform. Spotify distributes its service on the App Store, but at the same time, competes with Apple Music.</p><p>Spotify said Apple has an unfair advantage because Apple takes a 30 per cent cut from developers, which includes Spotify, for App Store purchases.</p><p>Spotify alleges that refusing to pay this commission would result in the service facing \"technical and experience-limiting restrictions\", such as locking Spotify out of Apple services such as Siri and Apple Watch.</p><p> Another impact of Big Tech is the issue of privacy risks.</p><p> Professor Boh Wai Fong of the Nanyang Business School at Nanyang Technological University said that the ownership and control of large amounts of data by tech giants give them a lot of power, \"especially as companies like Facebook keep getting into the limelight for the wrong reasons, such as the Cambridge Analytica and other scandals\".</p><p>  A common argument against governments regulating tech firms is, according to Alphabet chairman John Hennessy, that the Internet and technology move too fast for government regulations to keep pace.</p><p> Mr Bryan Tan, a lawyer from Pinsent Masons MPillay who specialises in technology law and data protection, said that regulations may have \"a chilling effect\" on innovation, so governments need to \"balance regulation and encouraging creativity\".</p><p> Prof Boh said that having more regulations could possibly benefit incumbents rather than start-ups because incumbents have the resources to comply with additional laws.</p><p> \"Regulators need to be nuanced in their policymaking, in terms of providing exceptions and allowing regulations to be contingent on the size and resources of organisations,\" she added.</p><p> However, Mr Benjamin Ang, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said that many governments are seriously looking into regulating Big Tech.</p><p> He said: \"These (Big Tech) companies have achieved near-monopoly power, accumulated resources that rival nation states and control the data of hundreds of millions of citizens in hundreds of countries, and yet have largely escaped regulation so far.</p><p> \"When this has happened in other industries like oil and telecommunications, regulators have had to step in to protect consumers.\"</p><p> The current norm - self-regulation - is also losing favour.</p><p> Even industry leaders, such as Apple's Tim Cook, admitted last year that the free market approach has not worked, especially when it comes to privacy protection.</p><p>Singapore Management University associate professor of law Eugene Tan Kheng Boon said that self-regulation has been shown to be \"patently lacking\".</p><p> He added that the lack of laws meant that each tech platform \"sets its own internal rules on how to deal with third-party requests for take-down or removal of content\", with little oversight or transparency.</p><p>Facebook and YouTube had come under fire for failing to act quickly enough to take down videos of the Christchurch terror attack. Facebook said the original video was viewed 4,000 times before it was removed.</p><p> Prof Tan said: \"The Christchurch terror attack showed the need for Big Tech platforms to have an integrated major-event protocol wherein they could all work in concert to prevent undesirable content from being amplified through their platforms.\"</p><p>  To tackle the spread of fake news online, Singapore has proposed legislation to give the Government the power to hold online news sources and platforms accountable for proliferating deliberate falsehoods.</p><p> The Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Bill, tabled in Parliament on Monday, will require Internet platforms such as Facebook to limit the spread of falsehoods by displaying corrections alongside posts or removing them. Failing to comply may lead to fines of up to $1 million for online platforms.</p><p> Lawyer Bryan Tan said other tools available to governments to rein in Big Tech are \"censorship, licensing and antitrust\".</p><p> In general, he said, the Europeans prefer antitrust regulations while authoritarian countries rely on censorship.</p><p> The European Union recently fined Google (EURO)1.49 billion (S$2.3 billion) for blocking competitors in the advertising business. Altogether, the EU has fined Google (EURO)8.2 billion for breaching antitrust rules.</p><p> Prof Boh said that imposing steep fines on tech giants may be effective in forcing them to comply with local laws.</p><p> But she said the tough stance taken by Europe may stifle the development of their technologies, compared with more tolerant regimes, such as China.</p><p> She added that breaking up Big Tech is not the solution: \"There are now tech giants in both the West and the East. Breaking up a company dominating the Western world will only benefit tech giants in the East.\"</p><p>   At first, attempting the challenge - go 48 hours without using any technology from Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft - did not seem like it would be much of a sacrifice.</p><p> After all, I've given up these same creature comforts and more in my military in-camp training stints before.</p><p> How wrong was I.</p><p> If you are on reservist training in the jungle, or chilling out by the pool on vacation, the technology sacrifice would be easier - you have mentally and physically removed yourself from your normal life and could easily take a break from such tech tools as well.</p><p> But when you are trying to get on with daily life and work, it is almost like taking away one of your senses.</p><p> How many times a day do you check WhatsApp or Gmail? Do you do your word processing with Google Docs or Microsoft Word'</p><p> Now, imagine not being able to access any of those things, while still carrying out your daily chores. You get the picture.</p><p> The realisation of just how much of my life was being controlled by the offerings of the Big Tech giants really hit home with six hours left in my challenge.</p><p> It was Saturday night and I was playing a video game. I had my PlayStation 4 controller in hand and my eyes were glued to my LG Smart TV - the two loopholes in this challenge as both devices run operating systems based on open source software that do not belong to the tech giants.</p><p> I was annihilating the online competition in my game, but I wasn't enjoying myself.</p><p> The reason: Almost no one has called me on my Nokia 8110, the retro-styled and feature-curtailed phone I have to use for this challenge, in nearly two days.</p><p> Other than two short phone calls with one friend, I hadn't had any connection with the \"outside\" world.</p><p> Society has long since relegated the SMS app - the main messaging tool available to me during the challenge - to little more than a call-screening tool and a graveyard of bill payment reminders from credit card companies.</p><p> Certainly, none of my friends were dispatching SMS messages to me.</p><p> I didn't know how my friend in Japan was coping with his new promotion, or what hate-filled opinions an annoying Facebook contact had about Captain Marvel.</p><p> Absent was the flurry of one-liner instant messages, emojis and animated GIFs I was used to getting by the hour, I'd never felt more disconnected from the world.</p><p> So when time finally ran out on my 48-hour challenge, I couldn't wait to swop the Nokia 8110 for my iPhone X again and binge-replied to two days' worth of messages that had accumulated - with mostly emojis and GIFs.</p><p> But as painful as it was to live without the offerings of the Apples and Facebooks of the world, this challenge did make me see how easy it is to be caught in the trappings of modern technology and its culture - for instance, spending too much time on instant messaging and recycling jokes and pop-culture references.</p><p> The lesson for me: We should share more real moments with friends, family and colleagues in person or over a phone call. Besides, information would flow more quickly this way than via any app, and it would probably leave both parties with a laugh or two.</p><p> So even though I have now got my iPhone back, I think I'm going to be tweaking my communication habits - by texting less and talking more.</p><p>Bryan De Silva</p><p>  The heat was sweltering and I was speed walking in the hot sun, hoping and praying that I was headed in the right direction.</p><p> I was on my way to conduct an interview at a newsmaker's apartment located in Sengkang, an area I had been to only once before, and I could not be sure if I was on the right track.</p><p> This was after I had spent the last 10 minutes carefully scrutinising the neighbourhood map put up at the MRT station, twisting my neck in awkward positions as I tried to flip the map around in my head.</p><p> The cursing began when I realised that the map was not detailed enough to indicate building block numbers.</p><p> Normally, this would have been a relatively pain-free process. I would have just whipped out my phone and entrusted Google Maps to map out the route for me.</p><p> This time around, however, I did not have that luxury - and after wandering around aimlessly under the hot afternoon sun for awhile, my usual option really did feel like a luxury.</p><p> I had been tasked by my boss to cut out four American tech giants - Facebook, Google, Apple and Microsoft - from my life for 48 hours and I was struggling through my second day.</p><p> Thanks to this tech detox forced upon me, I had been banned from using my Android smartphone - Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google - let alone rely on Google Maps.</p><p> I did have a phone with me for emergencies, so I could call or text the newsmaker if I got lost. But my replacement phone was the Nokia 8110, a re-imagined version of the one that Neo himself had used in The Matrix (1999) - and the idea of slowly typing out yet another SMS via the old-fashioned multi-tap keypad was highly unappealing.</p><p> I eventually made it to my interviewee's home on time and in one piece.</p><p> But the journey was just one of many instances that demonstrated how reliant I have become on just a handful of tech companies.</p><p> I felt major #fomo (fear of missing out), having been cut off Instagram and Whatsapp, both owned by Facebook. I did not know what my friends were chatting about in our group chats and it drove me nuts.</p><p> I could not call for a car via Grab or Gojek, and resorted to fighting off other desperate passengers on the sidewalk as I tried to hail a cab to get to a supper outing. In the end, I took the bus.</p><p> Even as I patted myself on the back for thinking of going to my company's Information Resource Centre to ask for help with research for a story, instead of my usual method of Googling, the staff member there told me to e-mail my request. At The Straits Times, we use Gmail on Windows laptops so that was not an option.</p><p> The detox experience was not all bad, though. I managed to get enough sleep for two nights because I did not get distracted by random YouTube videos and Facebook updates on my phone in bed.</p><p> I also finished reading a book that I had put off for the longest time and I became pretty competent at the classic Snake game.</p><p> If I had no work to do and was simply lying on a beach somewhere on vacation, going off the grid is absolutely possible and even a little appealing.</p><p> But the problems arise when I need to get certain things done because that is how closely linked our lives have become with technology.</p><p> On the third day, after the full detox was over, I attempted a partial tech cleanse of sorts - by not using the usual apps from the American tech giants.</p><p> As I can read Chinese, I tried using a number of alternative Chinese apps. Instead of searching for information on Google, I used Baidu, and instead of using Google Maps, I used Baidu Maps.</p><p> For most searches, the results were not too shoddy - but only if I typed in Chinese. If I tried to search for something in English on Baidu, the results were sometimes so far off that they were baffling.</p><p> For now then, I am certain I will not be cutting out any of the tech giants from my life any time soon.</p><p> Dear boss, please do not make me do it again.</p><p>Yip Wai Yee</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-574810</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VSX-YTS1-JCF2-849F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2549\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 3, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The CCPA stiffens penalties for companies if personal data that they hold are disclosed or stolen, prompting debate about how privacy should be regulated, and what level of government--state or federal--should be responsible for doing so.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Caltech undergraduate Rona Yu, a junior studying computer science in the Division of Engineering and Applied Science, has embarked on a yearlong project with Morgan Kousser, professor of history and social science, to examine the issue. In addition to submitting formal recommendations to the Federal Trade Commission as part of its comment process as it considers new privacy regulations, Yu will deliver a seminar at Caltech on June 3 that is open to the public. Recently, Yu answered a few questions about her project and why privacy is so important.</p><p>What got you interested in the issue of privacy?</p><p>Last spring, UCLA professor Adam Winkler, who is a constitutional lawyer, came to campus and gave a talk through the Caltech Y. His talk addressed the constitutional rights of businesses, but didn't really cover tech companies, which are of interest to me, so I reached out to him to discuss it further. That summer, California enacted the CCPA, which gained a lot of media attention because big tech companies in the U.S. are concerned about its implications and the possible economic effects of having one state with drastically different privacy regulations than all the other states. The CCPA triggered the Federal Trade Commission to call for comments and hold a series of privacy hearings. Companies, academic lawyers, and individuals--like me--started researching how to actually draft a national privacy law.</p><p>How are you researching this topic?</p><p>My first term, I just started off with a reading course on a specific piece of legislation for general Institute credit. Over time, it developed into a larger-scale, long-term project that actually satisfied my Caltech humanities requirements. By my second term, I had started thinking about the broader question: \"What should the nation be doing, right now, to draft a privacy regulation?\" To that end, I've written a paper that covers the points that new privacy legislation should be prioritizing, the potential unintended consequences of the legislation that has been proposed, and other smaller things that I think are going to become larger issues. I then prepared a document describing my findings that I will submit to the Federal Trade Commission.</p><p>Do you advocate a national strategy to legislate privacy rules, or more of a state-by-state approach?</p><p>I'm actually advocating for a kind of mixture of the two. I'm advocating for a national approach to the most sensitive kinds of information; geolocation data, for example, should have minimal federal standards. But because technology is evolving so quickly and because national regulations are kind of bureaucratic and take a while to pass once they have been proposed, I think states should be able to experiment a little bit on their own and they should not be completely preempted from developing state-based regulations.</p><p>How has this made you think about your own privacy online?</p><p>One day I was clicking around on my Facebook page, and I discovered that, under \"settings,\" there was a list of the companies that have your contact information and a list of your interests and other personal information. When I looked at mine, I found that there were a bunch of third parties I'd never heard of who had purchased information about me, but there was no way to easily find out exactly what they had purchased. Facebook was just saying that it's likely they'd given out my email or phone number, but they weren't really transparent about it. I guess, for me, that was my first sign that I didn't know where my own data were.</p><p>Since then, I've started thinking about how this lack of transparency could lead to increasingly serious downstream consequences that people don't really realize or discuss. Could insurance companies discriminate based on pre-existing health conditions predicted from social media activity patterns? Could companies target individuals who seem depressed and more prone to risky economic decisions? Could employers advertise jobs along gender stereotypes?</p><p>What message about privacy would you like to convey to your peers, particularly those who are getting ready to take jobs in the tech industry?</p><p>I would advise them to keep track of what is going on in policy and to know that tech policy does need people who have the technical background to understand what is actually happening with the data. I think the most effective legislation is going to understand both the technical and the policy aspect of things. A lot of the students here have the right background to make a big impact on policy, but they often aren't really aware of what's going on in the political sphere. It's important, and I would advise them to learn more about it.</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>'MSTRUCK'-6738449 'MSTRUCK'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6738449</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W5W-W1S1-DYG2-R1D5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"862\"/><timeReceived>9:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 23, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The CCPA stiffens penalties for companies if personal data that they hold are disclosed or stolen, prompting debate about how privacy should be regulated, and what level of government\u2014state or federal\u2014should be responsible for doing so.  Caltech undergraduate Rona Yu, a junior studying computer science in the Division of Engineering and Applied Science, has embarked on a yearlong project with Morgan Kousser, professor of history and social science, to examine the issue. In addition to submitting formal recommendations to the Federal Trade Commission as part of its comment process as it considers new privacy regulations, Yu will deliver a seminar at Caltech on June 3 that is open to the public. </p><p>Recently, Yu answered a few questions about her project and why privacy is so important. What got you interested in the issue of privacy?  Last spring, UCLA professor Adam Winkler, who is a constitutional lawyer, came to campus and gave a talk through the Caltech Y. His talk addressed the constitutional rights of businesses, but didn't really cover tech companies, which are of interest to me, so I reached out to him to discuss it further. That summer, California enacted the CCPA, which gained a lot of media attention because big tech companies in the U.S. are concerned about its implications and the possible economic effects of having one state with drastically different privacy regulations than all the other states. The CCPA triggered the Federal Trade Commission to call for comments and hold a series of privacy hearings. Companies, academic lawyers, and individuals\u2014like me\u2014started researching how to actually draft a national privacy law. How are you researching this topic?  My first term, I just started off with a reading course on a specific piece of legislation for general Institute credit. Over time, it developed into a larger-scale, long-term project that actually satisfied my Caltech humanities requirements. By my second term, I had started thinking about the broader question: \"What should the nation be doing, right now, to draft a privacy regulation?\" To that end, I've written a paper that covers the points that new privacy legislation should be prioritizing, the potential unintended consequences of the legislation that has been proposed, and other smaller things that I think are going to become larger issues. I then prepared a document describing my findings that I will submit to the Federal Trade Commission. Do you advocate a national strategy to legislate privacy rules, or more of a state-by-state approach?  I'm actually advocating for a kind of mixture of the two. I'm advocating for a national approach to the most sensitive kinds of information; geolocation data, for example, should have minimal federal standards. But because technology is evolving so quickly and because national regulations are kind of bureaucratic and take a while to pass once they have been proposed, I think states should be able to experiment a little bit on their own and they should not be completely preempted from developing state-based regulations. How has this made you think about your own privacy online?  One day I was clicking around on my Facebook page, and I discovered that, under \"settings,\" there was a list of the companies that have your contact information and a list of your interests and other personal information. When I looked at mine, I found that there were a bunch of third parties I'd never heard of who had purchased information about me, but there was no way to easily find out exactly what they had purchased. Facebook was just saying that it's likely they'd given out my email or phone number, but they weren't really transparent about it. I guess, for me, that was my first sign that I didn't know where my own data were.  Since then, I've started thinking about how this lack of transparency could lead to increasingly serious downstream consequences that people don't really realize or discuss. Could insurance companies discriminate based on pre-existing health conditions predicted from social media activity patterns? Could companies target individuals who seem depressed and more prone to risky economic decisions? Could employers advertise jobs along gender stereotypes? What message about privacy would you like to convey to your peers, particularly those who are getting ready to take jobs in the tech industry?  I would advise them to keep track of what is going on in policy and to know that tech policy does need people who have the technical background to understand what is actually happening with the data. I think the most effective legislation is going to understand both the technical and the policy aspect of things. A lot of the students here have the right background to make a big impact on policy, but they often aren't really aware of what's going on in the political sphere. It's important, and I would advise them to learn more about it.

It was a report that drew on hours of testimony from Cambridge Analytica directors, Facebook executives and dozens of expert witnesses: 73 in total, of whom MPs had asked 4,350 questions. And its conclusion? That Silicon Valley's tech platforms were out of control, none more so than Facebook, which it said had treated parliament with \"contempt\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And it's a measure of how much hasn't changed that this was a news story for just two hours on a Monday morning before the next Westminster drama - the launch of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">Independent Group</url> - knocked it off the headline slots.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was a year ago this weekend that the Observer published the first in a series of stories, known as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">the Cambridge Analytica</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">Files</url>, that led to parliament grappling with these questions. The account of a whistleblower from inside the data analytics firm that had worked in different capacities - the details are still disputed - on the two pivotal campaigns of 2016 that gave us Brexit and Trump.</p><p>Christopher Wylie, a 28-year-old Canadian and former research director at Cambridge Analytica, revealed how the company had exploited Facebook data harvested from millions of people across the world to profile and target them with political messages and misinformation, without their knowledge or consent.</p><p>What followed can only be described as a media firestorm. The story made headlines all over the world. In the week after we published Wylie's interview, Britain's information commissioner obtained a warrant to enter Cambridge Analytica's offices and seize its servers. Questions were asked in parliament. Facebook's share price plunged more than $50bn. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">It has now fallen well over</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">twice that</url>. </p><p>The affair raged for months. Cambridge Analytica rode it out, initially, but finally <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">called in the administrators</url> in May. In April Facebook admitted it wasn't 50 million users who had had their profiles mined, as we had reported, it was actually       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">87 million users</url>.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">Mark Zuckerberg was hauled before US congress</url>. And in October the Information Commissioner's Office fined Facebook its maximum possible penalty - \u00a3500,000 (which Facebook is appealing against).</p><p>When I meet Wylie to discuss the story a year on, I ask if he's managed to process it all yet - the impact, the fallout, the loss of billions of dollars.</p><p>\"No,\" he says. \"I mean... how do you fathom a billion dollars? I've never seen a billion dollars. I don't think anybody has. Maybe the US Treasury. But no, I can't fathom that.\"</p><p>The year has been like a mirage, he says. \"A lot of those months didn't feel real. It felt like being in la-la land.\"</p><p>Wylie became a public figure overnight. And the story triggered what, in many ways, looks like a year of reckoning for the tech industry. Damian Collins, the chair of the Department of Culture, Media and Sport's 18-month-long fake news inquiry, which delivered last month's report, described the story's publication as a \"pivotal moment\" when \"public attitudes and government policy towards the tech companies started to change\".</p><p>Last week, on the 30th anniversary of the worldwide web, its creator Tim Berners-Lee urged people to stop the \"downward plunge\" to \"a dysfunctional future\" that the Cambridge Analytica scandal had helped expose. It was, Berners-Lee said, the moment people realised that \"elections had been manipulated using data that they contributed\".</p><p>The problem is that while the tech companies have been called to account, they haven't actually been held accountable. In November, after Zuckerberg refused to comply with a summons to parliament to answer questions about Facebook's role in the scandal, Collins convened an international committee of nine parliaments. Zuckerberg refused to come to that too.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">Jason Kint</url>, the Washington-based chief executive of the trade association Digital Content Next, and a tech industry expert, describes Facebook's refusal to answer parliament's questions about its role in the scandal as \"the greatest cover-up in the history of the internet\". He has followed the fallout in minute detail, and all the subsequent parliamentary and congressional hearings, waiting for answers that never came.</p><p>The story was about how a company was able to use and abuse our personal information to target us in ways we can't even see, let alone understand. But the scandal that followed seems to reveal something far more shocking. That Facebook is not just bigger than any nation state on Earth, with 1.74 billion users, and plays a pivotal role in their elections, but that it's completely out of control.</p><p>\"This may be the first time in history where a company literally controlled by one person appears to be unaccountable to anyone anywhere on Earth,\" says Kint.</p><p>A year ago, we knew none of this. This weekend is the anniversary of the story's publication, but it's almost two years since I met Wylie. We always knew the story would strike a blow against Cambridge Analytica. It's why both he and I spent a year of our lives working on it. And why I shared my research with Channel 4 News, to enable their <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">undercover filming of Cambridge Analytica bosses</url>, and with the NewYorkTimes. But neither of us had realised quite how calamitous an effect it would have on Facebook.</p><p>\"Well, yes and no,\" Wylie says. \"Because what we did not anticipate was how Facebook would continuously shoot themselves in the foot. It was fair to assume it would have an impact on Facebook, but not that it would be a catastrophic crisis. But I think what the story really did was it forced them to show their cards.\"</p><p>That included threatening the Observer with legal action the day before we went to press. And making aggressive PR moves in the middle of the night: with hours to go before publication, Facebook published a statement saying that it had banned both Cambridge Analytica and Wylie from its platform. And, we learned from a  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">New York Times</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">article</url> in November, Facebook then hired a PR firm to launch a seemingly antisemitic smear campaign claiming that key critics of the company were funded by George Soros.</p><p>\"Facebook showed that they don't care,\" says Wylie. \"They're bullies. And they know they're bullies. This whole aura around them of being the good guys is complete bullshit.\"</p><p>Wylie appeared before Collins's parliamentary committee just over a week after the initial Observer story. Since then - in what he describes as his \"global testimony tour\" - he has testified to Congress and given evidence to regulators and lawmakers from across the world. He testified to the European parliament \"and to the [US] House Intelligence Committee for something like five hours. I've testified multiple times to the House Intelligence Committee. And also the House Judiciary and Senate Judiciary.\" In the US, the FBI is also investigating, as is the Department of Justice, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">Securities Exchange Commission</url>, 38 state attorney generals and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), all triggered by the story. The FTC is expected to impose a fine that will run into billions. Wylie gave evidence to pretty much all of them.</p><p>He tells me about an evidence session in the \"secure sub-basement beneath the basement at Congress\". The same day, he was subpoenaed by the Department of Justice and the FBI. \"They knew where to find me.\"</p><p>The ultimate consequences of the story, of Wylie's evidence, aren't yet known. But Jamie Bartlett, a journalist and author of The People Vs Tech, believes that the story has had a bigger impact on the public than <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">Edward Snowden</url> 's, and transformed the way politicians talk about big tech.</p><p>\"But especially Facebook,\" says Bartlett. \"Just yesterday, the Democrat presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">she wants Facebook broken up</url>. She wouldn't have said this without the Cambridge Analytica story. And this change in political tone is hugely significant.\"</p><p>David Carroll, a New York professor who <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">sued Cambridge Analytica to get his data back</url>, describes the story as a \"cataclysm\", which he believed exposed the company as \"the original gangster of rogue actors in the dark world of influence\". Which makes Facebook the capo di capi, the boss of bosses.</p><p>Wylie's role in the story is over, for now. His testimony tour has ended. He has a new job and we're sitting in the London office of his new employer, Swedish global fashion brand H&amp;M, where he's the new head of data research. I think some people were surprised, I say, when they learned of his move. </p><p>\"What do you mean?\" he says.</p><p>Well, I think because you'd been out there championing the threat to democracy, it was unclear what you'd do next.</p><p>\"What people forget is that no one pays you to go and be a champion for democracy. A girl's got to make rent. I didn't have a job for two years.\"</p><p>The office is all clean, white, Scandinavian lines. Sunlight pours through the window on to the minimalist design features and artfully arranged pot plants. It's an almost absurd contrast from where we were a year go. My overriding impression of the months before publication, I tell him, when we were working with lawyers on how to break his non-disclosure agreement and trying to prove the public interest case, and dealing with other news organisations, is of this long and dark and scary winter. \"Well it was,\" he says. \"It was stressful. And chaotic. And consuming.\"</p><p>It was an unsettling period, weird, difficult and paranoid-making.</p><p>\"It was also like dealing with a bit of a phantom enemy,\" he says. \"Which is not to say that there weren't real enemies, but we didn't quite know who they were. There were so many possibles.\"</p><p>There were. Not just Cambridge Analytica but a web of stories about interlinked individuals, multinational companies and private security firms. There was one angle that involved ex-Mossad agents; another with connections to major figures in the British establishment; another leading to the cash-for-passports trade. It seemed anything was possible; that nothing could be ruled out.</p><p>All our communication on this story was done via <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">Signal</url>, an encrypted app. Documents were kept on offline computers. At one point, Wylie collapsed and ended up in hospital (he suspected poisoning). At another, he was photographed in the street on the way to his lawyer's office and the photo was texted to him from an unknown number. He never found out who sent it.</p><p>He tells me about another incident last year. While staying in a New York hotel, he woke up in the middle of the night to see two men in masks. They stole his phone and laptop, but left without taking $1,000 he had in cash. The New York police tracked them to New Jersey, he says, but he has no idea who they were.</p><p>Our paths have diverged in the past year, and Wylie has been in the eye of the storm, but even from the sidelines I've experienced some of the insanity, not least the sense of unreality seeing Cambridge Analytica go from being my specialist subject to watching Zuckerberg answer questions on it before Congress. And we still share enemies: both Wylie and I have been constant targets of the right-wing blogsite <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">Guido Fawkes</url>, attack pieces by       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">Buzz</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">Feed</url>, abusive tweets from       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">the BBC's Andrew Neil</url>. And my skin crawls when he mentions that at a cybersecurity conference in Israel, an agent from the private security firm Black Cube introduced himself and apparently told him to \"pass on his regards to Carole\".  </p><p>But for everything that did happen in the past year, and for all the heat and noise the story made, there's still so much we don't know.</p><p>\"I was asked by a journalist to sum up the story in a minute,\" he says, \"and I was like: 'No'. It goes from Trump to Brexit to Russian espionage to military operations in Afghanistan to hacking the president of Nigeria. Where do you even begin?\"</p><p>He's referring to the fact that Cambridge Analytica was part of a much bigger company, SCL, which had worked as a defence contractor for governments and militaries around the world, then branched into elections in developing countries, and, only in its final iteration, entered western politics. That's one of the things, he says, that \"frustrates me about how dominant the Facebook angle of the story was, when there's so much fucked-up shit that Cambridge Analytica were doing in different parts of the world. But if you go to a developing country and do grossly unethical things, that's not 'newsworthy'.\"</p><p>For me, Cambridge Analytica was the entry point to a story that is not about technology per se. It is about the abuse of power, and standing up to power. And it has revealed the limits of this in so many ways. Certainly, Wylie felt so viscerally. Because while he's delighted with his new job, with its Scandi coolness and global reach - he slots me in between trips to Stockholm and South Africa - he really joined H&amp;M because he thinks he can \"accomplish more here than in politics. This is something I've realised.\" He talks excitedly about how \"we are the only fashion brand I know of that has started putting together an ethical AI policy team\". Before all this, he says, he had \"some level of confidence with the authorities. Whereas now, I don't.</p><p>\"I feel like the whole story is a lesson in institutional failure. Because although Facebook paid the price in its share value, there have been virtually no consequences for people who have committed unlawful acts.</p><p>\"When you look at how, for example, the NCA [National Crime Agency] has just sat on blatant evidence of Russian interference in Brexit,\" Wylie says. \"When you look at how you can go and commit the largest infraction of campaign finance law in British history and get away with it.\"</p><p>If it wasn't so tragic, it would be funny to Wylie that one of the biggest takeaways of the story - which was generating 34,000 news stories a day at its height and cost one of the biggest companies on Earth billions - is how it failed. The Brexit angle of the Cambridge Analytica Files, the explosive revelations of a second whistleblower, Shahmir Sanni, fell inexplicably flat. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">Sanni revealed in the</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">Observer</url> how Vote Leave deliberately broke the law in the way it funnelled money to the data firm AggregateIQ, an associate company of Cambridge Analytica. It's believed to be the biggest breach of electoral law in a century, but it was given minimal coverage by the BBC and all but ignored by Britain's political class. The law-breaking was confirmed by the electoral commission in July, and it has now been referred to the police.</p><p>\"The thing is that there was  such a huge weight of evidence which has now all been proven,\" says Wylie. \"Vote Leave broke the law. I can say that out loud now. Vote Leave broke the law. But nothing happened. It's insane to me that people get more upset by doping in the Olympics, when the consequence of this is an irreversible change to the constitutional settlement of the country.\"</p><p>Perhaps what the scandal has really revealed is a situation that is too embarrassing, too disastrous to acknowledge. We know that Facebook has been used to undermine elections all across the world, including our own. But we're in this strange historical moment where we've realised it, but we don't have the power, currently, to do anything about it.</p><p>Is that why the British government has ignored the DCMS report, I ask <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">Martin Moore</url>, director of the Centre for the Study of Media, Communication and Power at King's College London and the author of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">Democracy Hacked</url>. \"Yes, I think so,\" he says. \"On the one hand, this drew the curtain back. But on the other, it's like a driver going past a car wreck: we're transfixed by it, but we have no idea what to do about it. In a way it's better than thinking there's any one small change that will do it. I think we're just at the beginning of recognising the scale of this. We're in the middle of a huge transition, the fourth great communications transition after speech, writing and printing. And even breaking up Facebook is not going to save us from this. It's so much bigger than that.\"</p><p>He points out that every previous transition on this scale has been followed by war and upheaval. \"And I do worry about increasing polarisation that we can see happening everywhere.\" He's talking about the stories we see reported every day: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">gilets jaunes</url> in France, neo-Nazis in Charlottesville, Virginia,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">Tommy Robinson</url> 's antics in the UK. But they're rarely understood to be connected by the same deep technological undertow. Just days after I file this story, a mass shooter opens fire in a New Zealand mosque and live-streams the massacre on Facebook. A killing designed as a viral video. Which immediately goes viral. At times like these, it's almost impossible to keep the despair at bay.</p><p>In the meantime, while <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">Robert Mueller</url> in the US painstakingly sets out the evidence of how Russia subverted Facebook during the presidential election, we know almost nothing about what happened in Britain. Collins's parliamentary committee - citing Arron Banks's covert meetings with Russian embassy staff that were first revealed in the Observer, and the role of Russian paid-for propaganda - has       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">called for an independent investigation</url> into foreign interference, but it's a call both the government and the leader of the opposition have utterly ignored.</p><p>Wylie won't say what he talked about to the FBI, but he's full of praise for the ICO: \"I just think <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">Elizabeth Denham</url> [the information commissioner] has done an amazing job. She's shown the world what data protection should look like.\" His FBI grilling, on the other hand, involved a \"room full of men who were totally expressionless for hours on end. It was quite intimidating.\"</p><p>I've seen very little of Wylie over the past year. He vanished, more or less. And although he was initially heavily involved in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">Fair Vote campaign</url>, he's moved on from that. There have been so grumblings from his friends, but even before he became famous overnight and acquired a Hollywood agent - the William Morris Endeavor agency - he was exacting in his demands. It was a point of amusement at the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">Byline</url> festival last summer that Damian Collins spent the festival with his family in a yurt, whereas Wylie insisted on a chauffeur back and forth to his flat in London.</p><p>I was with him, however, in parliament on the day in June that Cambridge Analytica's former CEO, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/feb/18/facebook-fake-news-investigation-report-regulation-privacy-law-dcms\">Alexander Nix, gave evidence</url>. Nix, an Old Etonian, had been forced to step down from the firm after Channel 4's undercover film revealed he'd offered potential clients special election services that included flying in \"beautiful Ukrainian girls\" to entrap politicians. Wylie was there, for the whole thing, his tics going madly - he jiggles his leg in moments of stress and it jiggled almost continuously for hours of testimony, his eyes never leaving Nix.</p><p>Does he have any sympathy for him? \"No, none,\" he says without pause. \"Because one of the things I realised about Alexander Nix is that he was born in the wrong century. He is the type of person that would have been ideal at the height of the British Empire to go and become a governor of a colony, because he's the right station and class and went to Eton and all that. So the terra nova of the internet is the perfect environment for someone like Nix. There are no rules. You can do whatever you want. You go in and exploit people as resources.\"</p><p>Yes, I say, but he is also a person. He's been humiliated. He's lost his business. He has children who will read about all this one day. On a human level...</p><p>\"And?\"</p><p>Well...</p><p>\"I'm sorry, I do not feel bad for somebody who was born of so much privilege. He decides to create a company that colonises the rest of the world and exploits people when he didn't have to do that. Of all the things that he could have done in life, that is what he chose to do; so no, I do not feel sorry.\"</p><p>It was only in the final days before publication of the story that I began to realise how large Nix loomed in Wylie's life - how Wylie's relationship with his former boss informed his story in many ways.</p><p>I ask what he did the day Cambridge Analytica went bankrupt. \"I didn't do anything. It's kind of interesting because I didn't feel joy or anything. It felt almost like euthanising a dog. There's relief but I don't think... like, it wasn't a happy moment.\" He says he's become \"more forgiving\" of himself in the past year. \"But it's in part because the company doesn't exist any more.\" And then he admits something for the first time: \"I felt huge amounts of shame for having been part of it. And I don't think I could have forgiven myself for it until it was stopped.\"</p><p>It's a big admission, or self-realisation. Because for the entire year I was talking to him, he'd never recognised shame as an emotion that he was feeling, or that was fuelling him. Or acknowledged responsibility in any meaningful way. And it's only now that it's gone that it seems safe to do so.</p><p>Here in H&amp;M's office, Wylie is genuinely enthused about his new job. Though there's something almost suspiciously wholesome about it, I say. You're such a machinator, I point out. There's nothing I have seen Wylie do that he enjoyed more than plotting some political scheme. He loves being the spider in the middle of the web. Don't you miss it? Won't you get bored? Are you going to accidentally start weaponising T-shirts?</p><p>\"I still follow politics and I know a lot of people who work in it, but the extent of my involvement is going once in a while to parliament and drink the warm stale beer that they have in their shit bars. But the problem with politics is that it's so all-consuming.\"</p><p>Will there be a second act, a third act, in politics, I ask.</p><p>\"God, I hope not.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBSRVR-52633119</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBSRVR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNF-H981-JCJY-G3YW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">143296</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3609\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Guardian Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Observer(London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 17, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

An undercover report shows Cambridge Analytica execs outlining dirty election tactics. So when will <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>go public about Cambridge sharing your Facebook data, some 50 million users?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR: The president's legal team sitting down for the first time with the special counsel's lawyers. Now the president is bringing in a flame thrower attorney who publicly says the DOJ is framing <person><nameText>Donald Trump.</nameText></person></p><p>BRIGGS: And overnight, the Weinstein Company lifting all nondisclosure agreements with Harvey Weinstein. The question now, how many more women are ready to come forward with abuse allegations? Also filing for bankruptcy protection.</p><p>Welcome back to EARLY START, everybody, on a Tuesday. I'm Dave Briggs.</p><p>ROMANS: And I'm Christine Romans. It's 31 minutes past the hour. A very busy morning and the crisis at Facebook intensifying after it failed to protect user data.</p><p>CEO <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>still missing in action. It's been days since news broke that a firm tied to <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>campaign, a firm called Cambridge Analytica, accessed data to 50 million users. But so far <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has been silent and the story has cost him about $5 billion off his personal net worth so far.</p><p>Facebook shares fell 7 percent yesterday, shaving $37 billion off its market value, sparking both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq's worst day since February. Investors think stricter regulations for Facebook are likely. It faces tough question on how it protects user data from being exploited.</p><p>BRIGGS: And the \"Washington Post\" reports that thousands of developers siphoned data every day. Everything from games like Farmville to dating app Tinder. But unlike those firms, Cambridge Analytica broke Facebook's rules by claiming the data was for academic use.</p><p>ROMANS: Now Cambridge Analytica said they deleted all that user data and agreed to a forensic audit. But this latest crisis is a new threat to Facebook's reputation. Already tarnished for allowing Russia to manipulate its platform during the 2016 election. And the whistleblower from Cambridge Analytica told CNN's Don Lemon he is worried they contributed to that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WYLIE: I'm concerned that we made Russia aware of the programs that we were working on and that might have sparked an idea that, you know, eventually led to some of the disinformation programs that we have seen and the interference that we have seen from Russia in American elections. So for me, I am concerned about that and if I played some kind of role in that, I feel like it is my duty to tell people about it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Meanwhile, an advocate for a strong approach to Russia plans to leave Facebook. That's Facebook's head of security Alex Stamos. In a tweet, he did not deny leaving but promised he is still fully engaged with his work at Facebook.</p><p>BRIGGS: Further adding to the intrigue here, an undercover report by Channel 4 in Britain. A hidden camera showing senior Cambridge Analytica execs talking about how they can use bribery and entrapment to get comprising material on their client's political opponents.</p><p>Let's bring in CNN's Isa Soares for more live in London. Good morning, Isa.</p><p>ISA SOARES, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning to you, Dave. Cambridge Analytica, the company just behind me in this gray building just over my right shoulders, as you can see, has been hit with an emergency data seizure order in the UK and a warrant is expected to be issued today for them to pass on data.</p><p>Authorities here believe they haven't been truthful, they haven't been honest in the last parliamentary committee just in February. This of course coming in the last 24 hours over an expose by Channel 4 News and the Channel 4 reporters you were mentioning, Dave, went undercover posing as a potential Sri Lankan client taking the services of Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>Then over a series of meetings which included several of the senior executives with Cambridge Analytica, including its CEO Alexander Nix, they went on to offer and describe what one called disturbing array of services they could provide. One, they said they could provide -- it was using honey traps. Sending in young women, Ukrainian young women, they said, to really operate a sex sting. They also offered to really include bribery to discredit politicians. [04:35:04] They said at one point they can send in a property developer to offer money in exchange for land and film them and then use that against them, against of course the Sri Lankan opposition candidate. They also said they could promote and create fake news. Initially they said we're not in the business of fake news. But then they said, and I'm quoting them here. \"It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be believed. If it happens without anyone thinking it's propaganda.\" It has to happen, I correct myself, with anyone thinking it's propaganda. The minute they think it's propaganda, they'll be asking who is behind this. They were proud and boasting about ghosting in and ghosting out when it comes to presidential elections.</p><p>Now it really showed them to be pervert and corrupt according to Channel 4. For its part, Cambridge Analytica has said that this piece by Channel 4 was edited and grossly misleading -- Dave.</p><p>BRIGGS: It sounds like we're just at the beginning of this investigation.</p><p>Isa Soares, thanks so much.</p><p>Meanwhile, attorneys for <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>meeting face-to-face for the first time with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team. The two sides sitting down last week to hash out which topics investigators could cover with the president. According to sources, Mueller's team added specifics to the topics already discussed like the firing of former FBI director James Comey.</p><p>ROMANS: The meeting makes it clear the investigation is nowhere near ending. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>hiring a new personal attorney who's claimed the president is being framed -- the president is being framed, he says, by a group of FBI and Justice Department officials.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSEPH E. DIGENOVA, NEW PERSONAL ATTORNEY FOR <person><nameText>PRESIDENT TRUMP</nameText></person>: There was a brazen plot to illegally exonerate Hillary Clinton and if she didn't win the election to then frame <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>with a falsely created crime.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Trump attorney Jay Sekulow confirms Joseph DiGenova is joining the legal team. It is expected he will engage with the media and actively defend the president in the Russia investigation.</p><p>BRIGGS: Overnight, \"The New York Times\" reported the president has discussed dismissing White House lawyer Ty Cobb and that the president's lead personal attorney John Dowd has considered leaving because he cannot control Mr. Trump's behavior.</p><p>ROMANS: Fellow Republicans warning the president not to fire the special counsel.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SEN. ORRIN HATCH (R), UTAH: It would be the stupidest thing the president could do is fire him.</p><p>MANU RAJU, CNN SENIOR CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: How would Republicans react you think if he'd fire Mueller?</p><p>SEN. BOB CORKER (R), SOUTH CAROLINA: I think it would be total upheaval in the Senate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: So there is little support among Republicans to pass legislation blocking the president from firing Mueller.</p><p>BRIGGS: <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>laying out his plan to combat opioid abuse in America. He wants stiffen penalties for high intensity drug traffickers including the death penalty for some and is promising a large advertising campaign focusing on prevention and education. He is also pushing for his border wall while touting the work of Adapt Pharma which makes a drug that can save someone who's overdosing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Today we applaud Adapt Pharma's decision to provide free, free NARCAN to all high schools, colleges and universities in America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: It's not clear whether the president knew he was praising a program backed by the Clinton Foundation, which he has fiercely criticized as a corrupt pay-for-play scheme. First Lady Melania Trump making a rare appearance that include public remarks about her personal commitment to those battling the opioid crisis.</p><p>BRIGGS: Uber suspending tests of its self-driving cars after what is thought to be the first fatal crash involving a fully autonomous vehicle. A self-driving Uber SUV struck and killed 49-year-old Elaine Hershberg Sunday as she walked her bike across the street in Tempe, Arizona. A test driver from Uber was behind the wheel, but not in control. Preliminary data shows the car going about 45 miles an hour in a 35-mile-an-hour zone.</p><p>ROMANS: Police say there are no significant signs the SUV slowed down before impact. Uber says it is fully cooperating with local officials and, quote, \"Our hearts go out to the victim's family.\" Last year, Uber briefly pulled its self-driving test vehicles after one of its cars landed on its side in an accident also in Tempe. Waymo, a corporate cousin of Google, is launching a public self driving car this year in Phoenix.</p><p>BRIGGS: Seven-term Illinois Democratic Congress member Dan Lipinski fighting for his life in tonight's primary election. He faces a challenge from progressive candidate Marie Newman. Lipinski's conservative stances have made him the target of activists fighting to purge the party of what they see as views that are anathema to its energized base. In Lipinski's view, the party focused far too much on identity politics in the 2016 presidential election, losing focus on the economy.</p><p>ROMANS: That's a fascinating rural district there.</p><p>All right. Winter is going out like a lion. A reported tornado in the south and a nor'easter set to move up the coast with a lot of snow and some ice.</p><p>[04:40:05] The forecast next.</p><p>ROMANS: Happy spring. It starts today. But you cannot tell it from the weather. At least in the southeast and the East Coast. A possible tornado touching down in Jacksonville, Alabama, injuring at least one person, trapping others. At Jacksonville State University, the campus police spent the night going room to room at residence halls, checking on students after the storm damaged dorm roofs as well as campus' sports coliseum. Fortunately many students were away for spring break.</p><p>[04:45:14] BRIGGS: Power outages reported in Alabama and Georgia. The storm part of a larger system moving north due to turn into yet another nor'easter tonight into Wednesday.</p><p>For the latest, we go live to the CNN Weather Center and meteorologist Pedram Javaheri.</p><p>Pedram, deliver the latest batch of bad news for us.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>PEDRAM JAVAHERI, AMS METEOROLOGIST: I was going to say good things come in four, right? Or bad things in this case. You know, we're watching this carefully here because the severe weather concern quickly begin to dwindle and, you know it has been a quiet last couple of months as you expect into the cold season. It is going to quickly ramp up. In fact you take a look, of course, April, May, June as we approach the peak season of severe weather. And only 75 tornadoes so far since January 1st. Should be at 145. A little over 50 percent of average. So in that sense it's been quiet.</p><p>What is left of the city, the weather is shifting off towards the East. Parts of the Carolinas, parts of the eastern Georgia as well from Savannah point to the north, just south of Augusta where we have a severe thunderstorm watch in place.</p><p>This is about to expire at around 9:00 a.m. this morning but you'll notice it's really much of the conducted activity, thunderstorm activity dwindles. And by this morning really much of the concern for the eastern Carolinas will begin to fall apart as well.</p><p>It's in the parts of Florida, we're watching carefully. Upwards of 12 million people in line for some severe weather throughout this afternoon. And when you break down the numbers in that sense it is really a quiet one as well for tornadoes. The potential is quite high, but only three tornadoes so far reported. The vast majority of the damage related to hail and wind. And the storm system not done with yet, unfortunately it's going to move into very cold air. It's already in place since you know across the northeast. And as it does, we do have the National Weather Service across this region that is really prompting a widespread coverage of winter weather advisories, winter storm warning, winter storm watches that are place for upwards of 70 million people.</p><p>So we'll follow this storm system as it pushes up toward the north and really beginning later on tonight around at 6:00, 7:00, 8:00 p.m., you'll see some snow showers across Philly. Begin to see that fill in towards Washington into the overnight hours. New York begins to see a few flurries into the overnight hours as well but through much of Tuesday night into early Wednesday morning is when we really could see the scenario play out depending on which track the system takes.</p><p>At this point, it looks more likely like it will want to hug the coastline. It'll be a little closer to the close vine. If that is the case, we could bring in a little heavier snow amounts up there towards places such as New York which could see as much as 10 inches much snowfall if the models remained in agreement here with this. They remain in coastal land but as you know very well, these storms do really wobble back and forth. And if it wobbles a little away, we might make that smile on your face there --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>JAVAHERI: Be a little more meaningful than the reason I know you are smiling.</p><p>ROMANS: We don't get snow days. Like, if I were like 11, I think this is awesome.</p><p>BRIGGS: You know who does, though? The kids and Pedram, they're already minus two in the bank for snow days.</p><p>JAVAHERI: My goodness.</p><p>BRIGGS: They're minus two, so it's -- we love our children. We just want them to learn. That's all.</p><p>JAVAHERI: Yes: I'm with you on that. Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: And everyone watching from lovely Southern California is laughing that we live here.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes. Thanks, buddy, we appreciate it.</p><p>JAVAHERI: Thank you.</p><p>BRIGGS: OK. The Weinstein Company filing for bankruptcy protection. They're hoping for an organized sale process to a private equity firm. At the same time, the Weinstein board says it is ending all nondisclosure agreements related to sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein effective immediately, which could mean more victims coming forward. The company calls it an important step toward justice for any victims who have been silenced, adding no one should be afraid to speak out.</p><p>ROMANS: To Austin, Texas, now. Police Department says Houston and San Antonio, Texas, were sending bomb technicians and k-9 teams to Austin to help in the serial bomber investigation after a fourth explosion in less than three weeks. Now the latest attack injured two white men, making it the first not to kill or injure minorities. The Austin police chief is asking neighborhood residents with any security camera footage to contact police.</p><p>BRIGGS: Women in Mississippi can no longer get abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Governor Phil Bryant signing a new law tightening what were already the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation. The measure only makes exceptions for medical emergencies or severe fetal abnormality. No exceptions for rape or incest.</p><p>Mississippi's Planned Parenthood director calls the ban unconstitutional, says it endangers women's health.</p><p>ROMANS: The younger brother of Parkland High School gunman Nicholas Cruz arrested Monday for trespassing on the ground of Stoneman Douglas High School. According to a complaint affidavit 18-year-old Zachary Cruz wanted to reflect on the school shooting and soak it in. He's been released after posting bond. According to court documents he feels some responsibility for what his brother did because he and his friends bullied Nikolas and he wishes he had been nicer to him.</p><p>BRIGGS: Officials in Bermuda announcing that a 19-year-old American student who went missing over the weekend has been found dead.</p><p>[04:50:02] Police say Mark Dombroski's body was found in a moat at Fort Prospect. They say foul play has not been ruled out and a forensic team is processing the scene. Dombroski was a freshman at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia, was on Bermuda to compete in a rugby tournament. Police say after competition Saturday he went out to socialize with friends and family. He's last seen on surveillance video alone just after 1:00 a.m.</p><p>ROMANS: So terrible.</p><p>All right. Facebook's latest crisis is hitting its stock price and its worst day in four years are dragging down all in Wall Street. \"CNN Money\" is next.</p><p>[04:55:16] BRIGGS: 4:55 Eastern Time and 24 Russian diplomats expelled by the UK set to depart London today. The action comes one- day after chemical weapons experts traveled to Britain. They'll test samples of the substance used to poison that former spy and his daughter.</p><p>CNN's Melissa Bell live in Salisbury, England, with the latest. Good morning, Melissa. MELISSA BELL, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Dave. Those inspectors that arrived yesterday. It is however the verification of those samples that have been collected by British authorities, something that's likely to take some time, Dave. At least two weeks, we're told the inspectors will get those samples from the British, they're being held at point gun right here. And just outside Salisbury, having been collected from scenes like the one just behind me where the Skripals had lunch on the day that they were found poisoned.</p><p>Those samples then get sent to laboratory chosen by the organization to furbish those chemical weapons and then we will find out if these international experts back the president's claim for which they really haven't provided any proof to the international community. There will be a lot of attention, a lot of focus on what the OPCW inspectors come up with.</p><p>Meanwhile, of course, as you say on the diplomatic front today, we're hearing from the Russian news agency that it is a flight that will be taking these 23 Russian diplomats, the ones that were expelled by Britain in retaliation for the poisoning of the Skripals and their family, 18 people in over here and they'll be leaving on a special aeroflot plane back to Moscow. And this day really Dave, it's just likely to be the beginning of a much longer diplomatic row between Britain and Moscow.</p><p>Indeed Britain's prime minister has said that she is leaving the door open for further measures against Moscow as she tries to gather support for further moves by the European union as well -- Dave.</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes. One would think more is still to come. Melissa Bell, for us in England. thank you.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Just about the top of the hour, let's get a check on money this morning. Facebook's worst day in four years dragging down stocks. Facebook fell 7 percent on news of the firm tied to <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>campaign with access to 50 million users. Facebook along with Amazon, and Netflix, Alphabet. They all shed more than $100 billion in value, and how big tech goes so goes the market these days.</p><p>The Dow, the Nasdaq, the S&amp;P 500 all fell at least 1.4 percent. The Dow is now negative for the year again. Wall Street was already concerned about higher interest rates and possible trade wars especially with reports that tariffs on $60 billion in Chinese goods are imminent. Right now global stocks and U.S. futures are mixed.</p><p>AT&amp;T's anti-trust trial just began, it's already sparring with the Department of Justice over e-mails and power points. The DOJ lawsuit will block AT&amp;T's $85 billion purchase of Time Warner, parent of CNN. And attorneys for AT&amp;T want to throw out several pieces of evidence from the DOJ, including thousands of e-mails sent by AT&amp;T employees. AT&amp;T says many are not major decision makers, but the government says it proves the merger will harm consumers by raising prices. Adding that the deal is necessary to compete in the new media landscape. Another nostalgic brand filing for bankruptcy. Teen jewelry chain Claire's filed for bankruptcy protection Monday. It plans to use the filing to reduce most of its $2 billion in debt, promised that 1600 stores we'll say open during the process. According to It will use most of the $2 billion in debt. It promised the stores will stay open.</p><p>This is a staple at the mall. It just the last retailer to succumb to a massive pile of debt like Toy R'Us. Last week the iconic Toys R' Us said it will close or sell all its U.S. stores. So there's a whole generation of women today who got their ears pierced at Claire's.</p><p>BRIGGS: And dads who went down there and spent $12 on hair bands.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes. Yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: Bracelets and necklaces that made their dad as thrilled. Love that place indeed.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Another retailer.</p><p>BRIGGS: EARLY START continues right now.

Live from CNN London, I'm Hala Gorani.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, Cambridge Analytica suspend its CEO, Alexander Nix, amid Facebook data collection allegations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also, ahead, a string package bomb explosions has shaken the Texas city of Austin and officials are worried a serial bomber is on the loose. We are live in Texas.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And the last male northern white rhino in the world has died leaving only females to save the species from total extinction. We're also be going to live to the site of the conservation park where that rhino passed away today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking news in the last hour, the CEO of data company, Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix has been suspended by the company's board pending a full investigation. That's in a response to a report last night by Britain's Channel 4 news that featured covert video of him saying that the company could entrap politicians in compromising situations.</p><p>This is a story that extends well beyond the small data firm to one of the biggest in the world talking, of course, about Facebook. The spokesperson for the social media giant has told CNN that it will brief multiple congressional committees this week on issues related to Cambridge Analytica and the use of user's data.</p><p>The question, though, many are asking is tonight where is Mark Zuckerberg? Facebook held a full staff meeting today, but no official comment yet from the CEO. Alexander Nix's suspension comes after news report by the U.K.'s Channel 4 airing in three parts.</p><p>Here is the latest portion of the secret footage in question. Take a look.</p><p>(VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: Well, as we just reported, Cambridge Analytica announced on Tuesday that it has suspended its CEO, Alexander Nix, you saw him there in that covert video and that the suspension comes with immediate effects and has ordered a full and independent investigation that it says that Mr. Nix's recent comment secretly reported by Channel 4 and other allegations do not represent the values or operations of the firm. And his suspension reflects the seriousness with which we view this violation.</p><p>In response to the undercover footage showing Nix boasting about the firm's role in Trump's success in 2016, Cambridge Analytica told Channel 4 it has, quote, \"never claimed that it won the election for the president. We are proud of the work we did on that campaign and have spoken in many public forums about what we consider to be our contribution to that campaign.\"</p><p>Many moving parts in the story that was complicated to begin with. Let's bring in Nick Paton Walsh who is with me in London, and Laurie Segall in New York. Nick, so Nix is suspended, who controls this company, Cambridge Analytica? The Board of Directors, who are we talking about here?</p><p>NICK PATON WALSH, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, at this point, we know that he temporarily replaced as they have an independent investigation into his conduct while Alexander Taylor (ph), who is currently also part of that board there.</p><p>But at this stage too that news broke almost exactly the same time as Channel 4 News broadcast the third part of their report as you are sure that with further undercover footage of Mr. Nix and Mr. (inaudible) talking to the undercover reporter.</p><p>Now the key issue that Channel 4 seems to lean upon here is whether or not these other groups perhaps the use of foreign citizens here is advising the Trump campaign may somehow be a violation of campaign-finance law.</p><p>Cambridge Analytica said that it is not the case because they put an adequate firewall and put a distance between themselves to be sure that they complied with Federal Election Commission Law.</p><p>But certainly. the report itself gave a relatively colorful description of exactly how messages will pump in. So, what I think their approach is the bloodstream of American body politics to in fact to influence that campaign.</p><p>In fact, Mr. Nix saying he'd met Mr. Trump many times and they ran addition campaign, the tv campaign and they said they had harvested in fact (inaudible). So, a lot there to digest, but more broadly Mr. Nix's departure, I think frankly overshadowing that last report.</p><p>[16:05:13] GORANI: And Laurie, how damaging is this to Facebook?</p><p>LAURIE SEGALL, CNN SENIOR TECH CORRESPONDENT: I mean, I think is a monumental moment for Facebook. It's been a bad year for Facebook. I mean, how many times we've been talking about the imitation of the platform and unintended consequences that have come along with, you know, you look at Mark Zuckerberg, who has always been out there pushing this narrative of bringing the world together, creating a better place.</p><p>And by the way, I think it's a great question you asked at the beginning where is Mark Zuckerberg? I mean, you know, often times when tech companies go through these terminal, you don't necessarily see the CEO step in front of it.</p><p>But I think this is different, Hala. I think people really want Mark Zuckerberg or Sherly Sandberg who defined the brand of Facebook, who have been out there as a brand of Facebook to step forward and help answer some of these really challenging questions that impacted more than 2 billion people.</p><p>I'll tell you I have been talking to executives within the company. It's not just us in the press or the public that want to hear from these leaders, you know, it's also senior top-level executives at Facebook who have said to me, you know, we want Mark Zuckerberg to speak more openly about this.</p><p>He is very involved behind the scenes. He is in all the meetings. He's a very well-respected leader, which is why there is pressure within for him to be more of a face of this and also, you know, these conversations, I should say, are really difficult conversations to have.</p><p>They do not really speak in soundbites. You know, they are not easily distilled into blog post that Facebook is putting out. These are ethical issues about our future and executives are having these conversations behind closed doors and we are not really getting to hear any of that.</p><p>GORANI: And Nick, back to Cambridge Analytica, authorities in this country are trying to gain access to the office of this Cambridge Analytica in the U.K. Have they been able to do so?</p><p>WALSH: We don't know at this point. Has it occurred? We do know the information commissioner had been hoping to try and get some kind of access, and in fact, asked Facebook's own auditors to stop their work inside that building going from the files that Facebook wanted to check.</p><p>But it has been a remarkable day, Hala, of developments in the story here. I mean, frankly, from Christopher Wiley, one of the key whistleblowers who began this saying he will get documents and interviews to the Democrats, the House Intelligence Committee.</p><p>In the United States Facebook potentially being called to brief both the intelligence, judiciary and commerce committees there as well. The U.K. parliament saying Mark Zuckerberg has to appear in front of them.</p><p>Frankly, it has blown out of substantially exactly what initially was the cover tapes themselves is now causing a much broader question of influence of social media in politics per se.</p><p>GORANI: Laurie, lastly to you, the perception now is out there following this story and others that people's data on social media platform just is not safe. Not only that that third-party apps can use personality questionnaires to harvest the data of millions and millions of unsuspecting users. Should people be concerned?</p><p>SEGALL: Yes, I think we should all be concerned. I think there's going to be this more fundamental question of is privacy dead, but I do want to be too alarmist right now, but I will say in 2014 Facebook did change their policies.</p><p>But executives inside have admitted to me that they were too loose. They put too much trust in developers and that's how, you know, a lot of this information was being taken at that time.</p><p>People did not realize they were filling out the survey, which was supposedly a personality quiz for research purposes, you know, that was transferred over to Cambridge Analytica, which is against Facebook's policy.</p><p>An executive said we put too much trust in these developers, that has since changed, but this brings all sorts of questions about what kind of data the company is collecting, and also all the data we leave behind, every like you put, every Facebook status you like, you know, you are creating a very personalized version of who you are that people can target in very specific ways.</p><p>And it's not just about targeting you based on demographics, but it could be targeting you on a psychological profile. Behind closed doors, I will say they are talking about this idea of micro-targeting versus manipulations. So, all sorts of ideas that are coming out now in light of all this news.</p><p>GORANI: Laurie Segall, thanks very much. Nick Paton Walsh as well following the story and one that last night you'll remember I conducted an extensive interview with the whistleblower at the center of this story, Christopher Wiley.</p><p>In it, the former Cambridge Analytica contractor spoke about the firm's alleged links to Russia.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRISTOPHER WILEY, CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA WHISTLEBLOWER: We were amassing mass amounts of data. Meanwhile, we are interfacing with a company that has no link to the FSB, which is the Russian security and intelligence service, and the professor who is managing this app and the targeting program was going to Russia and working for the Russians. And in addition to this, the company literally pitched Coogan's work for the Russians to other clients in other countries.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GORANI: So, that was Christopher Wiley. Let's bring in Liam Byrne, a Labour MP and a shadow digital minister. Thanks for being with us.</p><p>[16:10:03] Parliament here wants to question Mark Zuckerberg. What do you want Mark Zuckerberg to tell you? What questions you have for him?</p><p>LIAM BYRNE, BRITISH LABOUR MP: We want to know the truth. We want to know how we could get into a situation where something like 50 million records were collected from individuals for one purpose and then used for another. I mean, over the last year, there has been a real concern of an unholy alliance coming together, bad companies and bad countries working together to jeopardize free and fair elections.</p><p>GORANI: When you say bad companies, who are you referring to?</p><p>BYRNE: Well, we think that if the allegations made against Cambridge Analytica were true, they are incredibly serious because you are talking about the misuse of data. Now the real concern and this is why parliamentarians are so focused on this now is that we also know that countries like Russia interfering in American elections, elections in France, Germany.</p><p>There are concerns they interfered in the Brexit referendum too. We cannot have the possibility of a company like Cambridge Analytica misusing targeting data tying together with bad countries like Russia --</p><p>GORANI: But how do we know it was effective? I mean, in the end, it's a small, you know, allegedly shady group that promised entrapment and honey traps and the rest of it. You saw it in that Channel 4 clip, I am sure, like the rest of us. Every small company that operates as a political consultancy will want to use some of these methods.</p><p>BYRNE: Very few small companies lay hands on 50 million worth of data records. That's why it's unusual, very few small companies were employed by the Trump campaign in order to organize a run for the White House.</p><p>So, Cambridge Analytica was in a different class of its own and the way in which data was allegedly misused creates a serious risk to the (inaudible) at a time where we know that there are countries like Russia that are using digital democracy as part of a new generation of --</p><p>GORANI: How do you control --</p><p>BYRNE: -- to try to rule their enemies.</p><p>GORANI: But how do you control the internet? I mean, Facebook essentially is a platform on which a lot of fake news was spread and 2 billion users. How do you even begin controlling that?</p><p>BYRNE: Through the trust for truth and transparency. So, on the one hand, what you do is equip (inaudible) information commissioner with a much stronger set of powers. All the people describe social media land is like the wild west at the moment.</p><p>We have a sheriff on the block who does not have the powers to the job effectively, which is why it's taken us so long to get the digital search warrant that she needed for Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>GORANI: And that's not out yet. That's not the --</p><p>BYRNE: They don't believe she's got the data and she's (inaudible) tell Facebook executives stand down since before her advice. But the other challenge that we've got is we do not have a little transparency in this country around the way in which (inaudible) was used in elections.</p><p>So, we are taking in parliament now kind of the British version of the U.S. (inaudible) Act that will give our election regulators much greater power to extract information about who is targeting you with what information and crucially, who is writing the checks?</p><p>GORANI: Right.</p><p>BYRNE: Right now, we do not have those rules in place.</p><p>GORANI: But the risk there is always is that if you have government authorities interfering in what messages are spread online and deciding what is fake and what is not fake, then you have accusations of censorship --</p><p>BYRNE: That's not what's being proposed. What we believe and a little bit like the first line of U.S. on the sidelines actually is that citizens have the right to be fully informed. At the moment, you can talk (inaudible) you owe me. No one else can necessarily see them.</p><p>And you and I wouldn't know who's paid for them, where they come from or what data they are using in order to talk with us. Now you might not change your mind if you know the backgrounds that particular ad, but I just happened to think that you've got the right to know what is going on.</p><p>GORANI: But in the U.S., especially in the last election cycle, there were so many negative ad and so much misinformation despite the fact that there is legislation that is intended to protect voters against --</p><p>BYRNE: It's nice substitute to a fully informed voter and you know, if people believe in democracy ultimately, they've got to run with the decision that a majority takes, but what you can insist on is that voters go to the polling booth fully informed about where their information came from.</p><p>And so, we are going into this new era now where the old rules I'm afraid are now going to have to change -- and crucially where voters and consumers need to be more critical consumers of information.</p><p>GORANI: What is Facebook's job here? Was is its responsibility in your opinion and is there anything that can be done legislatively?</p><p>BYRNE: And old ear is now passing. There is going to be a new era of regulation rules and what Facebook now needs to do is to lean into that era where (inaudible) legislators to fix the rules for the next five or six years' worth of data regulation.</p><p>You know, in the 19th Century here in Britain, there wasn't one factory acts over the course of the 19th Century. There was 17. We have to change that laws as technology and economics changed and that is the period that we are just now starting in the 21st Century.</p><p>GORANI: What about someone like Alexander Nix, the now suspended head of Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>[16:15:05] He testified before parliamentarians in February, was asked very directly did you use Facebook data, he said, no. Did you have Russian clients. He said no.</p><p>BYRNE: Well, (inaudible) if he's in breach of parliament, there are pretty serious sanctions for that, but, you know, right now, our information commissioner does not have the right to seek a custodial sentence if someone has interfered in one of her investigations.</p><p>So, that's another area where we think the law is going to change so that people don't just get fine. Actually, they face the risk of jail time if they are interfering in some of these inquiries.</p><p>And you have no power to or parliament here in the U.K. wants to hear from Mark Zuckerberg, summon Mark Zuckerberg, but there is nothing that can be done to compel Mark Zuckerberg --</p><p>BYRNE: (Inaudible). But I think Mark realizes that the U.K. is one of Facebook's most important global markets and we are a big market where Facebook generates huge profits here in the United Kingdom.</p><p>And if Facebook does not want to, you know, regulation written in a way that is very bad for Facebook, then he will lean in to this new debate and he will pitch up and make his case.</p><p>GORANI: I see what you did there.

We will have that next.</p><p>GORANI: Russian diplomats who are expelled from the U.K. have just arrived back in Moscow. The British prime minister ordered the 23 officials and their families to leave in a matter of days. It was a punishment for the poisoning of former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal in the U.K., which Britain blamed on Russia. Its ambassador to the U.K. has called the expulsion of violation of international law.</p><p>Certainly not the first time Russia has been accused of poisoning its rivals abroad. Matthew Chance takes a look at some other notable incidents.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): He was one of the Kremlin's most ruthless enemies, an Arab jihadist called Qatar (ph), notorious for executing Russian troops during the brutal Chechen war.

Matthew Chance, CNN, Moscow.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GORANI: French police are questioning former President Nikolas Sarkozy over his campaign finances. Now Mr. Sarkozy voluntarily appeared today to respond to allegations that he accepted money from Libya's Muammar Gaddafi to finance his election campaign in 2007. These are new allegations, but Sarkozy has long been dogged by accusations of financial wrongdoing.</p><p>Thierry Arnaud is chief political correspondent for BFM TV and he's in Paris. Is he still in custody?</p><p>THEIRRY ARNAUD, BFMTV ANCHOR: As far as I know, yes, Hala, he has been there since 8 a.m. this morning so for over 13 hours now is being questioned by police officers and they have to decide whether they can let him go or whether they will present him to three investigating judges later on tonight or if they can ask him as well to continue and come back tomorrow because this custody thing can last for up to two full days, 48 hours.</p><p>GORANI: But he hasn't been charged with anything yet?</p><p>ARNAUD: No, he hasn't. For that to happen, he has to be presented to those three investigating judges then they have to decide whether they'll let him go, option one, whether they make him what he's called an assisted witness (inaudible) which is sort of intermediary stage or whether they charge him in which case indicted (inaudible) which under examination as we say in French.</p><p>GORANI: Precisely what are the allegation that he accepted Libyan money for 2007 campaign?</p><p>ARNAUD: Yes, pretty much. The investigation started five years ago with the news report from a website called (inaudible) and in those subsequent reports amongst other things an intermediary of Franco-Lebanese businessmen called (inaudible). He claimed he acted as an intermediary between (inaudible) regime.</p><p>That he personally delivered 5 million euros in cash to Sarkozy himself into his chief of staff, a guy called (inaudible). That started a flood of allegations of corruption and abuse of public funds, money laundering, you name it, tens of millions of euros potentially.</p><p>And all of these allegations have come from (inaudible) and others. A lot of the former Libyan officials and even Muammar Gaddafi himself who went on the record saying that he gave money to Nicolas Sarkozy for his campaign.</p><p>GORANI: But why did it take so long to question him? These allegations, accusations and reports have been floating around for years.</p><p>ARNAUD: For more than five years, you're absolutely right. That is a very good question. That's one we've been asking all day many times to various experts and judges.</p><p>[16:25:05] (Inaudible), the answer is it is a very wide-ranging and complex investigation. It has many international ramifications as well and the judge was telling us today as an example that he took a very long time, literally months, for example, to secure documents that he needed from Switzerland. So, there's been all sorts of ramifications. It's very huge and complex investigation.</p><p>GORANI: And last, I think his political career as well truly over then?</p><p>ARNAUD: Well, it was supposed to be so anyway, but all those who know Nicholas Sarkozy and Perhaps those who know him best would tell you that as long as he is alive there is hope for him of a political comeback. He would officially say it is out of the question, that is done, that he has other things to do.</p><p>But if he can make it through these case and others because there are other cases pending for him as well, you know, I would not put it past him to think if the context is right of another attempt at coming back into French politics.</p><p>GORANI: Well, one thing he certainly has, determination. Thanks very much, Thierry Arnaud for joining us. Always a pleasure talking to you.</p><p>The Facebook crisis is deepening as the head of the firm that misused this data is suspended.

We'll be live at the White House.</p><p>GORANI: The disgraced data firm, Cambridge Analytica, with ties to the Trump campaign has suspended its CEO after undercover reports showed Alexander Nix discussing potential bribery and entrapment. Cambridge Analytica that it is investigating.</p><p>A whistleblower from the company who I interviewed yesterday has now agreed to give evidence and an interview to American lawmakers. Facebook says it will also brief congressional committees this week. But CEO Mark Zuckerberg still isn't talking.</p><p>Meanwhile, the European Union is getting ready to usher in a new data privacy law. Our next guest writes, that come May 25th, quote, \"The power balance will shift towards the consumer.\"</p><p>Nitasha Tiku is a senior writer at \"Wired\" and she comes to us from San Francisco. So how could things change do you think?</p><p>NITASHA TIKU, SENIOR WRITER, \"WIRED\": Well, people change significantly because the regulation comes with a potential fine of up to 4 percent of global revenue. So, for Facebook based on their 2017 numbers, that would be 1.6 billion and it will be 4.4 billion. So they have an incentive to follow the rules and regulators have the ability to enforce them.</p><p>HALA GORANI, CNN INTERNATIONAL ANCHOR: And what would the new rules be?</p><p>TIKU: Oh, yes. So the news rules have to do with how you can process personal information about people. And in particular there are restrictions about sensitive data like political information, religious information, sexual orientation, some of the same kinds of information that's came up in the Cambridge Analytica discussion.</p><p>GORANI: And how would authorities be able to monitor whether or not a social media platform misuses personal data?</p><p>TIKU: Well, under GDPR, each companies would have to have their own data protection officer, and they to document some of these things in terms of, for example, like you have to ask for a consent. Consent has to be informed and freely given. So you have to have a record if the investigators came calling. And actually, the EU's commissioner in charge of data protection, she said just this seek that she will use GDPR to address concerns about Cambridge Analytica.</p><p>GORANI: But where do you draw the line? Because obviously you have a Facebook account, you get targeted ads, they are harvesting data from your shopping history, what you clicked on, what you liked. I never consented to any of that, but I accept that it's kind of part of a Facebook contract but then I get bombarded with personalized and targeted ads based on where I've searched online. So, where do you draw the line here?</p><p>TIKU: Well, I think the -- it's not so much drawing of a line as shining a light on those practice. And you probably did legally consent to that just by clicking -- scrolling to the bottom of the terms of service and clicking yes. Under GDPR, if they want to process your personal information, they're going to have to explain. We took these particular bits of personal data in order to do this, in order to sell you -- in order to provide you a better service. If they're sending your information to third party, you have the ability to know what's actually happening.</p><p>GORANI: What is GDPR stand for?</p><p>TIKU: General Data Protection Regulation.</p><p>GORANI: And those come into effect the 25th of May in the EU?</p><p>TIKU: May 25th, yes.</p><p>GORANI: So, how does -- what if you're not in the EU and you used Facebook or Instagram or other social media platforms and websites?</p><p>TIKU: Well, actually, first of all, the big tech companies, Facebook and Google, they're rolling out some of the same privacy protections to their consumers around the globe, but we've already seen that in the UK, Americans have been given the OK by UK data commissioner to use -- to ask for information about Cambridge Analytica and find out what has been processed about them. So even the existing laws that are already there are being used by people here.</p><p>GORANI: How damaging is this to Facebook, I wonder? Anecdotally, obviously we're not mentioning it in real-time. But anecdotally, there's the -- there are trending hashtags calling on people to delete their Facebook page. More and more around me. I'm here and people sound kind of sick of Facebook. I don't spend that much time on it anymore. I've logged out or I'm going to -- how bad is this for Facebook? Because it was years and years of uninterrupted media recruit. Now, are we seeing -- is this a new chapter for the company?</p><p>TIKU: It certainly seems like it's mean and all the time that I've been covering tech. Last year when U.S. senators first said, hey, Facebook and Google, Twitter, we'd like your executives to come testify before Congress. At that time, it still seem like they really be able to get out of it. There wasn't -- there's no really -- there wasn't that much oversight. They've always managed to sneak their way out. And this week, for the first time, I really feel like they're -- we might actually see Mark Zuckerberg at a congressional hearing.</p><p>GORANI: Well, we haven't seen him yet. We know there was a meeting at Facebook, but we haven't heard from him. And I wonder, why not? I mean, isn't it -- at some point, you have to come out, right? You have to kind of address the issue.</p><p>TIKU: I think they're really scared and they don't know how to proceed. Facebook likes to be very controlling about how information is put out. I've been trying to think about what they could possibly say. He won't have the benefit of the doubt. He might not have the same level of acceptance and admiration that he's had in the past. So I imagine they don't know exactly how to proceed, especially if the demands are going to be like give it to a straight. You can't give us like a press release. You actually have to tell us what happened.</p><p>[16:35:04] GORANI: Nitasha Tiku, thanks very much, a senior writer at WIRED, joining us from San Francisco. We appreciate having you on the program.</p><p>Another issue that will not just go away for President Trump, Russia and Robert Mueller. Sources tell CNN the president is growing agitated, as the investigation shows no sign of winding down. The president is shaking up his legal team, even as the special counsel tem tries to agree on the terms for potential sit down interview, it goes as House Speaker Paul Ryan says he has been assured that Mr. Trump is not planning to fire Mueller.</p><p>Let's get you live to the White House. Dan Merica is there with all the very latest. So these assurances that Paul Ran says he's gotten. Who has he gotten them from, the president himself?</p><p>DAN MERICA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It doesn't appear to be that. It was left out there about where he got that assurance from. But it is worth noting that while he's getting his assurances or said he's getting these assurances, President Trump is shaking up his legal team and hiring a lawyer that is known as a pit bull. Somebody who has in the past gone after Robert Mueller. And really spread this conspiracy theory that people in the DOJ and FBI are trying to frame President Trump with this Russia probe. Now that person is Joe DiGenova. He's a former U.S. attorney here in the District of Columbia. But more recently, he's been in a lot of cable news shows, particularly concerned about outlets like Fox News. He's been brought on, we're told, according to a source, to deal directly with the media. So you can expect us to see him more on TV.</p><p>And what that says to most watchers is that the fact that he'll be on TV talking for the president's legal as President Trump is going to take far more harsh dance with Mueller in the coming weeks and months. Now, this is going to be frustrating for him that he's going to have to do this at all, because President Trump was told last year that this probe would be done possibly by the new year, if not earlier and that clearly, Hala, isn't happening, and that's why this is such a significant hiring.</p><p>GORANI: But is -- you see just a handful of Republican senators not running for reelection who are saying it would be a great, great mistake to fire Bob Mueller and it would be a constitutional crisis and we absolutely urge the president not to do this. The vast majority of Republicans though, we haven't really heard from.</p><p>MERICA: Yes. It seems like a lot of people are giving President Trump his little leeway on this and chalking it up to him, venting from the White House while they hope facing it done on Capitol Hill. You were exactly right in your lead. A lot of this is overshadowing and President Trump's message he's trying to get out. For example today, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia comes to the White House for a critical meeting, but it's President Trump's answer on Russia and the reelection of Vladimir Putin that really made the news. And that's newsworthy because of President Trump's relationship with Russia and the cloud hanging over this White House that is spurge by Robert Mueller's ongoing investigation. President Trump congratulated President Putin a phone call this morning. He then said a few things to reporters later in the day and that became big news overshadowing. What the president and the White House had hoped would be the big meeting today with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.</p><p>So what Republicans are giving the president leeway, what you're seeing is, is that this Russia probe and news about Russia, in general, it's really overshadowing much of what the president is trying to do. And that's going to frustrate leaders on Capitol Hill. This is going to make it more difficult for them to get things done, if all of the focus continues to be on Russia, Hala.</p><p>GORANI: And there's focus as well on another story that the president certainly would like to go away, but it isn't, and that is the Stormy Daniels situation. A report of a polygraph test taken by the porn star has been released and there's a picture of it. It says she was, \"truthful about having unprotected vaginal intercourse with Donald Trump in July 2006 and this is certainly a sense I thought I would never say on CNN, but there you have it.</p><p>The report states that the, \"Probability of deception was measured to be less than one percent.\" It was given to CNN by Michael Avenatti, Daniels' attorney. Obviously, polygraph tests are not admissible in U.S. courts, but people will take them to prove to see if they were telling the truth. How will this play out?</p><p>MERICA: This is all part of the ongoing really public relations campaign to get Stormy Daniels story out there. And so far, it has been incredibly successful. President trump has tried to ignore this, his White House has tried to ignore this. But what you're seeing is even though this polygraph test may not be admissible in court, it's huge news because it's coming out, it's re-up in the story about a relationship that President Trump had with a porn actress in Lake Tahoe in 2006. And while the White House is going to try and dismiss it, they're going to try and say that this has been answer during the campaign which is something that they have done in the past. This latest polygraph test makes this more of a story.</p><p>And you'll remember that Sarah Sanders earlier this month really stepped in the way of their attempts to dismiss the story by acknowledging that President Trump was party to a lawsuit between Stormy Daniels trying to get Stormy Daniels stop telling her story. So what this is going to do is Sarah Sanders would likely be asked about this again. She'll have to give an answer and it just makes it more possible at the White House that President Trump is wrapped into this story more than he was previously.</p><p>[16:40:25] GORANI: All right. Dan Merica, thanks very much.</p><p>Still to come tonight, fear in Texas worries about what investigators are calling a serial bomber there.

We'll be right back.</p><p>GORANI: Now to Texas in the United States in a situation one official is describing as absolute panic. A package exploded at a FedEx facility and police say that it was not the only parcel there that they believe contained explosives. It's just a latest in a spate of explosions in that state. Ed Lavandera has the latest from Austin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ED LAVANDERA, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Authorities in Texas are on high alert tonight after a bomb blew up in a FedEx facility overnight. In Schertz, Texas, 64 miles south of Austin, the one that blew up overnight was moving along an automatic conveyor belt. A worker nearby suffered minor injuries. FedEx says they turned over extensive evidence relating to the package including information about the person who shipped them.</p><p>Speaking outside the building, Schertz chief of police, Michael Hanson believes the distribution facility was not the intended target, but would not explain why.</p><p>MICHAEL HANSON, SCHERTZ POLICE CHIEF: It's very early in the investigation, obviously. But we're confident that neither this facility, nor any location in the Schertz area was the target.</p><p>LAVANDERA: As investigators try to determine if there is a connection to the four Austin bombings and the package found at SchertzFedEx location, they are also combing through a FedEx drop off point in Austin where they believe the Schertz package was mailed from.</p><p>And at the White House during a meeting with the Saudi Arabian Crown Prince, President Trump made his first remarks about the recent bombings this afternoon.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are the bombings in Austin an act of domestic terror or hate crime? Any comments on the bombings in Austin, Mr. President?</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The bombings in Austin are terrible. Local, state and federal are working hand in hand to get to the bottom of it. This is obviously a very, very sick individual or maybe individuals.</p><p>LAVANDERA: Police are also calling on the public to remain vigilant.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: If you didn't order something, if you are not expecting a package, if it's something that doesn't have an official label on it, or really just not -- just a package itself, if there's anything out of the ordinary, we are asking the community to please call 911, let our officers come out. Let us handle it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[16:45:06] GORANI: And Ed Lavandera joins us now live from Austin. So, we were talking earlier, Ed, and authorities believe this is a serial bomber, a single individual, or are they not sure? What's the very latest on who they think is behind this?</p><p>LAVANDERA: They're not sure if it's one person or more than one at this point. But what is interesting, Hala, is that they've actually made a concerted effort over the last couple of days to speak directly, when they do press conference, speak directly to whoever might be behind these attacks. And they're actually hoping that whoever is behind this will call the emergency hotline here in the United States, in the city of Austin and reach out to them.</p><p>Investigators are basically saying they want to hear from this person that they believe that there is some sort of message -- the culprit or culprits is trying to send. And that they're interested in hearing that and that they hope that it'd be something that would help crack this case and bring an end to the death and people who have been injured so violently here in the last several weeks.</p><p>GORANI: All right. Thanks very much. Ed Lavandera live in Austin.</p><p>Now to a completely different part of the world, a beloved subspecies is on the verge of extinction after its last, very last male has died. There are now only two northern white rhinos left on this planet and both are female.</p><p>Farai Sevenzo joins us from Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya where the rhino named Sudan spent his final years. So talk to us a little -- I saw pictures of the people who took care of Sudan and they seemed very close to him and they were petting him in his final moments. There must be a sad kind of atmosphere there at the conservancy today.</p><p>FARAI SEVENZO, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Absolutely, Hala. We've talked to a couple of rangers who'd known Sudan for the last four years. And a man from Czech zoo -- and they were absolutely stricken with grief over the death. Natural death, of course, we must remember to say. At 45 years old of Sudan. And of course, this is how the story unfolded this afternoon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEVENZO (voice-over): The world's last male northern white rhino known as Sudan because he was born there, had to be put down. In the end, Sudan succumbed to old age. At 45, his muscles and bones have begun to degenerate and he could hardly carry his own weight. Those who have looked after him felt his passing painfully.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The last moment of his life, at that time, it was raining. Heavy rain. And it was raining down where he was lying. Rain stopped. From here, he slept completely. He pulled a hand down, after that the rain stopped. So death came.</p><p>SEVENZO: It is almost impossible to imagine that when Sudan was born in the wild in 1973, hundreds of his kind roam the grasslands of east and central Africa.</p><p>Now, these two females Najin and Fatu, Sudan's daughter and granddaughter are the only remaining northern white rhinos in the world.</p><p>How did we get this? For decades now all species of rhino had been poached for their horn. The value (INAUDIBLE) is in the Far East. Demand for rhino horn and the profits from sale made that the rhino was always on the threat.</p><p>The Northern whites population became extinct in the wild in 2008, unlike another subspecies the southern white whose numbers have rebounded. Wildlife vet, Dr. Stephen Ngulu (INAUDIBLE) down.</p><p>STEPHEN NGULU, HEAD, VET AT OL PEJETA CONSERVANCY: Euthanasia was the best option at that moment, because then he was in a lot of pan. We've got into this stage because of various catastrophes that have been created by mankind. When you look at poaching, when you look at illegal deforestation, and look at waste habitat clearing, all these things have led to where we are. We can't make another Sudan. But we believe and we are hopeful that we can't propagate these species.</p><p>SEVENZO: Sudan spent much of his life in a Czech zoo. A move that almost certainly saved his life, as poaching in African wars took their toll on the remaining numbers. Czech conversation is (INAUDIBLE) flew in on the eve of Sudan's death. He had known the northern white rhino for over a decade.</p><p>So this is exciting prospect that even in death Sudan can still children.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It may sound unbelievable, but even Sudan still could have an offspring. And the way is that actually, because they are wiped out in the wild, we have to help them or ask them with the artificial techniques of reproduction. One way is that we would be able to harvest eggs from the females that we see behind me. These eggs will be fertilized in the laboratory. And the embryo that would be produced with this procedure will be put into a surrogate mother of a southern white rhino origin. The baby that would be born will be a rhino.</p><p>[16:50:14] SEVENZO: Cutting edge technology and advances in cellular biology made the scientists are no working hand in hand with conservationists to keep critically endangered species from dying out completely. After 50 million years on earth, it took mankind a couple of centuries to wipe out an entire subspecies of rhino. Even if the scientists managed to recreate Sudan's kind, will mankind stop killing them?</p><p>Farai Sevenzo, CNN, Northern Kenya.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GORANI: In India, handmade textile have a long and rich history. Destination India explores the craft of silk weaving there.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The city of Banaras has a sense of timelessness. I would call the city of (INAUDIBLE) Banaras, because that's how the local people call us.</p><p>If there's one thing that is unique of Banaras is their sense of time. And the city and the people (INAUDIBLE) craft. Banaras is known for the handmade crafting. And the reason for that also happens to be that it's on the crossroad of two of the big trade routes in India. Various fabrics, various traditions came here and the rivers here adapted themselves. We are in the north part of Banaras and this is where the magic of the Banaras textile happens. And the people are predominantly Muslim. They produce the finest fabrics out of Banaras in this region.</p><p>This is last stage of the weaving. We have the yarn stretched and it's checked. And after this, the (INAUDIBLE) is rolled onto a beam, so they are checking each (INAUDIBLE) it's the last stage before the goes onto the loom.</p><p>(INAUDIBLE) majority of the looms are pick loom. One of the reasons for that is that you need the humidity. When it becomes very dry then the yarn becomes very difficult to handle.</p><p>There are different techniques of weaving. One would be embroidery technique and the other is a (INAUDIBLE) technique. So very useful from end to end of the salvage of the fabric. You throw the rest.</p><p>I think the key factor in fine weaving is that the weaver has to have patients. It's a very meditative practice because, firstly, you're not looking at the front of the fabric, they're looking at the back of the fabric. So you never know how the front is happening. And you are weaving in such a slow feed, because hand loom. So to be a good weaver, is to be good at meditations.</p><p>The most important thing we have to remember is from the moment we are bond to the moment we die, we interact the fabric. We are always in constant contact with the piece of fabric.

Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[16:55:02] DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: Human skin keeps the body warm when t's cold and cool when it's hot. It's one of the most vital organs in our body. But when you lose a limb, like an arm, for example, you also lose all of its sensory features, right? Well, perhaps not anymore. After our tomorrow's hero, Benjamin Tee's discovery prosthetic limbs may soon be able to experience that real human touch.</p><p>BENJAMIM TEE, SCIENTIST: My name is Benjamin Tee. I'm from Singapore.

And we have months of brainstorming sessions to see how we can achieve that.</p><p>I really think we are very close. We have now developed platform technology that can enable sensors to be built on any skill you want. So it could be over the entire body of a robot or it could be as small as an area of your fingertip.</p><p>(INAUDIBLE) to change scientific -- science fiction into scientific reality. Quite frankly, kudos to the science fiction writers. They've done an excellent job of envisioning a future. But we are the ones putting that how to make that a reality.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GORANI: I'm Hala Gorani, I'll see you next time. \"QUEST MEANS BUSINESS\" is up next.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2018032001cbk40</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXG-B091-DXH2-642M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8050\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 20, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

While this scandal was revealed to the world in March 2018, recent reports suggests a possibility of Facebook and its top executives being aware of the data harvesting since 2016.</p><p><br/> Since the last one year, Facebook's rope of scandals is just twisting into deeper knots. And Cambridge Analytica was the catalyst that triggered a lot of Facebook's woes.<br/> A lot happened since 17 March 2018, after the massive scoops by The Guardian and Channel 4 News. Here's a timeline of all the major events since that fateful March day last year.<br/> 17 March 2018: Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie tells The New York Times and The Guardian/Observer about a firm called Cambridge Analytica, which purchased Facebook data on 50 million users without their knowledge to build a \"psychological warfare tool,\" which the company unleashed on US voters to show them pro-Trump content. Later, Facebook revealed that the number of compromised accounts stood at 87 million.<br/> 20 March 2018: The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reopens an investigation about whether Facebook had violated the agreed terms pertaining to data privacy protection of its users, which were reached at in 2011. Calls for Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to appear to testify before the US Congress intensify.<br/> 21 March 2018: Four days later, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologises for the data scandal in a Facebook post, which read, \"We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you. I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again\". Zuckerberg also announces that Facebook would no longer let third part app developers access to user data after 90 days of inactivity.<br/> Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix is suspended, who also confirms that the campaign did influence the US Elections.<br/> Meanwhile, the company's India partner, Ovleno Business Intelligence (OBI), lists the Indian political parties BJP, the Congress and the JD(U) as its clients.<br/> 23 March 2018: Mark Zuckerberg is summoned to testify before the US House Committee regarding the data breach.<br/> 25 March 2018: Facebook releases full-page 'sorry' ads in newspapers around the world to apologise for a \"breach of trust\".<br/> \"I'm sorry we didn't do more at the time. We're now taking steps to ensure this doesn't happen again,\" said the advertisements in major publications such as The New York Times, The Washington Post in the US, The Observer, The Sunday Times, etc, in the UK<br/> 28 March 2018: Indian government sends a notice to Facebook over the misuse of data by Cambridge Analytica.<br/> 10 April 2018: Mark Zuckerberg appears in front of the US court. He is grilled for five hours, where he takes responsibility for failing to prevent Cambridge Analytica from gathering personal information of users. Also says that his own data was improperly shared by the firm.<br/> May 2018: An official investigation is launched, and Christopher Wylie appears before the US Congress to answer questions about the scandal.<br/> Cambridge Analytica declares bankruptcy. It blames \"unfairly negative media coverage\" and says it has been \"vilified\" for actions that are both legal and widely accepted as part of online advertising.<br/> July 2018: The UK's Information Commissioner's Office announces its intention to fine Facebook $663,000 over the data scandal.<br/> Days later, Mark Zuckerberg announces that significant number of users are leaving the platform.<br/> August 2018: Crime Bureau of Investigation (CBI) begins investigating Cambridge Analytica data breach scandal.<br/> September 2018: Facebook's psychology researcher Joseph Chancellor, infamous for helping the Cambridge Analytica harvest Facebook users' profiles, quits.<br/> October 2018: The UK's Information Commissioner's Office fines Facebook $646,315 for failing to protect the personal information of its users.<br/> December 2018: A study announced Facebook as the least trusted company in the world.<br/> January 2019:  Cambridge Analytica's sister company fined \u00a315,000 ($19,000) for failing to disclose fully what information it held on an individual who had asked to know.<br/> March 2019: A report by The Observer reveals that Facebook was aware of the data harvesting scandal much before March 2018, as far back as 2016, when Cambridge Analytica started work on the Trump campaign. A meeting was hosted at Marc Andreessen's (Facebook board member and confidant of CEO Mark Zuckerberg) office with Christopher Wylie. Though Andreessen denies having ever met Wylie.<br/> The Cambridge Analytica saga is far from over. In the last one year, Facebook has been battling one PR disaster after another. Thanks to Cambridge Analytica data scandal, issues such as data privacy and the need to regulate big tech companies are stories that have come to the front pages. Facebook CEO promised a lot of things during his hearing and even as its profits seem to scale new heights, there hangs a big question mark on how far Facebook has come to fulfill its promises on data privacy. More recently, Zuckerberg also announced plans to create a privacy focused social media platform aimed at improving messaging and data privacy.<br/> A year on since the Cambridge Analytica data scandal, Facebook still has a lot to do and a lot to prove.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10947113</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VT3-D581-DYDW-748S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"924\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 3, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

NBC business correspondent Jo Ling Kent has more on the fallout.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(Begin VT)</p><p>JO LING KENT (NBC News Business Correspondent) (00:07:09): Tonight, Facebook stock tanking, dropping nearly seven percent after allegations that data firm Cambridge Analytica secretly harvested the personal information of fifty million unsuspecting Facebook users.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER WYLIE (00:07:22): They are not just a social network. They are also a-- a-- an information battle space.</p><p>JO LING KENT (00:07:28): Whistleblower Christopher Wylie helped found Cambridge which later was brought on to help the Trump campaign. The firm hired by Jared Kushner who oversaw the digital operation and by Brad Parscale who`s now running the Trump 2020 reelection efforts.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER WYLIE (00:07:43): It`s really important that Americans understand what has happened with their data, their private information.</p><p>JO LING KENT (00:07:50): Starting in 2014, Cambridge Analytica funded a personality test on Facebook and paid people to take it, this allowed the company to gather personal information from participants` Facebook feeds. But what users didn`t know, the company was also collecting data about their Facebook friends. The alleged goal: influence the views of the American electorate. In hidden camera video from our British partner ITN Channel 4, a company executive, told a reporter posing as a perspective client about the company`s edge in politics.</p><p>MAN #1 (recording) (00:08:21): I wouldn`t have thought. So, no, we`ll bring some,</p><p>MAN #2 (recording) (00:08:21): It`s no good fighting an election campaign on the facts because actually it`s all about emotion.</p><p>JO LING KENT (00:08:29): Another executive brags about the lengths they would be willing to go for a client.</p><p>MAN #3 (recording) (00:08:33): Send some girls around to the candidate`s house. We have lots of history of things.</p><p>JO LING KENT (00:08:39): Tonight, Cambridge Analytica denies misusing Facebook data and says, \"We entirely refute any allegation that Cambridge Analytica or any of its affiliates used entrapment, bribes, or so-called the honey-traps for any purpose whatsoever..\" Facebook which also owns Instagram, banned Cambridge Analytica from its platform and hired a digital forensic firm to investigate saying, \".we remain committed to vigorously enforcing our policies to protect people`s information,\" amid new calls for more regulation of social media companies.</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY (NYU Stern School of Business Professor of Marketing) (00:09:12): We`re seeing the beginning of the breakup of big tech. Big tech has not been held at the same scrutiny as the rest of corporate America.</p><p>(End VT)</p><p>JO LING KENT (00:09:20): Privacy experts say users should be aware that every like, post, or photo can reveal private information by your location, your preferences, and your political leanings, and all of that could be used for targeting.

Au total, ce sont 87\u00a0millions de personnes dont les informations personnelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 siphonn\u00e9es sans leur consentement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ce scandale est le point de d\u00e9part de la pire crise de l'histoire de Facebook, qui perdure aujourd'hui. Mais, il a aussi provoqu\u00e9 un \u00e9lectrochoc dans le monde, politiques et citoyens prenant conscience de l'ampleur du pouvoir des g\u00e9ants des nouvelles technologies dans nos vies et nos d\u00e9mocraties. En 2012, quand Barack Obama avait utilis\u00e9 des donn\u00e9es issues des r\u00e9seaux sociaux pour gagner la pr\u00e9sidentielle, le monde avait salu\u00e9 les m\u00e9thodes d'un pr\u00e9sident novateur. Quatre ans plus tard, les m\u00e9thodes de Cambridge Analytica ont au contraire jet\u00e9 un froid dans la communaut\u00e9 internationale. </p><p>Hasard du calendrier, le scandale est tomb\u00e9 deux mois avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur d'un de ces textes de sp\u00e9cialistes, le <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.lefigaro.fr/secteur/high-tech/2019/01/21/32001-20190121ARTFIG00199-rgpd-la-cnil-impose-a-google-une-sanction-record-de-50-millions-d-euros.php\">R\u00e8glement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur la protection des donn\u00e9es personnelles</url> (RGPD). Il a impos\u00e9 ce texte europ\u00e9en comme un standard n\u00e9cessaire aux yeux de la communaut\u00e9 internationale. Aux \u00c9tats-Unis, il a d'abord inspir\u00e9 la Californie, qui a adopt\u00e9 en juin 2018 sa propre loi en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e, le California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Dans ce m\u00eame intervalle, plusieurs membres du Congr\u00e8s ont pouss\u00e9 \u00e0 leur tour l'id\u00e9e de cr\u00e9er un RGPD \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. L'id\u00e9e est paradoxalement soutenue par les g\u00e9ants du Web, qui souhaitent une version plus souple que la loi californienne au niveau f\u00e9d\u00e9ral mais aussi \u00e9viter un patchwork de l\u00e9gislation entre cinquante et un \u00c9tats. Ailleurs dans le monde, l'Inde, le Canada ou encore le Japon veulent eux aussi leur RGPD.</p><h>Une menace \u00e9conomique</h><p>Pour le moment, l'affaire Cambridge Analytica n'a pas vraiment eu de cons\u00e9quences sur les finances de Facebook. En 2018, le chiffre d'affaires total de l'entreprise a atteint 55,8\u00a0milliards de dollars, en hausse de 37\u00a0% sur un an, et son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice s'est \u00e9tabli \u00e0 22,1\u00a0milliards de dollars. N\u00e9anmoins, Mark Zuckerberg a pr\u00e9venu ses actionnaires que les profits de sa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 risquaient d'\u00eatre r\u00e9duits en raison de sanctions \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir courant 2019, notamment de la Federal Trade Commission, qui veille aux droits des consommateurs aux \u00c9tats-Unis. L'institution devrait prochainement prononcer une amende de plusieurs milliards de dollars contre le g\u00e9ant. En termes d'organisation, Facebook a aussi perdu une dizaine de dirigeants en un an. Jeudi, c'est Chris Cox, num\u00e9ro\u00a0trois de l'entreprise, qui a pris la porte.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.lefigaro.fr/secteur/high-tech/2019/03/15/32001-20190315ARTFIG00069-facebook-perd-l-un-de-ses-dirigeants-historiques.php\">\u00bb LIRE AUSSI - Facebook perd l'un de ses dirigeants historiques</url></emphasis></p><p>Encore plus inqui\u00e9tante, une menace in\u00e9dite plane sur Facebook et les autres g\u00e9ants des technologies: celle du d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement.

Car Cambridge Analytica n'\u00e9tait que le d\u00e9but des ennuis pour le r\u00e9seau social: l'affaire a permis aux d\u00e9tracteurs de Facebook de l'attaquer sur divers sujets qui mena\u00e7aient depuis longtemps l'entreprise, pouss\u00e9s par un fort sentiment anti-Gafa des politiques et des citoyens. Sur le respect de la vie priv\u00e9e, la fiscalit\u00e9, la d\u00e9sinformation en ligne, la mod\u00e9ration, l'anticoncurrence...

Il y a un an, deux m\u00e9dias, le New York Times et le London's Observer (le magazine du journal britannique The Guardian), r\u00e9v\u00e9laient l'exploitation frauduleuse de donn\u00e9es d'utilisateurs Facebook par une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 britannique, au profit de la campagne de Donald Trump et de celle pour le Brexit, en Grande-Bretagne. Au total, ce sont 87\u00a0millions de personnes dont les informations personnelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 siphonn\u00e9es sans leur consentement.Ce scandale est le point de d\u00e9part de la pire crise de l'histoire de Facebook, qui perdure aujourd'hui. Mais, il a aussi provoqu\u00e9 un \u00e9lectrochoc dans le monde, politiques et citoyens prenant conscience de l'ampleur du pouvoir des g\u00e9ants des nouvelles technologies dans nos vies et nos d\u00e9mocraties.</p><h>Un \u00e9lectrochoc politique</h><p>En 2012, quand Barack Obama avait utilis\u00e9 des donn\u00e9es issues des r\u00e9seaux sociaux pour gagner la pr\u00e9sidentielle, le monde avait salu\u00e9 les m\u00e9thodes d'un pr\u00e9sident novateur. Quatre ans plus tard, les m\u00e9thodes de Cambridge Analytica ont au contraire jet\u00e9 un froid dans la communaut\u00e9 internationale. Hasard du calendrier, le scandale est tomb\u00e9 deux mois avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur d'un de ces textes de sp\u00e9cialistes, le R\u00e8glement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur la protection des donn\u00e9es personnelles (RGPD). Il a impos\u00e9 ce texte europ\u00e9en comme un standard n\u00e9cessaire aux yeux de la communaut\u00e9 internationale. Aux \u00c9tats-Unis, il a d'abord inspir\u00e9 la Californie, qui a adopt\u00e9 en juin 2018 sa propre loi en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e, le California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Dans ce m\u00eame intervalle, plusieurs membres du Congr\u00e8s ont pouss\u00e9 \u00e0 leur tour l'id\u00e9e de cr\u00e9er un RGPD \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. L'id\u00e9e est paradoxalement soutenue par les g\u00e9ants du Web, qui souhaitent une version plus souple que la loi californienne au niveau f\u00e9d\u00e9ral mais aussi \u00e9viter un patchwork de l\u00e9gislation entre cinquante et un \u00c9tats. Ailleurs dans le monde, l'Inde, le Canada ou encore le Japon veulent eux aussi leur RGPD.</p><h>Une menace \u00e9conomique</h><p>Pour le moment, l'affaire Cambridge Analytica n'a pas vraiment eu de cons\u00e9quences sur les finances de Facebook. En 2018, le chiffre d'affaires total de l'entreprise a atteint 55,8\u00a0milliards de dollars, en hausse de 37\u00a0% sur un an, et son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice s'est \u00e9tabli \u00e0 22,1\u00a0milliards de dollars. N\u00e9anmoins, Mark Zuckerberg a pr\u00e9venu ses actionnaires que les profits de sa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 risquaient d'\u00eatre r\u00e9duits en raison de sanctions \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir courant 2019, notamment de la Federal Trade Commission, qui veille aux droits des consommateurs aux \u00c9tats-Unis. L'institution devrait prochainement prononcer une amende de plusieurs milliards de dollars contre le g\u00e9ant. En termes d'organisation, Facebook a aussi perdu une dizaine de dirigeants en un an. Jeudi, c'est Chris Cox, num\u00e9ro\u00a0trois de l'entreprise, qui a pris la porte.Encore plus inqui\u00e9tante, une menace in\u00e9dite plane sur Facebook et les autres g\u00e9ants des technologies\u00a0: celle du d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement. Aux \u00c9tats-Unis, des \u00e9lus en ont m\u00eame fait un axe central de leur programme \u00e9lectoral pour la prochaine \u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 2020, \u00e0 l'image de la candidate \u00e0 l'investiture d\u00e9mocrate Elizabeth Warren. Celle-ci soutient l'interdiction des fusions entre Amazon et la cha\u00eene de distribution d'alimentation bio Whole Foods, ou encore de Facebook, Whats App et Instagram. Elle n'est d'ailleurs pas la seule \u00e0 pr\u00f4ner la r\u00e9gulation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du secteur. C\u00f4t\u00e9 r\u00e9publicain, des personnalit\u00e9s politiques conservatrices comme Ted Cruz appellent \u00e9galement au d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement de ce qu'elles appellent les \u00ab\u00a0big tech\u00a0\u00bb.</p><h>Une image \u00e9corn\u00e9e</h><p>Un \u00ab\u00a0gangster du num\u00e9rique\u00a0\u00bb. Voil\u00e0 le verdict du Parlement britannique, rendu en f\u00e9vrier, \u00e0 la suite d'une longue enqu\u00eate sur les efforts de Facebook pour lutter contre la d\u00e9sinformation en ligne. Car Cambridge Analytica n'\u00e9tait que le d\u00e9but des ennuis pour le r\u00e9seau social\u00a0: l'affaire a permis aux d\u00e9tracteurs de Facebook de l'attaquer sur divers sujets qui mena\u00e7aient depuis longtemps l'entreprise, pouss\u00e9s par un fort sentiment anti-Gafa des politiques et des citoyens. Sur le respect de la vie priv\u00e9e, la fiscalit\u00e9, la d\u00e9sinformation en ligne, la mod\u00e9ration, l'anticoncurrence... En Europe et dans le monde, les projets de loi se multiplient, contraignant Facebook mais aussi les autres g\u00e9ants du Web dans leurs activit\u00e9s. \u00c0 l'inverse, certaines entreprises ont profit\u00e9 de cette p\u00e9riode trouble pour faire du respect de la vie priv\u00e9e un v\u00e9ritable enjeu marketing. C'est notamment le cas d'Apple, dont le PDG, Tim Cook, a r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement attaqu\u00e9 Mark Zuckerberg tout au long de l'ann\u00e9e.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FIGECO-72203761088</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FIGECO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN6-7DG1-DYDH-S4DX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">276425</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"758\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Le Figaro Tous Droits R\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Le Figaro \u00c9conomie</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"22970\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>N\u00b0 23199</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>Samedi 16 Mars 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>FRENCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Il y a un an, deux m\u00e9dias, le <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">New York Times</emphasis> et le <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">London's Observer </emphasis>(le magazine du journal britannique <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Guardian</emphasis>), r\u00e9v\u00e9laient l'exploitation frauduleuse de donn\u00e9es d'utilisateurs Facebook par une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 britannique, au profit de la campagne de Donald Trump et de celle pour le Brexit, en Grande-Bretagne. Au total, ce sont 87 millions de personnes dont les informations personnelles ont \u00e9t\u00e9 siphonn\u00e9es sans leur consentement.<br/>Ce scandale est le point de d\u00e9part de la pire crise de l'histoire de Facebook, qui perdure aujourd'hui. Mais, il a aussi provoqu\u00e9 un \u00e9lectrochoc dans le monde, politiques et citoyens prenant conscience de l'ampleur du pouvoir des g\u00e9ants des nouvelles technologies dans nos vies et nos d\u00e9mocraties.<br/></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Un \u00e9lectrochoc politique</emphasis></h><p>En 2012, quand Barack Obama avait utilis\u00e9 des donn\u00e9es issues des r\u00e9seaux sociaux pour gagner la pr\u00e9sidentielle, le monde avait salu\u00e9 les m\u00e9thodes d'un pr\u00e9sident novateur. Quatre ans plus tard, les m\u00e9thodes de Cambridge Analytica ont au contraire jet\u00e9 un froid dans la communaut\u00e9 internationale. Hasard du calendrier, le scandale est tomb\u00e9 deux mois avant l'entr\u00e9e en vigueur d'un de ces textes de sp\u00e9cialistes, le R\u00e8glement g\u00e9n\u00e9ral sur la protection des donn\u00e9es personnelles (RGPD). Il a impos\u00e9 ce texte europ\u00e9en comme un standard n\u00e9cessaire aux yeux de la communaut\u00e9 internationale. Aux \u00c9tats-Unis, il a d'abord inspir\u00e9 la Californie, qui a adopt\u00e9 en juin 2018 sa propre loi en mati\u00e8re de vie priv\u00e9e, le California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Dans ce m\u00eame intervalle, plusieurs membres du Congr\u00e8s ont pouss\u00e9 \u00e0 leur tour l'id\u00e9e de cr\u00e9er un RGPD \u00e0 l'\u00e9chelle f\u00e9d\u00e9rale. L'id\u00e9e est paradoxalement soutenue par les g\u00e9ants du Web, qui souhaitent une version plus souple que la loi californienne au niveau f\u00e9d\u00e9ral mais aussi \u00e9viter un patchwork de l\u00e9gislation entre cinquante et un \u00c9tats. Ailleurs dans le monde, l'Inde, le Canada ou encore le Japon veulent eux aussi leur RGPD.<br/></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Une menace \u00e9conomique</emphasis></h><p>Pour le moment, l'affaire Cambridge Analytica n'a pas vraiment eu de cons\u00e9quences sur les finances de Facebook. En 2018, le chiffre d'affaires total de l'entreprise a atteint 55,8 milliards de dollars, en hausse de 37 % sur un an, et son b\u00e9n\u00e9fice s'est \u00e9tabli \u00e0 22,1 milliards de dollars. N\u00e9anmoins, Mark Zuckerberg a pr\u00e9venu ses actionnaires que les profits de sa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 risquaient d'\u00eatre r\u00e9duits en raison de sanctions \u00e0 pr\u00e9voir courant 2019, notamment de la Federal Trade Commission, qui veille aux droits des consommateurs aux \u00c9tats-Unis. L'institution devrait prochainement prononcer une amende de plusieurs milliards de dollars contre le g\u00e9ant. En termes d'organisation, Facebook a aussi perdu une dizaine de dirigeants en un an. Jeudi, c'est Chris Cox, num\u00e9ro trois de l'entreprise, qui a pris la porte.<br/>Encore plus inqui\u00e9tante, une menace in\u00e9dite plane sur Facebook et les autres g\u00e9ants des technologies : celle du d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement. Aux \u00c9tats-Unis, des \u00e9lus en ont m\u00eame fait un axe central de leur programme \u00e9lectoral pour la prochaine \u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle de 2020, \u00e0 l'image de la candidate \u00e0 l'investiture d\u00e9mocrate Elizabeth Warren. Celle-ci soutient l'interdiction des fusions entre Amazon et la cha\u00eene de distribution d'alimentation bio Whole Foods, ou encore de Facebook, WhatsApp et Instagram. Elle n'est d'ailleurs pas la seule \u00e0 pr\u00f4ner la r\u00e9gulation f\u00e9d\u00e9rale du secteur. C\u00f4t\u00e9 r\u00e9publicain, des personnalit\u00e9s politiques conservatrices comme Ted Cruz appellent \u00e9galement au d\u00e9mant\u00e8lement de ce qu'elles appellent les <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> big tech</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> \u00bb.</emphasis><br/></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Une image \u00e9corn\u00e9e</emphasis></h><p>Un <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u00ab gangster du num\u00e9rique \u00bb. </emphasis>Voil\u00e0 le verdict du Parlement britannique, rendu en f\u00e9vrier, \u00e0 la suite d'une longue enqu\u00eate sur les efforts de Facebook pour lutter contre la d\u00e9sinformation en ligne. Car Cambridge Analytica n'\u00e9tait que le d\u00e9but des ennuis pour le r\u00e9seau social : l'affaire a permis aux d\u00e9tracteurs de Facebook de l'attaquer sur divers sujets qui mena\u00e7aient depuis longtemps l'entreprise, pouss\u00e9s par un fort sentiment anti-Gafa des politiques et des citoyens. Sur le respect de la vie priv\u00e9e, la fiscalit\u00e9, la d\u00e9sinformation en ligne, la mod\u00e9ration, l'anticoncurrence... En Europe et dans le monde, les projets de loi se multiplient, contraignant Facebook mais aussi les autres g\u00e9ants du Web dans leurs activit\u00e9s. \u00c0 l'inverse, certaines entreprises ont profit\u00e9 de cette p\u00e9riode trouble pour faire du respect de la vie priv\u00e9e un v\u00e9ritable enjeu marketing. C'est notamment le cas d'Apple, dont le PDG, Tim Cook, a r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement attaqu\u00e9 Mark Zuckerberg tout au long de l'ann\u00e9e.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FIGARO-72203761088</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FIGARO2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VN6-7DD1-F0C5-84VM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">248099</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"758\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Le Figaro Tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Le Figaro</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"43844\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>N\u00b0 23199</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>Samedi 16 Mars 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>FRENCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They will be forced to expand their compliance, privacy and social responsibility functions. Big tech firms are going from being darlings to being devils in the public imagination. </p><p> Big tech firms have a Californian mindset: they assume that people will generally do the right thing but this is being challenged. Now, they're having to stop focusing on the sunny side of human behaviour and start recognising the more sinister side. They are scrambling to keep up by developing techniques for hunting down fake news, harmful content and online bullying. </p><p> Tech firms are now going to be under pressure to show the thousands of businesses who are plugged into their platform that they are complying with their policies. This could mean a rapid expansion of compliance bureaucracy. For the company, this is likely to mean more cost. For users, more terms and conditions they don't understand. </p><p> The really big issue is if regulators start questioning the business model of tech firms.

The problem is that it\u2019s not necessarily true. A story that is largely about the use of smoke and mirrors in elections is itself surrounded by smoke and mirrors. Amid the confusion, we may lose sight of the real problem.</p><p>Cambridge Analytica claimed to have developed an unprecedented dataset on American voters which, allied with personality-profiling tools, allowed it to \u201cmicrotarget\u201d political messaging in a way that would redefine political campaigning. Chris Wylie, the company\u2019s former research director, now a whistleblower, has said this dataset was built on the back of data obtained from Facebook, and that similar techniques were used by a related company in the Brexit referendum. (Cambridge Analytica has rejected the various allegations.)</p><p>But the evidence that any of this had a marked impact is thin. The Brexit campaign was brilliantly and unscrupulously targeted, but not by Cambridge Analytica, and not covertly.</p><p>The head of the Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, told the Spectator that the campaign\u2019s own micro-level analysis found that the most effective message with all groups was, \u201cLet\u2019s give our NHS the \u00a3350 million the EU takes every week\u201d.</p><p>Cambridge Analytica worked for Ted Cruz in the Republican primary: James Nix boasted that they took Cruz from being a nobody to coming second; Cruz spokesman Rick Tyler told BBC Newsnight that Cambridge Analytica gave the campaign \u201cno strategic advantage at all . . . In the end, it was just bullshit\u201d.</p><p>Cambridge Analytica had said they would apply this methodology to the Trump campaign, but have since said that they they were hired too late to do so.</p><p>The Trump campaign was brilliantly and unscrupulously targeted, but by Steve Bannon, not Cambridge Analytica. It was Bannon who harnessed the Trump campaign \u201cto a single political view: that the path to victory was an economic and cultural message to the white working class in Florida, Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania\u201d, wrote Michael Wolff, in Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House.</p><p>Or more simply: \u201cHere\u2019s what won it for Trump,\u201d said Bannon recently, in response to the Cambridge Analytica story: \u201ceconomic nationalism\u201d and \u201cplain language\u201d. The harsh truth for liberals is that, like Obama before him, Trump told a better story.</p><p>That\u2019s not all that Trump and Obama have in common. It was the Obama 2012 campaign that pioneered online micro-targetting; but this tended to be reported in eulogistic tech-utopian terms, rather than the Orwellian ones that have dominated this story.</p><p>So Trump is a distraction, as ever. Cambridge Analytica didn\u2019t need to acquire Facebook data via a third-party app; the Trump campaign didn\u2019t need to hire Cambridge Analytica to do micro-targeting. They could have just paid Facebook to do it for them.</p><p>The threat to democracy exists. Cambridge Analytica has brought this threat to mainstream attention in a way that satisfies the liberal narrative of the illegitimacy of Donald Trump; strip away that cladding and what remains is a more insidious, less dramatic story than the idea of rogue agents (Cambridge Analytica; the Russians) robbing elections. This threat is the cumulative impact of our growing addiction to social media and technology, through which we share ever more data, for which ever more ways to monetise it are found.</p><p>These trends have made Facebook and Alphabet (the parent company of Google) the third and seventh most valuable companies in the world. They have an effective duopoly of the digital advertising market and have cannibalised the print news industry. They know more about people and society than any institution, ever.</p><p>Keeping up is going to stretch law-makers and regulators to their limits. Transparency of political advertising online, as mandated in the Honest Ads Act currently before the US Congress, and tighter data privacy laws and regulation, are necessary measures, but marginal. More radical measures are needed.</p><p>One option is the kind of trust-busting that has a long history in the US (Standard Oil was broken up in 1911, AT&amp;T in 1982; Microsoft was due to be broken up in 2001 but appealed, and the Department of Justice then settled). Another would be a sea-change in data laws that would place radical restrictions on what can be kept or harvested. Apple manages vast amounts of user data in its iCloud service; it charges for the service instead of harvesting the data for ad targeting.</p><p>A more modest initiative that could have far-reaching effects would be simply to recognise the reality that Facebook and most social media companies are now first and foremost publishers, rather than tech companies. This would change the incentive structure for Facebook, incentivising it to block content which could be potentially harmful, as opposed to the status quo, where it has a financial incentive to allow any content that attracts eyeballs, and therefore advertising.</p><p>But the Achilles\u2019 heel of Facebook, and its social media peers, lies in its very success. The compulsive checking of your phone for notifications and updates may be normal, but it is not healthy. These devices \u2013 hardware and software \u2013 are addictive, and that addiction is damaging, most obviously to children. As we come to understand this more, my hunch is that what is now normal will come to be seen, in retrospect, as dysfunctional. Big Tech may outrun the legislators on competition law, on data privacy, on content monitoring, on regulation; but eventually, the public health argument is going to overtake it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUBUPO-413083</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUBUPO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5866-K6B1-JCW9-20CN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315448</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"983\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Post Publications Ltd.

Now I really just care about building something that my girls are going to grow up and be proud of me for.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It may sound sweet, but bringing in the daughters was a carefully calculated attempt to deal with the Zuck's most awkward public relations problem: people don't like him. Take Senator Dick Durbin, when he was asked whether <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>should turn up in Washington to face questions. \"Wouldn't it be great,\" he said, sarcasm rising off him like steam, \"for him to show up like most Americans do when asked to testify as to the practices of his company?\"</p><p>In all the coverage of the way Cambridge Analytica \"harvested\" <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>data on 50m of its users, the most consistent theme was: Zuck's a creepy geek who doesn't get it. Even The Economist stooped to a sarcastic sneer when suggesting he might see an 80% drop in his company's earnings when the regulators moved in: \"How would you like that, Mr <person><nameText>Zuckerberg?</nameText></person>\"</p><p>This wave of distaste has been brought about by the revelations about Cambridge Analytica, which, two weeks ago, was thought to be the mysterious master of the big data universe. An academic created a <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>questionnaire app that lured 270,000 people into giving it access to their data. These people had 50m <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>friends who unwittingly yielded up their data too. Cambridge Analytica swooped on this trove. They were then exposed as a bunch of twerps by undercover Channel 4 reporters in an expos\u00e9 that engulfed <person><nameText>Facebook.</nameText></person></p><p>None of which should matter for a $500bn company that controls the eyeballs of more than a quarter of the world's population. But it does because, financially and operationally, <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>is <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person>\"<person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is Mark, and Mark is <person><nameText>Facebook,</nameText></person>\" said the pollster Tavis McGinn. \"Mark has 60% voting rights . . . So you have one individual, 33 years old, who has basically full control of the experience of 2bn people around the world.\"</p><p>McGinn was brought in by <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>last year to \"track the public perception of <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg</nameText></person>\", a tricky job that also included tracking the company's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, 48. Sandberg, like <person><nameText>Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>was mysteriously absent for the days after the scandal broke but emerged on Thursday. \"We definitely didn't realise the gravity of these issues,\" she told CNBC, a startling admission given the scale of the dumped data. Staff call his office \"the Aquarium\" and hers \"Only Good News\". The two of them tried to be lovable by issuing an end-of-year video in 2016, a wincingly awful exchange of sweet corporate nothings. McGinn left, contractually unable to disclose his results.</p><p>He did, however, set up Honest Data, a polling company that found that 27% of people thought <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>was having a negative impact on the world. It came out worst among the big tech companies. Indeed only one company on his questionnaire was seen more unfavourably, the tobacco firm Marlboro.</p><p>Reputationally, <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>has crashed from the heavens. He was an internet god. Look at the books that were written about him - Think Like Zuck, Fifty Inspirational Life Lessons to Learn from <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>The Boy Billionaire and even <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg, </nameText></person>Vampire Slayer. (The film about him, The Social Network, was perhaps a more realistic portrayal.) His head turned by such adulation, is he likely to learn anything from these polls or from the Cambridge Analytica scandal? Probably not. He is, you see, a 33-year-old teenager with issues.</p><p>Every January, for example, he likes to announce his personal challenges for the coming year. These have included wearing ties, learning Mandarin, reading 25 books, running 365 miles. Last year it was visiting the 30 US states he had never been to. Like the appointment of McGinn, this was generally seen as part of a test run for the presidency - a risible ambition then; now even more so.</p><p>In 2011 his challenge was to eat meat only from animals he had personally killed. This proved a death sentence for an unfortunate bison whose head was used to decorate the <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>offices.</p><p>This isn't the brilliant, narcissistic capering of Steve Jobs, the abrupt, nerdy genius of Bill Gates or the cold, corporate calculation of Google; it's either teen pranks or fantastically clumsy attempts to make <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>look cool.</p><p>This year's challenge immediately came back to bite him where it hurts - it was to \"fix <person><nameText>Facebook</nameText></person>\".</p><p>\"If we're successful this year,\" he wrote, \"we'll end 2018 on a much better trajectory.\" Okaaaay.</p><p>The previous scandal - about Russia's use of <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>in its meddling with the 2016 election - was at first brushed aside by <person><nameText>Zuckerberg. </nameText></person>His reaction to this latest scandal was generally agreed to be inadequate. It was also several days too late.</p><p>This was, it has been reported, because of a disagreement at the top of the company about what to do. One side wanted to do nothing; the other wanted to do a lot - to, in fact, fix <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person>This argument is the heart of the matter.</p><p>Tech companies like to have grand mission statements: <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>was \"to make the world more open and connected\". Mission statements, however, never survive first contact with Wall Street. The brilliant programmer who created <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>in his Harvard dorm had to become the businessman who would make it pay. And, because of the peculiar and deeply flawed structure of the internet, the only way to do that was advertising. Both Google and <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>are advertising companies, and they form a dangerous duopoly that must surely, one day, be broken up.</p><p>As everybody knows, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>employs users' data to drive its advertising business. But <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>uses it far more ruthlessly than people realise, notably combining internal profile material with external tracking in a system called Custom Audiences. Once you've got it all working, this is easy money.</p><p>But it all depends on <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>mantra: \"We are an open platform.\" To survive in its present form, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has to minimise its responsibility for content. It needs to be like a content-neutral phone company, not a content- responsible publishing company. The execs who wanted to downplay the reaction last week did so because they knew that every discussion of content increases the threat to their business plan.</p><p>\"They have,\" said <person><nameText>Zuckerberg's </nameText></person>former mentor Roger McNamee last week, \"a deep philosophical belief that they are a platform, not a media company.\" He also made it clear this was an existential crisis for the company: \"They're so far off track now, I don't know how they get back.\"</p><p>The company has shot itself in the foot by, falteringly, toying with the idea that it is a news service. This would make it a publishing company and therefore subject to the same regulation as newspapers or TV channels. Anyway, going to <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>for news is like going to B&amp;Q for your milk: a category error.</p><p>Every discussion about <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is now about content. The \"open platform\" idea has succumbed to what social scientists call the \"tragedy of the commons\" - any shared resource will be exploited by self-interested users. These users are those such as Russia and Cambridge Analytica, but also politicians who, like Donald Trump, can exploit the advertising system. <person><nameText>Facebook's </nameText></person>algorithms do not just sell ad space to the highest bidder; they prioritise ads that grab attention, which makes a supposedly neutral platform an extremism-generating machine.</p><p>Content talk has driven <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>to a cliff edge, but does he know this? Truth-tellers such as McGinn and McNamee have left and, as executives' pay is partly shares-based, last week's dive in the share price may prove ominous for recruitment and keeping the best staff happy. Some are even leaving because they have acquired a conscience.</p><p>After the Russia-Trump-<person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>rumpus of the 2016 election, McNamee emailed Sandberg and <person><nameText>Zuckerberg</nameText></person>: \"I am really sad about <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person>I got involved with the company more than a decade ago and have taken great pride and joy in the company's success . . . until the past few months. Now I am disappointed. I am embarrassed. I am ashamed.\"</p><p>Alex Stamos, chief security officer, is now leaving seemingly because he was out of step with other executives when he said there should be more disclosure about Russian interference. In addition, over its 14-year life <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>has made many workers very rich. They have left to live their lives or start their own companies. <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>may or may not be lonely, but he is certainly isolated.</p><p>His further problem is very personal. It is that <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>is no longer a monolithic cult built around the character of its co-founder and his mission statement.</p><p>Antonio Garcia Martinez, a self- described heartbroken idealist, was a senior advertising executive at <person><nameText>Facebook. </nameText></person>\"You actually,\" he said, \"have leaks coming out of <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>now, which is unprecedented. Everyone in Silicon Valley would agree that, before the [2016] election, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>was famously difficult to penetrate. Nobody would talk.\"</p><p>The internet was designed, idealistically, to be a free information resource for everybody. But this created a funding vacuum that has been filled by advertising. If somebody had built a payments system - for example, a penny for every email - this monopolistic chaos of tragically ruined commons might never have happened. But we are where we are, and the Zuck is where he is, teetering and hoping his daughters will be proud.@bryanappleyardFacebook's 'gaping wound of data': go to thesundaytimes.co.uk/dannyinthevalley to listen to series two of our podcast</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-42536302</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RY8-K3C1-JCJY-G3CP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1619\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 25, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The revelations about Cambridge Analytica's use of Facebook data - mining more than 50 million users' personal information - came at a time when people were already considering appropriate ways to curb the handful of powerful tech companies that dominate not just the American economy but, increasingly, American life.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the information revolution took off in the 1990s, we all got caught up in the excitement of the age, the novelty of the products and their transformative power. We were dazzled by the wealth created by nebbishy 25-year-olds, who themselves became instant billionaires - the ultimate revenge of the nerds. And in the midst of all this, as America was transitioning into a digital economy, we neglected to ask: \"What is the role for government here?\"</p><p>The image of technology companies springing forth from unfettered free markets was never quite accurate. Today's digital economy rests on three major technologies: the computer chip, the Internet and GPS. All three owe their existence in large part to the federal government. The latter two were, of course, developed from scratch, owned and run by the government until they were opened up to the private sector. Most people don't realize that GPS - the global positioning system of satellites and control centers that is so crucial to the modern economy - is, even now, owned by the U.S. government and operated by the Air Force.</p><p>And yet, as these revolutionary technologies created new industries, destroyed others and reshaped communities and cities, we simply assumed that this was the way of the world and that nothing could be done to affect it. That would be socialist-style interference with the free market.</p><p>But the result does not seem one that a libertarian would celebrate. We now have a tech economy dominated by just a few mammoth companies that effectively create a barrier to entry for newcomers. In Silicon Valley today, new startups don't even pretend that they will ever grow to become independent companies. Their business plan is to be acquired by Google, Face-book, Amazon, Microsoft or Apple. The situation looks more like an oligopoly than a free market. In fact, through the age of big tech, the number of new business startups has been declining.</p><p>The other noticeable consequence has been the erosion of privacy, highlighted by the Cambridge Analytica/Facebook scandal. Because technology companies now deal with billions of consumers, any individual is a speck, a tiny data point. And since, for most technology companies, the individual consumer is also a product, whose information is sold to others for a profit, he or she is doubly disempowered. The technology companies would surely respond that they have democratized information, created products of extraordinary power and potential, and transformed life for the better. All this is true. So, did previous technologies like the telephone, the automobile, antibiotics and electricity. But precisely because of their power and transformational impact, it was necessary for the government to play some role in protecting individuals and restraining the huge new winners in the economy.</p><p>Change is likely to come from two directions. Regulatory action in the West will provide protections for the individual to better control his or her data. The European Union has established rules, which will come into effect on May 25, that will make it much easier for individuals to know how their data is being used and to limit that use. It is likely that the U.S. will follow suit.</p><p>The second direction is even more intriguing and comes from the East. Until recently, as Indian entrepreneur Nandan Nilekani pointed out to me, there were just a handful of digital platforms with more than 1 billion users, all run by companies in the United States or China such as Google, Facebook and Tencent. But now, India has its own billion-person digital platform: the extraordinary \"Aadhaar\" biometric ID system, which now includes almost all of the nation's 1.3 billion citizens (and whose creation Nilekani oversaw). It is the only of these massive platforms that is publicly owned. That means it does not need to make money off user data. It's possible to imagine that in India, it will become normal to think of data as personal property that individuals can keep or rent or sell as they wish in a very open and democratic free market. India might well become the global innovator for individuals' data rights.</p><p>Add innovations in blockchain technology and we are likely to see more challenges to the current gatekeepers of the Internet in the near future.</p><p>Whether from East or West, top down or bottom up, change is coming to transform the world of technology. Properly handled, it can produce freer markets and greater individual empowerment.</p><p>Fareed Zakaria's email address is <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:comments@fareedzakaria.com\">comments@fareedzakaria.com</email></p><p>(c) 2018, Washington Post Writers Group</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENTSLK-2031234145</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENTSLK2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S6J-F301-JBHT-D3R7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313420</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"831\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2018 Enterprise Business Newspaper Inc.

A former Obama campaign staffer, Carol Davidsen, put out a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-chain/2018/mar/04/alt-right-big-tech-censorship-lawsuits\">number of tweets</url> seeming to indicate that in 2012, their organization had also been given broad access to Facebook user data. \"Facebook was surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph,\" she wrote, \"but they didn't stop us.\" </p><p>For \"alt-right\" blogger and author, Vox Day, this was enough to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-chain/2018/mar/04/alt-right-big-tech-censorship-lawsuits\">confirm</url> that \"Facebook is in SERIOUS trouble\", and he did a back-of-the-envelope sum leading to the conclusion that the company may owe \"$200bn in potential FTC fines\". </p><p>Another part of Davidsen's remarks, where she said that Facebook was \"on our side\", became the basis of headlines from RT to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-chain/2018/mar/04/alt-right-big-tech-censorship-lawsuits\">ZeroHedge</url>, and dutifully amplified by the likes of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-chain/2018/mar/04/alt-right-big-tech-censorship-lawsuits\">Infowars</url>. </p><p>The story was also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-chain/2018/mar/04/alt-right-big-tech-censorship-lawsuits\">covered</url> by Breitbart, where schadenfreude led to a possibly unprecedented step: a straight and sympathetic       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-chain/2018/mar/04/alt-right-big-tech-censorship-lawsuits\">rewrite</url> of a Guardian column. </p><p>Others tried to wave the whole thing away. </p><p>In the New York Times, Ross Douthat <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-chain/2018/mar/04/alt-right-big-tech-censorship-lawsuits\">claimed</url> it was television, not social media, that was crucial in Trump's election. </p><p>On his radio show, Rush Limbaugh <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/the-chain/2018/mar/04/alt-right-big-tech-censorship-lawsuits\">insisted</url> that there was nothing to see. Facebook collects a lot of data, he argued, and \"Cambridge analytics [sic] is like any other outfit that found a way to access it, and it's not illegal.\" Then, with trademark bluster, he pointed the finger of blame at a familiar party. </p><p>\"Google, the kings of data collection, Google, the kings of harvesting everybody's personal data to use in advertising and who knows whatever else, practically had a White House relationship with Barack Hussein O,\" said Limbaugh.</p><p>More than a year since he left office, in times of trouble, conservatives are still using Obama as their most reliable punching bag. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-42492369</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXG-W1T1-F021-64VR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"737\"/><timeReceived>3:48 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

But Aleksandr Kogan, the University of Cambridge researcher whose data-collecting app formed the basis for Cambridge Analytica's subsequent work for various political groups, appeared to pour cold water on this idea when speaking to a US Senate committee . 'The data is entirely ineffective,' he said. 'If the goal of Cambridge Analytica was to show personalised advertisements on Facebook, then what they did was stupid.' Even if the boasts by former Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix and the statements of whistleblower Christopher Wylie of the company's influence are overblown as Kogan claims, the firm nevertheless hit on something with its approach of harvesting data in order to influence voter behaviour. </p><p>Before that approach becomes commonplace, we should survey the whole moral panic around the scandal and see what lessons can be learnt. Use and abuse of data The first issue is our misunderstanding of consent. Kogan's data-scrape may have been unethical, but he didn't steal the data from those that used the app - they gave it willingly. When you use a social media platform you, by definition, are publishing your private life. More so, you effectively sell your private life on an open market through giving your consent for it to be monetised by that platform. Following admissions by Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, we now know that 'online privacy' settings exist only as a means to allow Facebook users to believe they have a consumer's right to privacy, when in fact they are not the consumer, but the product itself. If privatisation is a process of transferring ownership from the public to the private realm, this means privacy itself has been privatised. You publish your data, making it public, so that private companies can capitalise on what this data says about you by selling you things. This leads to a paradoxical situation I call neoprivacy, following neoliberalism's similar disregard for and exploitation of the private individual. In a neoprivate world privacy exists to be exploited financially. The neoprivate individual both values their personal life so much that they publish it, yet is so neglectful of their privacy that, well, they publish it. Cambridge Analytica's stroke of genius was to combine two different kinds of datasets, let's call them deep and broad. The deep psychometric tests of a small sample (from Kogan's app) were combined with the broad online behaviour of a massive sample. With this they claimed they could predict people's behaviour simply by their actions on Facebook . The firm sold this to political campaigns and lobbyists as their ' secret weapon '. This model shows a real understanding of social media by grounding it on people's actions on Facebook - what they click on, read, and like - rather than their expressed statements. It's what you do that matters , not what you say. Putting information up for only commercial interests is a wasted opportunity. pixinoo/Shutterstock Democratic data dividend I think this data-driven approach offers a democratic opportunity. Typically deep, expert research generates the evidence that informs policies. But data-driven governance appears increasingly disassociated from ordinary lives, with voters preferring crowd-pleasing factoids when it comes to major decisions. Indeed, suspicion of experts may even be a contributing factor in the rise of what could be called demagogcracy and fake news . In contrast, broad data is generated by people based on what they choose to do, not what an expert has asked them, or prompted them, to say. Neoprivate individuals feel a sense of ownership and investment when they share something on Facebook or Instagram. If anything online needs to be harvested, it is this sense of communal, social engagement. Yet our primal need for social engagement is both stymied by expert policy wonks with no grip of the grassroots, and monetised by the big platforms with no interest in civic society. Evidence-based governance was instigated under former prime minister, Tony Blair, that was supposed to be a panacea for the uncertainties of political decision making. It has failed. In contrast, the activity-based influence of broad data is a political model that has been shown in the hands of Trump to be frighteningly effective. If we are to fix democracies then future leaders should engage with both - albeit more transparently than Cambridge Analytica did. One final lesson: if we live in a neoprivate world, why couldn't we monetise our own lives just as the big tech companies have? If Facebook knows enough about me to advise me on what sort of shelf brackets I need, why couldn't this same level of insight be applied to more important, more technical, complex political decisions that need to be made by citizens, for their benefit? If Cambridge Analytica can develop algorithms that are good predictors of our behaviour, shouldn't that information be used to influence policy? Why shouldn't politicians harvest it for the greater good rather than personal gain? Many biopolitical theorists define our current age as that of power through regulatory surveillance ; it is time that neoliberal democracies transitioned to power through participatory enhancement. Two worlds remain an absolute mystery: Facebook's algorithms and why we vote the way we do. Place both those secrets in the public realm rather than in the hands of the highest bidder, and maybe democracy can develop its own app and fix itself. Now that's what I call neoliberalism.

She is the author of \"Targeted: The Cambridge Analytica Whistleblower's Inside Story of How Big Data, Trump, and Facebook Broke Democracy and How It Can Happen Again\" and is a subject of the documentary film \"The Great Hack.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">             When you were younger, you were an Obama supporter, you were interested in human rights advocacy. Can you talk about ending up at Cambridge Analytica and some of the decision points or rationalizations that kept you there for three-plus years?           </p><p>I always assumed I would work in diplomacy or as a human rights lawyer and was working towards that. That's how I eventually ended up in Cambridge Analytica in the first place. Because I ended up doing my PhD in preventive diplomacy, looking into how people would be able to have enough real-time data to intervene in situations before they became violent. Specifically, looking into how you could prevent crimes against humanity and war crimes. [Former Cambridge Analytica CEO] Alexander Nix shared what they were doing for NATO and our allied militaries, which was to identify individuals vulnerable to be recruited into ISIS - young people in the United Kingdom either being recruited or possibly being sent messaging to encourage them to sneak into Syria. And to teach the digital teams of allied militaries to convince those kids to stay at home. I thought: This is amazing. That's what I want to learn how to do. So I'll take a consultancy and see where it goes. </p><p>I learned a lot more about data than I bargained for, obviously. I definitely started to quickly see the dark side of politics. Over the first year and a half I was there, we're in the middle of the Brexit campaign. And I'm starting to see a campaign that we're not running hands-on but did data work for in the beginning turn into something incredibly divisive. And then we get into the Trump campaign and various other conservative groups, advocacy organizations, that Cambridge was working for. You start to see projects specifically targeting neurotic people with messaging that shows their house getting broken into and saying, you know, A gun, it's not just a right. It's an insurance policy. That's where it starts to get quite creepy.</p><p>             So what's your reaction?           </p><p>I guess I kept telling myself: You're not running those campaigns. You're doing other things - and these people aren't going to win anyway. So it must be okay, right? It was only really after the Trump campaign when I had a two-day-long debrief presentation from my colleagues that ran the Trump campaign and the Trump super PAC when I really saw, for the first time, things that really disturbed me.</p><p>             Can you give an example?          </p><p>The chart that the Trump campaign had used to categorize different audience groups. On one axis, it's how likely you are to vote. The other axis is how much of a supporter you are of Trump or Hillary. And they have different audience groups for different strategies, but one of them is called \"deterrents.\" These are the people that are definitely Hillary voters if they are going to vote. There's no way you can get them to vote for Donald Trump. But you could possibly get them not to vote at all. </p><p>             Voter suppression.          </p><p>Exactly. Blatantly. So then they showed us different groups within that group and how they message those people. For instance, conservative women, in order to turn them off, they made this video called \"She Can't Run Her House.\" That advertisement was all about how Michelle Obama, who actually, at the time, was talking about her and Barack taking care of Sasha and Malia during the campaign, said, \"If you can't run your own house, you can't run the White House. I'm going to take care of my family first.\" But it was taken out of context and spliced with all of these things about Bill and Monica Lewinsky and saying Hillary Clinton was an unreliable woman because she had stayed with her cheating husband. And that was sent to women who were modeled to care about conservative values as their top political issue. </p><p>And that's where I said, I won't work for this company in America anymore. If you let me leave the country and start my own office, I'll stay. Because my father had had brain surgery, and it was quite obvious he was never going to work again, and no one else in my family had any money to pay any bills. So there was no way I was quitting my job over this. I just had to figure out a way to live with it. And I moved to Mexico to start my own office, so then I could work for people I wanted to work for and build something that was totally separate. That's the way that I justified it to myself.</p><p>             You've said, \"Big data, Trump and Facebook have broken our democracy.\" How do you feel about having been part of that?           </p><p>Well, it's still disturbing every time I look back on it, how far everything went. You know, I started out in a place - the Obama campaign - where we were not allowed to do negative messaging, and ended up in a place that enhanced negative messaging to the point where, in my opinion, it should be considered criminal. But the way that I have dealt with it is to do everything I can to stop this from happening now. Because, unfortunately, we're even worse off than in 2016. You know, there's now hundreds of Cambridge Analyticas, not one.</p><p>And we now have Facebook deciding they're no longer going to moderate political content and that politicians won't even be held to community standards. They basically refuse to enforce the laws we already have on their platform - laws against voter suppression, against slander and libel and incitement of violence. It worries me a lot. That's why I work with legislators to help pass not just privacy laws, but regulation of big tech. Like banning the negative use cases of algorithms that push up inflammatory content. Because we have to really force people like Mark Zuckerberg to be ethical. They're not going to make that decision themselves.</p><p>             Do you ever get pushback? People saying, well, who are you to tell us what's ethical now?           </p><p>I mean, every now and then. But it's never too late to do the right thing. People that have seen the darkest side of this and know how it works are going to be some of our biggest assets in fixing it. As you can see in Congress when people are questioning Mark Zuckerberg [laughs], not everyone has the understanding of these really advanced, cutting-edge technology tools. So I do a lot of briefings for legislators and politicians and testimony and written comment so they understand what they're dealing with. Because this stuff changes and gets more advanced every day, so it's kind of an all-hands-on-deck sort of situation.</p><p>             We're in an election year now. What do you think the chance is that we're able to have a free and fair democratic election?          </p><p>This year, it's not going to be great. I think we should actually be kind of scared about what we're going to see. </p><p>             What's your biggest regret in all this?          </p><p>Not having blown the whistle before Trump became president. </p><p>This interview has been edited and condensed.

We are live from the theater at Sahara, Las Vegas. I'm Erin Burnett.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are just four days away from the Nevada caucuses, a crucial contest for Democrats in the crowded 2020 primary campaign. The candidates are making one more final pitch to Nevadans, including the undecided voters right here in our audience tonight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, you just heard from Senator Bernie Sanders. We're going to keep it going now with one of his top competitors for the nomination, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Hello!</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  Nice to see you. Thank you.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  I want to begin tonight with a question about the president and what's going on with the judicial system in this country, President Trump.</p><p>Tomorrow the leaders of an independent group of federal judges, I don't know if you all saw this, but they're going to be having an emergency meeting and they're going to be talking about President Trump's attorney general, Bill Barr, how they've been handling these politically sensitive cases like Roger Stone.</p><p>More than 2,000 former Justice Department officials, as you know, have called for Barr to resign. Do you think he should, Mayor?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Absolutely. This really is an emergency. It is an emergency of legitimacy in our justice system. Our justice system only works if it is immune from the interference of politicians. And obviously this president, especially now that he feels emboldened after getting away with what he got away with during the impeachment, thinks he can just lean in and ask others to do the same, and interfere.</p><p>And one of the first criteria for my attorney general is that she or he will understand that she or he is the lawyer for the American people and not the personal lawyer of the president of the United States.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  I want to bring in Jamie Shay in our audience, she's from Henderson. She is retired but she is volunteering this week, Mayor Buttigieg, for the Democratic Party, in the caucuses on Saturday. And she is supporting you.</p><p>Go ahead, Jamie.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi, Mayor Pete, and thanks for coming tonight. You've not had a great amount of success turning around the lack of support of people of color, with your successes in Iowa and New Hampshire, your campaign has renewed excitement. But do you have a plan to gain the trust and support of more people of color as your campaign moves forward? And if so, how?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Yes. First of all, thank you for your work for the party. It's so important.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And one of the reasons I'm proud to belong to our party is that our party reflects the diversity of our country. And, of course, we're thrilled with the successes that we've had top two finishes in the first two states. But most of the racial diversity of the electorate is in the states yet to vote, beginning right here in Nevada.</p><p>And I view this not as a political question, but as a question of how to make sure we can lead, in order not just to win, but to deserve to win. Now the reality is voters of color have every reason to be especially skeptical of politicians, especially new politicians. When voters of color, and I'm thinking in particular of black voters who have been the most reliable and loyal constituency in the Democratic Party, feeling that politics has not delivered for them, often feeling that our party has taken their support for granted, I understand why that bar is so high.</p><p>Not only that, but I am from a city that has a complicated story, just like America has a complicated story. I'm proud of the things we were able to get right, cutting black unemployment, cutting black poverty in our city. We were nationally recognized for race-informed work on economic opportunity. But we've also had tremendous struggles and a lot of unfinished business, especially when it comes to racial justice and policing.</p><p>I'm seeking to earn the support of voters of color, first of all, by asking for it, and demonstrating that I understand that I am not entitled to anybody's support. And by laying out a vision for how the future can be a better one by proactive steps on everything from economic empowerment to reforms to our legal system that I know we must deliver in our time so that this can become a country where your race has no bearing on your health or on your wealth or on life expectancy or on your experience with law enforcement.</p><p>I also know that nobody is experiencing the pain of living under this administration more than voters of color. And that is why it is so important that we select a nominee who will put an end to the Trump administration, and I will continue working to demonstrate, to show, not just tell, that I am building the best campaign to do just that.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  So, how do you -- you talk about obviously Nevada and South Carolina, and these are going to be the diverse states that are going to vote. And you have made progress, but you've got a long way to go when you look at the polls with people of color. Are you worried you're running out of time?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Again, I'm worried that America is running out of time. This is not just about my political fortunes, this is about whether our country can get this right. But what I'm going to do as a candidate is use every minute and every day that remains to find voters, look them in the eye, meet them where they are, and speak specifically to the challenges that black and Latino and AAPI Americans face, that Native Americans face that are of a piece with the American experience but also unique challenges that deserve specific attention.</p><p>BURNETT:  So, our next question comes from Karen Keehan, she's over here, a special education teacher. She works with students who have been emotionally traumatized and she's also currently an undecided voter.</p><p>Karen, go ahead.</p><p>QUESTION:  Yes. Thank you for being here tonight, I appreciate it. As an educator here in Clark County School District, I participate in mandatory drills where I lock my door, draw blinds, ask students to shut down computers. They lay down on the floor, spread around the room. I explain they must be on the floor to avoid bullets coming through the windows and doors. To be more -- and then they need to spread out to be more difficult targets. They need to also turn off any screens that they have to prevent light from attracting the attacker.</p><p>What is your plan for remedying the terror that has become embedded in our schools?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  It is heartbreaking to hear you walk through that because it's in the specific way you described it, I'm thinking about terms like dispersion of targets and the difference between cover and concealment that are things that I learned as part of military training. And part of why I believed I was in the military was to serve potentially in conflict zones so that kids at schools in America would never have to have that experience.</p><p>And to see what we are accepting in terms of the expectation that this is just normal, that kids are going to have active shooter drills, sometimes before they're old enough to learn how to read, shows you that this country has its priorities wrong. Actually, no, Washington has its priorities wrong, because...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You know, you look at something like universal background checks. It won't save every life. But it would make a big difference. This is something that the vast majority, not just of Democrats, but of Republicans, and gun owners already believe we ought to do. It's 80 or 90 percent support in America and we still can't get it through Washington.</p><p>It shows you what has to change in our political system. It shows the need for presidential leadership on this issue, because you are in such an important field. This, of all things, should not be your problem, and it certainly shouldn't be the problem of the children that you serve.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  So, this weekend, as you know, was the one-year anniversary of the Parkland shooting. And the shooter was 19 years old. He had purchased his firearm. Florida moved to change that. So now the minimum age to purchase a gun in that state is 21 years old. Several of your opponents want to do the same thing on a federal level, make it you have to be 21 years old to buy a gun legally. Do you support that?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  I would be very open to that. We have to do whatever we can to save lives. And it's not just background checks, it's not just age of purchase, it's also red flag laws. Ways to disarm domestic abusers or intervene when somebody is a danger, especially because the crisis of gun violence in our country, it's not just murder, it's suicide. And many of those suicides are preventable.</p><p>And I believe we also need to take action on assault weapons. Because the kinds of weaponry I trained on in the military has no business anywhere near an American school.</p><p>BURNETT:  I want to bring in -- sorry, it was two years to Parkland, so. I want to bring in Alex Giuliani, a law student at UNLV who is currently undecided. Alex?</p><p>QUESTION:  Hello.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Hi.</p><p>QUESTION:  We have seen our government neglect public education, welfare, and Social Security, because their donors have no stake in those programs. By allowing private health insurance to exist under your universal health plan, do you worry that those who can afford private insurance will lose their vested interest in maintaining the quality of national health care?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, what I'm proposing is a national health insurance program that I believe will be so good that everybody or almost everybody over time will choose it. And if I'm right, then it will eventually become the Medicare plan for our everybody.</p><p>But I'm not willing to assume that we're right. This is where I part ways with my friend Senator Sanders. He believes that we should require everybody to adopt that plan, whether they want to or not, when actually there's a lot of folks here in the state of Nevada, for example, culinary workers come to mind, who negotiated for good private plans, often traded wages as part of that.</p><p>Who are we to tell them they have to give it up? I believe that we should trust individuals to make the right choice for them. But I also believe that support will exist for this plan that I'm proposing we create. As a matter of fact, one of the things that I think is striking about the moment we're living in is we have a powerful American majority ready to support this reform, what I'm talking about, creating a public plan for everybody, just as long as we don't kick people off their private plans, then this has widespread support, which is really important at a moment when we have got to try to unify and not further polarize the American people.</p><p>It solves the problem. It brings us together. It's also paid for, which is more than you can say for Senator Sanders's plan. And I believe it is the best way to make sure that there is no such thing as an uninsured American.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  So, Senator Sanders actually has called the current -- the private health insurance system that we have now corrupt. That's the word that he has used. Do you also believe it is corrupt? And if you do, why do you want to leave it in place?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, again, I think that Americans should be able to decide for themselves. Now the private insurance industry attacked my plan the moment that it came out, I think because they don't want the competition. And what we're going to do is we're going to create this quality public plan, either they'll come up with something better and they'll stay in business, or they'll fail to come up with something better and they'll go out of business. Either way works.</p><p>The important thing is not whether the government is providing your coverage. The important thing is that you get great coverage one way or the other. And I'll leave it to the private players to figure out if they can measure up.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  So, you've said undocumented immigrants should have been able to receive coverage through Obamacare. This is something that you've said in the past, and you've addressed that in your health plan. Now let's just say you're the president of the United States. You go to Congress. You're trying to pass the bill. And that becomes the roadblock, that you're just not able to get it through if you're going to provide access for undocumented immigrants. Would you be willing to put it aside, or is that something you will not drop?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  I'm going to fight to make sure that anybody can participate on this plan, because if we are excluding people from the ability to get in on health insurance, we're not just harming them, we're punishing ourselves. We become a less healthy country. More people will be in emergency rooms because they can't get the preventative treatment that they need up front. And more people will be sick.</p><p>Nobody wins when that is the case. And so I will do everything in my power to make sure that when we deliver this plan, we do it in a way that everybody can participate.</p><p>BURNETT:  Is it fair to say, just to be clear, that health insurance for undocumented immigrants is a deal-breaker for you?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  I can't game out every amendment or poison pill, every change they're going to try to make to bring the package together. What I'll say is that that is one of the pillars of the plan as I see it.</p><p>BURNETT:  All right. I want to bring in Donald Fagan. He's a student at UNLV, currently undecided. So go ahead, Donald.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi, Mayor Pete. Candidates such as Senator Sanders have criticized your campaign support from billionaires. Many Americans feel like their voices are often disregarded in favor of those with larger wallets. How can the average voter be certain that you will represent their interests first? And will you pledge to make overturning Citizens United and removing money from politics a day one priority as president?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  So, the answer to your second question is, yes, I will. Citizens United is a disaster for our democracy. And if what it takes to fix Citizens United is a constitutional amendment, then I think that's exactly what constitutional amendments are for. Let's not be afraid and let's launch that fight on day one.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And as far as defending the interests of those who aren't wealthy, I have the smallest wallet of anybody running for president right now. They did a ranking in Forbes magazine. And I'm officially the least wealthy presidential candidate right now. So when I'm talking about the interest of middle class, I'm also talking about our own. And I got into politics, I got into campaigning in order to be part of solutions for folks like my neighbors, folks like my own family.</p><p>And I also believe that at a time like this, we've got to get help from everybody who is willing to support our bold vision for the future. My campaign was driven and is driven by hundreds of thousands of individuals who have donated. As a matter of fact, if you're watching right now, you can go to peteforamerica.com, send in $5 or $10, because that is the lifeblood of our campaign.</p><p>But if there are some people a lot wealthier than I am who want to be part of that, who want to chip in, great, because we're getting ready to go up against Donald Trump and his allies, who have been raising hand over fist in order so much money in order to hold on to their grip on power.</p><p>And my campaign is one that's never going to define itself by whose help we reject. My campaign is about belonging. It's about bringing everybody into the picture and standing side by side with everybody determined to make sure that we end the Donald Trump presidency and deliver a better future for Americans.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  So, when you said you want to not be defined by who you reject, last hour, I don't know if you heard Senator Sanders, but he would not commit to accepting money from Michael Bloomberg if Michael Bloomberg is not the Democratic nominee. Right, he has pledged to help whoever is.</p><p>Would you take his money and his support if you are the nominee?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Sure. As a matter of fact...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Look, right now, obviously I'm competing against Mayor Bloomberg. We have, I think, different approaches and different visions. But his philanthropy supported a million dollar effort in our community to help low-income people get transportation to go to work. I'm not going to reject that help because it came from a very wealthy person. This is the moment to bring everybody that we can into this effort.</p><p>And I promise exactly one thing in return for any contribution, which is we're going to take that contribution and use it to go beat Donald Trump.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  So, you know, you talk about something he did in your community, but obviously Amy Klobuchar has said Bloomberg is, her words, hiding behind his ad spending. Elizabeth Warren says he has bought his way on to the debate stage. Bernie Sanders has accused him of trying to buy the entire election.</p><p>Pretty simple question, yes or no. Do you think Michael Bloomberg is trying to buy the Democratic nomination for president?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Yes. Yes. I mean, what else do you call it? What else do you call it when you dip into your endless reserves of millions and billions and don't go through the process of campaigning in states like Nevada or Iowa or New Hampshire, humbling yourself, going into the diners and the backyards, looking eye to eye to voters?</p><p>Look, my campaign wouldn't exist if all that mattered was how much money and fame you start with and how you get yourself on the air. We built this thing from nothing. And we built it by having those conversations and letting voters pick apart what you have to say.</p><p>And to try to just go around that by throwing colossal sums of money on television, shows you what's wrong with our system. And I also believe it's not the best way to pick our nominee or the next president.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  So, I want to bring in Kristen Makhathini now. She is a realtor and she is from Henderson, Nevada. She previously had supported Senator Kamala Harris. So she is now undecided. Go ahead with your question, please.</p><p>QUESTION:  Thanks. Hi, Mayor Pete, thanks for spending time with us tonight. As a fellow Episcopalian and Christian, it is very frustrating to hear so much of the public discourse that assumes that being a Christian equals evangelical Christian conservatism. My Episcopalian belief and Christianity teaches me the values of scripture, tradition, and reason. I am a Democrat and a Christian, you can be both.</p><p>How can you use your voice as president to share this viewpoint more broadly when the right thinks they own it?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, first of all, I'm glad to be with a fellow Episcopalian. And I agree. It starts with sending the message that God does not belong to a political party. And...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And by the way, you know, it's also very important to make clear that the presidency and the Constitution, and my presidency will belong to people of every religion and of no religion equally. This is not about imposing my faith on anybody.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>But I have got to say, like you, I find a message in scripture that is very different from what the political right seems to want to talk about all the time, a lot about poverty, a lot about compassion, a lot about humility that I seek in my imperfect way to live up to, and that does have implications for how I will approach public office.</p><p>And the time has come to send a message that people of faith have a choice. And if you belong to a Christian tradition or any moral or religious tradition that emphasizes making yourself useful to the oppressed and standing with and identifying with the prisoner, and welcoming the stranger, the stranger by the way is another word for immigrant. Yes that has implications in public life and I won't be afraid to talk about how my positions are informed by my faith.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  So, you know, to the point you talk about, about God not belonging to any kind of political party, at the last CNN town hall, you said if your faith calls upon you to help the marginalized, those who are afflicted, to comfort -- to comfort people, to strive for humility and decency, as the Christian faith does, and then I quote you, \"then I just can't imagine that that requires of you that you be anywhere near this president.\"</p><p>Do you think it is impossible to be a Christian and support President Trump?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, I'm not going to tell other Christians how to be Christians. But I will say, I cannot find any compatibility between the way this president conducts himself and anything that I find in scripture. Now I guess that's my interpretation. But I think that's a lot of people's interpretations. And that interpretation deserves a voice.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  All right, we are going to be back with more from presidential candidate, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, right after this break.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BURNETT:  And welcome back to Sahara Las Vegas. We're here with Democratic presidential candidate, the former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, for a live town hall.</p><p>So one thing that people might not know about you is that you speak eight languages. Am I missing one?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Depends what you mean by speak. Some -- some better than others.</p><p>BURNETT:  OK. OK. All right, but among them, Norwegian and Maltese...</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Uh-huh.</p><p>BURNETT:  ... which has a lot of Xs in it and all kinds of things. So, you know, I was thinking, like could you say something in one of them? And I'm like, here we are, and I didn't want to make it, you know, too easy, but something like, I don't know, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Oh, wow. Yeah, let's see. In Maltese, it would be something like (UNTRANSLATED) I think. A bunch of Maltese people are going to like tweet me how I got that wrong.</p><p>BURNETT:  There's no winning on this one, by the way.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Yeah, and Norwegian (UNTRANSLATED) I don't know. Anyone Norwegians here? I don't know.</p><p>BURNETT:  You couldn't get immediately...</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  As far as everybody here knows, that was right.</p><p>BURNETT:  OK.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  I hope.</p><p>BURNETT:  So, which of them -- because, I mean, when people hear eight languages, I mean, most of us speak one or we struggle to kind of comprehend a second. What was the hardest to learn?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Maltese is actually really hard, because it's this mix. So my father emigrated from Malta. It's one of the smallest countries in the world. It's got its own language. And it's a mix of everything -- it's a Semitic language. It's got parts of Arabic in it. There's a bunch of Italian and some English going on.</p><p>Like, the basic way to say hello in Maltese is to say, \"All right?\" And thank you in Maltese is \"Thank you.\" And -- but you also say \"Grazie,\" which is Italian. It's like a whole -- but, you know, the languages that are the most different from English are obviously the most challenging. And you don't get to practice a lot of them.</p><p>BURNETT:  No, I know, like I say, it's all those X's. Is there a time, though, that you can think where knowing one of these languages helped you help someone else?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Yeah. I remember the day the travel ban went into effect. And we were in Houston -- at the time I was seeking to be DNC chair and decided to go down and participate in the protests on the travel ban. And there was a rumor going that an Iranian family had been caught up in the situation that -- you know, they were being caught at customs and weren't being allowed through because of the ban.</p><p>Anyway, we were there at the terminal. And there was this amazing scene. It was a protest that had been organized almost on the spot by a young woman who was a server at a Carrabba's. It showed you the power of online organizing. And within a few hours, hundreds of people were at the airport, and we were -- they were calling for the travel ban to be lifted.</p><p>And then there was a stay, I think, in court. And so this family started coming through. And they were being mobbed by TV reporters, and I realized that they might not have had any idea of why there were all these protesters, cameras, or anything. So I went up.</p><p>And I learned -- to go to -- to deploy to Afghanistan, I learned Dari, which is kind of like Farsi, which is the language of Iran. So I see this man emerge, kind of Middle Eastern appearance. His wife is in a hijab. They got three or four little kids. A bunch of suitcases. They look exhausted.</p><p>And I went up to them and started trying to ask, you know, are you OK? Do you understand what's happening? Do you need any help? Everybody is here to support you. And the more I tried to say this in Farsi, the clearer it became that he -- he didn't understand me at all.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And then I realized he was an Arabic speaker. And I studied Arabic in college. I'm not very good at it, but I'd studied it. And had this conversation -- he had no idea what was going on. He was actually Jordanian, and he just wanted to go home.</p><p>And meanwhile, there -- because I'm wearing a tie, the reporters from one of the local TV stations think that I'm his lawyer and they start interviewing me. And one of them was from Telemundo, which was in Spanish, and they were asking me to try to ask him questions in Arabic, which I'm not that good at, and they were asking me in Spanish. And it was a real mess.</p><p>But in the end, I just realized there was this crowd chanting and cheering, and they didn't know what was going on, so I just grabbed the luggage cart to help him and his wife, and just got them out of there to the garage where his cousin was waiting to pick him up.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  Got him where he was going.</p><p>All right, I want to bring in Dave Comarow. He is a retired patent attorney from here in Las Vegas. And you say you're undecided, as well. Go ahead with your question, Dave.</p><p>QUESTION:  Mayor Buttigieg, welcome to our humble little town.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Great to be here.</p><p>QUESTION:  I hate that anybody has to ask this question, but, Mayor Pete, if you do become the nominee, how are you going to deal with the almost certain flood of personal attacks based on your sexual orientation?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, it'll happen, and I'm ready. You know, when I decided to come out in...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Thanks. When I decided to come out in -- it was during a re-election year in South Bend. I was up for mayor. I decided, after my deployment, that I was just too old to not have a personal life and made that personal decision, not knowing what the effect on my career would be or on being able to win.</p><p>Mike Pence was the governor of Indiana then. And it was tough sledding for -- as it still is for many LGBTQ people in the state where I come from. And I just decided I had to do it. And what wound up happening was that I got re-elected with 80 percent of the vote.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And what that tells me was that, at the end of the day, people were ready to judge me based on the job I was doing for them. But I also think it's important to recognize that change on these issues and acceptance and equality, even though it's got a long way to go, it's also happened at a pace that a lot of people are struggling with.</p><p>And I think for those who haven't quite found their way all the way to the right side of history, it's important to beckon them in the right direction. I remember not long after I started dating Chasten, and I ran into a woman I knew in South Bend, older generation, a little more conservative. And she kind of gave me this mischievous pat on the arm, and she said, \"I met your friend the other day, and he is wonderful.\"</p><p>You know, that could have been a moment to give her a lecture on the difference between, you know, your friend and your partner. But what I realized was, in her way, she was kind of inching toward the direction of acceptance, she felt good about it, she felt good that she was moving in that way. And I think in a moment like this, it's really important that we find those who are maybe not quite there yet, and help them get there instead of clubbing them over the head and telling them they're bad people until they see it just the right way. And I think that's a really important part of where our politics needs to go.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  So, last week, Rush Limbaugh made homophobic comments about you and he said that America is not ready, he doesn't think, for a gay president. Now, then Limbaugh -- I don't know if you know -- but he gave this whole story today that President Trump told him don't apologize...</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Oh, great.</p><p>BURNETT:  ... for saying anything he said. Publicly, though, Trump says that he would not have a problem supporting a gay candidate. Do you take him at his word?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, not if he's sending out his supporters to talk in this way. And, look, I mean, the idea of the likes of Rush Limbaugh or Donald Trump lecturing anybody on family values...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I mean, I'm sorry, but one thing about my marriage is it's never involved me having to send hush money to a porn star after cheating on my spouse with him or her.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So they want to debate family values? Let's debate family values. I'm ready.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  All right. Our next question is from Nick Elefantis. He is a high school government teacher. He is from Las Vegas and also undecided. Nicholas, please.</p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening, Mayor Buttigieg. It's widely acknowledged that the public education system in Nevada and across the nation is broken. Part of it is due to the attrition of teachers. We're faced with low salaries and crippling student debt. What can be done to help keep hard-working, highly qualified teachers in their job, instead of looking for the door?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Yeah.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You may see Chasten, who's right next to you, is nodding along, because he's a teacher with high student debt and who has dealt with low compensation. So we as a household -- you know, we understand what you're going through.</p><p>And it is so important that we recruit and motivate and empower teachers to be in that profession. It's such an important profession. And yet, as we talked about earlier, teachers are now being expected to convert into highly trained armed guards if there's a threat to the classroom. You're finding part of your job automated by the over-reliance on test administration.</p><p>And then there's the simple fact that teachers are not paid enough. We can do something about that. And we should do something about that with federal funds.</p><p>So I'm proposing that we triple the funds going into Title I in particular. Those are dollars that go into low-income districts, which is where having a great teacher is especially impactful, because low-income students, and disproportionately black and brown students, will perform better and earn more in the future, be more economically empowered if they have the best teachers.</p><p>We also, I think, need to lift up the profession as a whole. I'm proposing we create a...</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Yeah. I'm proposing that we create an Education Access Corps. The idea would be to link up high-quality teaching programs across the country. And if you participate in them, and then commit to teaching in one of those Title I programs, you have a portable teaching license you could take anywhere, and you get your student loans forgiven, if you do have that debt, in exchange for agreeing to be a teacher in such an important area.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>Bottom line is, as I like to say is that if we respected our teachers just a little more like we do our soldiers and paid our teachers just a little more like we do our doctors, this country would be a better place for all of us.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  So, you were talking about federal funding and what you would do with federal funding. Elizabeth Warren, some of your opponents, have called for complete freeze, no federal funding for new charter schools. Do you think that makes sense?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, I think that we need to not have a meat cleaver approach on this, but insist that any charter schools are set up in a way that will benefit traditional public schools, too. It can't just be up to whether you win a lottery that you have opportunity.</p><p>We've got to make sure -- charters can have a role in piloting new ideas or innovations, but they have to be subject to the same accountability and the same scrutiny as traditional public schools. And they should be funded at a comparable level.</p><p>So if we're talking about federal funds being used in a way that would tilt the scale, and then a charter school that gets more money says, see, we got better results, but it's just because they had more resources, that's not fair.</p><p>What we've got to do is make sure that any innovations that are going on in the space of education go in a way that would ultimately reach students at every kind of traditional public school in the country. And I neglected to mention one other thing, talking about teachers and how important that job is. There are a lot of people in school buildings and in classrooms, teachers, but also paraprofessionals and other educators and support staff who are also very much underpaid, and it's important that we, I think, speak to that, as well. I meant to mention that.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  Johnathan Carter is also a teacher. He's a high school English teacher, part-time college instructor here in Las Vegas, currently undecided, but I believe, Jonathan, leaning towards Mayor Pete. I don't know how he's done tonight for you, but that's what you were I think coming in the door. Go ahead with your question.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Hopefully I can bring you across, then.</p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening, Mayor.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Hi.</p><p>QUESTION:  The president of the United States has been accused of not always telling the truth about some of the most basic issues concerning Americans.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  That's diplomatic.</p><p>QUESTION:  I try. If you are in a debate with him, what will be your approach to ensuring that his mistruths do not go unchecked while still communicating your own vision for the country and not allowing yourself to become nothing more than a fact-checker?</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  You know, it's a great point. I think this president is kind of like one of those Chinese fingertraps, you know, the harder you pull, the more you get stuck in them. Because he has this way of commanding our attention by doing something outrageous or telling a lie. And if he -- if he tells a lie, you've got to correct it. If he does something racist, you got to confront it. If he insults a war hero, you got to stand up to it. And yet the moment you do that, you're starting to get sucked into his game.</p><p>And so I believe the discipline that's going to be required of any nominee, and the discipline I plan to bring to that debate stage, is to be ready very quickly to correct his lies and to confront his wrongdoing, but to put it in its place quickly enough that we deny him his famous ability to change the subject.</p><p>Because the real subject of this election is our lives. And that's a winning issue for us. We're the ones trying to get you a raise. We're the ones ready to deliver paid family leave, serious about climate change, prepared to do something about gun violence, standing up for workers and unions. On the things that are going to affect whether our lives go better in the future, I believe we've got all the best answers.</p><p>I think he knows that, and that's why he needs us arguing about whatever crazy nonsense he can use to dominate the news. And so my overall philosophy on how to defeat this president, especially how to debate this president, is, yeah, you've got to stand up to him sometimes, but the less we're talking about him, the more we're talking about you, and that's how we're going to win.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  You know, it's amazing how many people just in casual conversation talk about this, the debates, and how they imagine the debates between Trump and whomever the Democratic nominee is. So you touched on this a little bit, but how would you on a debate stage balance between responding to him, whether -- whatever it is he's saying or sometimes, as you mentioned, it could be five or six topics in one answer, responding and not letting him dominate the conversation?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, I think it's to remember what the election is about. I believe that every election is about the voter asking one question:  How is my life going to be different if you're president instead of you?</p><p>And when it comes to the things that are going to decide our lives and our children's lives going better or worse, we have not only a strong message, we have the majority of the American people with us.</p><p>You know, Democrats are so used to being in a defensive crouch politically, we forget this sometimes, but the American people are with us on wages, with us on health, even with us on guns and with us on immigration reform, issues where we used to hesitate to say what we really believe. The American people are already there.</p><p>We've just got to make sure that we keep the focus on those basic questions. And I will maintain the discipline to keep that at the center of this election and of the debates themselves.</p><p>BURNETT:  And so how do you reach voters -- because you're going to want some of these voters to listen to you, to possibly vote for you -- who get their news from sources that are very friendly to the president and may not be aware of the fact that he may be saying something false?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Yeah, well, that's why I go on some of those networks. It's a controversial decision. I took some heat in my party. But in addition to appearing on networks like CNN, you're going to see me on networks like Fox News. Not because I'm under any illusions about their objectivity, but how can -- in a world where people are starting to get their own information from their own sources and even have their own facts, how can we be surprised if somebody's not responding to my message if they've literally never even heard it?</p><p>How can we be mad at them for believing a lie, if it's the only thing that ever got to them? And those tendencies are only going to increase with these social media bubbles. That's why I think it's very important to pop those bubbles, to cross through different media, and I'm doing it as a candidate, I'll do it as president, too.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  So, our next question is from Brian Linsey. He owns a moving and a storage company here in Las Vegas. He's currently leaning towards supporting you, Mayor Buttigieg. Go ahead, Brian.</p><p>QUESTION:  Good evening, Mayor Pete. Good afternoon, Chasten. Welcome to Las Vegas to both of you.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Thanks.</p><p>QUESTION:  Measures to enact legislation to protect our climate and natural resources invariably run into GOP resistance, typically prevented as, \"This will cost us jobs\" or \"This will hurt the economy.\"</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Yeah.</p><p>QUESTION:  How do you protect our climate and protect our economy from job loss simultaneously?</p><p>And would you -- would you support a specific legislative proposal for a carbon tax and rebate?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  I will. That's the answer to the last part. Because I believe it would play a very important role in making sure that our economy and the prices in our economy accurately reflect the true cost of businesses as usual.</p><p>Remember, the most costly thing we could possibly do is to stay on the path that we're on. And that's not just a moral cost; that's a dollars and cents cost because the catastrophic effects of climate change, which we're already beginning to see, are only going to increase.</p><p>So the idea of a carbon tax and rebate, or a carbon fee and dividend, whatever you want to call it, is that we assess a fee on the price of carbon. But, at least in my plan, we would rebate that right back out to the American people.</p><p>And I'd do it on a progressive basis so that most low and middle-income people would be made more than whole. This is not about taking money out of the economy. This is about making sure that the economy accurately reflects the cost of carbon pollution and climate change. And that's part but only part of how we're going to meet these needs.</p><p>Now, you're right, there has been a lot of partisan resistance to doing the right thing, whether it's climate, whether it's protections for federal lands, for air and for water. But here's another example, kind of, like what we were talking about earlier with guns, where, actually, there's a lot more agreement among the American people than there is on the floor in Congress.</p><p>Right now, most Americans, including in conservative states, believe in protecting public lands, believe in making sure we have clean air and water.</p><p>Now, there are some who have been made to feel like they are part of the problem, if you're working in certain kinds of industry, for example. Ironically, those are some of the very people whose skills we will need to recruit in the next generation of those industries that have to be carbon-free.</p><p>There is no question there will be a transition. And I'm proposing that we invest over $200 billion in supporting workers through that transition. But we also estimate that we will create at least 3 million net new jobs by taking the action we must as a country to mobilize and fight climate change.</p><p>And some of these jobs are -- might sound a little new-fangled, high-tech green jobs. A lot of them are jobs that are perfectly easy to understand right now. I'm talking about building trades. I'm talking about union carpenters and electrical workers and insulators and glaziers that we're going to need just to get our buildings to where they will have to be retrofitted for -- for us to stay ahead of the climate challenge.</p><p>So we've got to break this idea that we're choosing between doing the right thing for our climate and doing the right thing for our economy. The only way forward, for our economy, for our future, for our children and for our climate, is to step up, come together, deal with carbon pollution and lead the world in doing something about it.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  So, earlier tonight, Senator Sanders was talking about the Green New Deal, which he supports. And one of the key tenets of the Green New Deal is a federal jobs guarantee, which he happens to also support. Do you support a federal jobs guarantee?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, I want everybody to have an opportunity to work, but I wouldn't structure it in the same way that Senator Sanders is talking about.</p><p>What I would do is make sure not only that we're supporting everyone's ability to get training for jobs that are growing -- I mean, remember, we have shortages right now in key areas, from direct care workers to -- to educators.</p><p>BURNETT:  That's true.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  But, also, I'm proposing that we create a national service program, a million paid voluntary national service opportunities a year, to help get people that experience of working on something important. In fact, a big part of it would be a climate core, and then other parts of it could be decided by local communities, so that we set everybody on the path to success, whether they're going to ultimately go to college or whether they're going directly into the workforce.</p><p>BURNETT:  All right. We're going to take a very brief break. When we come back, we'll have more with Mayor Pete Buttigieg, right after this.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  And welcome back. We are live from Las Vegas with former mayor Pete Buttigieg.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>So I want to ask you about something else that happened this morning. And I know you're out on the campaign trail, but I know there's no way you missed this, President Trump commuting the sentence of the former Illinois governor and \"Celebrity Apprentice\" contestant...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(BOOING)</p><p>... Rod Blagojevich, the former New York police commissioner Bernie Kerik, Michael Milken, the financier, and a former NFL owner.</p><p>My question, though, is who would be at the top of your list for possible presidential pardons?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  I would start with nonviolent drug offenders caught up in the racial disparities of the failed war on drugs.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>I mean, look, I actually think presidential clemency power can be an important part of how we de-carcerate a country that is shockingly over-incarcerated.</p><p>I mean, if incarceration made a country safe, we'd be the safest country in the world, and we're not. It's bad enough just by the numbers, but when you add to that the racial disparities of who has been incarcerated often for nonviolent offenses, or those who have aged out of being any threat and could contribute in their communities.</p><p>That's where I would be paying my attention. This president -- it seems like he's never met a corrupt politician he didn't like.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>It's one thing about him that actually is bipartisan, is his fondness for corrupt politicians.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>And it's just, to me, the absolute wrong direction to even think about that pardon power.</p><p>BURNETT:  I want to bring in Chelsea Johnson. She's a student at Nevada State College who is undecided tonight.</p><p>Go ahead, Chelsea.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi, Mayor Pete.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Hi.</p><p>QUESTION:  I was wondering what you plan to do on protecting everyday citizens' valuable data that has been collected and sold by social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  What a great question. And it's an example of one of the issues that the next president is going to face that hadn't even been thought about, really. a few years or decades ago.</p><p>And we don't have a national policy on data security or on data privacy. Different states have them. So basically, we have 50 different policies across the country. And not only that, we're relying on very outdated legal protections.</p><p>Just think about this. When you download an app, you have that thing you've got to scroll through about 18 pages of fine print and then you just click \"Agree,\" right? Nobody reads what's in there. There could be anything in there. But in the eyes of the law, that counts as a legitimate legal binding document on your relationship with that company and what's going on with your data.</p><p>It's why I believe we need to set a national standard, even when you give your data to a company, on what they can and can't do with it, certain rights that we have over data, especially when companies are making money off of it.</p><p>And that means accountability for the big tech companies like Facebook and Google and Amazon, but also companies of any size can act in very problematic ways with our data.</p><p>So the time has come to create a body of law that will set those left and right boundaries. We can't just leave it to the companies to regulate themselves, the way we have been.</p><p>And we need leaders who can understand this. You know, we've seen several times now the spectacle of a tech executive appearing before a committee of elected officials who make it abundantly clear that they have no concept of what it is they're supposed to be regulating. We have to make sure we bring the right expertise not just in elected office but in terms of who is appointed to hold these companies accountable and establish a new and tighter framework for what they can and can't do with our personal data.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  This is Lisa Krueger. She's a former precinct captain and delegate at the Nevada convention in 2016, also a retired flight attendant. She's undecided but I believe leaning towards supporting Mayor Buttigieg.</p><p>QUESTION:  Yes.</p><p>BURNETT:  OK. There we go. Go ahead.</p><p>QUESTION:  Hi, Mayor Pete. Thank you so much for joining us tonight. Also, congratulations on all fronts. You're doing an amazing job and it's wonderful.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>You are one of the most exciting candidates that I've seen in decades. But I am curious why the senior population seems to love you so much and the younger crowd, the students, aren't quite as up to date with that.</p><p>I have an 86 year-old father and he loves you. He says \"Mayor Pete\" -- in fact, he thinks you're a doctor. He goes, \"Dr. Pete.\" I'm like, \"No, he's a mayor. He's a mayor.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, all right. He's promoted me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUESTION:  But he loves you and he's so behind you, and then I ask my 32 year-old son and he said, \"Well, I mean, yeah, he's OK.\"</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>I'm like -- so I'm just curious about that.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Yeah. So I don't know all the reasons for that. You know, even when I was running for mayor, when I was in my 20s, we found that older voters were likely to be the most supportive. I wonder, maybe, if it's partly that the longer you've been here and you've seen leaders of different ages and generations succeed and fail, maybe it demystifies, a little bit, the idea that age is the same thing as wisdom. I don't know.</p><p>What I do know is that we're going to continue reaching out to everybody. Of course, we're thrilled to have a lot of support -- and one thing that was very encouraging in those first two contests, in Iowa and New Hampshire, was that we did do well with voters of different age brackets as well as different educational experiences and different kinds of communities, urban, rural and suburban.</p><p>And I have a message for young people, too. And it's the longer you're planning to be here, the more the decisions that are about to be made will affect you personally. I am running to be the most progressive president we will have had in the last half century. But, crucially, I'm also running to do it in a way that can actually start to bring America together and unify a frighteningly divided American people.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>And that will continue to be my message as I reach out to voters of all generations.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  So, maybe a \"grass is greener\" thing. And, look, nobody -- older people may want to be younger and younger people want to be older. But a new poll out just a few hours ago showed 40 percent of voters either have some reservations or are very uncomfortable about a president under 40 years old. I can tell you, when you hit that number, it doesn't feel so great. However, you're not there yet.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>What would you say to them?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, again, I think that, look, every candidate, every person, is different. But let's not equate age with wisdom. After all, we've got the oldest president in American history and how's that working out for us right now?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>BURNETT:  So, if you were elected, or when -- if you're the nominee. you get a code name, Secret Service code name.</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Oh.</p><p>BURNETT:  Do you have any kind of thoughts on what you might want that to be?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  One of the many, many ways in which I'm very different from this president is I'm not great at thinking up nicknames. I'll...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURNETT:  That's true. He would have had several choices at the ready for this when he...</p><p>(UNKNOWN):  (OFF-MIKE)</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Yeah, I'll -- I'll leave it to others to figure that out. But that's a fun one to turn over in my mind.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURNETT:  All right. And -- and for the young voters, I do wonder, what do you say to those young voters? Does it -- do you think to yourself, \"Why is it that people my age or people in their 20s and they can look at you and look at your husband and they should have a lot in common? Why is it that they are sometimes wary?</p><p>BUTTIGIEG:  Well, again, I think everybody ought to be wary right now. I mean, so much is at stake in the decision that we are about to make. We've got to make sure we have a nominee who can win and defeat Donald Trump. And we've got to make sure we have somebody who's going to keep the promises that they are making.</p><p>And I don't blame anybody for being skeptical about my candidacy or any candidacy. But what I'll also say is that, you know, we have worked to show, not just tell, in the course of our campaign, how we can build a life in this country that will be one of belonging, that will not just be about getting the policies right but opening up a better era to just live in and be an American.</p><p>And I want to reach out to people of every background, every age group and also make clear that, whether you support me or not, I'm running to be a president for you as well.

We are live from the theater at Sahara, Las Vegas. I'm Erin Burnett.  </p><p>      We are just four days away from the Nevada caucuses, a crucial contest for Democrats in the crowded 2020 primary campaign. The candidates are making one more final pitch to Nevadans, including the undecided voters right here in our audience tonight.  </p><p>      Now, you just heard from Senator Bernie Sanders. We're going to keep it going now with one of his top competitors for the nomination, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Hello!  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Nice to see you. Thank you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Thank you. Thank you.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  I want to begin tonight with a question about the president and what's going on with the judicial system in this country, President Trump.  </p><p>      Tomorrow the leaders of an independent group of federal judges, I don't know if you all saw this, but they're going to be having an emergency meeting and they're going to be talking about President Trump's attorney general, Bill Barr, how they've been handling these politically sensitive cases like Roger Stone.  </p><p>      More than 2,000 former Justice Department officials, as you know, have called for Barr to resign. Do you think he should, Mayor?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Absolutely. This really is an emergency. It is an emergency of legitimacy in our justice system. Our justice system only works if it is immune from the interference of politicians. And obviously this president, especially now that he feels emboldened after getting away with what he got away with during the impeachment, thinks he can just lean in and ask others to do the same, and interfere.  </p><p>      And one of the first criteria for my attorney general is that she or he will understand that she or he is the lawyer for the American people and not the personal lawyer of the president of the United States.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  I want to bring in Jamie Shay in our audience, she's from Henderson. She is retired but she is volunteering this week, Mayor Buttigieg, for the Democratic Party, in the caucuses on Saturday. And she is supporting you.  </p><p>      Go ahead, Jamie.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hi, Mayor Pete, and thanks for coming tonight. You've not had a great amount of success turning around the lack of support of people of color, with your successes in Iowa and New Hampshire, your campaign has renewed excitement. But do you have a plan to gain the trust and support of more people of color as your campaign moves forward? And if so, how?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Yes. First of all, thank you for your work for the party. It's so important.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And one of the reasons I'm proud to belong to our party is that our party reflects the diversity of our country. And, of course, we're thrilled with the successes that we've had top two finishes in the first two states. But most of the racial diversity of the electorate is in the states yet to vote, beginning right here in Nevada.  </p><p>      And I view this not as a political question, but as a question of how to make sure we can lead, in order not just to win, but to deserve to win. Now the reality is voters of color have every reason to be especially skeptical of politicians, especially new politicians. When voters of color, and I'm thinking in particular of black voters who have been the most reliable and loyal constituency in the Democratic Party, feeling that politics has not delivered for them, often feeling that our party has taken their support for granted, I understand why that bar is so high.  </p><p>      Not only that, but I am from a city that has a complicated story, just like America has a complicated story. I'm proud of the things we were able to get right, cutting black unemployment, cutting black poverty in our city. We were nationally recognized for race-informed work on economic opportunity. But we've also had tremendous struggles and a lot of unfinished business, especially when it comes to racial justice and policing.  </p><p>      I'm seeking to earn the support of voters of color, first of all, by asking for it, and demonstrating that I understand that I am not entitled to anybody's support. And by laying out a vision for how the future can be a better one by proactive steps on everything from economic empowerment to reforms to our legal system that I know we must deliver in our time so that this can become a country where your race has no bearing on your health or on your wealth or on life expectancy or on your experience with law enforcement.  </p><p>      I also know that nobody is experiencing the pain of living under this administration more than voters of color. And that is why it is so important that we select a nominee who will put an end to the Trump administration, and I will continue working to demonstrate, to show, not just tell, that I am building the best campaign to do just that.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  So, how do you -- you talk about obviously Nevada and South Carolina, and these are going to be the diverse states that are going to vote. And you have made progress, but you've got a long way to go when you look at the polls with people of color. Are you worried you're running out of time?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Again, I'm worried that America is running out of time. This is not just about my political fortunes, this is about whether our country can get this right. But what I'm going to do as a candidate is use every minute and every day that remains to find voters, look them in the eye, meet them where they are, and speak specifically to the challenges that black and Latino and AAPI Americans face, that Native Americans face that are of a piece with the American experience but also unique challenges that deserve specific attention.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  So, our next question comes from Karen Keehan, she's over here, a special education teacher. She works with students who have been emotionally traumatized and she's also currently an undecided voter.  </p><p>      Karen, go ahead.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Yes. Thank you for being here tonight, I appreciate it. As an educator here in Clark County School District, I participate in mandatory drills where I lock my door, draw blinds, ask students to shut down computers. They lay down on the floor, spread around the room. I explain they must be on the floor to avoid bullets coming through the windows and doors. To be more -- and then they need to spread out to be more difficult targets. They need to also turn off any screens that they have to prevent light from attracting the attacker.  </p><p>      What is your plan for remedying the terror that has become embedded in our schools?  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  It is heartbreaking to hear you walk through that because it's in the specific way you described it, I'm thinking about terms like dispersion of targets and the difference between cover and concealment that are things that I learned as part of military training. And part of why I believed I was in the military was to serve potentially in conflict zones so that kids at schools in America would never have to have that experience.  </p><p>      And to see what we are accepting in terms of the expectation that this is just normal, that kids are going to have active shooter drills, sometimes before they're old enough to learn how to read, shows you that this country has its priorities wrong. Actually, no, Washington has its priorities wrong, because...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      You know, you look at something like universal background checks. It won't save every life. But it would make a big difference. This is something that the vast majority, not just of Democrats, but of Republicans, and gun owners already believe we ought to do. It's 80 or 90 percent support in America and we still can't get it through Washington.  </p><p>      It shows you what has to change in our political system. It shows the need for presidential leadership on this issue, because you are in such an important field. This, of all things, should not be your problem, and it certainly shouldn't be the problem of the children that you serve.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  So, this weekend, as you know, was the one-year anniversary of the Parkland shooting. And the shooter was 19 years old. He had purchased his firearm. Florida moved to change that. So now the minimum age to purchase a gun in that state is 21 years old. Several of your opponents want to do the same thing on a federal level, make it you have to be 21 years old to buy a gun legally. Do you support that?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  I would be very open to that. We have to do whatever we can to save lives. And it's not just background checks, it's not just age of purchase, it's also red flag laws. Ways to disarm domestic abusers or intervene when somebody is a danger, especially because the crisis of gun violence in our country, it's not just murder, it's suicide. And many of those suicides are preventable.  </p><p>      And I believe we also need to take action on assault weapons. Because the kinds of weaponry I trained on in the military has no business anywhere near an American school.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  I want to bring in -- sorry, it was two years to Parkland, so. I want to bring in Alex Giuliani, a law student at UNLV who is currently undecided. Alex?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hello.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Hi.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  We have seen our government neglect public education, welfare, and Social Security, because their donors have no stake in those programs. By allowing private health insurance to exist under your universal health plan, do you worry that those who can afford private insurance will lose their vested interest in maintaining the quality of national health care?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, what I'm proposing is a national health insurance program that I believe will be so good that everybody or almost everybody over time will choose it. And if I'm right, then it will eventually become the Medicare plan for our everybody.  </p><p>      But I'm not willing to assume that we're right. This is where I part ways with my friend Senator Sanders. He believes that we should require everybody to adopt that plan, whether they want to or not, when actually there's a lot of folks here in the state of Nevada, for example, culinary workers come to mind, who negotiated for good private plans, often traded wages as part of that.  </p><p>      Who are we to tell them they have to give it up? I believe that we should trust individuals to make the right choice for them. But I also believe that support will exist for this plan that I'm proposing we create. As a matter of fact, one of the things that I think is striking about the moment we're living in is we have a powerful American majority ready to support this reform, what I'm talking about, creating a public plan for everybody, just as long as we don't kick people off their private plans, then this has widespread support, which is really important at a moment when we have got to try to unify and not further polarize the American people.  </p><p>      It solves the problem. It brings us together. It's also paid for, which is more than you can say for Senator Sanders's plan. And I believe it is the best way to make sure that there is no such thing as an uninsured American.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  So, Senator Sanders actually has called the current -- the private health insurance system that we have now corrupt. That's the word that he has used. Do you also believe it is corrupt? And if you do, why do you want to leave it in place?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, again, I think that Americans should be able to decide for themselves. Now the private insurance industry attacked my plan the moment that it came out, I think because they don't want the competition. And what we're going to do is we're going to create this quality public plan, either they'll come up with something better and they'll stay in business, or they'll fail to come up with something better and they'll go out of business. Either way works.  </p><p>      The important thing is not whether the government is providing your coverage. The important thing is that you get great coverage one way or the other. And I'll leave it to the private players to figure out if they can measure up.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  So, you've said undocumented immigrants should have been able to receive coverage through Obamacare. This is something that you've said in the past, and you've addressed that in your health plan. Now let's just say you're the president of the United States. You go to Congress. You're trying to pass the bill. And that becomes the roadblock, that you're just not able to get it through if you're going to provide access for undocumented immigrants. Would you be willing to put it aside, or is that something you will not drop?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  I'm going to fight to make sure that anybody can participate on this plan, because if we are excluding people from the ability to get in on health insurance, we're not just harming them, we're punishing ourselves. We become a less healthy country. More people will be in emergency rooms because they can't get the preventative treatment that they need up front. And more people will be sick.  </p><p>      Nobody wins when that is the case. And so I will do everything in my power to make sure that when we deliver this plan, we do it in a way that everybody can participate.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Is it fair to say, just to be clear, that health insurance for undocumented immigrants is a deal-breaker for you?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  I can't game out every amendment or poison pill, every change they're going to try to make to bring the package together. What I'll say is that that is one of the pillars of the plan as I see it.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  All right. I want to bring in Donald Fagan. He's a student at UNLV, currently undecided. So go ahead, Donald.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hi, Mayor Pete. Candidates such as Senator Sanders have criticized your campaign support from billionaires. Many Americans feel like their voices are often disregarded in favor of those with larger wallets. How can the average voter be certain that you will represent their interests first? And will you pledge to make overturning Citizens United and removing money from politics a day one priority as president?  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  So, the answer to your second question is, yes, I will. Citizens United is a disaster for our democracy. And if what it takes to fix Citizens United is a constitutional amendment, then I think that's exactly what constitutional amendments are for. Let's not be afraid and let's launch that fight on day one.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And as far as defending the interests of those who aren't wealthy, I have the smallest wallet of anybody running for president right now. They did a ranking in Forbes magazine. And I'm officially the least wealthy presidential candidate right now. So when I'm talking about the interest of middle class, I'm also talking about our own. And I got into politics, I got into campaigning in order to be part of solutions for folks like my neighbors, folks like my own family.  </p><p>      And I also believe that at a time like this, we've got to get help from everybody who is willing to support our bold vision for the future. My campaign was driven and is driven by hundreds of thousands of individuals who have donated. As a matter of fact, if you're watching right now, you can go to peteforamerica.com, send in $5 or $10, because that is the lifeblood of our campaign.  </p><p>      But if there are some people a lot wealthier than I am who want to be part of that, who want to chip in, great, because we're getting ready to go up against Donald Trump and his allies, who have been raising hand over fist in order so much money in order to hold on to their grip on power.  </p><p>      And my campaign is one that's never going to define itself by whose help we reject. My campaign is about belonging. It's about bringing everybody into the picture and standing side by side with everybody determined to make sure that we end the Donald Trump presidency and deliver a better future for Americans.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  So, when you said you want to not be defined by who you reject, last hour, I don't know if you heard Senator Sanders, but he would not commit to accepting money from Michael Bloomberg if Michael Bloomberg is not the Democratic nominee. Right, he has pledged to help whoever is.  </p><p>      Would you take his money and his support if you are the nominee?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Sure. As a matter of fact...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Look, right now, obviously I'm competing against Mayor Bloomberg. We have, I think, different approaches and different visions. But his philanthropy supported a million dollar effort in our community to help low-income people get transportation to go to work. I'm not going to reject that help because it came from a very wealthy person. This is the moment to bring everybody that we can into this effort.  </p><p>      And I promise exactly one thing in return for any contribution, which is we're going to take that contribution and use it to go beat Donald Trump.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  So, you know, you talk about something he did in your community, but obviously Amy Klobuchar has said Bloomberg is, her words, hiding behind his ad spending. Elizabeth Warren says he has bought his way on to the debate stage. Bernie Sanders has accused him of trying to buy the entire election.  </p><p>      Pretty simple question, yes or no. Do you think Michael Bloomberg is trying to buy the Democratic nomination for president?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Yes. Yes. I mean, what else do you call it? What else do you call it when you dip into your endless reserves of millions and billions and don't go through the process of campaigning in states like Nevada or Iowa or New Hampshire, humbling yourself, going into the diners and the backyards, looking eye to eye to voters?  </p><p>      Look, my campaign wouldn't exist if all that mattered was how much money and fame you start with and how you get yourself on the air. We built this thing from nothing. And we built it by having those conversations and letting voters pick apart what you have to say.  </p><p>      And to try to just go around that by throwing colossal sums of money on television, shows you what's wrong with our system. And I also believe it's not the best way to pick our nominee or the next president.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  So, I want to bring in Kristen Makhathini now. She is a realtor and she is from Henderson, Nevada. She previously had supported Senator Kamala Harris. So she is now undecided. Go ahead with your question, please.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Thanks. Hi, Mayor Pete, thanks for spending time with us tonight. As a fellow Episcopalian and Christian, it is very frustrating to hear so much of the public discourse that assumes that being a Christian equals evangelical Christian conservatism. My Episcopalian belief and Christianity teaches me the values of scripture, tradition, and reason. I am a Democrat and a Christian, you can be both.  </p><p>      How can you use your voice as president to share this viewpoint more broadly when the right thinks they own it?  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, first of all, I'm glad to be with a fellow Episcopalian. And I agree. It starts with sending the message that God does not belong to a political party. And...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And by the way, you know, it's also very important to make clear that the presidency and the Constitution, and my presidency will belong to people of every religion and of no religion equally. This is not about imposing my faith on anybody.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      But I have got to say, like you, I find a message in scripture that is very different from what the political right seems to want to talk about all the time, a lot about poverty, a lot about compassion, a lot about humility that I seek in my imperfect way to live up to, and that does have implications for how I will approach public office.  </p><p>      And the time has come to send a message that people of faith have a choice. And if you belong to a Christian tradition or any moral or religious tradition that emphasizes making yourself useful to the oppressed and standing with and identifying with the prisoner, and welcoming the stranger, the stranger by the way is another word for immigrant. Yes that has implications in public life and I won't be afraid to talk about how my positions are informed by my faith.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  So, you know, to the point you talk about, about God not belonging to any kind of political party, at the last CNN town hall, you said if your faith calls upon you to help the marginalized, those who are afflicted, to comfort -- to comfort people, to strive for humility and decency, as the Christian faith does, and then I quote you, \"then I just can't imagine that that requires of you that you be anywhere near this president.\"  </p><p>      Do you think it is impossible to be a Christian and support President Trump?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, I'm not going to tell other Christians how to be Christians. But I will say, I cannot find any compatibility between the way this president conducts himself and anything that I find in scripture. Now I guess that's my interpretation. But I think that's a lot of people's interpretations. And that interpretation deserves a voice.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  All right, we are going to be back with more from presidential candidate, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, right after this break.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  And welcome back to Sahara Las Vegas. We're here with Democratic presidential candidate, the former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, for a live town hall.  </p><p>      So one thing that people might not know about you is that you speak eight languages. Am I missing one?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Depends what you mean by speak. Some -- some better than others.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  OK. OK. All right, but among them, Norwegian and Maltese...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Uh-huh.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  ... which has a lot of Xs in it and all kinds of things. So, you know, I was thinking, like could you say something in one of them? And I'm like, here we are, and I didn't want to make it, you know, too easy, but something like, I don't know, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas?  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Oh, wow. Yeah, let's see. In Maltese, it would be something like (UNTRANSLATED) I think. A bunch of Maltese people are going to like tweet me how I got that wrong.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  There's no winning on this one, by the way.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Yeah, and Norwegian (UNTRANSLATED) I don't know. Anyone Norwegians here? I don't know.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  You couldn't get immediately...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  As far as everybody here knows, that was right.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  OK.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  I hope.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  So, which of them -- because, I mean, when people hear eight languages, I mean, most of us speak one or we struggle to kind of comprehend a second. What was the hardest to learn?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Maltese is actually really hard, because it's this mix. So my father emigrated from Malta. It's one of the smallest countries in the world. It's got its own language. And it's a mix of everything -- it's a Semitic language. It's got parts of Arabic in it. There's a bunch of Italian and some English going on.  </p><p>      Like, the basic way to say hello in Maltese is to say, \"All right?\" And thank you in Maltese is \"Thank you.\" And -- but you also say \"Grazie,\" which is Italian. It's like a whole -- but, you know, the languages that are the most different from English are obviously the most challenging. And you don't get to practice a lot of them.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  No, I know, like I say, it's all those X's. Is there a time, though, that you can think where knowing one of these languages helped you help someone else?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Yeah. I remember the day the travel ban went into effect. And we were in Houston -- at the time I was seeking to be DNC chair and decided to go down and participate in the protests on the travel ban. And there was a rumor going that an Iranian family had been caught up in the situation that -- you know, they were being caught at customs and weren't being allowed through because of the ban.  </p><p>      Anyway, we were there at the terminal. And there was this amazing scene. It was a protest that had been organized almost on the spot by a young woman who was a server at a Carrabba's. It showed you the power of online organizing. And within a few hours, hundreds of people were at the airport, and we were -- they were calling for the travel ban to be lifted.  </p><p>      And then there was a stay, I think, in court. And so this family started coming through. And they were being mobbed by TV reporters, and I realized that they might not have had any idea of why there were all these protesters, cameras, or anything. So I went up.  </p><p>      And I learned -- to go to -- to deploy to Afghanistan, I learned Dari, which is kind of like Farsi, which is the language of Iran. So I see this man emerge, kind of Middle Eastern appearance. His wife is in a hijab. They got three or four little kids. A bunch of suitcases. They look exhausted.  </p><p>      And I went up to them and started trying to ask, you know, are you OK? Do you understand what's happening? Do you need any help? Everybody is here to support you. And the more I tried to say this in Farsi, the clearer it became that he -- he didn't understand me at all.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      And then I realized he was an Arabic speaker. And I studied Arabic in college. I'm not very good at it, but I'd studied it. And had this conversation -- he had no idea what was going on. He was actually Jordanian, and he just wanted to go home.  </p><p>      And meanwhile, there -- because I'm wearing a tie, the reporters from one of the local TV stations think that I'm his lawyer and they start interviewing me. And one of them was from Telemundo, which was in Spanish, and they were asking me to try to ask him questions in Arabic, which I'm not that good at, and they were asking me in Spanish. And it was a real mess.  </p><p>      But in the end, I just realized there was this crowd chanting and cheering, and they didn't know what was going on, so I just grabbed the luggage cart to help him and his wife, and just got them out of there to the garage where his cousin was waiting to pick him up.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Got him where he was going.  </p><p>      All right, I want to bring in Dave Comarow. He is a retired patent attorney from here in Las Vegas. And you say you're undecided, as well. Go ahead with your question, Dave.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Mayor Buttigieg, welcome to our humble little town.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Great to be here.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I hate that anybody has to ask this question, but, Mayor Pete, if you do become the nominee, how are you going to deal with the almost certain flood of personal attacks based on your sexual orientation?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, it'll happen, and I'm ready. You know, when I decided to come out in...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Thanks. When I decided to come out in -- it was during a re-election year in South Bend. I was up for mayor. I decided, after my deployment, that I was just too old to not have a personal life and made that personal decision, not knowing what the effect on my career would be or on being able to win.  </p><p>      Mike Pence was the governor of Indiana then. And it was tough sledding for -- as it still is for many LGBTQ people in the state where I come from. And I just decided I had to do it. And what wound up happening was that I got re-elected with 80 percent of the vote.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And what that tells me was that, at the end of the day, people were ready to judge me based on the job I was doing for them. But I also think it's important to recognize that change on these issues and acceptance and equality, even though it's got a long way to go, it's also happened at a pace that a lot of people are struggling with.  </p><p>      And I think for those who haven't quite found their way all the way to the right side of history, it's important to beckon them in the right direction. I remember not long after I started dating Chasten, and I ran into a woman I knew in South Bend, older generation, a little more conservative. And she kind of gave me this mischievous pat on the arm, and she said, \"I met your friend the other day, and he is wonderful.\"  </p><p>      You know, that could have been a moment to give her a lecture on the difference between, you know, your friend and your partner. But what I realized was, in her way, she was kind of inching toward the direction of acceptance, she felt good about it, she felt good that she was moving in that way. And I think in a moment like this, it's really important that we find those who are maybe not quite there yet, and help them get there instead of clubbing them over the head and telling them they're bad people until they see it just the right way. And I think that's a really important part of where our politics needs to go.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  So, last week, Rush Limbaugh made homophobic comments about you and he said that America is not ready, he doesn't think, for a gay president. Now, then Limbaugh -- I don't know if you know -- but he gave this whole story today that President Trump told him don't apologize...  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Oh, great.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  ... for saying anything he said. Publicly, though, Trump says that he would not have a problem supporting a gay candidate. Do you take him at his word?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, not if he's sending out his supporters to talk in this way. And, look, I mean, the idea of the likes of Rush Limbaugh or Donald Trump lecturing anybody on family values...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      I mean, I'm sorry, but one thing about my marriage is it's never involved me having to send hush money to a porn star after cheating on my spouse with him or her.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      So they want to debate family values? Let's debate family values. I'm ready.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  All right. Our next question is from Nick Elefantis. He is a high school government teacher. He is from Las Vegas and also undecided. Nicholas, please.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Good evening, Mayor Buttigieg. It's widely acknowledged that the public education system in Nevada and across the nation is broken. Part of it is due to the attrition of teachers. We're faced with low salaries and crippling student debt. What can be done to help keep hard-working, highly qualified teachers in their job, instead of looking for the door?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Yeah.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      You may see Chasten, who's right next to you, is nodding along, because he's a teacher with high student debt and who has dealt with low compensation. So we as a household -- you know, we understand what you're going through.  </p><p>      And it is so important that we recruit and motivate and empower teachers to be in that profession. It's such an important profession. And yet, as we talked about earlier, teachers are now being expected to convert into highly trained armed guards if there's a threat to the classroom. You're finding part of your job automated by the over-reliance on test administration.  </p><p>      And then there's the simple fact that teachers are not paid enough. We can do something about that. And we should do something about that with federal funds.  </p><p>      So I'm proposing that we triple the funds going into Title I in particular. Those are dollars that go into low-income districts, which is where having a great teacher is especially impactful, because low-income students, and disproportionately black and brown students, will perform better and earn more in the future, be more economically empowered if they have the best teachers.  </p><p>      We also, I think, need to lift up the profession as a whole. I'm proposing we create a...  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Yeah. I'm proposing that we create an Education Access Corps. The idea would be to link up high-quality teaching programs across the country. And if you participate in them, and then commit to teaching in one of those Title I programs, you have a portable teaching license you could take anywhere, and you get your student loans forgiven, if you do have that debt, in exchange for agreeing to be a teacher in such an important area.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Bottom line is, as I like to say is that if we respected our teachers just a little more like we do our soldiers and paid our teachers just a little more like we do our doctors, this country would be a better place for all of us.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  So, you were talking about federal funding and what you would do with federal funding. Elizabeth Warren, some of your opponents, have called for complete freeze, no federal funding for new charter schools. Do you think that makes sense?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, I think that we need to not have a meat cleaver approach on this, but insist that any charter schools are set up in a way that will benefit traditional public schools, too. It can't just be up to whether you win a lottery that you have opportunity.  </p><p>      We've got to make sure -- charters can have a role in piloting new ideas or innovations, but they have to be subject to the same accountability and the same scrutiny as traditional public schools. And they should be funded at a comparable level.  </p><p>      So if we're talking about federal funds being used in a way that would tilt the scale, and then a charter school that gets more money says, see, we got better results, but it's just because they had more resources, that's not fair.  </p><p>      What we've got to do is make sure that any innovations that are going on in the space of education go in a way that would ultimately reach students at every kind of traditional public school in the country. And I neglected to mention one other thing, talking about teachers and how important that job is. There are a lot of people in school buildings and in classrooms, teachers, but also paraprofessionals and other educators and support staff who are also very much underpaid, and it's important that we, I think, speak to that, as well. I meant to mention that.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Johnathan Carter is also a teacher. He's a high school English teacher, part-time college instructor here in Las Vegas, currently undecided, but I believe, Jonathan, leaning towards Mayor Pete. I don't know how he's done tonight for you, but that's what you were I think coming in the door. Go ahead with your question.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Hopefully I can bring you across, then.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Good evening, Mayor.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Hi.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  The president of the United States has been accused of not always telling the truth about some of the most basic issues concerning Americans.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  That's diplomatic.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I try. If you are in a debate with him, what will be your approach to ensuring that his mistruths do not go unchecked while still communicating your own vision for the country and not allowing yourself to become nothing more than a fact-checker?  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  You know, it's a great point. I think this president is kind of like one of those Chinese fingertraps, you know, the harder you pull, the more you get stuck in them. Because he has this way of commanding our attention by doing something outrageous or telling a lie. And if he -- if he tells a lie, you've got to correct it. If he does something racist, you got to confront it. If he insults a war hero, you got to stand up to it. And yet the moment you do that, you're starting to get sucked into his game.  </p><p>      And so I believe the discipline that's going to be required of any nominee, and the discipline I plan to bring to that debate stage, is to be ready very quickly to correct his lies and to confront his wrongdoing, but to put it in its place quickly enough that we deny him his famous ability to change the subject.  </p><p>      Because the real subject of this election is our lives. And that's a winning issue for us. We're the ones trying to get you a raise. We're the ones ready to deliver paid family leave, serious about climate change, prepared to do something about gun violence, standing up for workers and unions. On the things that are going to affect whether our lives go better in the future, I believe we've got all the best answers.  </p><p>      I think he knows that, and that's why he needs us arguing about whatever crazy nonsense he can use to dominate the news. And so my overall philosophy on how to defeat this president, especially how to debate this president, is, yeah, you've got to stand up to him sometimes, but the less we're talking about him, the more we're talking about you, and that's how we're going to win.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  You know, it's amazing how many people just in casual conversation talk about this, the debates, and how they imagine the debates between Trump and whomever the Democratic nominee is. So you touched on this a little bit, but how would you on a debate stage balance between responding to him, whether -- whatever it is he's saying or sometimes, as you mentioned, it could be five or six topics in one answer, responding and not letting him dominate the conversation?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, I think it's to remember what the election is about. I believe that every election is about the voter asking one question:  How is my life going to be different if you're president instead of you?  </p><p>      And when it comes to the things that are going to decide our lives and our children's lives going better or worse, we have not only a strong message, we have the majority of the American people with us.  </p><p>      You know, Democrats are so used to being in a defensive crouch politically, we forget this sometimes, but the American people are with us on wages, with us on health, even with us on guns and with us on immigration reform, issues where we used to hesitate to say what we really believe. The American people are already there.  </p><p>      We've just got to make sure that we keep the focus on those basic questions. And I will maintain the discipline to keep that at the center of this election and of the debates themselves.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  And so how do you reach voters -- because you're going to want some of these voters to listen to you, to possibly vote for you -- who get their news from sources that are very friendly to the president and may not be aware of the fact that he may be saying something false?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Yeah, well, that's why I go on some of those networks. It's a controversial decision. I took some heat in my party. But in addition to appearing on networks like CNN, you're going to see me on networks like Fox News. Not because I'm under any illusions about their objectivity, but how can -- in a world where people are starting to get their own information from their own sources and even have their own facts, how can we be surprised if somebody's not responding to my message if they've literally never even heard it?  </p><p>      How can we be mad at them for believing a lie, if it's the only thing that ever got to them? And those tendencies are only going to increase with these social media bubbles. That's why I think it's very important to pop those bubbles, to cross through different media, and I'm doing it as a candidate, I'll do it as president, too.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  So, our next question is from Brian Linsey. He owns a moving and a storage company here in Las Vegas. He's currently leaning towards supporting you, Mayor Buttigieg. Go ahead, Brian.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Good evening, Mayor Pete. Good afternoon, Chasten. Welcome to Las Vegas to both of you.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Thanks.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Measures to enact legislation to protect our climate and natural resources invariably run into GOP resistance, typically prevented as, \"This will cost us jobs\" or \"This will hurt the economy.\"  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Yeah.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  How do you protect our climate and protect our economy from job loss simultaneously?  </p><p>      And would you -- would you support a specific legislative proposal for a carbon tax and rebate?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  I will. That's the answer to the last part. Because I believe it would play a very important role in making sure that our economy and the prices in our economy accurately reflect the true cost of businesses as usual.  </p><p>      Remember, the most costly thing we could possibly do is to stay on the path that we're on. And that's not just a moral cost; that's a dollars and cents cost because the catastrophic effects of climate change, which we're already beginning to see, are only going to increase.  </p><p>      So the idea of a carbon tax and rebate, or a carbon fee and dividend, whatever you want to call it, is that we assess a fee on the price of carbon. But, at least in my plan, we would rebate that right back out to the American people.  </p><p>      And I'd do it on a progressive basis so that most low and middle-income people would be made more than whole. This is not about taking money out of the economy. This is about making sure that the economy accurately reflects the cost of carbon pollution and climate change. And that's part but only part of how we're going to meet these needs.  </p><p>      Now, you're right, there has been a lot of partisan resistance to doing the right thing, whether it's climate, whether it's protections for federal lands, for air and for water. But here's another example, kind of, like what we were talking about earlier with guns, where, actually, there's a lot more agreement among the American people than there is on the floor in Congress.  </p><p>      Right now, most Americans, including in conservative states, believe in protecting public lands, believe in making sure we have clean air and water.  </p><p>      Now, there are some who have been made to feel like they are part of the problem, if you're working in certain kinds of industry, for example. Ironically, those are some of the very people whose skills we will need to recruit in the next generation of those industries that have to be carbon-free.  </p><p>      There is no question there will be a transition. And I'm proposing that we invest over $200 billion in supporting workers through that transition. But we also estimate that we will create at least 3 million net new jobs by taking the action we must as a country to mobilize and fight climate change.  </p><p>      And some of these jobs are -- might sound a little new-fangled, high-tech green jobs. A lot of them are jobs that are perfectly easy to understand right now. I'm talking about building trades. I'm talking about union carpenters and electrical workers and insulators and glaziers that we're going to need just to get our buildings to where they will have to be retrofitted for -- for us to stay ahead of the climate challenge.  </p><p>      So we've got to break this idea that we're choosing between doing the right thing for our climate and doing the right thing for our economy. The only way forward, for our economy, for our future, for our children and for our climate, is to step up, come together, deal with carbon pollution and lead the world in doing something about it.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  So, earlier tonight, Senator Sanders was talking about the Green New Deal, which he supports. And one of the key tenets of the Green New Deal is a federal jobs guarantee, which he happens to also support. Do you support a federal jobs guarantee?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, I want everybody to have an opportunity to work, but I wouldn't structure it in the same way that Senator Sanders is talking about.  </p><p>      What I would do is make sure not only that we're supporting everyone's ability to get training for jobs that are growing -- I mean, remember, we have shortages right now in key areas, from direct care workers to -- to educators.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  That's true.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  But, also, I'm proposing that we create a national service program, a million paid voluntary national service opportunities a year, to help get people that experience of working on something important. In fact, a big part of it would be a climate core, and then other parts of it could be decided by local communities, so that we set everybody on the path to success, whether they're going to ultimately go to college or whether they're going directly into the workforce.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  All right. We're going to take a very brief break. When we come back, we'll have more with Mayor Pete Buttigieg, right after this.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      (COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  And welcome back. We are live from Las Vegas with former mayor Pete Buttigieg.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      So I want to ask you about something else that happened this morning. And I know you're out on the campaign trail, but I know there's no way you missed this, President Trump commuting the sentence of the former Illinois governor and \"Celebrity Apprentice\" contestant...  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      (BOOING)  </p><p>      ... Rod Blagojevich, the former New York police commissioner Bernie Kerik, Michael Milken, the financier, and a former NFL owner.  </p><p>      My question, though, is who would be at the top of your list for possible presidential pardons?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  I would start with nonviolent drug offenders caught up in the racial disparities of the failed war on drugs.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      I mean, look, I actually think presidential clemency power can be an important part of how we de-carcerate a country that is shockingly over-incarcerated.  </p><p>      I mean, if incarceration made a country safe, we'd be the safest country in the world, and we're not. It's bad enough just by the numbers, but when you add to that the racial disparities of who has been incarcerated often for nonviolent offenses, or those who have aged out of being any threat and could contribute in their communities.  </p><p>      That's where I would be paying my attention. This president -- it seems like he's never met a corrupt politician he didn't like.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      It's one thing about him that actually is bipartisan, is his fondness for corrupt politicians.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      And it's just, to me, the absolute wrong direction to even think about that pardon power.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  I want to bring in Chelsea Johnson. She's a student at Nevada State College who is undecided tonight.  </p><p>      Go ahead, Chelsea.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hi, Mayor Pete.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Hi.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  I was wondering what you plan to do on protecting everyday citizens' valuable data that has been collected and sold by social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  What a great question. And it's an example of one of the issues that the next president is going to face that hadn't even been thought about, really. a few years or decades ago.  </p><p>      And we don't have a national policy on data security or on data privacy. Different states have them. So basically, we have 50 different policies across the country. And not only that, we're relying on very outdated legal protections.  </p><p>      Just think about this. When you download an app, you have that thing you've got to scroll through about 18 pages of fine print and then you just click \"Agree,\" right? Nobody reads what's in there. There could be anything in there. But in the eyes of the law, that counts as a legitimate legal binding document on your relationship with that company and what's going on with your data.  </p><p>      It's why I believe we need to set a national standard, even when you give your data to a company, on what they can and can't do with it, certain rights that we have over data, especially when companies are making money off of it.  </p><p>      And that means accountability for the big tech companies like Facebook and Google and Amazon, but also companies of any size can act in very problematic ways with our data.  </p><p>      So the time has come to create a body of law that will set those left and right boundaries. We can't just leave it to the companies to regulate themselves, the way we have been.  </p><p>      And we need leaders who can understand this. You know, we've seen several times now the spectacle of a tech executive appearing before a committee of elected officials who make it abundantly clear that they have no concept of what it is they're supposed to be regulating. We have to make sure we bring the right expertise not just in elected office but in terms of who is appointed to hold these companies accountable and establish a new and tighter framework for what they can and can't do with our personal data.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  This is Lisa Krueger. She's a former precinct captain and delegate at the Nevada convention in 2016, also a retired flight attendant. She's undecided but I believe leaning towards supporting Mayor Buttigieg.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Yes.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  OK. There we go. Go ahead.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  Hi, Mayor Pete. Thank you so much for joining us tonight. Also, congratulations on all fronts. You're doing an amazing job and it's wonderful.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      You are one of the most exciting candidates that I've seen in decades. But I am curious why the senior population seems to love you so much and the younger crowd, the students, aren't quite as up to date with that.  </p><p>      I have an 86 year-old father and he loves you. He says \"Mayor Pete\" -- in fact, he thinks you're a doctor. He goes, \"Dr. Pete.\" I'm like, \"No, he's a mayor. He's a mayor.\"  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, all right. He's promoted me.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">QUESTION</emphasis>:  But he loves you and he's so behind you, and then I ask my 32 year-old son and he said, \"Well, I mean, yeah, he's OK.\"  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      I'm like -- so I'm just curious about that.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Yeah. So I don't know all the reasons for that. You know, even when I was running for mayor, when I was in my 20s, we found that older voters were likely to be the most supportive. I wonder, maybe, if it's partly that the longer you've been here and you've seen leaders of different ages and generations succeed and fail, maybe it demystifies, a little bit, the idea that age is the same thing as wisdom. I don't know.  </p><p>      What I do know is that we're going to continue reaching out to everybody. Of course, we're thrilled to have a lot of support -- and one thing that was very encouraging in those first two contests, in Iowa and New Hampshire, was that we did do well with voters of different age brackets as well as different educational experiences and different kinds of communities, urban, rural and suburban.  </p><p>      And I have a message for young people, too. And it's the longer you're planning to be here, the more the decisions that are about to be made will affect you personally. I am running to be the most progressive president we will have had in the last half century. But, crucially, I'm also running to do it in a way that can actually start to bring America together and unify a frighteningly divided American people.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      And that will continue to be my message as I reach out to voters of all generations.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  So, maybe a \"grass is greener\" thing. And, look, nobody -- older people may want to be younger and younger people want to be older. But a new poll out just a few hours ago showed 40 percent of voters either have some reservations or are very uncomfortable about a president under 40 years old. I can tell you, when you hit that number, it doesn't feel so great. However, you're not there yet.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      What would you say to them?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, again, I think that, look, every candidate, every person, is different. But let's not equate age with wisdom. After all, we've got the oldest president in American history and how's that working out for us right now?  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  So, if you were elected, or when -- if you're the nominee. you get a code name, Secret Service code name.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Oh.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Do you have any kind of thoughts on what you might want that to be?  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  One of the many, many ways in which I'm very different from this president is I'm not great at thinking up nicknames. I'll...  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  That's true. He would have had several choices at the ready for this when he...  </p><p>      (UNKNOWN):  (OFF-MIKE)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Yeah, I'll -- I'll leave it to others to figure that out. But that's a fun one to turn over in my mind.  </p><p>      (LAUGHTER)  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  All right. And -- and for the young voters, I do wonder, what do you say to those young voters? Does it -- do you think to yourself, \"Why is it that people my age or people in their 20s and they can look at you and look at your husband and they should have a lot in common? Why is it that they are sometimes wary?  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BUTTIGIEG</emphasis>:  Well, again, I think everybody ought to be wary right now. I mean, so much is at stake in the decision that we are about to make. We've got to make sure we have a nominee who can win and defeat Donald Trump. And we've got to make sure we have somebody who's going to keep the promises that they are making.  </p><p>      And I don't blame anybody for being skeptical about my candidacy or any candidacy. But what I'll also say is that, you know, we have worked to show, not just tell, in the course of our campaign, how we can build a life in this country that will be one of belonging, that will not just be about getting the policies right but opening up a better era to just live in and be an American.  </p><p>      And I want to reach out to people of every background, every age group and also make clear that, whether you support me or not, I'm running to be a president for you as well. And I will support you in your life, no matter who you supported in this election.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BURNETT</emphasis>:  Well, we thank you very much for your time tonight, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      Coming up next, presidential candidate Senator Amy Klobuchar. She will join Anderson Cooper. We will be back on this stage and we will be back right after this.  </p><p>      (APPLAUSE)  </p><p>      END   </p></bodyText></section></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7X-38W1-JDPT-T2G3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><publicationInfo><publicationName>CQ Transcriptions</publicationName><bodyText><p>All materials herein are protected by United States copyright law and may not be reproduced, distributed, transmitted, displayed, published or broadcast without the prior written permission of CQ Transcriptions.

Stevens said, \"Anticipating a renewed push for antitrust investigations in Washington, Big Tech has apparently manufactured David to vouch for Goliath. While claiming to be a genuine advocate for small business in Washington, 3C has very close ties to tech giants like Google and Amazon and advocates for their interests at every turn. Journalists and policymakers need to be aware that 3C's real goal is to undermine the push for greater tech regulation by arguing Big Tech is good for small business.\"</p><p>Founded just a year ago, 3C already has met with more than 50 members of Congress, filed at least seven official comments at regulatory agencies, and sent at least two representatives to testify before Congress. The new group has published a raft of materials paintinga rosy picture of the tech giants, complete with quotes from small business owners heaping praise on them.</p><p>CfA's review of 3C's origins, structure, and activities, however, strongly suggests that 3C is little more than a front for the technology platforms themselves. For example, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Square are members of 3C's \"Partner Council,\" which, the group states, provide \"general support\" for its programs for small business owners, suggesting they're the driving financial force behind the group's lobbying efforts.</p><p>Furthermore, 3C isn't run by small business owners. Rather, a number of its executives and consultants have significant past experience working with the big technology companies to secure favorable government policies. This includes 3C's President, Jake Ward, who previously led a Google-funded trade group called the Application Developers Alliance.</p><p>Creating pro-small business front groups is a tactic Google, in particular, has used before.
