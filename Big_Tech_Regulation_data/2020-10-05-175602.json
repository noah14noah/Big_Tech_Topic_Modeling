He mentions that Google, Red Hat, Blackberry and Earthlink just sent some comments[2] [PDF] to the FTC and the Department of Justice asking for[3] an investigation into what they politely call patent assertion entities, or PAEs. So have the Computer and Communications Industry Association [Comments, PDF[4]] and the National Restaurant Association [Comments, PDF[5]] also asked for such scrutiny. </p><p><br/>But the most important part of the Google et al. request, to me, hasn't yet been highlighted in the media reports I've seen. What they are asking for is not just an investigation into trolls, but into active companies outsourcing their patent enforcement *to* PAEs. And what they are asking for is whether such activities in some instances can rise to the level of antitrust violations.<br/> That is something I've wondered about for a while -- why didn't regulatory bodies see what is happening to Android, for example, with all the old guard working apparently together to try to crush it? One thing that Microsoft and Nokia have done, for example, is outsource patent enforcement to MOSAID and other patent enforcement-style non-practicing entities. (If you recall, Google filed a compliant[6] specifically about that with the EU Commission last summer.) The new comments call the new outsourcing to trolls patent privateering, which they say is designed for assymetric patent warfare -- meaning the defendant's business is at stake, but the outsourcing company's business isn't, and the troll has nothing to lose, because it has no business. <br/> So, finally, the day I've been waiting for begins.<br/> I've taken the time to do the comments as text for us, because the footnotes alone are a treasure trove of resources. So let's take a look at the antitrust issues and see if we can learn something about antitrust law that way.<br/><br/><br/><br/> Jump To Comments[7]<br/> Groklaw has a permanent page on Legal Research, with various categories represented, and one is antitrust law[8], including Andy Updegrove's extensive collection of resources[9] as well as the FTC antitrust guidelines[10], including a page on antitrust laws[11]. So that's our foundation for how it all works. <br/> Keep in mind that just as in fashion, there can be changes in antitrust law, depending on the administration. During the Bush years, antitrust was basically on life support, at best. Folks did as they pleased, pretty much. Now, there's been a shift and regulators are more active. But antitrust is a high bar, nonetheless, but that's not the only angle the FTC use: The Federal Trade Commission Act bans \"unfair methods of competition\" and \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\" The Supreme Court has said that all violations of the Sherman Act also violate the FTC Act. Thus, although the FTC does not technically enforce the Sherman Act, it can bring cases under the FTC Act against the same kinds of activities that violate the Sherman Act. The FTC Act also reaches other practices that harm competition, but that may not fit neatly into categories of conduct formally prohibited by the Sherman Act. Only the FTC brings cases under the FTC Act. Ah. Unfair methods of competition. That sounds promising, at least. And here's why[12] it makes sense that the comments were sent to both the FTC and the DOJ, from the FTC's page on enforcement:Both the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division enforce the federal antitrust laws. In some respects their authorities overlap, but in practice the two agencies complement each other. Over the years, the agencies have developed expertise in particular industries or markets. For example, the FTC devotes most of its resources to certain segments of the economy, including those where consumer spending is high: health care, pharmaceuticals, professional services, food, energy, and certain high-tech industries like computer technology and Internet services. Before opening an investigation, the agencies consult with one another to avoid duplicating efforts. In this guide, \"the agency\" means either the FTC or DOJ, whichever is conducting the antitrust investigation.<br/>According to IAM's most recent tally[13] in February, by the way, the owners of the 10 biggest active US patent portfolios (in order): Samsung, IBM, Canon, Panasonic, Sony, Toshiba, Hewlett-Packard, Hitachi, Microsoft<br/>and Intel. So the problem isn't just trolls. Just saying.<br/> Tim Worstall at Forbes claims[14] that PAEs are good for us, maybe, a natural division of labor, so that companies can outsource to specialists and keep doing what they do best in house. First, the article doesn't forget to mention this, but it answers it by noting that the Commission says the putative rewards are uncertain and outweighed by the negative impact. <br/> The real issue raised by the comments, however, isn't whether the pluses outweigh the negatives; it's whether companies that are in business to sell products but outsource patent enforcement to trolls are violating US antitrust laws: II. Patent Transfers To PAEs Create Additional Perils<br/>An accelerating phenomenon threatens to exacerbate the above-described harms and poses additional perils to competition and innovation. Although operating companies have consistently raised concerns about PAEs,53[15] some such companies increasingly employ PAEs as patent enforcement surrogates. These operating companies sell or assign pieces of (or entire) patent portfolios to PAEs that then assert the acquired patents against the transferring company's rivals. Put differently, although operating companies previously funded certain PAE activities and served as a well-spring for patents PAEs enforce,54[16] operating companies are increasingly employing PAEs to strategic ends in new and evolving relationships.<br/> The evolving relationships between operating companies and PAEs pose numerous distinct threats to innovation, competition and consumers. We describe several noteworthy harms below: (i) how transfers from operating companies to PAEs can harm innovation and raise rivals' costs by altering enforcement incentives; (ii) how patent outsourcing arrangements can foster exploitation by facilitating evasion of no royalty stacking commitments in some industries; and (iii) how contractual arrangements between operating companies and PAEs can further exclusionary ends. Unfortunately, these are but a few examples of the many ways operating companies and PAEs interact that may implicate competition policy and our nation's antitrust laws.55[17]<br/><br/>_________ 53[18] See , e.g., Tim Frain, Nokia Response to Patent Standards Workshop, Project No., P11-1204, at 5 (July 8, 2011), (\"From a policy and regulator's perspective, the role and impact of NPEs on legitimate enterprise perhaps deserves more careful attention.\"), available at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ftc.gov/os/comments/patentstandardsworkshop/00032-60891.pdf;\">http://www.ftc.gov/os/comments/patentstandardsworkshop/00032-60891.pdf;</url> Horacio Gutierrez, The SHIELD Act: Another Step in the Patent Reform Discussion, Technet (Feb. 27, 2013),       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_on_the_issues/archive/2013/02/27/the-shield-act-another-step-in-the-patent-\">http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_on_the_issues/archive/2013/02/27/the-shield-act-another-step-in-the-patent-</url> reform-discussion.aspx (\"Microsoft is harassed by PAEs as much as anyone in our industry: at any given moment, we face as many as 60 PAE suits, comprising the vast majority of patent cases brought against us.\").<br/><br/>#ref5454 See generally Tom Ewing Robin Feldman, The Giants Among Us, 2012 STAN.

Certain transfers from operating companies to PAEs threaten to evade FRAND commitments even when, consistent with In re N-Data, the PAE agrees to honor a specific FRAND commitment made by the transferor.72[19] In particular, in some industries, operating companies that have made specific commitments to avoid royalty stacking may, in tandem with PAEs, be evading those commitments. The result, as with other transfers to PAEs, is to \"raise prices and decrease incentives to innovate.\"...<br/>Similarly, commitments to royalty caps or FRAND licensing secured by certain industry participants from rights holders (whether through formal standard setting, unilateral commitments by patent holders, or otherwise) can mitigate royalty stacking concerns.78[20] Such assurances work to keep royalties reasonable once firms have adopted standardized technologies.79[21] One type of assurance is a \"no stacking\" pledge. Often this takes the form of a commitment by a rights holder not to seek more than a specific royalty level from implementers of particular standards no matter how many patents the rights holder possesses and no matter how many standards an implementer uses.80[22]<br/> 15<br/>\"No stacking\" commitments are common in some industries. A concrete example of such a pledge is one made by Nokia. To induce adoption of its proposed LTE standard, Nokia committed not to seek more than a 2.0% royalty for all of its patents \"essential to wireless communication standards irrespective of the number of wireless standards deployed\" and denominated this pledge a \"no royalty stacking\" commitment.81[23] Nokia's commitment - and similar commitments of other cellular SEP holders - played a critical role in inducing the telecommunications industry to adopt its proposed LTE standard as a 4G cellular communications standard.82[24] SSOs facilitate \"no stacking\" commitments. The IEEE, for instance, permits firms with likely essential patents to commit to not-to-exceed license fees.83[25]<br/>Transferors can attempt to circumvent these no royalty stacking commitments by outsourcing the enforcement of patents to PAEs. Suppose an operating company, which holds 500 patents essential to implementing a certain technology, makes a \"no stacking\" commitment not to charge more than 2.0% royalty for a license to all of its 500 patents for use in the field to which they are essential. The operating company then transfers 300 of its 500 essential patents to three PAEs (100 each). Further suppose that, in a purported effort to comply with In re N-Data, each PAE agrees to be bound by the operating company's 2.0% royalty cap. That promise may preclude each PAE from individually charging more than 2.0% for its 100 patents. But that promise may prove insufficient to prevent each PAE from charging that level. Thus, the effective royalty on the essential patent portfolio may end up being 8.0% in this situation, as the operating company and each PAE may attempt to charge up to 2.0%.84[26]<br/> 16<br/>In this example, by disaggregating and parceling out selected parts of its previously unified patent portfolio to PAEs, the operating company attempts to circumvent its \"no stacking\" commitment - indeed, its outsourcing creates the potential for the very royalty stacking by multiple rights holders that its \"no stacking\" pledge was designed to prevent.85[27] Well, well, that may put the currently fashionable whining by Microsoft and Apple et al. about Android vendors' allegedly charging too much for their FRAND patents into a fascinatingly hypocritical context, don't you think? And here's how the strategies work out to harm competitors, according to the comments:<br/>C. Operating Companies Can Employ PAEs To Harm Competition Firms may combine the above tactics with contractual commitments extracted from PAE transferees that facilitate anticompetitive strategies. For example, a firm that made a \"no stacking\" pledge to an SSO or to the industry at large might seek to evade that commitment in order to raise its rivals' costs by parceling out pieces of a previously-unified portfolio to PAEs. Such PAE \"privateers,\" which do not confront the threat of patent countersuits, have a greater ability and incentive to target the firm's rivals than the transferring firm, and the ability to evade a \"no stacking\" pledge can inflict further harms. The transferring operating company, however, might seek to further incentivize its PAE enforcement agents to target rivals through contractual mechanisms. Such provisions, in effect, can give the operating company continuing influence over the PAE, resulting in what Professor Carl Shapiro, at the FTC/DOJ PAE hearings, called a \"Hybrid PAE.\"87[28]<br/> Examples of such mechanisms might include, among others, a continuing royalty for the benefit of the transferring operating company coupled with a right by the transferring operating company to take the patents back. If a firm sells patents to a PAE (or transfers an exclusive right to sue for a lump sum royalty) the transferring firm might not maintain influence over the PAE's<br/> 17<br/>subsequent enforcement actions. By contrast, if the PAE must pay the transferring firm a running royalty and the transferring firm retains the right to take the patents back if the royalties are insufficient, such provisions might give the PAE an additional incentive to act in the transferring firm's strategic interest. This may lead the PAE to target specific rivals of the transferring operating company for patent enforcement and thereby facilitate a rival's cost-raising strategy by the transferring operating company.<br/>Another mechanism for channeling a PAE's enforcement activities to serve the transferring firm's strategic interests is a specific agreement on enforcement targets or retained licenses to the transferred patents that protect the transferring firm's customers or strategic allies. For example, if a firm selling an intermediate product sought to arm a PAE against purveyors of competing intermediate products, it could transfer patents to the PAE while retaining licenses that shield its customers from suit. Under those restraints, the PAE could only target customers' implementations of the transferring firm's competitors' intermediate products. Customers might favor the transferring firm's products because they benefit from the retained license and because they can avoid the cost of litigation brought by the PAE.<br/> In other words, an operating company can employ what are in effect PAE partners to raise rivals' costs.88[29] The threat of strategic outsourcing to raise rivals' costs, moreover, has become more acute. Preliminary statistics suggest that patent enforcement outsourcing is becoming increasingly prevalent.89[30] The exclusionary impact may be relatively larger when rivals are small and not well funded. PAEs' most frequent enforcement targets are small- and medium-sized firms. One survey found firms with under $10 million in annual revenue represented 55% of PAE defendants, and firms with under $100 million in annual revenue represented 66% of total patent defendants.90[31] And a common opinion is that PAEs \"with weaker patents often target small companies that cannot afford the legal fees required to defend a patent infringement matter in court\" and those companies may \"opt to pay the demanded license fee rather than defend to avoid the expense of litigation that could dwarf the amount of the demanded license fee.\"91[32] The concern with firms employing PAE vassals to target rivals may be exacerbated by the secrecy with which PAEs conduct their operations. Amen. I hope the FTC follows through. What they asked for specifically, then, is a Section 6(b) study of PAEs that includes a focus on patent transfers from operating companies. Here's what that is, 15 USC \u00a7 46[33], titled \"Additional Powers of Commission\", and look at paragraph b, colloquially called 6(b):(b) Reports of persons, partnerships, and corporations<br/>To require, by general or special orders, persons, partnerships, and corporations, engaged in or whose business affects commerce, excepting banks, savings and loan institutions described in section 57a (f)(3) of this title, Federal credit unions described in section 57a (f)(4) of this title, and common carriers subject to the Act to regulate commerce, or any class of them, or any of them, respectively, to file with the Commission in such form as the Commission may prescribe annual or special, or both annual and special, reports or answers in writing to specific questions, furnishing to the Commission such information as it may require as to the organization, business, conduct, practices, management, and relation to other corporations, partnerships, and individuals of the respective persons, partnerships, and corporations filing such reports or answers in writing. Such reports and answers shall be made under oath, or otherwise, as the Commission may prescribe, and shall be filed with the Commission within such reasonable period as the Commission may prescribe, unless additional time be granted in any case by the Commission. This section makes it ideal, the comments say, for investigating what is going on:We accordingly recommend that the FTC employ its authority under Section 6(b) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 46, to initiate an inquiry into the relationship between PAEs and operating companies - whether as a discrete topic or as part of a broader Section 6(b) inquiry into PAEs. A Section 6(b) inquiry will enable the Commission to probe this important area and answer many important questions. For example: How prevalent is the outsourcing of patent enforcement by operating companies to PAEs?<br/> What types of arrangement have PAEs and operating companies consummated?<br/> What motivates these arrangements?<br/> What are the likely competitive harms and benefits of patent outsourcing?<br/> What are the competitive implications of the secrecy with which many PAEs conduct their operations?<br/> Do the particular terms of outsourcing arrangements indicate that operating companies are employing PAE proxies as competitive weapons? A Section 6(b) inquiry focused on these and other questions would enable the Commission and the public to deepen their understanding of how operating companies' arrangements with PAEs affect innovation, competition and consumers.10[34] The fruits of a Section 6(b) inquiry also would provide a foundation for the antitrust agencies to assess whether the solutions to the competitive concerns patent outsourcing arrangements pose lie in antitrust enforcement, in changes in the patent laws (where the antirust enforcement agencies might play an important advocacy role), or elsewhere. So when you read Joe's piece on two FTC members saying they are considering using subpoena powers, know that it didn't happen out of a clear blue sky.<br/> Here it is, as text, and you can get the footnotes from there. You don't want to miss footnote 36.<br/><br/>**************<br/><br/>COMMENTS OF GOOGLE, BLACKBERRY, EARTHLINKRED HAT TO THE<br/> FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE<br/> on<br/> PATENT ASSERTION ENTITIES<br/><br/> Submitted via email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ATR.LPS-PAEPublicComments@usdoj.gov\">ATR.LPS-PAEPublicComments@usdoj.gov</email><br/><br/><br/>Comments to the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice on Patent Assertion Entities<br/> INTRODUCTION<br/> The Commission recognizes that Patent Assertion Entities (\"PAEs\") jeopardize the patent system's central purpose of encouraging innovation. In its 2011 Evolving IP Marketplace Report, the Commission observed that PAEs' accumulation and assertion of patents impose costs that threaten to \"distort competition in technology markets, raise prices and decrease incentives to innovate.\"1[35] The Commission further expressed skepticism that PAEs produce the benefits that their proponents claim or that any such benefits justify the harms that PAEs inflict.<br/> The Commission's skepticism appears well-founded. We believe that many PAE activities are inconsistent with the fundamental goal of the patent system - that is, \"to Promote the Progress of Science and the Useful Arts.\"2[36] In particular, PAEs impose an ever-rising \"tax\" on innovative industries. The facts are sobering: PAEs are filing four times as many cases today as in 2005.<br/> PAE lawsuits now account for 62% of all recently filed patent litigation.<br/> Big tech companies face hundreds of PAE lawsuits, but small- and medium-sized companies are the most frequent targets.<br/> PAE claims cost U.S. companies $29 billion in 2011; $80 billion when accounting for all costs - direct and indirect.<br/> Although the Supreme Court's decision in eBay limits PAEs' ability to obtain injunctions in district court, PAEs continue to Seek exclusion orders in the ITC.<br/> PAEs also continue to take advantage of information asymmetries that stem from poor notice and inadvertent infringement to appropriate sunk costs from firms locked into product design choices. We therefore applaud the Commission's and the Antitrust Division's decision to hold a joint workshop on patent assertion entities that builds upon the Commission's work from 2011. As the Commission noted in its 2011 Report, \"[t]wo areas of patent law\" - notice and remedies - \"impact how well the patent system and competition policy work together to further their common goal of enhancing consumer welfare.\"3[37] Without \"clear notice of what a patent covers,\" and what patents exist, firms may be unsure about the potential risks of developing and<br/><br/>1<br/> commercializing high-tech products.4[38] \"Poor patent notice undermines innovation and competition by raising the risk of . . . infringement and imposing 'a very high overhead' on innovation.\"5[39] The Commission recognized, moreover, that the current state of the law regarding patent infringement remedies \"encourage[es] patent speculation, ex post licensing and 'being infringed' as a business model.\"6[40] PAEs, in particular, are exploiting fuzzy patent boundaries and targeting \"inadvertent infringers\"7[41] to extract economic rents that often far exceed the value of the underlying technologies. A patent system that enables the appropriation of sunk costs through excessive rents and \"[d]amage awards that do not track the value of a patented invention compared to alternatives can deprive consumers of the benefits of competition among technologies.\"8[42]<br/>Although we agree that the current patent system undesirably encourages PAE activity, we are also concerned with, and suggest that the agencies should seriously examine, the outsourcing of patent enforcement by operating companies - companies that develop technology and sell products - to PAEs and the competitive implications of such activities. So-called \"privateering\"9[43] amplifies the threat to innovation and competition already posed by PAEs.<br/> PAEs long have sought to acquire IP rights from operating companies. And operating companies long have served as targets of PAEs' patent enforcement efforts. Today, however, we are witnessing an important shift in the relationship between certain operating companies and PAEs. Some operating companies appear to be outsourcing patent enforcement to PAEs and providing incentives to those PAEs to enforce patents against the transferring company's rivals. Privateering poses numerous perils to competition, consumers and innovation.<br/> First, operating companies' outsourcing of patent enforcement to PAEs detrimentally alters enforcement incentives. When, for example, two operating companies each possess patents that implicate the other's products, a common outcome is cross-licensing. Cross- licensing, particularly at low royalty levels that \"net out\" the value of respective IP rights, benefits competition and consumers. Cross-licensing resolves blocking positions, reduces costs and promotes the dissemination of technology and innovation. Conversely, the threat of patent countersuits may also deter firms from enforcing patents against one another. Such \"mutual assured destruction\" can achieve many of the same benefits as cross-licensing.<br/> 2<br/> Outsourcing to PAEs alters these incentives in ways that raise costs and harm competition. Unlike an operating company, most PAEs are immune to patent countersuits because they offer no products or services. Transferring patents to a PAE can shift symmetric patent peace into asymmetric patent aggression. Indeed, by outsourcing enforcement of part of its patent portfolio to a PAE, an operating company can try to have it both ways: The operating company can continue to deter patent suits by another operating company by virtue of its remaining patents; and it can encourage offensive actions against its rivals through strategic patent transfers to a PAE (which need not fear patent countersuits). Moreover, by outsourcing part of its portfolio to PAEs while retaining a stake in the outcome, an operating company may extract value from its own patents that it otherwise might not have been able to achieve. And although outsourcing can be met in kind, escalating patent conflicts through mutual PAE outsourcing merely imposes additional costs that ultimately harm consumers.<br/>Second, in some industries, patent outsourcing arrangements between operating companies and PAEs can threaten royalty stacking and result in exploitation. In the standard-setting context and in other contexts, some patent holders make \"no royalty stacking\" pledges to induce Standard Setting Organizations (\"SSOs\") and industry participants to adopt their technology over alternatives. In a \"no stacking\" commitment, a company pledges that, no matter how many of its patents implicate a particular technology or standard, the company will only Seekroyalties up to a certain level. By transferring patents essential to implement the committed technology to multiple PAEs, a company can Seekto evade its no royalty stacking commitment. This can occur when, despite agreements by each PAE individually to honor the operating company's royalty cap, there is no obligation by the PAEs and operating company collectively to honor the cap. Disaggregation of a patent portfolio to PAEs thus can enable the very royalty stacking that a patent holder's \"no stacking\" pledge was designed to prevent. Moreover, when a breach of the \"no stacking\" commitment occurs after an industry becomes locked into a standard, outsourcing patents subject to a no royalty stacking commitment to PAEs may result in the very type of exploitation the Commission condemned in In re N-Data and sought to arrest in Rambus.<br/><br/>Third, operating companies may combine the above tactics with contractual commitments secured from their PAE surrogates to raise rivals' costs and thereby harm competition and stifle innovation. An operating company might parcel out pieces of a previously-unified patent portfolio to multiple PAEs pursuant to terms that give the PAEs significant incentives to raise rivals' costs. For example, an operating company might retain the right to pull back the transferred patents if royalties secured by PAEs do not meet certain milestones. Or the transferring operating company and PAEs might agree to target the transferring operating company's rivals. The operating company thereby may succeed in saddling rivals with additional costs that enable the transferring company (or its allies) to exercise market power.<br/> These arrangements (and others) between operating companies and PAEs can, depending on the facts, transgress the antitrust laws. Patent acquisitions by PAEs from operating companies are subject to Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as well as the Sherman Act. Schemes by which operating companies outsource patents to PAE proxies to raise rivals' costs may be subject to invalidation under Sherman Act Section 1 and Section 2. And, depending on the circumstances, employing PAE enforcement agents to evade FRAND commitments (including no royalty<br/> 3<br/> stacking pledges) may violate precedent under Section 5 of the FTC Act as well as the Sherman Act.<br/>We accordingly recommend that the FTC employ its authority under Section 6(b) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 46, to initiate an inquiry into the relationship between PAEs and operating companies - whether as a discrete topic or as part of a broader Section 6(b) inquiry into PAEs. A Section 6(b) inquiry will enable the Commission to probe this important area and answer many important questions. For example: How prevalent is the outsourcing of patent enforcement by operating companies to PAEs?<br/> What types of arrangement have PAEs and operating companies consummated?<br/> What motivates these arrangements?<br/> What are the likely competitive harms and benefits of patent outsourcing?<br/> What are the competitive implications of the secrecy with which many PAEs conduct their operations?<br/> Do the particular terms of outsourcing arrangements indicate that operating companies are employing PAE proxies as competitive weapons? A Section 6(b) inquiry focused on these and other questions would enable the Commission and the public to deepen their understanding of how operating companies' arrangements with PAEs affect innovation, competition and consumers.10[44] The fruits of a Section 6(b) inquiry also would provide a foundation for the antitrust agencies to assess whether the solutions to the competitive concerns patent outsourcing arrangements pose lie in antitrust enforcement, in changes in the patent laws (where the antirust enforcement agencies might play an important advocacy role), or elsewhere.<br/>I. PAEs Continue To Hinder Innovative Industries<br/> The threat that PAEs pose to innovative industries continues to grow. The Commission's 2011 IP Report explained how PAEs impose an ex post \"tax\" on innovation. When a PAE asserts a patent obtained from a third party against a manufacturer, \"[a] manufacturer's royalty payment may raise costs to consumers, but it obtains only the avoidance of infringement litigation, not the benefit of the technology itself.\"11[45] Put differently, the \"manufacturer's costs will increase and its return on investment will decrease after it has developed and commercialized a product.\"12[46] In short, by See king to hold up firms that have commercialized<br/><br/>4<br/>products, PAEs threaten to \"distort competition in technology markets, raise prices and decrease incentives to innovate.\"#foot1313<br/><br/>Many others have described PAEs' harmful effects on innovation. Some have argued that \"PAEs represent a 'socially wasteful' business activity, diverting resources from more useful areas to the fora of litigation.\"#foot1414 President Obama recently called PAEs a \"classic example\" of firms that \"don't actually produce anything themselves. They're just trying to essentially leverage and hijack somebody else's idea and see if they can extort money out of them.\"#foot1515 President Obama suggested that \"smarter patent laws\" might be one possible solution to the problem.16[47] Google has proposed that \"Congress should [] make it easier for companies to recover money spent defending against frivolous troll suits\" by passing legislation similar to \"the bipartisan SHIELD Act\" and \"expanding the covered business method program of the America Invents Act to include more patents.\"17[48] Still others suggest that the President could encourage \"increase[d] antitrust scrutiny\" of PAEs that are, in essence, imposing \"a startup tax across the tech sector.\"18[49]<br/>Recent data indicate that the number of exploitative suits and economic rents extracted by PAEs is growing dramatically and the worst is yet to come. Both the number of PAEs and the number of patents held by PAEs are increasing; PAE \"innovation\" in rent-extraction techniques is occurring rapidly and spreading by imitation. PAEs retain the threat of obtaining ITC exclusion orders even if eBay has eased the threat of a district court injunction. Without public policy reforms, the costs PAEs impose - in the form of defense costs, licensing fees and litigation awards - will continue to rise.<br/><br/> A. Patent Lawsuits Filed By PAEs Nearly Doubled from 2007 To 2011<br/>The increase in lawsuits filed by PAEs over the last decade is dramatic. Last year, 4,125 of the 6,934 defendants (59%) named in patent cases were named by PAE plaintiffs.19[50] In 2011, operating companies mounted nearly 6,000 litigation defenses against PAEs, a more than 400%<br/>5<br/> increase since 2005.20[51] Today, lawsuits filed by PAEs account for 62% of all patent cases.21[52] The following graphs depict this dramatic increase in PAE-related litigation:<br/>PAE Suits Have Become the Majority of All Patent Suits22[53]2<br/><br/> 6<br/> Number of PAE Defendants Has Increased Significantly In Recent Years23[54]<br/><br/>PAEs have focused much of their attention and resources on the information technology (\"IT\") industry. There are a number of reasons for this: (1) companies in the industry often enter bankruptcy or become so distressed they are willing to sell off their patents; (2) products in this field are often covered by many patents; and (3) IT patents, some assert, are relatively easy to procure as \"paper inventions\" - i.e., without constructing the underlying invention.24[55] As noted, however, PAE activities threaten to impose costs and hinder innovation in numerous other industries as well.<br/><br/>B. PAEs Continue To Seek ITC Exclusion Orders<br/>Although the Supreme Court has limited PAEs' ability to obtain injunctions in the federal courts,25[56] PAEs remain (as a result of the interpretation of \"domestic injury\") able to seek exclusion orders in the International Trade Commission (\"ITC\"). While \"the injunction grant rate post-eBay in district courts has declined to around 75 percent . . . the ITC's injunction rate has held steady at 100 percent.\"26[57] This reflects that \"[p]arties who win in district court but would not receive an injunction under eBay can circumvent this response by refiling their cases in the<br/>7<br/>ITC because a district court's denial of an injunction request is no barrier to the grant of an exclusion order by the ITC.\"27[58]<br/>It is little wonder that PAEs have shifted their focus to the ITC. One set of scholars has observed that, because \"nearly every patentee can bring an ITC complaint, and nearly every accused infringer is a potential ITC defendant,\" the ITC has become the \"mainstream venue in which to file patent grievances.\"28[59] Indeed, the ITC's \"caseload has more than doubled, from 29 cases in 2005 to 64 [in 2011].\"29[60] Based on a recent analysis, Professor Colleen Chien estimates that PAEs account for more than one-quarter of all patent cases filed in the ITC.30[61] \"Growth in NPE-initiated ITC cases has outpaced that in ITC cases in general [from 2006 to 2011], with the NPE share of all ITC cases growing from 7% to 25% and the number of respondents from NPE-initiated ITC cases growing to over 50% of all ITC respondents.\"31[62]<br/> Put differently, an \"unintended consequence\" of eBay has been to drive \"patentees to the ITC in hopes of obtaining an injunction no longer available in the federal district courts.\"32[63] In some instances, moreover, it appears that PAEs have employed operating company licensees' activities to help establish domestic industry, a pre-requisite for a successful suit at the ITC.33[64]<br/> 8<br/> C. PAE Patent Enforcement Imposes A Tax On Innovation<br/>The explosion of PAE litigation has worked to raise the costs confronting innovative industries. One study found that PAEs have inflicted $500 billion in costs on publicly-traded companies since 1990, with total costs (including direct and indirect costs) of more than $83 billion per year over each of the past four years.34[65] In 2011, the \"direct costs of [PAE] patent assertions . . . totaled about $29 billion . . . including the costs of non-litigated assertions.\"35[66] These direct costs, which have doubled from 2009 to 2011 and have increased by 400% since 2005,36[67] include legal defense fees, licensing arrangements and monetary judgments, all of which have the consequences of diverting resources and delaying new products.37[68] The costs of defending a patent infringement suit are startling. According to industry estimates, the median cost of patent litigation breaks down as follows38[69]:<br/><br/>These costs are merely the legal costs borne by defendants. Combine the legal costs with settlement costs, according to one source, and the \"mean total litigation costs are $1.75 million for small/medium companies (defined as companies with less than $1 billion in reported revenue) and $8.79 million for large companies.\"39[70] To understand the harmful impact of excessive litigation, one must add to these out-of-pocket costs the loss of time, energy and creativity of managers, engineers and scientists caught up in the litigation process.40[71]<br/>9<br/> The prospect of incurring these substantial costs drives many defendants to settle even the most unmeritorious of claims.41[72] And these settlements are by no means trivial. In fact, \"it is clear that non-litigated patent assertions are responsible for much of the direct costs imposed by [PAEs] on operating companies.\"42[73] According to one source, the mean total cost per company for a non-litigated patent assertion - that is, the direct and indirect costs resulting from PAE enforcement and licensing efforts shy of litigation - is $42.4 million for large companies and $8.1 million for small/medium companies, averaging $29.8 million across all companies.43[74] PAEs, therefore, \"have nothing to lose and much to gain by litigating aggressively\"44[75] or demanding royalties based in large part on design-around costs.45[76]<br/>Despite the significant costs they inflict, a very small share of PAE revenues is used to support innovation or invention. For that reason, some researchers contend that \"a substantial part of direct costs of [PAE] litigation is a deadweight loss to society.\"46[77] They conclude that approximately only one quarter of PAE revenues flows to innovators \"and at least that much go[es] toward legal fees.\"47[78] Moreover, other empirical research concludes that \"less than two percent of losses in wealth caused by PAEs passed through to independent inventors.\"48[79] And only 29% of PAE patents come from small inventors; 43% come from large firms.49[80] Thus, although supporters contend that PAEs produce certain benefits - for example, efficiently dividing labor between innovators and experts in enforcement; enabling smaller firms and sole inventors to achieve a return on otherwise unmonetizable investments in innovation; facilitating efficient management of large IP portfolios50[81] - the Commission rightly described these benefits as \"uncertain\"51[82] and likely outweighed by the harms PAEs inflict.52[83]<br/> 10<br/>II. Patent Transfers To PAEs Create Additional Perils<br/>An accelerating phenomenon threatens to exacerbate the above-described harms and poses additional perils to competition and innovation. Although operating companies have consistently raised concerns about PAEs,53[84] some such companies increasingly employ PAEs as patent enforcement surrogates. These operating companies sell or assign pieces of (or entire) patent portfolios to PAEs that then assert the acquired patents against the transferring company's rivals. Put differently, although operating companies previously funded certain PAE activities and served as a well-spring for patents PAEs enforce,54[85] operating companies are increasingly employing PAEs to strategic ends in new and evolving relationships.<br/> The evolving relationships between operating companies and PAEs pose numerous distinct threats to innovation, competition and consumers. We describe several noteworthy harms below: (i) how transfers from operating companies to PAEs can harm innovation and raise rivals' costs by altering enforcement incentives; (ii) how patent outsourcing arrangements can foster exploitation by facilitating evasion of no royalty stacking commitments in some industries; and (iii) how contractual arrangements between operating companies and PAEs can further exclusionary ends. Unfortunately, these are but a few examples of the many ways operating companies and PAEs interact that may implicate competition policy and our nation's antitrust laws.55[86]<br/><br/> A. Outsourcing To PAEs Impairs Competition By Undermining Patent Peace<br/>It is commonly recognized that cross-licensing benefits consumers and innovation.56[87] Cross-licenses remove blocking positions, facilitate the dissemination of technology, reduce<br/>11<br/> costs by reducing risk and uncertainty and foster innovation.57[88] Cross-licenses, in other words, are among the \"ex ante\" patent transactions that, as the Commission recognized in its 2011 IP Report, typically benefit competition.58[89] Moreover, when firms possess significant patent portfolios that may implicate one another's products, those positions can serve to achieve consequences similar to a cross-license. One firm may be deterred from initiating patent litigation against another for fear of drawing a patent countersuit.59[90] Therefore, each firm's possession of patents may foster \"patent peace.\" As one set of scholars put it, \"When one has an insurmountable weapon, there is no need to use the weapon.\"60[91]<br/>But in many circumstances, patent transfers to PAEs undermine patent peace and harm innovation, competition and consumers.61[92] The reason is that such transfers change incentives to enforce patents. For example, suppose two competitors (A and B) decline to sue one another because each knows that initiating patent litigation will draw a countersuit by the other. Firm A then outsources enforcement of some (but not all) of its patents to a PAE. As many commentators recognize, the PAE transferee has different incentives to assert the transferred patents than Firm A.62[93] PAEs are not operating companies and, therefore, are not vulnerable to patent countersuits when the PAE initiates litigation.63[94] Thus, where the prospect of patent countersuits deterred Firm A from suing Firm B, Firm A can avoid the deterrent effect of countersuits by transferring patents to a PAE with incentives to assert them against Firm B.<br/> 12<br/>In other words, the transfer from Firm A to the PAE alters - potentially quite dramatically - the incentives to enforce the transferred patents. These altered incentives can increase costs. Before the patent transfer, Firm A and Firm B had strong incentives to include a cross-license in any patent dispute settlement. The cross-license likely would have reduced the amount of cash royalties flowing from one firm to the other, and in some circumstances it may have reduced royalty payments to zero. But transferring patents to the PAE undermines cross-licensing because the PAE places no value on access to other firm's technologies. And by outsourcing enforcement of only part of its portfolio to the PAE,64[95] Firm A can attempt to deter Firm B from suing Firm A (because Firm A retains other patents potentially to assert against Firm B) while raising Firm B's costs through outsourcing enforcement of other patents to the PAE. The secrecy that often shrouds transfers to PAEs may facilitate such tactics, by masking that the PAE obtained the patents from Firm A (at least where Firm A's personnel are not inventors).65[96]<br/>Depending on the facts, transfers that change enforcement incentives may raise rivals' costs and harm competition. A firm that refrains from unleashing a patent assault on a competitor for fear of countersuit - which leaves both firms competing vigorously against one another - might ship part of a patent portfolio to a PAE enforcement agent. Enforcement by the PAE enforcement proxy, in turn, might significantly raise the rival's cost structure and thereby raise market-wide prices. Although not every patent transfer from an operating company to a PAE would threaten such consequences, the potential for anticompetitive harm in these transactions warrants investigation by the agencies.<br/><br/> B. Outsourcing Patent Enforcement Enables Exploitative Rent Seeking<br/>A second and distinct way that operating company transfers to PAEs threaten competition is by enabling the company to evade its \"no stacking\" commitments, which are common in some industries.<br/>The antitrust agencies long have sought to prevent patent holders from exploiting firms that reasonably relied on the patent holder's patent declarations or licensing commitments. The Commission's litigation efforts against Rambus and Unocal illustrate the FTC's commitment to remedy, and thereby deter, the exploitation of firms induced to adopt technology based on such commitments made by patent holders.66[97] The Commission's In re N-Data consent order sought to arrest another form of exploitation: When the transferee of a patent ignores the specific<br/> 13<br/>FRAND commitment made by the transferor and seeks exorbitant rates against a locked-in industry.67[98] The Commission's 2011 IP Report similarly recognized that PAEs' acquisition of and enforcement of patents also can foster exploitation. The Commission wrote: the harms associated with PAE activity are the harms associated with all ex post patent assertions against manufacturers that have independently created or obtained the technology . . . . Such transactions can distort competition in technology markets, raise prices and decrease incentives to innovate. The extent of PAE activity in the IT sector amplifies the potential harm there.68[99] The threat of PAE ex post assertions is magnified by the fact that many PAE patents are of questionable merit. PAEs only win 9.2% of the infringement suits they bring that actually reach trial (only 8% if default judgments are excluded).69[100] In contrast, operating companies win 40% of their cases that reach trial (50% if default judgments are included).70[101] Thus, in general, PAEs assert weak patents. Carl Shapiro recently demonstrated that \"a large fraction of negotiated royalties\" firms can extract using \"weak patents covering a minor feature of a high-margin product that takes time to redesign\" is attributable \"to hold-up, not to the value of the patented technology.\"71[102] Operating companies and PAEs may engage in joint ex post exploitation. Certain transfers from operating companies to PAEs threaten to evade FRAND commitments even when, consistent with In re N-Data, the PAE agrees to honor a specific FRAND commitment made by the transferor.72[103] In particular, in some industries, operating companies that have made specific commitments to avoid royalty stacking may, in tandem with PAEs, be evading those commitments. The result, as with other transfers to PAEs, is to \"raise prices and decrease incentives to innovate.\"73[104]<br/>14<br/> Royalty stacking - or the \"Cournot Complements problem\" - can occur, for example, when multiple complementary patent holders seek to assert infringement by a single device.74[105] This theory holds that because each patent holder maximizes only its own revenue, each will seek to maximize the royalty owed to it, even though the overall effect is to reduce royalties for rights holders in the aggregate below optimal levels.75[106] These aggregate licensing costs might reduce overall output, and all patentees and manufacturers suffer from lower revenues; consumers suffer from reduced supply, limited features and higher prices.76[107]<br/>One procompetitive function of patent pools is to mitigate royalty stacking by combining complementary assets and licensing efficiently.77[108] Similarly, commitments to royalty caps or FRAND licensing secured by certain industry participants from rights holders (whether through formal standard setting, unilateral commitments by patent holders, or otherwise) can mitigate royalty stacking concerns.78[109] Such assurances work to keep royalties reasonable once firms have adopted standardized technologies.79[110] One type of assurance is a \"no stacking\" pledge. Often this takes the form of a commitment by a rights holder not to seek more than a specific royalty level from implementers of particular standards no matter how many patents the rights holder possesses and no matter how many standards an implementer uses.80[111]<br/> 15<br/>\"No stacking\" commitments are common in some industries. A concrete example of such a pledge is one made by Nokia. To induce adoption of its proposed LTE standard, Nokia committed not to seek more than a 2.0% royalty for all of its patents \"essential to wireless communication standards irrespective of the number of wireless standards deployed\" and denominated this pledge a \"no royalty stacking\" commitment.81[112] Nokia's commitment - and similar commitments of other cellular SEP holders - played a critical role in inducing the telecommunications industry to adopt its proposed LTE standard as a 4G cellular communications standard.82[113] SSOs facilitate \"no stacking\" commitments. The IEEE, for instance, permits firms with likely essential patents to commit to not-to-exceed license fees.83[114]<br/>Transferors can attempt to circumvent these no royalty stacking commitments by outsourcing the enforcement of patents to PAEs. Suppose an operating company, which holds 500 patents essential to implementing a certain technology, makes a \"no stacking\" commitment not to charge more than 2.0% royalty for a license to all of its 500 patents for use in the field to which they are essential. The operating company then transfers 300 of its 500 essential patents to three PAEs (100 each). Further suppose that, in a purported effort to comply with In re N-Data, each PAE agrees to be bound by the operating company's 2.0% royalty cap. That promise may preclude each PAE from individually charging more than 2.0% for its 100 patents. But that promise may prove insufficient to prevent each PAE from charging that level. Thus, the effective royalty on the essential patent portfolio may end up being 8.0% in this situation, as the operating company and each PAE may attempt to charge up to 2.0%.84[115]<br/> 16<br/>In this example, by disaggregating and parceling out selected parts of its previously unified patent portfolio to PAEs, the operating company attempts to circumvent its \"no stacking\" commitment - indeed, its outsourcing creates the potential for the very royalty stacking by multiple rights holders that its \"no stacking\" pledge was designed to prevent.85[116] Moreover, the gains from evading and exceeding the pledged rate cap by disaggregating a portfolio can exceed the deadweight loss from reduced licensed sales volume. The operating company and its transferees can then seek licensing fees that, in the aggregate, exceed the promised cap,86[117] thereby engaging in a form of exploitative rent seeking. The 2.0% \"no stacking\" pledge functioned as a form of FRAND commitment. By outsourcing enforcement to multiple PAEs, the operating company seeks to evade that commitment and shares in the resulting super-FRAND returns.<br/><br/>C. Operating Companies Can Employ PAEs To Harm Competition<br/>Firms may combine the above tactics with contractual commitments extracted from PAE transferees that facilitate anticompetitive strategies. For example, a firm that made a \"no stacking\" pledge to an SSO or to the industry at large might seek to evade that commitment in order to raise its rivals' costs by parceling out pieces of a previously-unified portfolio to PAEs. Such PAE \"privateers,\" which do not confront the threat of patent countersuits, have a greater ability and incentive to target the firm's rivals than the transferring firm, and the ability to evade a \"no stacking\" pledge can inflict further harms. The transferring operating company, however, might seek to further incentivize its PAE enforcement agents to target rivals through contractual mechanisms. Such provisions, in effect, can give the operating company continuing influence over the PAE, resulting in what Professor Carl Shapiro, at the FTC/DOJ PAE hearings, called a \"Hybrid PAE.\"87[118]<br/> Examples of such mechanisms might include, among others, a continuing royalty for the benefit of the transferring operating company coupled with a right by the transferring operating company to take the patents back. If a firm sells patents to a PAE (or transfers an exclusive right to sue for a lump sum royalty) the transferring firm might not maintain influence over the PAE's<br/> 17<br/>subsequent enforcement actions. By contrast, if the PAE must pay the transferring firm a running royalty and the transferring firm retains the right to take the patents back if the royalties are insufficient, such provisions might give the PAE an additional incentive to act in the transferring firm's strategic interest. This may lead the PAE to target specific rivals of the transferring operating company for patent enforcement and thereby facilitate a rival's cost-raising strategy by the transferring operating company.<br/>Another mechanism for channeling a PAE's enforcement activities to serve the transferring firm's strategic interests is a specific agreement on enforcement targets or retained licenses to the transferred patents that protect the transferring firm's customers or strategic allies. For example, if a firm selling an intermediate product sought to arm a PAE against purveyors of competing intermediate products, it could transfer patents to the PAE while retaining licenses that shield its customers from suit. Under those restraints, the PAE could only target customers' implementations of the transferring firm's competitors' intermediate products. Customers might favor the transferring firm's products because they benefit from the retained license and because they can avoid the cost of litigation brought by the PAE.<br/> In other words, an operating company can employ what are in effect PAE partners to raise rivals' costs.88[119] The threat of strategic outsourcing to raise rivals' costs, moreover, has become more acute. Preliminary statistics suggest that patent enforcement outsourcing is becoming increasingly prevalent.89[120] The exclusionary impact may be relatively larger when rivals are small and not well funded. PAEs' most frequent enforcement targets are small- and medium-sized firms. One survey found firms with under $10 million in annual revenue represented 55% of PAE defendants, and firms with under $100 million in annual revenue represented 66% of total patent defendants.90[121] And a common opinion is that PAEs \"with weaker patents often target small companies that cannot afford the legal fees required to defend a patent infringement matter in court\" and those companies may \"opt to pay the demanded license fee rather than defend to avoid the expense of litigation that could dwarf the amount of the demanded license fee.\"91[122] The concern with firms employing PAE vassals to target rivals may be exacerbated by the secrecy with which PAEs conduct their operations.<br/> 18<br/>III. The Commission Should Conduct A Section 6(b) Study of PAEs That Includes A Focus On Patent Transfers From Operating Companies<br/>PAE activities are expanding and are impacting innovative industries. Thus PAEs, the evolving ways in which operating companies transfer patents to PAEs, and the myriad of ways those arrangements may harm competition, warrant investigation. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 46(b), otherwise known as Section 6(b), provides an ideal tool for the Commission to examine PAE activities, and more specifically, the evolving and troubling practice of PAE \"privateering.\"<br/> Section 6(b) enables the Commission to engage in a wide-ranging probe of business practices. Companies subject to orders issued under Section 6(b) can be compelled, among other things, to \"file with the Commission\" \"special[] reports or answers in writing to specific questions, furnishing to the Commission such information as it may require as to the organization, business, conduct, practices, management, and relation to other[s].\"92[123] In conducting a Section 6(b) investigation, the Commission is not limited to a \"focused theory\" of why the conduct might transgress the law,93[124] but rather may \"satisfy [itself] that corporate behavior is consistent with the law and the public interest.\"94[125]<br/> As the Commission's Generic Drug Study and Authorized Generics Reports demonstrate, Section 6(b) provides the Commission flexible tools to investigate evolving practices and to assess their potential harms and benefits to competition, consumers and innovation.95[126] The Commission's ability to evaluate and report facts about key activities that affect commerce is an important part of its mission, and the Commission's use of its investigatory powers such as Section 6(b) has been important in the enactment of major legislation.96[127] Commission investigations have also provided important data that was considered in shaping the Security Act of 1933, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and the Federal Power Act of 1935.97[128] PAE activities and patent transfers by operating companies to PAEs are similarly appropriate subjects for a Section 6(b) investigation for numerous reasons. First, the conduct in question is rapidly growing and becoming more aggressive. The Commission's 2011 IP Report sheds light on the significant potential harms threatened by PAEs and the many different types of business models PAEs employ. A model, by which operating companies outsource enforcement to PAEs, often retaining a stake in the proceeds, is emerging. A Section 6(b) study would enable the Commission to obtain information from PAEs and operating companies alike on the business rationale for those arrangements; the extent of those<br/> 19<br/>arrangements; the prevalence of such arrangements; and the likely future direction of those arrangements. As one academic noted, conclusions about the effects of \"privateering\" are \"difficult to draw with the information presently available and additional investigation seems warranted.\"98[129] A Section 6(b) study, in other words, would enable the Commission to take a logical next step from the IP Report's foundation and explore the ways in which PAEs, and their relationship with operating companies, are evolving.<br/>Second, a Section 6(b) study of PAE activities focusing on operating company transfers is appropriate because the terms of most transfers between operating companies and PAEs and the extent to which operating companies have transferred patents to PAEs largely remains unknown. And, of course, operating companies' concrete plans to initiate further transfers of patents to PAEs, and the motives for those transfers, remains unknown. A Section 6(b) inquiry would enable the Commission to determine - for particular industries - the scope of the practice; the likely trajectory of the practice; and other information important for making a judgment of the competitive consequences of operating company patent transfers to PAEs.<br/> Third, a Section 6(b) inquiry is appropriate because how PAE activities, and specifically patent transfers from operating companies to PAEs, impact competition, consumers and innovation raise issues that require information from operating companies and PAEs, much of which is not publicly available. For example, it is a common belief that PAEs use the threat of litigation and holdup-driven damage awards to coerce settlements even where underlying infringement claims lack merit. Because settlements prior to litigation generate little, if any, public information, existing academic research methods have been inadequate in documenting these PAE activities.99[130] Data and other information from these stakeholders will shed light on the likely competitive consequences of the arrangement and enable the Commission to gather information from stakeholders with different perspectives on the practices at issue.<br/> Fourth, Section 6(b) is an appropriate tool because the application of the antitrust laws to patent transfers to PAEs is unsettled. The precise circumstances in which such arrangements threaten anticompetitive effects are largely undeveloped in the case law. A Section 6(b) investigation accordingly is appropriate not only to enable the Commission to gather the requisite facts, but also to enable the Commission to form a judgment about the extent of the problem and, if a solution is needed, whether it lies in enforcement of the antitrust laws or in new legislation or regulation.<br/> In short, obtaining information on the above-described subjects through a Section 6(b) inquiry will facilitate a richer understanding by the Commission of the impact of PAEs on<br/> 20<br/> innovation and competition. The Commission will thereby be better situated to contribute to the dialogue on whether the solution to the many issues PAEs raise rests with legislative changes to the patent system, in influencing the shape of the patent laws through amicus efforts in the courts, or through enforcing the antitrust laws.<br/>As for the precise shape of the Section 6(b) inquiry, we recommend that the Commission initially focus on the information technology industry. The IT industry has been a principal target of litigation by PAEs and has witnessed notable patent transfers from operating companies to PAEs. Moreover, many PAEs that have acquired patents in the IT industry are now contemplating acquiring patents in yet other areas. Thus, studying the role of PAE activities and patent outsourcing in the IT industry may provide a foundation for predicting the course of PAE activities elsewhere.<br/><br/> CONCLUSION<br/>PAEs impose tremendous costs on innovative industries. These costs are exacerbated by the evolving practice of operating companies employing PAE privateers as competitive weapons. The consequences of this marriage on innovation are alarming. Operating company transfers to PAEs create incentives that undermine patent peace. Transfers to PAEs threaten royalty stacking, which can raise rivals' costs and hinder competition in technology markets. The secrecy in which PAEs cloak their activities exacerbates all of these concerns and leaves the public without information needed to access the likely competitive effects of patent outsourcing practices. We therefore urge the antitrust agencies to study carefully the issue of operating company patent transfers to PAEs and recommend that a Commission inquiry under Section 6 is an appropriate vehicle for examining this issue of vital importance to the competitive health of this Country's most important industries.<br/>Dated: April 5, 2013<br/> Respectfully submitted,<br/>Google Inc.

The effective total cash payment may be significantly higher than a four-fold increase because, where the former essential patent holder may have accepted a cross-license to offset some or all of the cost of the essential patents it was licensing, PAEs do not value cross-licenses and would most frequently demand all-cash payments.

The restructuring should simplify Google's regulatory and legal battles because the European Commission is likely to have some of the same concerns as its various state regulators, so addressing issues with the commission could also help address potential state regulatory concerns, competition law specialist Pinar Akman, an associate professor at the University of Leeds, England, told SNL Kagan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The EU is one big market and the concerns that the competition authority of the European Commission will have are likely to be shared by all the national competition authorities of the member states,\" Akman said. \"It makes sense for Googleto have one European division to be able to deal with any concerns effectively.\"</p><p>Google's move to reorganize comes as it awaits the determination of recently appointed European Union antitrust commissioner Margrethe Vestager regarding the direction of a long-pending antitrust probe against Google. Vestager in November 2014 said that she needed some time following her appointment to mull views from the various parties involved in the complaint.</p><p>Richard Holway, an IT analyst and chairman of research firm TechMarketView in Guildford, England, said Google's restructuring only mirrors what other major tech companies have done in recent years, as many have moved to centralize their European operations.</p><p>\"This is necessary because the EU speaks with one powerful voice to these big tech companies,\" Holway said.</p><p>Googlein 2014 saw a number of political and regulatory setbacks in Europe. The company failed to persuade the European Union to drop its antitrust investigation, for instance. It also faced scrutiny over its activities in practically every European market, including Germany, France, Spain, Russia and the United Kingdom, in a series of actions that made clear that Googleand European authorities held differing views on data protection and information sharing issues.</p><p>Moreover, Europe's highest court ruled in May 2014 that an Internet search engine is responsible for the personal data it processes and could be required to remove links to inaccurate or irrelevant search results. The Court of Justice of the European Union decided that Googlemust amend and delete links to \"irrelevant\" or \"inadequate\" search results at the request of European citizens.</p><p>Then in 2015, the year had hardly started when Russian Internet service Yandex encouraged that country's antitrust agency to probe Googleover its Android operating system. Yandex claimed that Googleis not allowing handset vendors to preinstall third-party apps on Android-powered devices. Russia's Federal Anti-Monopoly Service subsequently launched an investigation.</p><p>And most recently, the new European Commissioner for digital affairs, G\u00fcnther Oettinger, criticized Googleand Facebook Inc. for allegedly exploiting legal loopholes in European Union states' digital laws. Oettinger argued in a speech that American tech giants exploit laws in EU member states with weaker data protection measures to be able to sell their users' personal data.</p><p>Indeed, there has been a growing sense in Europe that Googlemust inevitably face a clash with the European Commission. In a somewhat symbolic move, the European Parliament in November 2014 approved a controversial motion that called for the breakup of the company by requiring the unbundling of Internet search engines from other commercial services. While the commission has the power to order such a break up, imposing such an action is legally only possible if the commission can prove that there is no other equally effective measure that would be less burdensome to the company than a structural change. Nevertheless, the motion put more pressure on the European Commission to pursue swift action against Google.</p><p>However, privacy issues have been among the most damaging to Google's reputation in Europe. Among the most recent examples, in the Netherlands, the Dutch Data Protection Authority in December 2014 imposed an incremental penalty payment on Googleover its alleged breach of the country's data protection laws. The DPA claimed that Google's 2012 privacy policy breaches several provisions of the Dutch data protection act. For example, the agency's probe showed that the search giant combines personal data of Internet users among other types of data to display personalized ads.</p><p>The regulator has demanded Googleseek user consent for the combination of personal data from different Googleservices, clarify information in its privacy policy and provide clear information about YouTube's connection to Google.</p><p>Berend van der Eijk, an associate at law firm Bird &amp; Bird in The Hague, said that the DPA has started to investigate whether Googlehas met all of its obligations.</p><p>\"If not, Googlewill be liable to pay (EURO)20,000 per day and per infringement,\" Van der Eijk told SNL Kagan. \"In a worst-case scenario for Google, [the company] could be fined (EURO)15 million.\"</p><p>Van der Eijk also noted that although Googlecan lodge an objection to any decision from the DPA, it will not lead to a suspension of any incremental penalty payments.</p><p>\"For this to take place, Googlecan start a separate procedure at the administrative court and try to prevent the execution of the penalty payments through a preliminary injunction,\" he explained.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Italy, Googlerecently agreed to allow the Italian data protection authority to carry out inspections at its headquarters in California. The agreement, which is part of the Italian watchdog's efforts to ensure the data privacy of the country's citizens, will result in Google's compliance with all the Italian regulators' privacy protection requirements, including regular checks and quarterly updates to monitor compliance efforts, the company said.</p><p>The move to allow Italian inspectors at its U.S. headquarters signals that privacy compliance is becoming \"a tough hurdle\" for Googlein Europe, said Giulio Coraggio, a Milan-based technology lawyer and partner at international law firm DLA Piper.</p><p>He said that other European regulators, including the EU Commission, will \"undoubtedly\" monitor the Italian development closely, as it is the first time any European privacy watchdog has been granted the right to inspect Google's U.S. offices and receive such regular updates.</p><p>\"It is unclear whether this arrangement between Googleand the Italian privacy authority is a victory or a defeat from Google's point of view, but there is no doubt that it will have a major impact on their business,\" Coraggio told SNL Kagan.</p><p>With the agreement, Googleaims to avoid another fine. In April 2014, it paid (EURO)1 million to settle an Italian case regarding the company's Street View cars.</p><p>\"The question is whether the approach taken by the Italian privacy authority will be just the beginning of a more stringent approach by [European] privacy regulators,\" Coraggio said, adding that it is likely it \"will open a new field for negotiations\" between Googleand the watchdogs.</p><p>In an attempt to improve its standing with the European Commission, Google's Brittin wrote Feb. 26 on the company's blog that Googlewill train a million Europeans in digital skills by 2016 and it will invest an additional (EURO)25 million to broaden current training programs for small businesses</p><p>\"We will build a Europe-wide training hub to support businesses anywhere in Europe to get training online,\" he wrote, adding that Googlerecognizes \"creativity, ambition and talent\" in Europe.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-30598890</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FG5-K3V1-JDVW-N195-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1367\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

Additionally, Google is said to manipulate auto-complete results to remove sensitive subjects \u2014 including abortion and immigration. The tech giant has denied manipulating Google Search results for years, though various publications have repeatedly reported on as much[3]. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[4] Google's ubiquitous search engine, Google Search[5], is the backbone of the tech giant's business. In many ways, Google Search is the backbone of the modern internet \u2014 the way much of the web is sorted and organized and located. </p><p>Given how crucial it is to daily internet use for billions of people around the world, it's a particularly ripe target for manipulation. Google denies doing as much, and insists that Google Search is built on algorithms[6] and data gleaned from use. But a new Wall Street Journal investigation[7] found that Google manipulated search algorithms in some worrying ways, including prioritizing large businesses over smaller ones, removing autocomplete results that involve sensitive topics like immigration and abortion, and even outright blacklisting some websites.In one such change to Google's search algorithms, the service guided search users to more prominent businesses over lesser-known ones, the Journal reported. That change reportedly helped to boost Amazon's store in search results. In another example cited in the Journal's report, autocomplete search results for sensitive subjects were replaced with safer results than those found on competing search engines like Yahoo, Bing, and DuckDuckGo. Google is known for refusing to share specific details on how its search algorithms operate, which it attributes to a measure of operations logistics: If the algorithms were public, then they could be gamed, Google argues. \"Extreme transparency has historically proven to empower bad actors in a way that hurts our users and website owners who play by the rules,\" Google spokesperson Lara Levin told the Journal. When reached for a response to the report, a Google spokespersonoffered the following statement: \"We have been very public and transparent around the topics covered in this article, such as our Search rater guidelines, our policies for special features in Search like Autocomplete and valid legal removals, our work to combat misinformation through Project Owl, and the fact that the changes we make to Search are aimed at benefiting users, not commercial relationships. This article contains a number of old, incomplete anecdotes, many of which not only predated our current processes and policies but also give a very inaccurate impression of how we approach building and improving Search. We take a responsible and principled approach to making changes, including a rigorous evaluation process before launching any change \u2014 something we started implementing more than a decade ago.

The critics now want the tech giant to quit altogether.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TORONTO -- The announcement was big enough for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to fly down to Toronto and deliver. A corporate sibling of Google had been selected to transform a largely abandoned port area in Toronto into an innovative, sensor-laden, tech-centric city of tomorrow. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  But almost from the time of its unveiling, the project -- which combined environmentally advanced construction with a plan for sensors to track residents' movements and actions -- was hit by formidable opposition. Critics cast it as a recipe for a surveillance-driven, corporate-controlled urban dystopia and objected to turning over public spaces to one of the world's wealthiest companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Now, nearly two and a half years later, the opponents have shown that even if you can't fight city hall, you can take on Google and succeed.</p><p>  After admitting that it had underestimated privacy worries with its original plan, the Google sibling, Sidewalk Labs, has retreated. A couple of weeks ago, it unveiled details of a much watered-down plan along with new privacy protections. But some critics remain unconvinced. Waterfront Toronto, a government agency, will announce in May if the project will proceed.</p><p>  ''This thing has blown up on them,'' said one of the plan's leading critics, Jim Balsillie, who as a co-chief executive of Research in Motion helped make the BlackBerry the world's first successful smartphone and himself into one of Canada's biggest names in tech. ''I smoked them out. They were playing us like a bunch of colonial supplicants and suckers.''</p><p>  The story of how Toronto walked back the Google plan is in part a tale of locals taking on a big company. But it also reflects a growing pushback around the world against big tech that has accelerated since Sidewalk Labs unveiled its proposal.</p><p>  In the United States, several of the Democratic presidential hopefuls have described Google, Facebook and other tech giants as monopolies that should be scrutinized for antitrust violations. Europe has seen a flurry of new laws around online content and Britain has floated the idea of an internet regulator.</p><p>  In Canada, even Mr. Trudeau's government, which has actively pursued investments by multinational tech giants, is proposing to follow the lead of France and tax digital services.</p><p>  ''I think there's been a significant shift in attitudes and public understanding of what's at stake and the issues with these tech giants,'' said Andrew Clement, professor emeritus at the University of Toronto's faculty of information who studies digital surveillance and infrastructure.</p><p>  ''To let in an enormous company that I would say has not shown much respect for governmental institutions even in the United States, one that has a rather expansive vision of its role as a political and economic actor, strikes me as a kind of Faustian bargain,'' he said.</p><p>  The message of Mr. Balsillie and other prominent critics is blunt: They argue that foreign tech investment in Canada ultimately sucks knowledge out of the country, creating a net drain on the economy. Mr. Balsillie described Sidewalk's Toronto plan as a move by Google to use data from people's lives in the physical world in the same way it now exploits their online lives -- an assertion that Sidewalk vigorously denies.</p><p>  ''This is the mother lode,'' Mr. Balsillie said. ''Your offline data is way more valuable than your online data -- and your online data is really valuable.''</p><p>  The project, known as Quayside, came about when Waterfront Toronto set up a competition in 2017 to redevelop a 12-acre parcel of Toronto's formerly industrial shoreline along Lake Ontario.</p><p>  Long abandoned, the land features an old grain elevator, a gravel parking lot and an emergency shelter for the homeless. But it sits beside a potentially enormous development prize: 800 acres mostly owned by the federal government, and the largest undeveloped tract in downtown Toronto.</p><p>  Sidewalk, founded by Google in 2015 to develop technologies to improve urban life, won the first round of the contest. Its idea was to create a so-called city of the future that would marry technological innovation to shape urban planning and design.</p><p>  High-rises made from engineered wood would replace weed lots and underused warehouses along streets. Bike paths would melt snow. Giant awnings would shelter pedestrians from rain or blazing summer sun. Sensors would track residents' every movement to optimize everything from traffic signals to underground armies of robots delivering parcels and discarding trash.</p><p>  And all of it would meet ambitious environmental standards.</p><p>  Critics pounced. How would Sidewalk use the data it gathered from the streets, washrooms and even the garbage bins, they asked. Who would own the data? How would it be stored?</p><p>  Several people, including Mr. Balsillie, rejected Sidewalk's fundamental premise that algorithms, rather than politics, are the best way to design and run a city. And some argued that the project appeared to be a means of promoting concepts such as self-driving cars and other interests of Google, which, like Sidewalk, is a subsidiary of Alphabet.</p><p>  ''This is about corporate capture of governance and privatizing governments,'' said Bianca Wylie, who has long pushed for citizen access to data and who co-founded Block Sidewalk, the largest group opposing the plan.</p><p>  Sidewalk, she said, has ''wonderfully intelligent people working there, and they care about cities.''</p><p>  But, Ms. Wylie added, ''The problem is that nobody gets to buy democracy and governance.''</p><p>  Mr. Balsillie took an unlikely leading role in the opposition, appearing regularly on television and radio, writing newspaper op-eds and consulting with the Canadian government on the project.</p><p>  Dan Doctoroff, Sidewalk's chief executive, makes little effort to hide his irritation when presented with Mr. Balsillie's oft-repeated argument that the project was a back door for Google to use data from the physical world in the way it uses online data.</p><p>  ''That is completely untrue,'' Mr. Doctoroff said. ''He has never uncovered a shred of evidence of that being the case. And so I think that allegation is irresponsible. We have always said that there is no connection to Google.''</p><p>  The low point for Sidewalk came last June when it released thousands of pages of its master development plan, blindsiding many people in Toronto with a more expansive vision than originally proposed.</p><p>  Instead of a 12-acre project, the master plan covered the full 800 acres adjacent to the original parcel. Sidewalk proposed receiving a cut of future property taxes from the neighborhood in exchange for building a rail transit line there. That funding idea was ultimately withdrawn.</p><p>  While Mr. Doctoroff said Waterfront Toronto had requested a broader vision, he acknowledged that Sidewalk had overreached.</p><p>  ''It was just too big certainly until we have proven ourselves at a smaller scale,'' he said. ''But while we still have negotiations to come, we believe that a large percentage of what we hoped to do will still be possible.''</p><p>  But after strong public blowback, the plan is back to 12 acres. The super awnings are gone. The self-heating paving stones that were to be used to create snow-melting bike lanes may also be abandoned, a spokeswoman acknowledged, given that any route will run only for a couple of blocks.</p><p>  The trash robots? They may not be possible with the smaller scale. The huge engineered wood beams will still be used, but originally they were to come from a factory that Sidewalk would help establish, an investment that the scaled-down project cannot justify on its own.</p><p>  After negotiations, Sidewalk proposed that Waterfront Toronto itself set the rules covering data use and that the information be stored in an open ''data trust'' managed by the agency.</p><p>  But the company has yet to persuade a variety of critics that the revised proposal imposes acceptable limits on the use of the information, or even the need to gather it.</p><p>  Last month a panel of technology experts assembled by Waterfront Toronto, including Professor Clement, released a report on Sidewalk's proposal questioning ''whether sufficient benefits had been identified to justify the proposed collection or use of data.''</p><p>  The group also raised concerns about the rules surrounding data ownership and use, and about ''the accountability'' of Sidewalk, given that it has Alphabet's resources behind it.</p><p>  Still, Sidewalk does have many boosters, including Richard Florida, an urban studies professor at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.</p><p>  ''I think they made the project better,'' said Professor Florida, who acknowledged that he had done some work for a company that is advising Sidewalk. ''When I go to American cities people go crazy on me and say, 'Please bring it here, can we please have it here?'''</p><p>  But Mr. Balsillie hopes the city rejects even the mini-version of Sidewalk's urban future.</p><p>  ''It's a mangled and failing project, it's 90 percent dead,'' he said. ''What I've called for is to restart it and do it right.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Google's offices in Kitchener, Ontario, are its largest in Canada.

An optometrist has an office downstairs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Weinberg's company, DuckDuckGo, has become one of the feistiest adversaries of Google. Started over a decade ago, DuckDuckGo offers a privacy-focused alternative to Google's search engine.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The company's share of the search engine market is still tiny - about 1 percent compared with Google's 85 percent, according to StatCounter. But it has tripled over the past two years and is handling around 40 million searches a day. It has also made a profit in each of the last five years, Weinberg said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Weinberg, 40, is among the most outspoken critics of the Internet giants. DuckDuckGo's chief executive has repeatedly called for new privacy-focused legislation and has warned at hearings and in newspaper opinion pieces about the problems that big companies can cause by tracking our every move online.</p><p>But the challenges faced by DuckDuckGo reflect just how difficult it is to take on the giants and build an Internet business that is focused on the privacy of its users.</p><p>After a decade, the private company's modest success is an indication that, even as regulators around the world consider tougher rules for the data-tracking methods of big tech companies, selling consumers on privacy-focused services is still an uphill battle.</p><p>Like other search companies, DuckDuckGo displays ads at the top of each search page. But unlike others, it does not track the online behavior of its users to personalize the ads.</p><p>DuckDuckGo constantly bumps into Google's business, which stretches far beyond search. It also has to contend with the fact that most people don't seem willing to give up much to recover their privacy, and are easily overwhelmed when they decide to try to make a change.</p><p>\"It's not as easy to switch as we'd like it to be,\" Weinberg said while sitting in his office in jeans, red sneakers and a black short-sleeve shirt. \"There is a lot of inertia drawing people back to the existing system.\"</p><p>These limitations are reflected in DuckDuckGo's modest offices. DuckDuckGo, which has 65 employees, has done only two relatively small fundraising rounds, about $13 million, that add up to less than what Google makes in an hour. Weinberg parks his 2011 Honda minivan in a parking lot you can see from his corner office, which is papered mostly in drawings by his two sons.</p><p>For people who care about privacy, DuckDuckGo is a reminder that it is possible to offer Internet access and build an online business without logging every move made by users. It also provides a vision of what the Internet might look like if companies are forced to scale back the surveillance economy.</p><p>\"DuckDuckGo is very much a poster child for a future in which companies stand with their users and still make money,\" said Gennie Gebhart, a researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on privacy and online rights. \"They counter the assumption that we've all been socialized to accept: that it is normal to hand over all your information. DuckDuckGo shows that doesn't have to be the way.\"</p><p>Google has avoided any showdowns with DuckDuckGo. Last year, Google added DuckDuckGo as one of the four default search engines available for users of its Internet browser, Chrome.</p><p>But the Internet giant has not taken kindly to DuckDuckGo's suggestions that it is selling information about its users to the highest bidder.</p><p>\"The data we collect makes our product more helpful for people in a variety of ways, such as improving our understanding of queries and combating threats like spam and fraud,\" said Lara Levin, a Google spokeswoman. \"We keep this data private and secure, and we provide controls so people can make their own choices.\"</p><p>Weinberg started DuckDuckGo in 2008 when he was a stay-at-home dad, after struggling to get two previous startups off the ground. The early versions of DuckDuckGo (its name is a nod to the children's game) did not have any focus on privacy. When he went in that direction, it was attractive to only a small number of privacy advocates.</p><p>But after Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, revealed extensive online surveillance by the U.S. government in 2013, privacy became a selling point. Business began to grow.</p><p>DuckDuckGo is not the only upstart that is trying to capitalize on privacy concerns. Proton Technologies, a Swiss startup, is taking on Gmail with an alternative email service. The Firefox and Brave browsers are more focused on privacy than Chrome. And Google Maps users can switch to OpenStreetMap.</p><p>DuckDuckGo's search site looks similar to Google, with the G replaced by a playful cartoon head of a duck, who goes by the name Dax. Type in a question and up pops a list of links that looks like what you'd get from Google, with definitions from Wikipedia at the top and maps supplied through a partnership with Apple Maps.</p><p>Weinberg said the site was designed to make it feel similar to Google, to ease the transition for new users. While DuckDuckGo does not keep data on its users, it can pull the geographic location from each query and serve local results for things like restaurants and news.</p><p>\"We don't think privacy is stopping getting good search results for anybody,\" Weinberg said.</p><p>DuckDuckGo is also up against another hard reality of the online world: If you call up DuckDuckGo on the Chrome browser, for example, Google is still logging your search queries.</p><p>\"It can feel a bit futile as an individual,\" said Liz Coll, the head of digital change at Consumers International, a consumer advocacy group. \"It's quite hard to isolate your search engine as opposed to all the other things you do online.\"</p><p>DuckDuckGo is expanding beyond the search engine. The company's second most popular product, a free widget that can be installed in any browser, blocks invisible trackers from Google and other companies while providing a privacy and security grade for every website.</p><p>The plug-in gives Google's main website a grade of D, because, DuckDuckGo says, Google tracks you across the web and keeps permanent logs of your activity, which either the government or hackers might exploit.</p><p>Google has said it offers users many settings so they can opt out of data collection. Most people don't, the company said, because the data collection makes online services better and hasn't led to big problems - at least at Google.</p><p>Weinberg said the challenge of parsing what Google did and did not do was an indication of why it was so important to build alternatives that don't keep any data.</p><p>\"All of these companies were saying you can't make money without tracking your users,\" he said. \"By us existing and getting bigger and being profitable, we serve as the existence proof that it is possible.\"</p><p>Popper writes for New York Times.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SDUT-LA0097754745</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SDUT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WK7-YDP1-JBM5-R0SB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11811</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1137\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The San Diego Union-Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The San Diego Union Tribune</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 16, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In recent years, some of them have found a receptive audience in Europe, where authorities have thrice fined Google for -alleged monopolistic practices. Google has paid the fines but is challenging them in court.</p><p>Now rivals are increasing their advocacy in the US, where antitrust enforcers recently divvied up the job of examining antitrust concerns at large tech platforms, with the Justice Department preparing a Google probe. The Wall Street Journal reported on potential probes by the department and the Federal Trade Commission earlier this month.</p><p>Antitrust lawyers say any probe could take years to complete. Battle lines are already forming. Google is preparing its own data and arguments, the Journal has reported. It also recently overhauled its Washington lobbying operation with an eye towards amplifying the message that its products promote competition and benefit consumers.</p><p>Google has successfully navigated US regulatory scrutiny of several previous mergers. In 2012 and early 2013, it persuaded the FTC not to pursue a possible antitrust case by agreeing to change some business practices.</p><p>A Google spokeswoman declined to comment.</p><p>The stable of Google critics includes TripAdvisor and Yelp, which accuse the search giant of unfairly favouring its own content.</p><p>Oracle, which has a long-pending copyright case against Google, has briefed European antitrust regulators about Google's use of data to target ads and was part of a successful coalition of plaintiffs against Google's alleged anticompetitive behaviour in its Android operating system for smartphones, which led to a record fine issued by the European Commission last year, of \u00e2\u201a\u00ac4.3 billion.</p><p>News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal, The Australian and other publishers, says Google and other tech platforms siphon ad revenue from content creators.</p><p>All these companies say they would welcome further antitrust scrutiny. They and others are expected to seek out Justice Department officials as the officials prepare a Google probe, according to industry executives and antitrust lawyers.</p><p>Still more firms haven't criticised Google publicly but privately stand ready to provide information to US authorities about practices they view as potentially anticompetitive.</p><p>\"There is a lot more concern that you hear behind closed doors,\" said Jason Kint, chief executive of Digital Content Next, a trade association for online publishers that has argued online tech platforms are harming competition and consumers.</p><p>\"Cautious and quiet optimism\" is how Mr Kint described his members' mood upon hearing the news of the potential Justice Department probe.</p><p>Private testimony was key in the FTC's previous probe of Google, when competitors such as Microsoft gave regulators information on Google's business practices, according to an internal FTC report from 2012. A Microsoft spokeswoman said the firm hadn't filed a formal antitrust complaint with US regulators and declined to comment further.</p><p>Last month a veteran of the online advertising industry - which Google leads, but where rivals typically don't criticise it publicly - told the Senate Judiciary Committee that policymakers should consider breaking up tech giants.</p><p>\"We need to assume that internet giants, like any other big companies, will use their assets to maximise profit and strategic value,\" said Brian O'Kelley, former chief executive of AppNexus, an advertising technology firm bought by AT&amp;T last year after what he says was an unsuccessful attempt to compete with \"the Google super-monopoly\".</p><p>\"Either break up the internet giants or force them to treat their component parts at arm's-length,\"In addition to information gathered from US companies, federal authorities can collect evidence from abroad. During the 2012 FTC probe, US and Euro-pean investigators shared documents and updated one another on theories and evidence during regular phones calls, according to the internal FTC report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-5c39bed096f411e9b907843b9bcee4c43b89a4eb86cee8e6fb8ff9dcbbdafd57</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDT-J7V1-JD3N-51CG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"730\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 26, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Fitbit health and wellness data will not be used for Google ads. And we will give Fitbit users the choice to review, move, or delete their data,\u201d he said. </p><p>Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have begun to look at whether a strong grip over data can play a part in competition cases against the Big Tech companies. Margrethe Vestager, the EU\u2019s competition chief, said this month that dominance in data can make it hard for others to compete. </p><p>Maurice Stucke, a professor of law at the University of Tennessee, said the acquisition could be an important case as regulators will need to decide whether it could \u201csignificantly decrease privacy\u201d for Fitbit users and whether Google\u2019s access to this data could help it dominate further in its core markets, such as online advertising for search. </p><p>\u201cWhen you have a company like Google, which has violated privacy laws multiple times\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009you can imagine it will raise significant concerns,\u201d he said. </p><p>Buying Fitbit would help Google catch up with Apple, which has been focusing its health ventures around data collected by the Apple Watch. </p><p>Apple had 15 per cent of the worldwide market in the second quarter, shipping 5.1m watches, compared with a just over 10 per cent share at Fitbit, which sold 3.5m in the quarter, according to data firm IDC. The global market is led by Xiaomi, the Chinese device maker. </p><p>The Fitbit data would be an important victory for Google\u2019s mission to collect health data, giving it much of the same tracking information about heart rates and physical activity as Apple and the potential to deploy more sensors on an existing customer base. </p><p>Carolina Milanesi, a consumer tech analyst at Creative Strategies, said Google was trying to use its expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning to diversify its business and healthcare looked like it had \u201chuge potential from a revenue perspective\u201d. </p><p>Just like Apple\u2019s purchase of Shazam enhanced Apple Music, the Fitbit deal could improve Google\u2019s healthcare offerings by acquiring data and expertise, she added. </p><p>Fitbit is rich in data that is not covered by US health privacy regulations because the company is not a healthcare provider or insurer. </p><p>Going far beyond just tracking step counts, Fitbit has been moving further into healthcare, attracted, like Google and other Big Tech companies, by the prospect of mining data for new insights on how to treat disease and cut the cost of healthcare. </p><p>It has partnerships with health insurers, such as United Healthcare, where members can earn rewards for keeping fit, and will run a health programme for the government of Singapore that covers 20 per cent of the country\u2019s population. It recently signed a deal with an alliance between pharmaceutical companies Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, working towards approval of a sensor and algorithm that could spot atrial fibrillation, a sign of the potential for a stroke. </p><p>In the months ahead of the Google announcement, Fitbit subtly changed its company description to emphasise that the company has \u201cone of the world\u2019s largest databases of activity, exercise and sleep data\u201d. </p><p>Eric Topol, the author of Deep Medicine, said that Google\u2019s ultimate aim was likely to use many data sources \u2014 from fitness data to electronic health records to genomes \u2014 to create a \u201cvirtual coach\u201d for health. </p><p>\u201cIt will give you real-time advice about why this or that is off track,\u201d he said. \u201cIn order to get there, they will have to have the person\u2019s data.\u201d </p><p>Google did not say whether Fitbit data would be used to inform other Google products, and privacy advocates fear that the data will not be ringfenced but will instead be used for a variety of applications across the company. <br/></p><p>\u201cMerging and pulling data together from lots of different sources is in Google\u2019s DNA. That\u2019s how they make their money. That\u2019s everything they have always been about,\u201d said Adams Dudley, a professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota.\u00a0</p><p>Other large technology companies, including Apple and Amazon, are also eager to disrupt the healthcare industry, which makes up 18 per cent of US gross domestic product.\u00a0</p><p>Big Tech\u2019s expertise in data analytics is attracting healthcare providers and insurers trying to learn more about biology and medicine \u2014 but privacy advocates are worried that they could combine health data with their existing profiles of users.\u00a0</p><p>Google is already facing a number of healthcare privacy probes. </p><p>It is being sued by a patient at the University of Chicago who claims that Google took anonymised data from the university\u2019s medical school but could have combined it with the location of patients on Google Maps and with WiFi connections to put names to the patients. Google and the University of Chicago are contesting the lawsuit. </p><p>The US government is also investigating whether Google broke privacy regulations in its \u2018Project Nightingale\u2019 agreement with Ascension, the country\u2019s second-largest healthcare system. Google was given access to medical records of more than 50m Americans but many of the patients only found out about the deal from a report in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-s-secret-project-nightingale-gathers-personal-health-data-on-millions-of-americans-11573496790\"> Wall Street Journal</url>. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-50e1f04206f311eaa984fbbacad9e7dd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJR-FSH1-DXP9-94CS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1191\"/><timeReceived>4:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 22, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But regulators might put the acquisition on ice over privacy concerns. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB), which advises the European Commission on data protection law, says it's worried about the massive tech firm accumulating yet more personal data. Google is already under investigation by the EU for how it collects user data, and the US Department of Justice is separately investigating the Fitbit acquisition. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. Google's acquisition of wearables company Fitbit could be under threat from the EU. Google announced its acquisition of Fitbit for $2.1 billion[2] in November 2019, marking a serious entry into the wearables market, currently dominated by Apple. The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) issued a statement on Thursday voicing concerns over the prospective deal. It cited, in particular, the strict privacy rules that govern European users' online information, known as the GDPR. \"There are concerns that the possible further combination and accumulation of sensitive personal data regarding people in Europe by a major tech company could entail a high level of risk to the fundamental rights to privacy and to the protection of personal data,\" the EDPB said in its statement, as first spotted by TechCrunch[3]. \"The EDPB reminds the parties to the proposed merger of their obligations under the GDPR and to conduct a full assessment of the data protection requirements and privacy implications of the merger in a transparent way. The Board urges the parties to mitigate possible risks to the rights to privacy and data protection before notifying the merger to the European Commission,\" it added[4]. The EDPB is an independent body to the European Commission, the EU's antitrust regulator, but advises on applying data protection law. In response to the EDPB's statement, a Google spokesman told Business Insider: \"We are acquiring Fitbit to help us develop devices in the highly competitive wearables space and the deal is subject to the usual regulatory approvals. Protecting peoples' information is core to what we do, and we will continue to work constructively with regulators to answer their questions.\" A spokesperson for the European Commission told TechCrunch Google and Fitbit are yet to formally notify the regulator of the merger. The tech giant is already the subject of an EU antitrust investigation into how it amasses and leverages user data[5], while back in the US the Department of Justice is also investigating Google's purchase of Fitbit[6].NOW WATCH: 62 new emoji and emoji variations were just finalized, including a bubble tea emoji and a transgender flag.

Google's planned $2.1 billion bid for the California-based fitness-and-health data tracker was announced in November 2019, as the search engine seeks to increase its market share in the wearable and health data businesses. The announcement caused uproar among privacy and consumer protection groups, who have raised concerns over the prospect of Google adding sensitive health data to the personal profiles it aggregates from its services, including online searches and emails.    In a bid to allay those concerns, Google, which is owned Alphabet Inc., has pledged to refrain from using any of the Fitbit data for advertising purposes.    But the European Commission, the European Union's top antitrust enforcer, on Tuesday said those assurances are insufficient to safeguard competition and started an in-depth inquiry into the planned deal. The Commission's main issue is with health data consolidating Google's dominant position in the online advertising business, despite its commitment to keep Fitbit data separate.    The Commission said the probe would examine the potential data aggregation issues the tie up would have on the digital healthcare sector and the impact it would have on rivals' wearable devices that use Google's Android operating system.    Google disputed that the deal would harm competition. \"This deal is about devices, not data,\" Google Senior Vice President Rick Osterloh wrote in a blog post, noting that there is a \"vibrant competition when it comes to smartwatches and fitness trackers.\" He said the company will continue to work with regulators to answer their questions.    The European probe comes just days before the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is due to give its verdict on the transaction. In June, the ACCC said the proposed deal could harm competition in health data services and in the supply of wearable devices, while at the same time consolidating Google's dominant position in the online advertising market.    The U.S. Justice Department is also reviewing the planned acquisition of Fitbit, amid congressional scrutiny over Google's secret project to collect and analyze the medical health data of millions of Americans, as revealed by the Journal last year. The Justice Department is separately preparing a range of antitrust lawsuits, with several state attorneys general, against the search engine.    Buying Fitbit would help Google catch up with Apple Inc., who owns a third of the wearable device market, followed by its Chinese rival Xiaomi Corp., Samsung Electronics and Huawei Technologies Co. Fitbit used to be the market leader, but by March 2020 it ranked fifth globally, according to data analytics firm IDC.    The EU probe comes as regulators around the world face mounting public pressure over their enforcement record, and suggestions that competition authorities should do more to reign in Big Tech from growing even bigger, said Verity Egerton-Doyle, a competition lawyer with London-based law firm Linklaters LLP. Both the EU and the UK competition authorities came under fire in recent years for giving their green light to Facebook's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram.    \"They now have to run the ruler over every aspect of a deal that may be problematic,\" she said.    Europe's competition czar Margrethe Vestager, who has fined Google a total of $9.4 billion for alleged anticompetitive behavior, in a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal said that mergers of companies handling sensitive data would receive extra scrutiny.    \"The more sensitive and specific the data, the bigger the risk that it will give rise to competition problems,\" Ms. Vestager said.

According to that report, Google's U.K. market share of tools used by publishers to serve up advertisements - such as Google Ad Manager and Google DoubleClick for Publishers - is at least 90 per cent. In addition, advertisers use demand-side platforms to bid for ads, and Google's market share there is between 50 and 70 per cent. When it comes to supply-side platform used by publishers to accept bids, Google is there again, with a market share of between 40 per cent and 60 per cent.</p><p>In an interview, Scott Morton said the figures are relevant for the United States and other places Google operates, such as Canada.</p><p>\"We know Google is a popular search engine in the U.S. and Canada (and there's) no reason to believe it would be different,\" she told the Post.</p><p>\"The business model is the same around the world.... These markets are quite similar, likely, across jurisdictions.\"</p><p>Her paper, published this month with co-author David C. Dinielli, is titled Roadmap for a Digital Advertising Monopolization Case Against Google, and appears to lay out a path for regulators probing anti-competitive behaviour.</p><p>\"It is possible that the reason Google chose to occupy the entire value chain linking publishers and advertisers was to be able to design the sale of advertising to benefit itself at the expense of other parties,\" wrote Scott Morton and Dinielli, who is a senior adviser at Omidyar Network, an organization with a mission that includes addressing unintended consequences of or negative outcomes from technology platforms.</p><p>\"It is unusual, to say the least, for a single company to represent both sellers and buyers in the same market, and also to set the rules for, and conduct, the auctions that determine the winners, losers, and prices in that market,\" their report says.</p><p>Google did not respond to a request for comment by deadline.</p><p>The detailed paper on Google's strong presence in the digital advertising market comes on the heels of a news report that U.S. authorities are ramping up probes into the search engine giant.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported last week that both the Justice Department and a group of state attorneys are preparing to file antitrust lawsuits against Google and parent company Alphabet Inc. The Journal said the DOJ could act as soon as this summer.</p><p>In Canada, meanwhile, the head of Canada's competition watchdog, Matthew Boswell, has pledged to crack down on anti-competitive behaviour in the digital economy.</p><p>Last fall, the Competition Bureau issued a call to market participants to inform the watchdog of any conduct in the digital economy that may be harmful to competition.</p><p>The bureau said it was examining \"concerns that certain core digital markets, like online search, social media, display advertising and online marketplaces, have become increasingly concentrated, to the detriment of consumers and businesses.\"</p><p>This isn't the first time the Canadian watchdog has looked into such matters.</p><p>In April of 2016, the Competition Bureau discontinued what it described as an in-depth investigation into allegations that Google engaged in anti-competitive business practices related to online search, search advertising and display advertising services in this country.</p><p>The investigation concluded that Google had used anti-competitive clauses in some terms and conditions in a way that was \"intended to exclude rivals and negatively affected advertisers.\" But the Bureau said the tech giant had \"removed these clauses and ... provided a commitment to the Commissioner not to reintroduce them (or others which have the same effect) for a period of five years.\"</p><p>In that investigation, the bureau did not find sufficient evidence that Google engaged in any other conduct for an anti-competitive purpose, or that its practices resulted in a substantial lessening or prevention of competition in any relevant market.</p><p>Melanie Aitken, who was Commissioner of Canada's Competition Bureau from 2009 to 2012, said the digital economy is clearly in the sights of Canada's competition watchdog.</p><p>\"They've made this a real focus for themselves,\" she said in an interview from Washington, where she works as a partner at Toronto-based law firm Bennett Jones LLP.</p><p>Aitken noted that investigating suspected anti-competitive behaviours such as abuse of market dominance is challenging in the tech sector because so much is new, and it is constantly evolving. This makes such probes particularly tough for smaller regulators with limited resources.</p><p>Scott Morton, too, acknowledged an added layer of complexity in the tech industry, where untangling processes such as online bidding and auctions, and multiple acquisitions can complicate an already time-consuming process.</p><p>It is a stark contrast to \"easy to understand\" antitrust issues such as price fixing in the beer market, she said.</p><p>\"People pay more for beer.

According to that report, Google's U.K. market share of tools used by publishers to serve up advertisements - such as Google Ad Manager and Google DoubleClick for Publishers - is at least 90 per cent. In addition, advertisers use demand-side platforms to bid for ads, and Google's market share there is between 50 and 70 per cent. When it comes to supply-side platform used by publishers to accept bids, Google is there again, with a market share of between 40 per cent and 60 per cent.</p><p>In an interview, Scott Morton said the figures are relevant for the United States and other places Google operates, such as Canada.</p><p>\"We know Google is a popular search engine in the U.S. and Canada (and there's) no reason to believe it would be different,\" she told the Post.</p><p>\"The business model is the same around the world.... These markets are quite similar, likely, across jurisdictions.\"</p><p>Her paper, published this month with co-author David C. Dinielli, is titled Roadmap for a Digital Advertising Monopolization Case Against Google, and appears to lay out a path for regulators probing anti-competitive behaviour.</p><p>\"It is possible that the reason Google chose to occupy the entire value chain linking publishers and advertisers was to be able to design the sale of advertising to benefit itself at the expense of other parties,\" wrote Scott Morton and Dinielli, who is a senior adviser at Omidyar Network, an organization with a mission that includes addressing unintended consequences of or negative outcomes from technology platforms.</p><p>\"It is unusual, to say the least, for a single company to represent both sellers and buyers in the same market, and also to set the rules for, and conduct, the auctions that determine the winners, losers, and prices in that market,\" their report says.</p><p>Google did not respond to a request for comment by deadline.</p><p>The detailed paper on Google's strong presence in the digital advertising market comes on the heels of a news report that U.S. authorities are ramping up probes into the search engine giant.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported last week that both the Justice Department and a group of state attorneys are preparing to file antitrust lawsuits against Google and parent company Alphabet Inc. The Journal said the DOJ could act as soon as this summer.</p><p>In Canada, meanwhile, the head of Canada's competition watchdog, Matthew Boswell, has pledged to crack down on anti-competitive behaviour in the digital economy.</p><p>Last fall, the Competition Bureau issued a call to market participants to inform the watchdog of any conduct in the digital economy that may be harmful to competition.</p><p>The bureau said it was examining \"concerns that certain core digital markets, like online search, social media, display advertising and online marketplaces, have become increasingly concentrated, to the detriment of consumers and businesses.\"</p><p>This isn't the first time the Canadian watchdog has looked into such matters.</p><p>In April of 2016, the Competition Bureau discontinued what it described as an in-depth investigation into allegations that Google engaged in anti-competitive business practices related to online search, search advertising and display advertising services in this country.</p><p>The investigation concluded that Google had used anti-competitive clauses in some terms and conditions in a way that was \"intended to exclude rivals and negatively affected advertisers.\" But the Bureau said the tech giant had \"removed these clauses and ... provided a commitment to the Commissioner not to reintroduce them (or others which have the same effect) for a period of five years.\"</p><p>In that investigation, the bureau did not find sufficient evidence that Google engaged in any other conduct for an anti-competitive purpose, or that its practices resulted in a substantial lessening or prevention of competition in any relevant market.</p><p>Melanie Aitken, who was Commissioner of Canada's Competition Bureau from 2009 to 2012, said the digital economy is clearly in the sights of Canada's competition watchdog.</p><p>\"They've made this a real focus for themselves,\" she said in an interview from Washington, where she works as a partner at Toronto-based law firm Bennett Jones LLP.</p><p>Aitken noted that investigating suspected anti-competitive behaviours such as abuse of market dominance is challenging in the tech sector because so much is new, and it is constantly evolving. This makes such probes particularly tough for smaller regulators with limited resources.</p><p>Scott Morton, too, acknowledged an added layer of complexity in the tech industry, where untangling processes such as online bidding and auctions, and multiple acquisitions can complicate an already time-consuming process.</p><p>It is a stark contrast to \"easy to understand\" antitrust issues such as price fixing in the beer market, she said.</p><p>\"People pay more for beer. It's very clear what the issues are there.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

At present consumers must opt out of personalised adverts and in most cases still face tracking online.</p><p>The CMA has taken an increasingly<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/07/03/uk-competition-watchdog-probe-facebook-googles-digital-dominance/\">aggressive stance</url> on technology giants under chairman Andrew Tyrie, investigating technology merger deals and investments by Google and Amazon.</p><p>However, the watchdog said that regulating big tech firms represented a major challenge due to their power and international scale. It had collaborated with regulators in the US, Australia, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, France and Spain and said international consensus on any remedies was desirable.</p><p>CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli said: \"Digital advertising fuels big businesses like Google and Facebook and we have been building a picture of how this complex new market works. At the end of the study, we'll present our findings to the new Government as they decide whether and how to regulate what is an increasingly central sector in all our lives.\"</p><p>Its final report will be published in July 2020 following a consultation and its decision on a full market investigation. It said expected to make \"recommendations to government for regulatory reform\".</p><p>Phil Smith, general counsel of advertising body the ISBA, said: \"More needs to be done to increase digital advertising transparency and ensure consumers have greater control over their data.\"</p><p>On Sunday The Telegraph reported the CMA would <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2019/07/03/uk-competition-watchdog-probe-facebook-googles-digital-dominance/\">propose legal and political measures to tackle the power of big tech</url>, focusing on Google's dominance of advertising and was considering a further far-reaching inquiry. </p><p>Google UK head Ronan Harris said it would continue to work constructively with the CMA and the government.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-58786913</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XS9-Y6K1-JCJY-G3TG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"665\"/><timeReceived>2:11 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 18, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

But there\u2019s growing concern that the case against the search giant will amount to nothing but a political manoeuvre. Adding to Google\u2019s headaches, it\u2019s now reportedly in the crosshairs of China\u2019s regulators as the tech trade war spills out to enlist more soldiers.                     Reuters reported on Wednesday that China could soon launch an antitrust probe into Google that would focus on whether its business practices surrounding the Android mobile operating system are actively stifling competition. Citing sources speaking on the condition of anonymity, Reuters claims that regulators in China were prompted to consider the case by the embattled Chinese telecom firm Huawei. The proposal has reportedly already been submitted to the nation\u2019s top antitrust cops for review.       Huawei has been the focus of aggressive manoeuvres by U.S. officials who claim, without offering evidence, that the company\u2019s equipment represents a national security threat because it could be used by China\u2019s government for the purposes of spying. Huawei has denied that it operates differently than any other big tech firm, but that didn\u2019t stop the Trump administration from issuing an order blocking U.S.-based entities from doing business with the company in 2019. And while Google obtained a temporary licence to continue working with Huawei, that authorization expired in August.   Since the ban was implemented, Huawei has blamed the blacklist for billions in missed earnings, and it\u2019s made efforts to replace Google\u2019s products with its own in-house offerings. According to Reuters, China is now looking to the examples set by regulators in Europe who have successfully taken on Google\u2019s competitive practices in the past. In particular, Europe managed to levy a record-setting $US5.1 ($7) billion fine against Google for its requirements that manufacturers pre-install products like Chrome and Gmail on devices that run the full-featured Android OS. That decision forced Google to launch a bidding war for which search engine will come as the default on Android devices \u2014 a process that has brought fresh allegations of unfair practices from some competitors.       Reuters also reports that the U.S. Justice Department is expected to file a lawsuit against Google as soon as next week, and the agency is currently trying to gather state attorneys general to join the case. It\u2019s unclear what will be the focus of the DOJ\u2019s case against Google. But sources speaking with Reuters anonymously said that investigators have been looking into Google\u2019s hoarding of data to disadvantage search engine rivals as well as its control over the advertising space directly under search results on its homepage.   But the story of the DOJ investigation has been plagued by the appearance of political theatre, and earlier this month the New York Times reported that investigators were given an \u201carbitrary\u201d deadline to wrap up their inquiries by the end of September. \u201cMost of the 40-odd lawyers who had been working on the investigation opposed the deadline,\u201d the Times wrote. \u201cSome said they would not sign the complaint, and several of them left the case this summer.\u201d       The growing worry is that Attorney General Bill Barr is just trying to score some points before the November election by giving the appearance that his department is doing something about the dominance of a handful of tech companies that has led to complaints on both sides of the aisle. At a time when it\u2019s increasingly rare to see a major antitrust case succeed, there\u2019s justifiable fear that a rushed lawsuit by the DOJ might be politically expedient in the short term but hand Google a victory in the long run.   The DOJ\u2019s investigation isn\u2019t the only thing that Google has to worry about; there are also active inquiries into the company by 50 state attorneys general, the FTC , the House Antitrust Subcommittee , and the Senate Antitrust Subcommittee . In fact, the House committee will be holding a hearing on Thursday to review proposals, \u201cstrengthen antitrust laws and restore competition online.\u201d Google is not the only subject of that hearingm and its peers like Facebook, Amazon, and Apple are all facing increasingly intense accusations of anticompetitive behaviour.   Which brings us back to the fact that everything hinges on the election. Who knows what U.S. relations with China will be like if Trump is voted out of office. Google could end up dodging a bullet if things become more normalized. And if the DOJ does launch a Potemkin lawsuit, we could see it delayed or reevaluated by a new administration.   It\u2019s not just the DOJ that seems to think that it\u2019s important to make competition moves before the election. Just today, Facebook began integrating Instagram and Facebook\u2019s messaging systems in a broad effort to consolidate its world-dominating products. The strategy is widely seen as a hail mary effort to make it more difficult to break up Facebook if antitrust action is taken.   Gizmodo asked Google for comment on this story but did not receive a reply.

The No. 1 trading strategy of the 1920s. My low-risk approach that beat a buy-and-hold strategy by more than 3-to-1.It took me almost 20 years to arrange this call. I was holding the phone at 3:30 a.m., waiting to dial. You see, he told me to call him first thing in the morning, and he's several time zones ahead of me. </p><p>I was waiting for the investor who wrote the first academic paper ever on relative strength (RS). This is an investment strategy I began studying in the late 1980s. It was a new idea then. The first journal reference was from 1967. The author of that 1967 paper, Robert Levy, disappeared from the academic and finance world after that. I finally found him, and he agreed to take my call. What I learned that day is timely again. [embedded content]The Key to Success in the Roaring '20sIt turns out the story of RS applies to Google. RS was a popular investment idea in the 1920s. That was a roaring bull market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained almost 500%. But not all stocks went up. Only about half of all stocks participated in the bull market. Investing was more difficult in the 1920s. Stock selection was the key to success. Many investors picked the wrong stocks and lost money in the bull market. Active management strategies were popular. RS was one of the most successful. RS strategies buy stocks that are better than average. For example, let's say traders tracked 10 stocks. They bought the three with the largest 26-week gain. Every week, they rotated into the strongest stocks. There's a bit more to the strategy, but that's the general idea. Buy the winners. Sell when they stop winning. In that early-morning call, I learned utility stocks were popular among traders.An Evolving IndustryUtility companies include electricity and natural gas providers. Governments usually regulate utilities now. Regulation ensures access to basic services. In the early 1900s, electricity became available to factories. To increase profits, electric companies ran wires to buildings and homes that were near the factories. Profits determined access to electricity. Companies were eager to serve profitable areas. Rural communities often went without power because it wasn't profitable for a company to wire a small farm town. Government officials stepped in. They regulated electric companies to ensure access for everyone. As this evolution took place, utility stocks were volatile and profitable.Antitrust Problems Highlight Google's Business ProblemGoogle is becoming a utility. Few of us go a day without Google. You might use Gmail or Google Maps. Your Nest thermostat or your Google Home Hub might prepare the house for your arrival. There are endless examples of Google in our lives. For many, Google is as ubiquitous as electricity. The company even faces the same problems electricity companies faced in the 1920s. Google tries to make life easy for its best customers. In its search engine, the best customers are the ones looking for information. Searchers give Google data to use in its other businesses. Google makes searches easy with answer boxes. Answer boxes might be all the information a user wants. Google met that customer's needs efficiently and learned one more fact about that individual. One problem is that Google doesn't own that information. The search engine pulled it from another site. By helping the user get the information, Google kept the user from going to the underlying source. Google is profiting by treating customers differently. This is the kind of behavior that attracts the attention of regulators. Understandably, Google is under scrutiny.Trading as New Rules Evolve Increased regulation is likely for Google. The same is true for Facebook, Amazon and other Big Tech companies. It's the perfect environment for an RS trading strategy. You could create a list of stocks and buy the biggest gainers. A simpler model is to just own the stock when it's going up. To do that, compare today's price to the price three months, six months or a year ago. If today's price is higher, the stock is a buy. Technically, this is using the rate-of-change (ROC) indicator. Buy signals are given when ROC is above zero. Sell when ROC is below zero. Any time frame between three and 12 months works well. The chart below uses 12 months. Sell signals are highlighted in red.The biggest advantage of these strategies is they reduce risk. Using 12 months for signals, the largest loss since Google began trading in 2004 is less than 20%. Buy-and-hold investors suffered a 67% decline in 2008. Utility regulation was new and important in the 1920s. Internet regulation is also new and important. Investors should embrace the change and use a strategy to benefit from the uncertainty that rules will create.

Google's massive search and advertising businesses are at the heart of investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and nearly every state attorney general. The Justice Department is reportedly getting ready to file a lawsuit against the company in the coming weeks.     On Tuesday, senators on a Judiciary subcommittee pressed Donald Harrison, Google's president of global partnerships and corporate development, on the scope and scale of the company's digital advertising business.    \"Do you know of any other company that exercises this kind of concentration and dominance across every layer of the ad stack?\" asked Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., referring to the collection of tools linking advertisers to publishers. Google is involved in nearly every step in the chain between advertisers seeking to place their ads and the publishers selling space on their websites. Hawley pointed to findings from the United Kingdom's antitrust regulator showing that Google has dominant positions in various parts of the ad technology market, ranging from 40% to more than 90%.        Harrison, testifying remotely by video, responded that publishers and advertisers have choices other than Google. He pointed to the fact that digital advertising prices have fallen over the years as evidence that competition is robust.    Senators also pushed Harrison on how Google uses data from other services, such as search and Gmail, to benefit its ad business. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-MN, asked why the digital advertising business shouldn't be regulated \"to prevent conflicts of interest, inappropriate self-dealing and trading on inside information,\" as financial trading markets are regulated.    \"I think there's tremendous choice, I think there's lots of competitors, I think prices have come down,\" Harrison replied. \"I don't see the market failure that would require regulation.\"    While much of the hearing delved into the technical details of the digital ad market, Senate Republicans also took the opportunity to question Harrison about whether Google is biased against conservatives \u2014 a long-running complaint on the right, for which there is little evidence.    Republicans including Hawley, Ted Cruz of Texas, and subcommittee chair Mike Lee of Utah, tried to frame their complaints about anti-conservative bias as evidence of Google's undue clout.    Lee said in his opening remarks that antitrust was not the right tool for solving concerns about bias and that such concerns were not the focus of the hearing.    His first question for Harrison, however, was about allegations that Google had banned a conservative website from its ad network.    \"Isn't this behavior evidence of market power?\" he asked.    Harrison responded that comments on the website, the Federalist, had violated Google's policies against racism. \"We've been clear in our policies that our ads can't show up next to that kind of commentary,\" he said.     The looming antitrust case against Google comes amid broader scrutiny of whether big tech companies are stifling competition and harming consumers. The CEOs of Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon testified together before a house committee in July, where they pushed back against charges that too much power has become concentrated in too few companies.

Google is involved in nearly every step in the chain between advertisers seeking to place their ads and the publishers selling space on their websites. Hawley pointed to findings from the United Kingdom\u2019s antitrust regulator showing that Google has dominant positions in various parts of the ad technology market, ranging from 40% to more than 90%.    Harrison, testifying remotely by video, responded that publishers and advertisers have choices other than Google. He pointed to the fact that digital advertising prices have fallen over the years as evidence that competition is robust.    Senators also pushed Harrison on how Google uses data from other services, such as search and Gmail, to benefit its ad business. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., asked why the digital advertising business shouldn\u2019t be regulated \u201cto prevent conflicts of interest, inappropriate self-dealing and trading on inside information,\u201d as financial trading markets are regulated.    \u201cI think there\u2019s tremendous choice. I think there\u2019s lots of competitors. I think prices have come down,\u201d Harrison replied. \u201cI don\u2019t see the market failure that would require regulation.\u201d    While much of the hearing delved into the technical details of the digital ad market, Senate Republicans also took the opportunity to question Harrison about whether Google is biased against conservatives \u2014 a long-running complaint on the right for which there is little evidence.    Republicans including Hawley, Ted Cruz of Texas, and subcommittee chair Mike Lee of Utah, tried to frame their complaints about anti-conservative bias as evidence of Google\u2019s undue clout.    Lee said in his opening remarks that antitrust was not the right tool for solving concerns about bias and that such concerns were not the focus of the hearing.    His first question for Harrison, however, was about allegations that Google had banned a conservative website from its ad network.    \u201cIsn\u2019t this behavior evidence of market power?\u201d he asked.    Harrison responded that comments on the website, the Federalist, had violated Google\u2019s policies against racism. \u201cWe\u2019ve been clear in our policies that our ads can\u2019t show up next to that kind of commentary,\u201d he said.    The looming antitrust case against Google comes amid broader scrutiny of whether big tech companies are stifling competition and harming consumers. The CEOs of Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon testified together before a House committee in July, where they pushed back against charges that too much power has become concentrated in too few companies.

But is Google doing enough to protect user privacy?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Privacy was Google's big message at I/O 2019. Sundar Pichai has even penned an opinion piece in the New York Times, arguing that 'privacy cannot be a luxury good', seen as a dig at its rival Apple, which has always touted how their products are secure and do not collect user data.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The timing of Google's message is nonetheless interesting. Another big tech company in Silicon Valley: Facebook is facing heat over its handling of user privacy. And even Mark Zuckerberg insisted at the F8 conference that the 'future is private' and wanted everyone to believe that the company was going to build a future 'private' social network. Though everyone, including Zuckerberg, knows Facebook's record on privacy does not inspire confidence.</p><p>But Google's big privacy push is a lot more important than Facebook's considering the reach and scale of its software products, and the sheer amount of, very personal, data the company is handling. It also needs a lot more discussion and highlighting, especially from Google.</p><p>Scale of Google products</p><p>Android is powering more than 2.5 billion active devices, and many of the users are first-time smartphone and internet users, who perhaps are not even aware of why privacy is crucial online. YouTube's biggest audience is in India, Google Maps remains the de facto navigation product for many in India and across the world and the popularity of Google Search has never really been challenged.</p><p>The Chrome browser dominates the browser market. Then there are newer Google products like Home with the AI-powered Google Assistant, which wants to be more helpful, but requires that users share more and more personal information in exchange.</p><p>Not just your calendar schedule, Google Assistant could soon know exactly who to call when you say 'Call Mom,' though the company insists this will only happen if you choose to share such personal information. It also promises you will be able to delete this information.</p><p>The point is simple: Unless you live off the grid, you are likely dependent on more than one Google product, even on iOS. Apple too acknowledges that Google is the built-in search option on Safari because they are the best.</p><p>Privacy by design?</p><p>The privacy steps from Google therefore are doubly important. The company wants to make it easier to let users delete their data from the service. It now gives the option of deleting 'Web &amp; App' activity and users will be able to choose how long Google should keep the data.</p><p>The options range from Keep until user deletes manually, delete after three months or delete after 18 months. The default setting is of course keep the data, till the user chooses an option. In my view, it would have ss the option to permanently delete all this data, if you can spot the Trash Can symbol on the Timeline history. Soon the user will have the option of ensuring this kind of data can be deleted every three months or 18 months as they prefer.</p><p>Privacy on Chrome is also being improved with Google cracking down on third-party cookies that track users. Again this is a much needed move, though Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox already offer more drastic steps for those who value privacy.</p><p>More data, more risk</p><p>The problem with Google's privacy steps is that the onus is entirely on the user. Yes, the option for greater privacy is there, provided you bother to find it. Find the settings, reduce the amount of data Google is storing.</p><p>And that's something many of the newer users are unlikely to understand. Even those who are well-versed with Google products will might never end up using these features. One can argue users worried about privacy should take the needed steps, they cannot blame these companies.</p><p>Fair enough. But privacy by design should mean that default effort from the company, be it Google or Facebook, reduces data storage, especially for longer periods.</p><p>Collection and storing of location data, web search history forever does pose a privacy risk for many of Google's users. It is very easy to create a profile of someone should someone else get access to their Google Account. And for those living in countries with authoritarian regimes, the kind of data access can mean the difference between life and death.</p><p>Pichai is right when he says 'privacy is for everyone'. It cannot be viewed as a concern of the elite, an argument that is often made in India when anyone talks about privacy. And it is good that he does not wish to wait for regulation to fix this problem. But Google will need to more than just tweaking settings across its products to highlight its new found emphasis on privacy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDEXP-0047372322</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDEXP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2S-XMW1-JB5M-W096-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">364854</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"789\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Indian Express, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Express</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 9, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The US tech giant is currently contesting a \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.62 billion) fine handed to it by the EU in 2017 for alleged anticompetitive practices concerning its Google Shopping price comparison service. It has received two other huge fines from the EU since then for $5 billion and $1.7 billion, both on antitrust grounds. </p><p>According to Bloomberg, Google's lawyer Thomas Graf told the EU's General Court Wednesday that Google \"would have had no other option but to abandon its innovative technologies and its improved designs\" had a similar fine been imposed on it in a decade earlier. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. A mammoth legal battle between Google and the EU has just begun - and Google has wasted no time marshaling its arguments. Google says the EU's policy of imposing large fines over antitrust concerns threatens internet innovation, as it starts the first of three legal challenges against a total of $9 billion in EU fines. The US tech giant is currently contesting a \u20ac2.4 billion ($2.6 billion) fine handed to it by the EU in 2017[2] for allegedly abusing its dominance as a search engine to give an unfair advantage to its own shopping comparison service. Google has received two more large fines from the EU since then. In July 2018 it was hit with a \u20ac4.3 billion ($5 billion) fine[3] for allegedly abusing its dominant position of its Android operating system, and a third \u20ac1.49 billion ($1.7 billion) fine came in March 2019[4] for allegedly blocking its online advertising rivals. According to Bloomberg, Google's lawyer Thomas Graf told he EU's General Court Wednesday[5] that Google \"would have had no other option but to abandon its innovative technologies and its improved designs\" had a similar fine been imposed on it a decade earlier. How to square innovation and regulation is an issue contested by tech firms and governments since time immemorial, but the sheer bullishness of the EU - typified by its tireless competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager - has brought the issue into focus like never before. In recent years, Vestager has handed out multi-billion dollar fines to big tech firms with startling regularity. As well as handing out the three Google fines, Vestager fined Apple \u20ac13 billion ($14 billion) in August 2016[6] for accepting alleged illegal state aid from Ireland. Just last month, Apple mounted a similar argument to Google's[7], claiming that the EU's regulation \"stifles innovation\" as it fights the EU's ongoing attempts to standardize phone chargers. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has often played the regulation-threatens-innovation card, too. Speaking to the European Parliament in May 2018[8]in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, he said future regulation of social media needs to \"allow for innovation.\"NOW WATCH: Watch Elon Musk

Google fits the bill nicely and there is a neat reciprocity because JD can provide exactly the kind of help that Google needs in its latest quest - taking on Amazon.</p><p>In a world where the traditional alliance structure is crumbling under the stewardship of the Trump administration, it's more than a little curious to see the resurgence of global alliances in the corporate sphere.</p><p>To stretch the analogy a little further, this latest alliance has also been struck between tech giants in China and the US at the same time as Trump is doing his best to start a trade war between Washington and Beijing.</p><p>However that nascent battle plays out, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on the newly formed alliance between Google and JD, which have teamed up to push into south-east Asia.</p><p>For Google, it's about getting the jump on Amazon, which has moved swiftly into India and Japan but has little presence in south-east Asia.</p><p>The idea that Google, a search company which makes money from advertising, is being challenged by Amazon, an online retailer, is hard for many to fathom.</p><p>But Google itself often cites Amazon as its main competitor.</p><p>\"More commercial searches are done on Amazon as a starting point for search activity than are done on Google,\" the company's senior vice-president Kent Walker told ABC radio on Wednesday.</p><p>Walker was defending Google against accusations it has too much market power, but his response reveals how traditionally separate categories such as search and e-commerce are rapidly converging.</p><p>For Google to play in this space it needs the logistics and warehousing capability of JD, which in turn is trying to match the offshore expansion of its traditional rival Alibaba.</p><p>Just this week Jack Ma's internet behemoth, which has a market value of $US528 billion, opened its first south-east Asian office in Kuala Lumpur. Ma himself was there to mark the occasion - while also making a well-publicised call on newly installed Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad - as the big Chinese tech players increasingly look outside the mainland for growth.</p><p>JD, too, has made significant investments in Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand, where it launched its $US500 million joint venture with local retailer the Central Group just this week.</p><p>But the Google tie-up will give it more firepower as the American company brings with it an extensive international user base and strong marketing capabilities. That will help JD better target consumer preferences.</p><p>What JD brings to the alliance with Google is its delivery, warehousing and all-round logistics capability.</p><p>\"That Google has chosen to partner with JD shows its technology is world class,\" says Adrian Turner, a former Silicon Valley entrepreneur, now chief executive of the federal government's data science agency, Data61.</p><p>\"It shows that JD knows how to build logistics and do it at scale ... this is what Google is seeking from the deal.\"</p><p>Such an acknowledgement also throws doubt on Trump's often-made claim that the primary goal of many Chinese companies is to steal US intellectual property.</p><p>That might still be an issue in other sectors, but when it comes to e-commerce and logistics, JD and Alibaba are recognised world leaders.</p><p>This leadership is due to the rapid growth of e-commerce in China, which according to McKinsey accounts for 40 per cent of global transaction value, processes 11 times more mobile payments than the US and has a third of the world's unicorns; start-up companies valued at over $US1 billion.</p><p>A spokesman for JD, Josh Gartner, said utilising Google's marketing strength was a key reason for the deal, as the parties seek to become the dominant e-commerce player in south-east Asia.</p><p>He also indicated the initial tie-up was just the start.</p><p>\"When we partner with these companies, we expect the relationship to expand significantly,\" he said.</p><p>Indonesia, with its population of 260 million and an emerging middle class fuelled by economic growth averaging nearly 5 per cent for much of the last decade, is the early battleground between JD and Alibaba.</p><p>While Alibaba has expanded through acquisition, spending more than $US5.1 billion buying stakes in Indonesia's two biggest e-commerce players Lazada and Tokopedia, JD has preferred to build its own footprint.</p><p>It already has five warehouses and 1400 staff across Indonesia and told the local media last month it had plans for a further four warehouses.</p><p>Within JD, there is a belief the company can provide a different offering to Alibaba across south-east Asia. In Indonesia, for example, Lazada is viewed as more of a Gumtree-style marketplace where anyone can go on the platform to buy and sell, while JD owns the stock itself and deals with brands directly. Indeed, JD may be moving to get an advantage in the region over Amazon, which has a more similar business model.</p><p>In addition to Indonesia, JD has bought a stake in Vietnamese e-commerce giant Tiki.vn and earlier this year opened an office in Melbourne, mainly to source food products from Australia and New Zealand.</p><p>Alibaba has been equally busy outside Indonesia.</p><p>The company, or its affiliate, Ant Financial, have taken positions in e-commerce and payments companies in Singapore, India, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.</p><p>Outside of pure e-commerce JD has also invested in Indonesian ride-hailing app Go-Jek, alongside Chinese gaming, payments and social media giant Tencent, owner of the ubiquitous WeChat platform.</p><p>It's worth noting Tencent also holds a 15 per cent stake in JD, an alliance which has fuelled growth at the online retailer by pushing new shoppers its way.</p><p>\"I think you need to look at the deal between JD and Google as really a deal between Tencent and Google,\" says one person who has worked for many of the big tech players in China.</p><p>\"JD is part of the Tencent ecosystem in China.\"</p><p>That \"ecosystem\" has seen Tencent, with its $US480 billion market value, compete fiercely with Alibaba for deals and market share in China's rapidly growing tech sector.</p><p>In doing so Tencent has put together a series of interlocking alliances which are starting to resemble Europe before World War I.</p><p>The initial deal was Tencent taking that 15 per cent stake in JD in March 2014 and online magazine Quartz highlighted during the week a number of subsequent investments and tie-ups. Two years after Tencent's investment, JD bought Walmart's China e-commerce business, which in turn saw the giant US retailer increase its stake in JD to almost 11 per cent.</p><p>Google joined the club in August last year when it announced a partnership with Walmart to offer the retailers' products on its online shopping site.</p><p>Tencent has since been linked to an investment in the China business of French supermarket chain Carrefour, after the two teamed up on a high-tech store in Shanghai.</p><p>Google and Carrefour are also collaborating online, while Walmart said in March it would no longer accept Alibaba's Alipay offering across western China. Instead, it will only accept Tencent's payments option.</p><p>In January this year Google and Tencent also agreed to share patents covering a range of products and technologies.</p><p>These deals suggest a loose alliance of Tencent, JD, Google, Walmart and potentially Carrefour, while Alibaba and Amazon are mostly going it alone.</p><p>When Amazon inevitably moves into south-east Asia, a region which is viewed as five years behind China in its uptake of e-commerce, it will put the world's four largest tech companies in direct competition for the first time.</p><p>For Australian meat, vitamin, dairy and wine producers, which all have established relationships with these e-commerce companies, their entry into south-east Asia provides an opportunity.</p><p>\"Rising middle class in Asia want clean, green, safe food and produce. We do that really well, but for small business it's quite hard today to access south-east Asian markets because there's lots of regulation, logistics and local competition,\" said PwC's Asia Practice head Andrew Parker, who is on a secondment to Australia Post spearheading its international operations.</p><p>\"Technology is changing that. You've got these big e-commerce platforms, Alibaba, JD ... they're putting enormous investment into those markets and I think the Chinese companies have led the way in these areas because they believe that south-east Asia is the next China.\"</p><p>Eventually it may even allow some Australian producers to reduce their reliance on Chinese consumers, but it does also concentrate retail ownership in the region and make producers increasingly reliant on the big the e-commerce giants for their growth and market access.P</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc70ow91mwmd4gtrxk921</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SM9-NDJ1-JD34-V1XY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1544\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

This week, Google executives claimed their company is now \u201ccarbon neutral.\u201d                         \u201cGoogle\u2019s lifetime net carbon footprint is now zero,\u201d Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google and its parent company, Alphabet, said in a blog post. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to be the first major company to get this done, today.\u201d   Pichai said the firm is now moving onto a new goal: running the entire business on carbon-free energy sources, including offices, campuses, and data centres. This all sounds great! Or at least, it would if it weren\u2019t a giant vat of bullshit.       Google didn\u2019t actually go back in time and stop itself from producing millions of tons of greenhouse gas pollution. Instead, it offset those emissions, meaning it paid for green projects elsewhere to make up for its environmental impact. The company told BBC its offsets have mostly been focused on capturing methane gas where it leaks out of pig farms and landfill sites.   Having less methane in the atmosphere is good, but we should get there by moving away from animal agriculture and reducing waste to eliminate the methane emissions at the source. Services like Google\u2019s offset programs run the risk of leading polluting companies to believe they can just keep running their businesses as usual as long as they clean up their excess emissions. But even with less pollution, those models are still fundamentally unsustainable.       To be fair, Google is attempting to move away from offsets with its next big undertaking of cleaning up its power supply. Right now, the company says they\u2019re neutralising the carbon footprint of its total energy usage by buying renewable energy elsewhere, neutralising its own use of fossil-based power in places where it isn\u2019t running on renewables. By 2030, it aims to change that by actually running on 100% carbon-free power sources.   That\u2019s an ambitious goal for a tech giant, sure. But it still shouldn\u2019t be able to govern its own path to reaching it. We absolutely need to stop using fossil fuels, but not all renewable energy is created equal. The process of creating solar, wind, and battery storage could all screw up the Earth\u2019s biodiversity and be dependent on abusive labour practices if we don\u2019t pay careful attention to the supply chain. Who\u2019s going to make sure Google does that? It\u2019s not like we can vote on how it decarbonises \u2014 it\u2019s accountable to its shareholders, not users. That means it\u2019s likely to prioritise its profits in decarbonisation above all else.   As Google cleans up its own power supply, it also says it\u2019s going to help cities and corporations do the same by selling its services. That means Google gets to profit off the clean energy transition. And frankly, some of the stuff the company will be selling sounds downright scary. For instance, it plans to hock machine learning based tools, including Google Cloud and an artificial intelligence technology called DeepMind, to airports, shopping malls, hospitals, data centres and other commercial buildings and industrial facilities. The firm says these will reduce the need to use air conditioning in these buildings. There are plenty of clean and low-tech ways to do that already without AI \u2014 but you can bet Google isn\u2019t interested in many of them because they\u2019re cheap and present few opportunities to continually maximise profits, including mining people\u2019s personal data.   Big Tech\u2019s continued expansion into climate services is another reason that it needs to be more tightly regulated. Google is a company that\u2019s worth $US1 ($1.4) trillion dollars and counting. All that wealth gives Google a ton of political power, since it can spend millions to lobby elected officials, which makes it pretty difficult to convince those policymakers to reign them in. Now, it could be on the road to decarbonising without effective oversight on if its practices are effective, sustainable, use equitable labour, and respect our privacy.   To avoid all of this, there are other options. We could tax the hell out of Google and companies like it and put the funds into a more democratically controlled system of decarbonisation. Or we could make an even bigger change and nationalise tech giants so they\u2019re completely under government control.

The company, at its annual Google I/O developers conference[1] yesterday, announced a number of fancy software updates, in addition to unveiling new hardware like Nest Hub Max and cheaper versions of its Pixel smartphone. But it also made it a point to bang the privacy drum repeatedly, stating how these features have been built keeping individuals' privacy in mind. The message not only acknowledges the current privacy conundrum that has crippled big tech, but also runs antithetical to the company's penchant for amassing huge volumes of data about its consumers.A laundry list of privacy controlsGoogle, for its part, has been steadily rolling out small privacy improvements in the weeks leading up to the I/O. Last month, it announced the ability to use your Android phones as a hardware security key to provide an additional layer of authentication to access your accounts. </p><p>Then last week, it announcednew auto-delete controls[2] to erase your location history, and web and app activity after a period of three or 18 months. This doesn't include Google's other privacy-focussed moves, like abandoning its time-honored practice of scanning your personal Gmail inboxes for ad personalization[3]. But it didn't stop there. During the Google I/O keynote, the company said it will add an incognito mode to Google Maps,much like YouTube, that prevents specific searches from being associated with your profile.Coming soon to @googlemaps[4], when you turn on Incognito mode in Maps, your activity\u2014like the places you search or get directions to\u2014won't be saved to your Google Account. Just tap from your profile picture to easily turn it on or off. #io19[5] pic.twitter.com/z7GRkkmDbn[6]; \u2014 Google (@Google) May 7, 2019[7] Another surprise move that might have a significant impact on its business is itsplans to limit cookie-based tracking in Google Chrome, and add support for blocking certain types of 'user fingerprinting' techniques that are being abused by online advertisers. Google is also making a new open-source browser extension available that will inform users of the various intermediaries that were involved in serving a particular ad, along with surfacing the factors used to tailor an ad to a user. Elsewhere on Android, Google has announced a new permissionsmanager that lets you share location with apps only when they are in use.Big focus on on-device machine learningOffering enhanced privacy controls to users wasn't the only trick Google had up its sleeve. It's leveraging on-device machine learning in a big way to enable features like Gboard word suggestions, Smart Reply, Live Caption (real-time subtitles to any audio or video playing on the phone), and Live Relay (transcribe phone calls in real-time). This ensures that all your data (aka 'training data') remains on the device, effectively 'decoupling the ability to do machine learning from the need to store the data in the cloud.'With federated learning, a new approach to machine learning invented by Google, products like #Gboard[8] get better, faster\u2014without collecting data from your device. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/xHdDvGnVzn\">https://t.co/xHdDvGnVzn</url>[9] #io19[10] pic.twitter.com/GJ9tpZt1gn[11]; \u2014 Google (@Google) May 8, 2019[12] The approach also spread to other products like thenewly announced Nest Hub Max[13]. The company's first smart display with a camera does all its Face Match processing locally on the device so that facial recognition data isn't sent to Google. The company calls this collaborative machine learningtechnique 'Federated Learning[14].' Of course Google is not the first company to use it. Apple led the way for on-device intelligence with iOS 10[15] three years ago when it embraced the methodto 'identify the people, objects and scenes in Photos, and power QuickType suggestions.' But the very fact that Google is taking a similar route is telling.Privacy for everyoneGoogle and Facebook's rise as the de facto monopolies of online advertising came at the cost of aggressive collection of user data, with little or no regard to safeguarding individual privacy. But a long list of embarrassing data abuses and privacy debacles in recent years, compounded by regulatory hassles and calls for breaking them up, have led to a Silicon Valley reckoning. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg opened last week's F8 keynote[16] with a new mantra: 'The future is private,' he said, adding, 'We don't have the strongest reputation on privacy right now, to put it lightly. But I'm committed to doing this well and starting a new chapter for our product.' The intention is laudable, no doubt. But at a time when both Facebook and Google are facing dozens of investigations for their privacy violations, can we take their 'pivot to privacy' seriously? Or is it just nothing more than mere corporate defense? Several countries around the world uphold the right to privacy as a 'fundamental right' that's equally available to everyone in the world. Yet it appears that 'this right to be left alone' is increasingly becoming a right that can only be paid for \u2014 i.e. a luxury.Privacy has turned out to be this extra thing that needs to opted-in and purchased at an extra cost. But it shouldn't have to. And Google CEO Sundar Pichai's belated acknowledgement[17] that 'privacy cannot be a luxury good offered only to people who can afford to buy premium products and services' should serve as a wake-up call to any company to which billions of users entrust their personal data. Because it's high time we deserve a platform that takes privacy seriously and encodes it into their design[18] in a manner that instills transparency andtrust. TNW Conference 2019 is coming!

With the backdrop of last month's news that 50 state attorney's general had launched a probe into Google[1], the company's CEO Sundar Pichai wrote an op-ed for Fox Business News. Pichai argues that Google[2] is a friend to small business, not a foe. His choice of publication is an interesting appeal to pro-business political conservatives as Fox Business News is the sister outlet to Fox News, both owned by conservative-leaning Fox New Group. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[3] There's one thing that people on both sides of the aisle seem to agree on these days: a mistrust of Big Tech, especially Google and Facebook[4]. On Thursday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, made a public appeal for his company in an op-ed on Fox Business News,[5] a sister news outlet to Fox News, both of whom are owned by the conservative-leaning Fox News Group. Pichai was making the case that Google was not a big, evil tech corporation, but that it uses its monopolistic hold on internet search advertising and all of its monitoring tech to be a friend to small business owners. \"Some people assume that big companies can only succeed at the expense of small ones,\" he wrote. \"At its core, connecting local businesses with customers is an information problem. So when someone asks Google to find the best BBQ restaurant or dry cleaner \"near me,\" we try to get as much relevant information in their hands as possible. That includes information like driving directions, hours, or popular times to help plan a visit, along with easy ways to make a purchase or reservation on the spot.\" In other words, Pichai is saying that Google needs to collect massive amounts of information on people to use in service of small businesses. He then promoted Google's free training tools, a site that trains people on how to use Google's advertising and technology products and services. Google is positioning this free training as being a gift to small business, and it is helpful to many small businesses not to have to hire someone to use Google's ad. But, like all corporate-specific training programs, the goal is a self-serving one: the more people that know how to use Google's commercial offerings, the more money Google makes. Read: 50 state attorneys general have launched a formal probe into whether Google has engaged in anticompetitive practices in its ads business[6] Pichai also announced that its charity organization has made a $10 million pledge to help entrepreneurs from underserved communities start new businesses. The first grant will be a $2 million contribution to the American Library Association to support entrepreneurship centers at libraries in ten states. All of this comes on the backdrop of 50 state attorneys general officially opening up an investigation into Google[7] last month, a move with bipartisan support. One of them is Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who said in a statement to the New York Times, \"we have seen evidence that Google's business practices may have undermined consumer choice, stifled innovation, violated users' privacy and put Google in control of the flow and dissemination of online information.\" Meanwhile, top Democrat presidential candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, has also been preaching[8] that Google, Facebook and Amazon should be broken up.

So when someone asks Google to find the best BBQ restaurant or dry cleaner \"near me,\" we try to get as much relevant information in their hands as possible. That includes information like driving directions, hours, or popular times to help plan a visit, along with easy ways to make a purchase or reservation on the spot.\"</p><p>In other words, Pichai is saying that Google needs to collect massive amounts of information on people to use in service of small businesses.</p><p>He then promoted Google's free training tools, a site that trains people on how to use Google's advertising and technology products and services. Google is positioning this free training as being a gift to small business, and it is helpful to many small businesses not to have to hire someone to use Google's ad. But, like all corporate-specific training programs, the goal is a self-serving one: the more people that know how to use Google's commercial offerings, the more money Google makes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Read: 50 state attorneys general have launched a formal probe into whether Google has engaged in anticompetitive practices in its ads business</emphasis></p><p>Pichai also announced that its charity organization has made a $10 million pledge to help entrepreneurs from underserved communities start new businesses. The first grant will be a $2 million contribution to the American Library Association to support entrepreneurship centers at libraries in ten states.</p><p>All of this comes on the backdrop of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/state-attorneys-general-launch-antitrust-probe-into-google-2019-9?utm_source=digitalarchivedistribution&amp;utm_medium=ingest\">50 state attorneys general officially opening up an investigation into Google</url> last month, a move with bipartisan support.</p><p>One of them is Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who said in a statement to the New York Times, \"we have seen evidence that Google's business practices may have undermined consumer choice, stifled innovation, violated users' privacy and put Google in control of the flow and dissemination of online information.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, top Democrat presidential candidate, Sen.

The Google chief instead argued existing laws could be repurposed to regulate AI sector by sector and cautioned that hastily drawn-up laws could hinder \"innovation and research.\" There's a good reason Pichai probably wants regulators to stay away wide-reaching caps on AI.

Speaking in Helsinki, Pichai warned against broad regulation of AI, arguing instead that existing laws could be repurposed sector by sector \"rather than assuming that everything you have to do is new.\" \"It is such a broad cross-cutting technology, so it's important to look at [regulation] more in certain vertical situations,\" said Pichai. Read more: A former Google engineer warned that robot weapons could cause accidental mass killings[3] \"Rather than rushing into it in a way that prevents innovation and research, you actually need to solve some of the difficult problems,\" he added, citing known issues with the technology such as algorithmic bias and accountability. Pichai's comments are set against the backdrop of Google's own rocky relationship with artificial intelligence technology, and backlash over some of its projects. The company canned an autonomous drone contract with the Department of Defense \u2014 codenamed Project Maven \u2014 after fierce employee backlash, with thousands signing a petition and multiple resignations. Engineers felt the project was an unethical use of AI, and Google allowed its contract to elapse in March of this year. Artificial intelligence remains a core future growth plank for Google more generally. Pichai said in a first-quarter earnings call this year that almost three-quarters of Google's advertising clients are using automated ad technologies which make use of machine learning and AI. The firm makes the bulk of its revenue from advertising, reporting $33 billion in revenue for the second quarter[4]. Google's fast-growing cloud business also uses AI[5]. And its new health division is part of the firm's efforts to commercialise[6] research produced by its AI lab, DeepMind. Laura Nolan, a former Google engineer who was recruited to Project Maven and subsequently resigned over ethical concerns, told Business Insider via email that while Pichai may be speaking out of self-interest, she agrees that blanket AI regulation may be too broad an approach. \"Laws shouldn't be about specific technological implementations, and AI is a really fuzzy term anyway,\" she said. Professor Sandra Wachter of the Oxford Internet Institute also told Business Insider that the contexts in which AI is used change how it should be governed. \"I think it makes a lot of sense to look at sectorial regulation rather than just an overarching AI framework. Risks and benefits of AI will differ depending on the sector, the application and the context. For example, AI used in criminal justice will pose different challenges than AI used in the health sector. It is crucial to assess if all the laws are fit for purpose,\" said Wachter. She said that in some cases existing laws could be tweaked, such as data protection and non-discrimination laws. However, both Nolan and Wachter cited specific areas which may require new laws to be written \u2014 such as facial recognition. \"Algorithmic decision-making is definitely an area that I believe the US needs to regulate,\" Nolan said. \"Another major area seems to be automated biometric-based identification (i.e. facial recognition but also other biometrics like gait recognition and so on). These are areas where we see clear problems emerging due to new technological capabilities, and not to regulate would be to knowingly allow harms to occur.\" \"The use of AI in warfare absolutely needs to be regulated \u2014 it is brittle and unpredictable, and it would be very dangerous to build weapons that use AI to perform the critical function of target selection,\" she added.NOW WATCH:

Brown will be Gusto, a human resources startup, as chief people officer. Google said in a statement that Brown will be replaced by Melonie Parker, who has acted as Google's head of diversity, equity and inclusion. In the past year, Google has faced scrutiny over its handling of sexual misconduct allegations[3] against senior executives, and faces a class action lawsuit[4] over pay discrimination. Following a year full of controversy \u2014 including the Google Walkout, where employees protested the company's handling of sexual misconduct allegations \u2014 Google is shaking up its diversity and inclusion team. </p><p>Google's chief diversity officer, Danielle Brown, is leaving the company, the company confirmed Thursday to Business Insider. She'll be replaced by Melonie Parker, who had served as Google's global head of diversity, equity, and inclusion for the last 9 months. \"We're grateful to Danielle for her excellent work over the past two years to improve representation in Google's workforce and ensure an inclusive culture for everyone,\" Eileen Naughton, Google's head of people operations, said in a statement to Business Insider. \"We're deeply committed to this work and have made progress, but there's more we need to do.\" Brown wrote in a LinkedIn post she'll be joining on as chief people officer at Gusto, a startup that provides human resources software to businesses. Read more: These 7 graphs lay bare Google's diversity problem[5] Brown joined on at Google as vice president of employee engagement and head of diversity in June 2017. In the two years since Brown took charge of Google's diversity efforts, the company has faced a barrage of scandals and controversies. A few months after Brown started, Google software engineer James Damore released a manifesto saying[6] the company needed to be more tolerant of employees' conservative viewpoints, and argued women were underrepresented in tech because of \"biological causes\" that made them inferior to men. Brown was inundated with[7] racist and sexist insults on Twitter after Google fired Damore. Many ex-Google employees have since come forward with stories of racial and gender discrimination at the search giant, furthering Silicon Valley's longstanding perception as a \"boys' club.\" One former employee told the Guardian[8] that she felt \"invisible\" at Google and like she \"didn't matter.\" More than 8,000 current and former female employees are currently pursuing a class action lawsuit[9] against Google, alleging pay discrimination. Later, in October 2018, the New York Times[10] detailed sexual misconduct allegations against senior executives at Google. This specifically included the \"father of Android,\" Andy Rubin, who was reportedly given a $90 million exit package[11] when he left the company following an investigation into his behavior. In response, Google employees staged a company-wide walkout in protest, with more than 20,000 Googlers[12] participating at company offices around the world. Google announced in February it would end its practice of forced arbitration[13] in all cases, including those involving sexual harassment and discrimination. Moving forward, Google may be hoping for a fresh start in its diversity and inclusion efforts, even as it appoints this new leader.

Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, June 17.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 8:00 a.m. on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Coronavirus cases are spiking once again. Six states including Florida and Texas reporting record high number of cases. Meanwhile some good news on fighting the pandemic: a low cost steroid shows promise in treating patients.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell on Capitol Hill. He says there are signs of a modest rebound. But he is also warning significant uncertainty remains and pushing Congress for more stimulus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Markets are higher this morning. Futures indicating a gain at the start of trading extending yesterday's big rally, now at the highs of the morning with the Dow futures up 98 points. The Nasdaq futures up 48. And the S&amp;P futures up 10 points.</p><p>Much stronger than expected retail sales fueled a rally yesterday. And markets finished up 526 points on the Dow. The Nasdaq was up 169.</p><p>President Trump taking action on police reform. He signed an executive order pushing for higher standards for use of force, and de-escalation training. Also emphasizing the importance of police saying that without police there is chaos. Congress working on additional reforms set to be unveiled later today.</p><p>U.S. companies given the green light to work with Huawei on setting 5G standards. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross telling me he is still opposed to the use of Huawei technology saying spying is a very real issue.</p><p>Plus censorship on the Internet. Google forcing some conservative news sites to remove comments in order to keep lucrative Google ads.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.</p><p>Global markets this morning also higher. European indices higher across the board. FT is 100 up 27. The CAC 40 is up 49. And the DAX index in Germany up 61.</p><p>Inflation showing in the Eurozone this morning. May consumer prices were down a tenth of a percent, month-over-month. So no real inflation.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets are mostly higher except for Japan. The Nikkei average was down. Japan reporting that exports in the month of May were down over 28 percent year-over-year. Meanwhile in China, Beijing is closing schools, blocking off some neighborhoods and canceling flights as it sees a spike in coronavirus cases.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning is Dagen McDowell, Alli McCartney and Mike Huckabee. Great to see everybody.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Great to see you.</p><p>MIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: Good morning.</p><p>ALLI MCCARTNEY, MANAGING PARTNER, UBS: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning.</p><p>In just a few hours, police reform will take center stage on Capitol Hill. Senator Tim Scott set to reveal the GOP's Justice Act today. Leading Senate Democrats already slamming the plan even before seeing it, claiming it falls short of meaningful reform. House Democrats unveiled their Justice and Policing Act last week.</p><p>The GOP plan comes a day after President Trump signed an executive order on police reform banning chokeholds in all but the most extreme cases and improving information sharing to address mental health issues.</p><p>The Fulton County, Georgia district attorney expected to announce whether to charge the officers involved in Rayshard Brooks' death. Three charges are being considered against now fired Atlanta officer Garrett Rolfe, including felony murder.</p><p>Meanwhile Atlanta fire officials have released new photos of a woman that they believe was involved in setting a Wendy's on fire during protests over Brooks' death. They're offering a reward for information.</p><p>Google is under scrutiny this morning after blocking the financial blog ZeroHedge from advertising on its platform over posts in its comments section. The technology giant also threatening to take that same step against \"The Federalist\" for violating its policies on dangerous or derogatory content. Google says \"The Federalist\" removed its comments section after it warned it could cut off the company's ad revenue.</p><p>Senator Ted Cruz sending a letter to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, saying that the company is abusing its monopoly power to censor political speech.</p><p>And the Justice Department reportedly set to propose limits on legal protections for big tech firms like Twitter, Google and Facebook. According to \"The Wall Street Journal\" the proposed reforms could be announced as soon as today and are aimed at forcing Internet companies to crack down on illicit and illegal content on their sites.</p><p>President Trump recently signed an executive order targeting legal protections of social media companies in response to concerns about alleged online censorship.</p><p>Conservative censorship on the Web. NBC News' verification center forced to backtrack this morning after allegedly pushing Google to ban ads on a conservative Web site. The report says that the technology giant planned to demonetize both ZeroHedge and \"The Federalist\" over racist content in their comments section. Google viewed the issue and said that \"The Federalist\" was never demonetized because it removed comments on its site.</p><p>Joining me right now is former White House press secretary and Fox News contributor Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Sarah -- it's great to see you again. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Great to be with you. Thanks -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well it's interesting that Google can force \"The Federalist\" to eliminate their comment section. It's not like \"The Federalist\" wrote the comments. These are comments from people who read articles on \"The Federalist\" and want to comment on them. And yet Google said if you don't remove that comments section we are going cut into your ad revenue.</p><p>SANDERS: I think it's a very dangerous game for Google to start playing the censorship card particularly if they're going to focus all their efforts of censorships on conservative Web sites. And if they don't do the same on liberal Web sites I think it shows a very clear bias and sends a very clear message about where they are leaning and where they are pushing people to go,</p><p>I think that is a very dangerous road for them to go down. Just like the media shouldn't take a role in elections, Google and other big tech companies shouldn't either. They need to put information out there and let Americans decide for themselves where they are going to go.</p><p>I have seen some pretty outrageous comments on a lot of liberal Web sites about the President and people in his administration, myself included, that have never been taken down, never been asked to be removed by companies like Google.</p><p>And I think this is a very dangerous road and one they should think very carefully about before they travel down it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's probably one of the reasons that there are real questions about new legislation that will remove any protections that these social media companies have in terms of not getting sued because they are not content creators. In fact Devin Nunes says that is exactly what they are -- content creators.</p><p>SANDERS: That is certainly what they are becoming. And they're moving more into that space.</p><p>And again I think that that is a difficult place for them to travel down. Particularly we have seen so much intensity focused on censorship of conservatives but not that same level of scrutiny placed on liberal web sites. I think that they are putting themselves in a very bad position. And not a very good one I think moving forward over the -- as we particularly get closer to the election. And something I think they should take a big step back from and that's across the board for big tech and social media platforms.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Sarah -- so many people in the media are upset with, and you experienced this firsthand, President Trump and the treatment of the media by people within the administration.</p><p>However, I will point out to quote Sean Davis, the co-founder of \"The Federalist\" that it is in fact NBC News that is interfering in the coverage of an election. Here is what Sean Davis wrote on Twitter. \"NBC News is in a lot of trouble given that they conspired with a secretive foreign outfit -- he's referring to the U.K. Center for Countering Digital Hate -- to defame 'the Federalist' and seek to interfere in U.S. elections by trying to get publications banned and de-platformed in the middle of the 2020 election.\"</p><p>So remember, some members of the media clearly need to hold up a mirror and look in it if they want to talk about the destruction of our constitutional protections of freedom of speech and the destruction of trust in the media.</p><p>SANDERS: Absolutely. I think one of the things that we have seen a significant amount of, particularly over the last several years, is Democrats and liberals are all for freedom of speech as long as what you are saying is what they also believe.</p><p>If you don't, then they want to shut that down. They want to censor it. They want to close you down. And I think that we see that more and more through the big tech companies. I think again, they have got to take some real steps to correct this and make sure that they are not playing content creation but they're simply providing a platform for other people to put information out there. Otherwise, I think they are going to find themselves in a lot of hot water moving forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Let me ask you about John Bolton, former national security adviser. John Bolton now being sued by the Trump administration over the release of his new book.</p><p>So the department of Justice says that the memoir still contains classified any information that could compromise national security and should be blocked from release next week. The book's publisher says Bolton has fully cooperated with security guidelines -- Sarah. Your reaction.</p><p>SANDERS: Look, I have not read the book so it's hard to comment on specifics. But what I do know is I was in the room with the President far more than John Bolton over the last three years. And based on what I am hearing about the book, in my experience what I saw was a president who loves this country, spent every day trying to make it better.</p><p>John Bolton echoed that message of the President and publicly said a lot of very nice things about the President, right up until the moment he got fired.</p><p>I find that to be extremely interesting. He had a moment that he could have testified under oath if he thought that there were impeachable offenses. He didn't. He often had an agenda that ran contrary to the President's.</p><p>And I think what we are seeing right now is an effort to sell more books by John Bolton.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SANDERS: And I think it is a sad thing and a bad thing for the country, that he has chosen to go down this road.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Let's talk Father's Day -- just around the corner this upcoming Sunday -- Sarah. We've got your father with us on the panel today. What do you have planned for Sunday -- Sarah?</p><p>SANDERS: Unfortunately I'm not going to get to be with my dad. But we have been able to spend some time together, and you, know I used to think that I was a pretty big deal to my dad. And then I had my own kids and I quickly learned that I didn't matter anymore. And it was all about the grandkids which is perfectly fine.</p><p>And they've had a great time, getting to spend some time with their Papa and hopefully we will have many home made cards from them for him on Sunday.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about it -- Governor. You must be so proud.</p><p>HUCKABEE: I would say \"Sarah who?\" You know, I have these six wonderful grandchildren -- three by Sarah, three by my other son. I don't even recognize her except when I see her on television.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't believe you.</p><p>SANDERS: It's a sad day. It's a sad day.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Too bad you're not going to see each other on Father's Day. Yes. And we see your posts and your beautiful family -- Sarah. Congrats to you.</p><p>SANDERS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Great to see you this morning -- Sarah. Sarah Sanders. Governor Huckabee -- great to have you all morning long with us. We've got a lot to talk about this morning.</p><p>Coming up, I'll be speaking with Mr. Equity Partners founder chairman and CEO Robert Smith on diversity in small business funding. Don't miss that.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Retail's record jump. Futures are up this morning. Investors optimistic over record consumer spending. Yesterday we saw the May sales report seeing the largest increase on record. Retail sales were up 17.7 percent in the month May. Overall sales are still down 8 percent from February.</p><p>Joining me right now is Wells Fargo Investment Institute president Darrell Cronk. Darrell -- great to see you.</p><p>What did you make of that retail sales number yesterday? I guess it did give some credibility to the report on jobs just a few days earlier when we saw 2.5 million jobs created in the month of May.</p><p>DARRELL CRONK, PRESIDENT, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE: Yes. You're exactly right -- Maria. Good morning.</p><p>So it's the strongest reading on record. And if you get into each of the categories the spending was kind of off the charts across almost every category. So there is just absolutely nothing bad at all about the retail sales numbers.</p><p>Your point is well taken if you couple it with the jobs report, from a couple of Fridays ago. And then also if you start looking at things like what we've seen with mortgage applications investigations setting an 11- year-high already this morning that (INAUDIBLE) released.</p><p>The NFIB numbers were much better which is a good proxy of small business. We have seen the University of Michigan consumer sentiment number move higher and even the consumer comfort numbers moved higher. So the data of late has certainly been much better and well received by the markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what do you want to do then in terms of investing? We've got Alli McCartney on the panel this morning. And Alli -- you've been talking about midcap companies.</p><p>MCCARTNEY: Yes, I think a lot of the data that we have just talked about has already been priced in. That is why we're trading at, you know, over 20 times next year's earnings and it's sort of thrown out this year's earnings.</p><p>And so the question is if we are a little overvalued, and if a lot of this good news and good data is priced in, then where do we find opportunity.</p><p>And we're starting to look at the midcap space because large cap growth has been what has taken us out of the bear market. And we see a lot of room and cyclicality and bottoming in the numbers that will have midcap which is also very value-oriented taking out from here.</p><p>Darrell -- what is your positioning on growth versus value? And do you feel a lot of this good news is priced into the market already when you have risks being put in front us like we're seeing second waves in other countries?</p><p>CRONK: Yes, it's a great point -- Alli. So we actually like midcaps. I've liked midcaps for some time. My two favorite areas within the (INAUDIBLE) markets today continue to be large and midcap stocks over small caps. We like domestic over international. And we continue to like cyclical over value.</p><p>There has been rotation of late in valuing, certainly make an argument that that there is cheaper valuations there, or better more attractive valuations. We still think areas like technology, consumer discretionary, (INAUDIBLE) services are what's going to continue to lead the market higher. There is a value play that we like here. We think financials do make some sense. You're getting paid handsomely in the dividend yield while you wait.</p><p>Most of the financials are trading far less than their tangible book value (INAUDIBLE). So there is some good opportunity within the market but you do have to be selective. You're right. I wouldn't tell them to dig in (ph) they were cheap at the industry levels we are looking at today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Darrell -- are you expecting anything out of Jay Powell today? The Federal Reserve chairman gearing up for day two of his semiannual congressional testimony? Yesterday, of course, here is what he said about the economy.</p><p>CRONK: Yes --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>POWELL: The last thing I will say is this. It's all quite uncertain but we appear to be entering that second phase of the economy reopening and businesses reopening and spending increasing. In the long run, I am confident positive that we will have full recovery.</p><p>The fact is we've had the largest economic shock in living memory and the economy is going to recover from that. But we just have to be a little patient with it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Darrell -- all this as the Fed is now buying corporate bonds directly from eligible lenders. Don't fight the Fed? What do you do? Do you do what the Fed does?</p><p>CRONK: Yes. Certainly the latest trade has been to buy what Chair Powell is buying. They announced Monday what they call the secondary market corporate credit facility which is what they'll use to buy up to $250 billion worth of corporate bonds in the market.</p><p>It's been 85 days since they announced the parameters (ph) -- just now launching it. So we think corporate bonds and what we call spread products still make sense here as you think about the back half of the year. There's all kinds of firepower. You couple that with what they just announced Monday with the launch of the Main Street lending program which also has $600 billion worth of ammunition that the Boston Fed will purchase up to 95 percent of those loans.</p><p>There is some opportunities we still think in the fixed income markets. Where the Fed goes we want to go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok. That's what I was -- that's what I was thinking. Follow the Fed.</p><p>Darrell -- it's great to get your insights this morning. Thank you -- sir. We will see you soon. Darrell Cronk joining us there.</p><p>Stay with us. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg diving into politics. The Facebook CEO writing an op-ed in \"USA Today\" outlining his plan to get out the vote this November. Zuckerberg writes this, \"I believe Facebook has a responsibility, not just to prevent voter suppression which disproportionately targets people of color, but also to actively support well-informed voter engagement, registration and turnout.\" Zuckerberg also announced users will be able to turn off political ads as part of a new feature.</p><p>Governor Huckabee -- what do you think about that?</p><p>HUCKABEE: You know, Zuckerberg seems to get it in a way that a lot of the other tech execs don't. he's not perfect for sure but at least he recognizes that it's the consumer that ought to turn off the political ads, not the media giant. And I appreciate him for doing that. Well done -- Zuckerberg.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you think is going to happen here though? I mean all of this pressure on social media and media companies in general to make sure, and not at least put -- get perceived as covering up speech, censoring free speech. The DOJ obviously making moves today. How does this play out in your view?</p><p>HUCKABEE: I think these companies have one of two choices. they either start acting like a common carrier and they don't try to regulate what people say. They simply provide a platform.</p><p>Or else the government is going to bust them up and they're going to bust them up hard. And frankly, I don't see them having enough good common sense to make the decision on their own. I think we are going to see antitrust actions, civil suits and they're going to be split all to pieces.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Dagen -- what do you think?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Some of what Mark Zuckerberg is doing is posturing because he's trying to at least look better than the other large tech companies that are monopolies that like Google is working in cahoots with the media organization to shut down -- NBC News -- to shut down another media organization.</p><p>But in terms of these bastions of liberal and progressive thought. That is what these technology companies are. They need to start walking the talk. I say it over and over again. But if you look at black America -- 13 percent of this country, the population is made up of black Americans. At Facebook the overall workforce, less than 4 percent of the workforce at Facebook is black.</p><p>In technical jobs it is 1.5 percent. That is appalling. So they need to start stepping up. And I'm going to call them out as much as I can because what they are doing in terms of hiring practices is really, really frightening.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Important -- important issue that you raised.</p><p>Investors are waiting on some housing data this morning. that housing data will be out in moments. We will bring you those numbers on the other side of this break.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Wednesday June 17th. Your top stories right now, 6:32 a.m. on the East coast.</p><p>Markets are higher this morning. Looking to extend yesterday's big rally. Take a look. Dow futures up 147 points right now. We had a pretty good pop in the last 20 minutes. The NASDAQ is up 56 and the S&amp;P 500 higher by 16. This on top of a big rally yesterday sparked by that much stronger than expected retail sales report. At the close on Wall Street yesterday, the Dow Industrials were up 526 points, that was better than two percent. The NASDAQ was up 169 and the S&amp;P was up 58.</p><p>Global markets also with a firmer tone this morning for the most part, European indices, take a look, green across the board. FT100 up 45, the Quatre Quarante in Paris up 45 as well, and the DAX Index in Germany up 65. Inflation slowing in the Eurozone this morning. May consumer prices out, falling 1/10th of a percent month over month.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were mostly higher with the exception of Japan, take a look. Japan reporting May exports down 28 percent year over year. Meanwhile in China, Beijing is closing schools, blocking off some neighborhoods and cancelling flights as it sees another spike in coronavirus cases. This time in Beijing. Nonetheless, the Asian markets mostly higher.</p><p>Major job cuts at Hilton to report. Cheryl Casone with those details now. Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: That's right Maria, good morning. Hilton is cutting 2,100 jobs worldwide, or about 22 percent of the workforce following the collapse in travel from the COVID-19 pandemic. Hilton is also extending corporate pay cuts, furloughs and reduced ours for up to three more months. Hilton CEO says this is the first time in the company's 101 year history that a global crisis has virtually halted travel and he's devastated that he had to make this move, but they need to protect the busines. Hilton has more than 6,100 properties in 188 countries and territories. Taking a look a the stock, it is unchanged in the premarket. Down though, about 30 percent this year.</p><p>Well, beginning today, US Facebook user are going to have the option to completely turn off all political advertising on their feed. After the company announced they would not fact check or moderate the ads. In a post Mark Zuckerberg said for those of you who have already made up your minds and want the election to just, well, be over, we hear you. Facebook also launched a new push to register voters. Users are going to see a voting information center on their feeds. The goal register four million they say. There's the stock in the premarket. It's up about half a percent.</p><p>Well here's a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. Apple is reopening more than 70 stores in the US this week after the coronavirus pandemic forced a mass shutdown in March. Elon Musk says SpaceX is developing offshore floating space ports to launch travel to the Moon, Mars and hypersonic travel. And finally this, NBA players who choose not to play when the season resumes reportedly won't face disciplinary action. They've got until June 24th to decide. And those are your headlines from the newsroom, Maria. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alright, Cheryl. Thank you so much. Addressing trade imbalances this morning. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer set to testify before the House Ways and Means Committee later this morning. The USTR reportedly expected to call for a global reset in tariff's as the Trump administration wages battle with the World Trade Organization. Joining me right now is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. Mister Secretary, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks very much for joining me.</p><p>WILBUR ROSS, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF COMMERCE: Thank you for having me on, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What are you trying to do in terms of tariff's now with the World Trade Organization?</p><p>ROSS: Well the President has always had the idea that tariff's should be reciprocal. If some country charges us X, we shouldn't only chart them a fraction of that. His real purpose, though, is to bring them down everywhere. So, reciprocal is important, low is important, and I think you'll hear Trade Rep Lighthizer talking about structural reforms to the WTO itself.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Have you gotten any response on any of this? Do you expect that we will see tariff's go lower across the world?</p><p>ROSS: Well, it's a very much more complicated story, because every country is a little bit different. But US historically has been, and remains today, the lowest, less protectionist country. And we have the trade deficits to show for it. So, the real problem is getting the other countries to be less protectionist.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Secretary I want to switch gears, ask about Huawei. We were all very surprised yesterday to learn the news that the Commerce Department is now allowing American companies to work with Chinese telecom giant Huawei on setting 5G standards. Will this normalize, will this move normalize and elevate a company that has ties to the Chinese government we know that this is a state run company. And that there back doors and the data goes back to the Chinese Communist Party. Why the change?</p><p>ROSS: Well, the change is really simply a clarification. It isn't that we're doing something to help Huawei. What we're doing is something to make it easier for global standards to be symmetrical. If our companies are not allowed to participate in the setting of standards, you'll have the same kind of problem that occurred many years ago when cell phones were early. You couldn't have a cell phone that worked in Japan and also worked in Korea, because they hadn't adopted a common standard. So, the idea of this is to make sure that standards are symmetrical, that they're worldwide and that with 5G, they facilitate the interconnectedness of everything. Every person, everything, every factory, every process, that's the whole idea of 5G. So, this is not anything to help 5G in Huawei, this is to help make sure we have ubiquity in 5G.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, is there any reason that there should be vulnerabilities here by the use of Huawei and just the work with American companies? Should we be worried that there is a vulnerability and the opportunity to spy, given the Huawei connection?</p><p>ROSS: Well, we are very opposed to the use of Huawei for 5G, and we've been explaining our purposes to countries all around the world. And they're gradually getting to realize it. There really is a vulnerability with 5G that's much more severe than it had been with 4G, 3G, 2G. So, we think it's very important, as you know, FCC is banning the use of Huawei in this country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>ROSS: Many other countries are limiting the use of it, and the problem with the security issue on Huawei is you'll never really know if there was a back door until they decide to open it, and that's far too late.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, sure. What about this subcommittee of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee? Recently concluding an investigation, Secretary, into four Chinese Communist Party telecom companies for pretty much operating in this country, spying on American telecom companies for a long time, using their access to American carriers to conduct essentially unchecked espionage against the US. How worried are you about these four Chinese telecom companies that apparently have been embedded in US companies for decades?</p><p>ROSS: Well, as you know, the FCC is taking action against them. And I think that's the correct thing to do. It's clear that one of the reasons that Huawei is so aggressive in its pricing is that it has motives, perhaps other than just providing commercial service. That's what we have great concern about. And that's what FCC is dealing with. You look at Huawei is under Federal indictment for several serious offenses, that's why the CEO's daughter, who is also the Chief Financial Officer, has been under house arrest in Canada, for well over a year, because she's trying to fight extradition to the United States, so she can be tried.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>ROSS: Among the things she is being charged with is bank fraud.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you, I know this administration has been very tough and severe on this issue, but these companies, I'm talking China Mobile, China Telecom, China Unicom and ComNet. Three of those are actually traded on the New York Stock Exchange. So, I mean, some people have made the case that we're actually paying the CCP to spy on us, given that they're raising dollars, they're raising funding by being listed on our exchanges, and yet, their business is to spy on American companies.</p><p>ROSS: Well, where stock is traded has very little to do with these other issues. But the President has directed the government to look into the accounting procedures that Chinese companies use, because many of us feel that those procedures are not adequate, they're not adequate to protect American investors.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Okay.</p><p>ROSS: Their whole concepts of auditing and financial principals in accounting are not the same as ours, so that's a whole separate issue, but the spying is a very real issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Absolutely.</p><p>ROSS: Very real issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's a real issue. Yeah, I mean that's why I want to make sure to communicate it, because our audience needs to know this. Real quick before we go. Let me squeeze in this question about potential $1 trillion dollar infrastructure package being spoken about by the administration in an effort to boost the economy. 5G wireless infrastructure would be part of that package. Is this something the administration is considering?</p><p>ROSS: Well, President Trump, way back in the campaign days was very much in favor of big infrastructure bill. We've already taken many measures to reduce the time it takes to get an infrastructure project approved. It had been where it could take 10 years to get the approvals in themselves. It had been where it could cost almost 40 percent of the total project just for consultant fees, lawyer fees, things like that. We've gotten rid of a lot of that regulatory morass. Now what we need is funding to do a very significant program for infrastructure. We need rural broadband. We need our airports to be fixed. We need our highways to be fixed. We need our ports.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah.</p><p>ROSS: We need our water infrastructure. We need our electrical grids.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Might we see that this year? Will we see that this year Secretary?</p><p>ROSS: Well, we'll see. It all depends on whether the Congress can get together and decide what activities, how many dollars, how to pay for it, and whether to just keep it a pure infrastructure bill, which is what the Senate wants, or whether they're going to load it up a bunch of goodies, which is what the initial draft from the House said.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sure. Yes, we understand. Secretary, it's good to see you this morning. Thank you so much. We will keep following all of that.</p><p>ROSS: Thank you Maria. Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very important conversation. We'll see you soon. Have a good day. Secretary Wilbur Ross. Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. A possible game changer in the fight against coronavirus. A new study shows the inexpensive steroid Dexamethasone can reduce death rates by 1/3 for the most seriously ill patients. Joining us right now is family medicine doctor Mikhail Varshavski, aka, Doctor Mike. Doctor Mike, great to have you. Scientists are calling this a major breakthrough, is it?</p><p>DOCTOR MIKHAIL VARSHAVSKI, FAMILY MEDICINE DOCTOR: Good morning Maria, thank you so much for having me. I think this is a potential huge deal. It's not going to be a cure. It is going to be a very very helpful treatment for those who are on ventilators or on supplemental oxygen. That's where we've seen the biggest benefit in this study. However, Maria, I do have to say that I approach this with a bit of skepticism. At least healthy skepticism, because, I have not seen the full study. None of us has seen the full study. We're getting all this information essentially from press releases by the authors of the study and I'm inclined to trust them, but we have seen in the past few weeks studies coming out, at least preliminary reports to these studies, that were promising, but once the actual studies were released in peer reviewed journal, we found that they weren't exactly as promised. So, I will hold completely until I see the full study published in the coming weeks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you know if the drug has been used to treat COVID-19 patients in the United States yet?</p><p>VARSHAVSKI: Yes, Maria. So, Dexamethasone is a commonly used steroid, both oral and IV, and we use it in several cases, not just in COVID-19 where we have a lot of inflammation going on inside a patient's body. Think sepsis, when you have an infection that potentially starts as a pneumonia and then starts spreading throughout the body through the blood. We use Dexamthasone in these cases. I know several ICU physicians who've used Dexamethasone in COVID-19 cases specifically, in fact one of the spokespeople for Northwell Health, which is one of the biggest providers here in New York, said that they've been using this medicine. So, it's not something that's foreign to physicians, but it's nice to have quality evidence to back up that type of treatment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yeah, really good Op-ed in the Journal this morning from the Vice President that there is no second wave of the coronavirus. He's talking about 23 million tests being taken already, and that we're in a much better shape, much better place than we were just four months ago. Worth a read there. Doctor Mike, it's good to see you this morning sir. Thanks so much. We will see you soon. Mike Varshavski. Stay with us, we'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Time for the morning buzz. First up, don't stand too close. Amazon reportedly testing a new wearable device int it's fulfilment centers to tell workers when they are not social distancing. The clear plastic sleeve has a flashing light and flashing lights and beeping alerts to tell you to move farther away from somebody. Governor Huckabee, what do you think?</p><p>HUCKABEE: I love it. I want to get one. I don't want to work in an Amazon warehouse. It's not that. But I would just like to wear one so that if somebody comes up and wants to be close talker, the alarm goes off. If somebody wants to mug me, the alarm goes off. I think this is great. Everybody ought to have one. It could change the world. It could be a lot of fun watching people step back when they've gotten too close, so way to go Amazon. Another great product.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Alright, next up, a new look for Tom Brady. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers releasing the first look at the famed quarterback in his new uniform. There he is. Brady joining the team after spending the first 20 seasons of his career with the New England Patriots. Nice uniform Dagen, what do you think?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'm very happy for Tampa Bay. It will give, lift people's spirits down in that beautiful part of Florida, but if that's a white jersey, the other color, Florida is really steamy, I would say, well, 12 months out of the year, and you wear those dark colors out in the hot summer Florida sun, or even the winter sun. Man, watch out.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's hot. Finally this, Boston Dynamics putting its four legged Spot robot up for sale. It's one of the business in the United States. This robot is used mostly for surveying and data collection but could be used for other tasks as well. Spot comes at price tag of $74,000, roughly the same cost as a Tesla model S, Alli, what do you think?</p><p>MCCARTNEY: I think I'll take two as long as it'll help me clean my house during this quarantine pandemic.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You need spot.</p><p>MCCARTNEY: Yes. I need lots of spots. Help me with my kids, my work, everything.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's called a Rumba Alli. You've got to buy a Rumba. You don't have a Rumba or like eight Rumba's roaming around your house, come on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Rumba. I've seen that Rumba, but no, I don't have that either. So, I'm with you.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If you've got dogs, they will freak out.</p><p>MCCARTNEY: I have a dog. I've got a puppy and a blind dog.

This presents a potential issue for this technology's effectiveness, with governments suggesting they would require between 60% and 80% uptake across populations[5] for contact tracing to make a difference.This is in addition to approximately two billion mobile phone owners around the world who are unable to use the smartphone-based system, according to the Financial Times[6]. This is because the specific wireless chips needed for the technology to work correctly won't be present in hundreds of millions of handsets still in active use.Advertisement - Article continues belowThe API is built around a mechanism by which individual smartphone emit Bluetooth signals[7] at all times. </p><p>When two smartphone signals come into close proximity, they download key codes to one another's device to register a 'contact'.After users flag whether they are experiencing coronavirus symptoms, or if they have tested positive, all those they've been in contact with are sent alerts. It's expected that any app based on these principles could accelerate the lifting of lockdown restrictions, and protect the population against future outbreaks.There are a string of practical issues that may also impede the rollout of a coronavirus app in the UK, despite the UK government's intentions of developing and releasing technology based on the Google and Apple API as soon as possible.The UK is 'too technically limited' for any such app to be effective[8], according to a rapid-response report prepared by the Ada Lovelace Institute, with technical and social shortcomings likely rendering the task pointless.There may be a heavy degree of imprecision in detecting 'contacts' between smartphones, for example, while mass-take up can only be achieved if there's a high level of public trust in the data-gathering exercise[9].

Oliver[1] MoginRubin[2] MoginRubin Blog[3] Google says cookies are good. They are critical to generating advertising revenue and they help the company improve its product from functionality and privacy perspectives.Competing search engines do more to give users control over how these tiny tracking files monitor them. In April Google said it would move in that direction. It has since come out strongly against their complete elimination, however, arguing that it would be bad for privacy. </p><p>Without cookies, Google says, more risky tracking methods will proliferate. This increasingly heated debate comes at a time when, just this month, Google's YouTube was found in violation of federal law for tracking children.Despite Google's public statements, asWall Street Journalreporter Patience Haggin put it, a 'full-on cookie crackdown isn't happening.' Haggin also quoted Princeton University computer science Assistant Professor Jonathan Mayer, who said, 'This notion that blocking cookies is bad for privacy is completely disingenuous.' Enhanced Tracking Protection Google's Chrome isn't as strict about cookies as are Firefox, Safari and DuckDuckGo, and these competitors know it. On Sept. 3, for example, Mozilla Corp. announced that its Firefox desktop and Android versions will \u2014 by default \u2014 'empower and protect all our users by blocking third-party tracking cookies and cryptominers.' Firefox's 'Enhanced Tracking Protection' will be the default for all users worldwide. As of June new users were already enjoying this enhanced protection. Anti-tracking is 'core to delivering on our promise of privacy and security as central aspects of your Firefox experience,' Mozilla said.Apple's Safari allows Mac users to prevent trackers from using cookies and website data to track them, and has 'block all cookies' and 'remove stored cookies and data' options, which means 'websites, third parties, and advertisers can't store cookies and other data on your Mac,' according to the company.Google's online policies explain what it is tracking: user search terms, videos watched, interactions with content and ads, voice and audio information, purchases, people with whom users communicate, activity on third-party sites and apps, user GPS locations, and information about equipment near mobile devices, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices.But the company says it's trying to be a good guardian of private information. Google is socializing a proposal to 'give people more visibility into and control of the data used for advertising,' and says it wants more feedback from industry and other stakeholders.The company says discussion of the proposal - which is postedHERE[4]- should revolve around principals that users should have transparency, choice and control over how they are tracked. Google says: Users should have transparency.They should be able to easily see and understand how their data is being collected and used for ads. Users should have choice.Their choices about how they experience the web should be respected and any attempts to bypass those choices should be prevented. Users should have control.They should have the ability to adjust how their data is collected and used to tailor the ads they see, including whether those ads are personalized at all. Search engine DuckDuckGo has always made privacy its primary differentiator over competitors. The company's banner says 'DuckDuckGo does not collect or share personal information. That is our privacy policy in a nutshell.' Beyond Search Engines: Websites Track Us, Too In a recent post, DuckDuckGo wrote that tracking restrictions cannot end with search engines and called for stricter anti-tracking legislation.'Our recent study on the Do Not Track (DNT) browser setting indicated that about a quarter of people have turned on this setting, and most were unaware big sites do not respect it,' according to DuckDuckGo. 'That means approximately 75 million Americans, 115 million citizens of the European Union, and many more people worldwide are, right now, broadcasting a DNT signal. All of these people are actively asking the sites they visit to not track them. Unfortunately, no law requires websites to respect your Do Not Track signals, and the vast majority of sites, including most all of the big tech companies, sadly choose to simply ignore them.'In May, DuckDuckGo proposed the Do-Not-Track Act of 2019 that would ban allowing third-party tracking as a default setting, and would not allow first-party tracking beyond the users' expectations. Shortly afterwards, Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), proposed legislation with language similar to the DuckDuckGo proposal. YouTube's 'Infinite Smorgasbord' In the midst of these escalating privacy concerns,Politicofirst reported that the Federal Trade Commission voted to fine Google '$150 million to $200 million' to settle accusations that Google's YouTube is illegally collecting personal information about children in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). On Sept. 4 the FTC announced that the proposed settlement was $170,000, requiring the company to pay $136 million to the FTC and $34 million to New York. The commissioners voted for the settlement 3-2.The proposed settlement also requires Google and YouTube to 'develop, implement, and maintain a system that permits channel owners to identify their child-directed content on the YouTube platform so that YouTube can ensure it is complying with COPPA.' The companies must: notify channel owners that their child-directed content may be subject to COPPA; comply with the law; provide notice about their data collection practices; and obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children.The amount of the FTC fine has been criticized.Politicoquoted Josh Golin of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood as saying that any fine should both 'level the playing field' and deter violations of COPPA. 'This fine would do neither,' Golin told Politico reporter Margaret Harding McGill. Given how quickly Google and YouTube can make that amount in ad revenue, the fine should have been 'at least half a billion dollars,' Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, told McGill. 'It sends the signal that you in fact can break a privacy law and get away largely scot-free,' he said.Dissenting FTC Commissioner Rebecca Kelly Slaughter said that, given this relatively low fine, she was concerned that 'the vast universe of content creators' would conclude in their cost-benefit analyses that 'the perceived payoff of monetizing child-directed content through behavioral advertising outweighs the perceived risk of being caught violating COPPA.'She said that unlike the old three-channels of Saturday morning cartoons, YouTube is a 'virtually infinite smorgasbord of content with more than 23 million channels that upload a combined 500 hours of video every minute.' Much of that content comes from small producers outside the U.S. who would be difficult to investigate. It will be expensive for them to secure a designation that their content is produced for children, she said. Given how difficult it would be to enforce COPPA globally, the FTC's order falls short of its goals.'The order does not require YouTube to police the channels that deceive by mis-designating their content, such as by requiring YouTube to put in place a technological backstop to identify undesignated child-directed content and turn off behavioral advertising,' Slaughter wrote. Commentary As with all privacy issues, this one comes down to disclosure and consumers' degree of control. Most browser customers value the services and convenience cookies provide and would opt to keep them if given the option. Who wants to reset a dozen usernames and passwords every week? I would be shocked if cookies were banned altogether.But, importantly, this example shows us that while they may claim otherwise, the 'FANG' gang (FacebookAmazonNetflix and Google) do not view privacy assurances as an important competitive benchmark. That is why privacy self-regulation simply won't cut it in the modern, shareholder-driven, digital age. After all, DuckDuckGo may lead the pack on browser privacy, but most of you are reading this in a Chrome browser window.Edited for MoginRubin LLP by Tom Hagy.

Firing fallout, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman announcing he is leaving office, just hours after U.S. Attorney General William Barr said President Trump fired the powerful prosecutor.</p><p>The move comes after Berman disputed Barr's earlier claim that he was stepping down, a lot of back and forth that started Friday night.</p><p>In a letter to Berman Bill Barr wrote this, because you have declared that you have no intention of resigning, I have asked the president to remove you as of today and he has done so.</p><p>Senator Lindsey Graham says he won't move forward with replacing Berman until he receives from approval from Senators and Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, the two senators from New York.</p><p>Joining us now former White Water Independent Counsel, former Federal Prosecutor Robert Wray. And also here with me all morning long Pollster and Maslansky and Partners President Lee Carter. PwC Partner Mitch Rochelle. And RealClearPolitics Co-founder and President Tom Bevan, welcome one and all.</p><p>Robert Wray, to you first, what do you make of this Berman getting shown the door over the weekend? The \"Wall Street Journal\" has an editorial about it and it's -- they call it your average Trump melodrama. That it was inartfully handled if you will, but -- and it could distract from Bill Barr's attempt to actually clean up the Justice Department.</p><p>ROBERT WRAY, FORMER WHITEWATER INDEPENDENT COUNSEL: Dagen, it wasn't the smoothest rollout, but I don't think anybody questions the authority of the president to make a change.</p><p>I -- the only thing here that, you know, in terms of what the end result will be, it's rather unfortunate to think that there isn't a nominee that could be proposed that would satisfy the two New York Senators.</p><p>I hope that's not the case and I understand they're -- they're concerns, but right now, of course, the result is that the office will be led by an acting U.S. attorney who was Mr. Berman's deputy, and the president has the right to fill that -- that position.</p><p>So, I don't know that this is the end of the story, it was a rather tumultuous from Friday night all the way through the weekend, but it doesn't change the fact that the president wants to make the change in the Southern District of New York and that change should be made, and it shouldn't have to wait until after the election.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The \"Wall Street Journal\" in its editorial writes that, you know, people -- people on the left, the Democrats are using this narrative -- this to create the narrative that this is an attempt to protect political allies. There is one minor investigation going on into Rudy Giuliani, Trump Advisor, according to the editorial.</p><p>But again, the whole point is, is that replacing Berman with a -- Jay Clayton was who they wanted to nominate for the job, who is running the Securities and Exchange Commission, but again, removing Berman isn't making cases go away.</p><p>Explain to the audience the way that the SDNY, the Southern District of New York, the whole Justice Department exists their career -- their career attorneys in this entire division and the -- these -- replacing the head of SDNY doesn't make them disappear.</p><p>WRAY: Well correct. I mean, Dagen, there's about 200 Assistant U.S. Attorneys in that office, at least 100 of which are in the criminal division and many of them are -- are young and they -- the office has a long tradition of independents. That will continue whoever is running the office and whoever the president's appointment is.</p><p>But again, I -- you know, I think this was a long time coming. I know that the Democrats narrative on this, is that this constitutes yet again another effort by the Attorney General to attempt to obstruct justice on the president's behalf.</p><p>There's no evidence or indication that that's the case and I understand they'll have a -- you know, a boat load of former federal prosecutors try to come write another letter, you know, claiming that Attorney General Barr should be impeached or should resign.</p><p>I don't -- I think that's far from the case here. I think that's, again, more melodrama, but the substance of this is that the president is entitled to have his choice running that office. It's in the interest of justice and it's apparently what the attorney general wants.</p><p>He's entitled to have a relationship that's a good one between him and the person who's leading the most prominent and the most important U.S. Attorney's Office in the country.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, Geoffrey Berman was never nominated and confirmed by the Senate. He was a judicial appointment and it was within the president's power and right to fire him if he wanted.</p><p>I want to move on to Attorney General William Barr, in an interview with Maria Bartiromo, hinting at when more details on the origins of the Russia Probe will be out. Maria sat down with Barr in an exclusive interview and asked him about the Derm (ph) Investigation. He explained the delays on \"Sunday Morning Futures.\" Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Has he been delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic?</p><p>BARR: There has been delay because of the pandemic. Yes there has.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And an inability to interview people?</p><p>BARR: Yes. Not an inability, but a distinct slowing down of that process.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Because you can't gather a grand jury?</p><p>BARR: Well, I don't -- I don't want to suggest there has been or is a grand jury, but it is a fact that there have been not grand juries in virtually all districts for a long period of time. And also, people have been reluctant to travel for interviews and things like that.</p><p>So, it has slowed things down, but it -- but -- but there's -- he's been working where he can an other matters that aren't affected by the pandemic, but there has been an effect.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Robert Wray, your reaction to that.</p><p>WRAY: Well notice, of course, how careful the attorney general is to not confirm or deny the existence of grand jury investigation and that -- and that's comes by operation of federal rule. He's not really permitted to do so.</p><p>I mean, I think it's pretty clear to many of us on the outside who have experience, that there in fact is a grand jury investigation up and running, but there is no question as the result of the pandemic that a grand jury is not going to be able assemble with the same degree of regulatory that would have otherwise have been the case prior to COVID-19.</p><p>I guess I would say -- what I hope here at the end of the day is that they could get to important conclusions in that Durham investigation before the election. I think the electorates entitled to have the benefit of -- of those results. And I hope we can get there. We still have a number of months left, but it would be ideal if the public had the benefit of that election before November 3.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do you worry that the Berman firing gets in the way of this incredibly important probe, again, into the origins of an investigation into a presidential campaign and ultimately a president with many people working together within Justice and the FBI to basically take down a president?</p><p>WRAY: I mean, I hear the point Dagen, but I really don't think so. I mean, I think this is a weekend distraction, which is the Berman saga. I think that this too shall past. I don't think that really will have an affect on what John Durham is doing and I don't think it's a significant distraction from the Attorney General's ability to shepherd that investigation to a conclusion.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Robert Wray, great to see you. Please come back</p><p>WRAY: Thanks Dagen, take care. Be well.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Take care. You as well.</p><p>We're just getting started this morning. Coming up the Federalist Ben Domenech on big tech censorship, he has experienced that first hand.</p><p>Then in the 7:00 o'clock hour Indiana Congressman Jim Banks on the threat from China and more from Maria's interview with Attorney General William Barr.</p><p>BarkerGilmore Co-founder and Managing Partner John Gilmore on the next jobs in American, and realtor former HGTV host Mike Aubrey on rents plunging in the most expensive cities in the country.</p><p>And in the 8:00 o'clock hour we have the Trump Campaign Senior Advisor Mercedes Schlapp on the president's rally in Tulsa Saturday night. More to come this week.</p><p>Lady Gaga's father, New York City restaurant owner Joe Germanotta on New York's phase two reopening, outdoor dining now allowed.</p><p>You don't want to miss any of these special guests.</p><p>MCDOWELL: President Trump holding his first rally since the coronvirus pandemic in Tulsa, Oklahoma over the weekend, but not without some controversy.</p><p>Blake Burman is here with the latest. Good morning Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hi there Dagen, good morning to you as well. Going into the relauch of these presidential rallies we have been hearing from President Trump and his campaign for days about this record demand to attend and this record demand for tickets.</p><p>However, by the time President Trump took the state on Saturday night in Tulsa, Oklahoma, you could look all around the arena and see batches of empty seats.</p><p>The Trump Campaign, in part, blaming that on the media, saying in a statement Sunday, quote, \"The fact is that weeks' worth of fake news media warning people away from the rally because of COVID and protestors, coupled with recent images of American cities on fire, had a real impact on people bringing their families and children to the rally.\"</p><p>Here is how the president described those who did show up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: To our warriors, I've been watching -- I've been watching the fake news for weeks now and everything is negative. Don't go, don't come, don't do anything. Today it was like, I've never seen anything like it. I've never seen anything like it. You are warriors.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Now, as we start the week the White House and the president will also likely be pressed over these comments the president made regarding -- regarding COVID-19 testing.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: When you do testing to that extent you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases. So, I said to my people, slow the testing down, please. They test and they test. We had tests of people who don't know what's going on. We've got tests. We've got another one over here. They young man's 10 years old, he's got the sniffles, he'll recover in about 15 minutes, that's the case.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Joe Biden responded in a tweet over the weekend writing, quote, \"I can't believe I have to say this, but we should be speeding up testing, not slowing it down.\"</p><p>Now there has been a bit of clean-up from President Trump overnight as he has sent out the following tweet as well, writing quote, \"Our coronavirus testing is so much greater, 25 million tests and so much more advanced that it makes us look like we have more cases, especially proportionally than other countries. My message on that is very clear.\"</p><p>Dagen, back to you</p><p>MCDOWELL: Black Burman, thank you so much for that.</p><p>Joining now, Trump Presidential Campaign Principal Deputy of Communications Director Erin Perrine. Erin, you attended Saturday's rally. How can you assure the president -- he's got rallies coming up this week, I believe, in Arizona and Wisconsin, that the places are packed, that you don't have that many empty seats.</p><p>ERIN PERRINE, TRUMP CAMPAIGN PRINCIPAL DEPUTY COMM. DIRECTOR: What we saw was an enthusiastic crowd for President Trump to be able to get his message out there.</p><p>Not only were people wanting to be there, but we were right when we said that there was a real issue when it came to people feeling comfortable being able to go because of what was being reported in the news.</p><p>But those who went had a great time. We saw over 12,000 people be able to attend President Trump's speech. And so, we're going to continue that ground swell. And when you couple that with the over 10 million views online, just on the Team Trump broadcast, we know that that message from President Trump was far and wide received and we feel good about what were able to do on Saturday.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Tom Bevan, jump in.</p><p>TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER OF REALCLEARPOLITICS: Erin, I just want to get your sense of where this race stands right now. We're under five months until the election. Donald Trump is behind in our RealClearPolitics national average about 9.5 points and is behind in some of these key swing states like Florida and Michigan, Pennsylvania.</p><p>Is that your sense of where this race is, or do you guys see -- see things differently? And if so, you know, what's the game plan moving forward over the coming months?</p><p>PERRINE: Yes, so internally we see that when we match up President Trump with a defined Joe Biden, the president is competitive in every state across the country and we are close if not leading in those states.</p><p>So, it's our job to continue to get the message out there about Joe Biden's failed 40 years of policies in D.C. So, we will continue that fight. And we fought the greatest ground game that's ever existed in presidential politics.</p><p>We've got millions of volunteers engaged. We're doing volunteer trainings remotely and in person across the country, contacting over -- making over 40 million voter contacts. We're going to continue to do that all the way to Election Day.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Joe Biden out-raised President Trump though, at least in the month of May by $7 million. I know that the Trump Campaign has more cash on hand, but are your focused on ramping up that fundraising?</p><p>PERRINE: We're going to continue to bring in money and most of our money comes from small dollar donors across the board for the campaign. We actually had record setting month for May and we're over $800 million on this campaign, with $200 million cash on hand. Those are hardworking Americans giving to support President Trump.</p><p>So, we're going to continue to fight for every vote and every dollar to make sure we get the president's message out there, because we want to be able to hold those trainings and continue to push online and across the board.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Erin, thank you for being here this morning. Have a great week.</p><p>PERRINE: Thanks. You too.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Erin Perrine. Coming up a tech cold war, Attorney General Bill Barr telling Maria what the U.S. may do in the race for 5G.</p><p>Plus censoring controversy, Federalist Publisher Co-founder Ben Domenech on his platform being silenced by Google with the help of NBC News.</p><p>MCDOWELL: This Fox Business alert, Attorney General William Barr breaking the news to Maria Bartiromo on \"Sunday Morning Futures\" yesterday saying the U.S. must rally behind telecommunications companies like Ericcson and Nokia that pose the strongest threat against Chinese telecom giant Huawei. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIMORO: Would the U.S. consider acquiring Ericcson and Nokia to send a message tot eh world that if you use if Ericcson and Nokia you've got the backing of the United States government as an alternative to Huawei?</p><p>BARR: So, I -- I mean, I -- I gave a speech a while back saying that it was -- that two companies best positioned to compete with Huawei are Ericcson and Nokia, but unlike Huawei, Huawei has the backing of the Chinese government and all the Chinese government money.</p><p>So, just to give you an example, for 5G network facilities, the total global addressable (ph) market is probably around $90 billion and the Chinese government has set up a fund of 100 -- over 100 billion to subsidize it. So, they can go to countries and say, hey, we'll put this in cash free, you know, very cheap money.</p><p>So, you know, that's -- that's -- that's what we're competing against with -- with Huawei and the companies like Ericcson and Nokia are the -- the strongest western competitors in this sector and I have a speech saying that -- that ultimately the west has to rally around these companies, whether that means private ownership or state involvement.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you would be OK taking a stake, even if it's a minority in -- in these companies to offset the threat of Huawei then?</p><p>BARR: That's not a decision for the Justice Department. I -- I -- I do think that the west has to pick a -- pick a horse or horses.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mitch Rochelle, potentially acquiring -- U.S. acquiring minority stakes in Nokia and Ericcson. What do you make of that?</p><p>MITCH ROCHELLE, PWC PARTNER: It's interesting Dagen. If you look at where we as the United States own enterprises, sort of state-owned enterprises on our part, it's all in the farm banks, the mortgage banks --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I need to hear this.</p><p>ROCHELLE: -- import banks, all of which are relevant to propping up our financial system. So, it stands to reason that if you think that 5G infrastructure is important, we should have the state-owned enterprises own a piece of that so that we can compete globally.</p><p>The fact of the matter is, there are many industries that have foreign (ph) (inaudible) enterprises and it's very difficult for us to compete on the global bases when governments own a piece of the business.</p><p>So, I think there's going to be more discussion about this and 5G is the future of telecommunication, so it stands to reason that this will be something that continues to be out there and discussed.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Lee Carter, your quick reaction?</p><p>LEE CARTER, PRESIDENT OF MASLANSKY AND PARTNERS: I think it's really important that we frame this around the investment in 5G, rather than about being private owned, because I think the United States does need to be involved in the future of 5G, 5G is where it's at.</p><p>We want to be at the forefront, we are about innovation and that's what this needs to be about rather than us versus China owning (inaudible), I think this is really about America innovation and that's what we need to be focuses on.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Coming up, big tech's influence. Attorney General Bill Barr talking to Maria about the platforms sway over content. Essentially Google can put you out of business if it wants to and we talk to a guest who was on the forefront of that.</p><p>Plus, New York City bouncing back, one small business owner who defied state orders, opening his business as the Big Apple rolls into phase two today. We're back after the break.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Welcome back. I'm Dagen McDowell in for Maria Bartiromo. It's Monday, June 22nd. Your top stories at 6:30 a.m. Eastern.</p><p>Futures set for a triple digit gain at the open. 199 point gain on the Dow futures. Stocks in the green across the board despite a sell off Friday over Apple keeping stores closed, some of them amid the pandemic. But it was a winning week for all three major market gauges here.</p><p>In Europe today, stocks there largely flat after erasing earlier losses. The EU and China meeting for a video summit today hoping to ease tensions over coronavirus disinformation. We have losses across the board at the moment, although slight.</p><p>In Asia overnight it was also selling galore on a resurgence of COVID cases. All four major markets there to the downside.</p><p>China revealing new details for Hong Kong's controversial new national security law. Cheryl Casone has more. Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yeah, that's right Dagen. China unveiled the blueprints for the security law over the weekend. It would allow Beijing to override Hong Kong's independent legal system. According to Chinese State Media, a special bureau will be set up in Hong Kong to investigate and prosecute crimes considered threatening to national security. The law also would allow Hong Kong's top official to hand pick which judges hear cases. China's legislature is currently reviewing the proposal.</p><p>Well, China has suspended poultry and pork from the Tyson food plan in Arkansas after hundreds of employees tested positive for COVID-19. The company announced last week that more than 480 workers tested positive for the virus at two facilities in the state. This after outbreaks at plants in North Carolina and Nebraska and Iowa. Tyson foods said in a statement its looking into the reports and added that global health organizations agree there is no evidence to support transmission of the virus through food.</p><p>And then finally, here's a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com. In the streaming wars battle Amazon Prime now offering three times more movies than Netflix. Amazon's Prime Video averages more than 1,400 movies per dollar. As movie theaters start to reopen big blockbusters are slated to debut in July and August, including Disney's Mulan, Tenet, Bill and Ted Face the Music, and Marvel X-Men Reboot, The New Mutants. And finally this, wealthy Americans are flocking to Turks and Caicos to buy luxury real estate, despite the coronavirus pandemic. And those are your headlines Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Keith Richards owns property on Parrott Cay in Turks and Caicos. Just saying. Thank you, Cheryl. Google's crackdown, in the meantime, NBC had reported the tech giant planned to demonetize both Zero Hedge and The Federalist over alleged racist commentary in the comment section. But NBC had reported The Federalist to Google itself. Essentially NBC, a news organization was ratting out a competitor, who had been critical of it, in cahoots with a left wing foreign organization. Google, ultimately reviewing the claims, and asking The Federalist to take down its comment section but allowed it to remain on the advertising platform. Joining me now, the publisher of The Federalist, Ben Domenech. Ben, good morning. What is, what's--</p><p>BEN DOMENECH, PUBLISHER, THE FEDERALIST: Good morning Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Do people understand the gravity of what happened, particularly NBC's actions, in an election year? You want to talk about election interference, but also, the power of Google at this point, to essentially, as I believe you have said, de-platform, demonetize, and put out of business, any publisher it doesn't agree with.</p><p>DOMENECH: Well Dagen I want to first say it's great to be talking to you again, its great to be with you. I want to make a slight correction to what you said, which is that the way that NBC reported this initially.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Sorry.</p><p>DOMENECH: They said that this was because of content on our site, namely an article that we ran that was critical of the media generally, but also of NBC. And that's something that they did at the behest of a foreign based group. A tiny little thing that barely counts as being called a think tank that is designed to go after all types of sites who publish things that they disagree with. What we're really seeing here is the power that small groups have to weaponize these large internet entities against people that they don't like. It's the appeal of radical leftists going after people whose opinions they think don't just, you know, run afoul of their ideas, but shouldn't even see the light of day, or have the financial support to continue staying open. And I think that we're only going to see more of that.</p><p>Google, in this case, I think, embarrassed by the whole situation, came up with the spin that it was because of our comment section. That's something that actually undercuts all of their arguments about section 230, which Attorney General Barr addressed with Maria this weekend in a way that I think clearly sets up a situation where that aspect of our law is going to be reformed.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I'll point out that was the Communications Decency Act, that was two years before Google was even founded that they passed that into law.</p><p>DOMENECH: Yeah.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If you want to talk about how dated it is. Well, you brought up Maria talking to Attorney General Bill Barr on Sunday Morning Futures about big tech's influence over all platforms of free speech. I want you to listen to this and just react.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Google did select The Federalist, Zero Hedge, and try to cut off their advertising revenue. Senator Tom Cotton also told me that he got a call from someone at Twitter who said take down your Tweet immediately about the police needing the military to back them up, otherwise we're deleting your account entirely.</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL: Right. There's something, you know, very disturbing about what's going on. To some extent there was a bait and switch over the past couple of decades. These companies held themselves out as open to all comers. That's how they built up all their membership and their networks. Saying, you know, we have a wide variety of views, people can come in and post their views and their positions and their statements. And that's what led to people to join and then get the strong market position they have. Then, they've switched. Now they're being more selective, and they're starting to censor different viewpoints. But you have this concentration of these very large companies that have that kind of influence on the sharing of information and viewpoints in our society.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ben, where does this go in terms of the government?</p><p>DOMENECH: Well, what I think we're seeing right now a shift in the Overton window in terms of what people are talking about on Capitol Hill, both on the right and the left. I had calls from both Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill, Congressman and Senators about this subject, because they're deeply concerned about the outsized power of big tech. And frankly the ability of small woke leftist mob to target someone within the building, find someone who can flip a switch, and make arbitrary decisions that can ultimately bankrupt or end entire business platforms that exist and depend on these ad networks. We have never seen companies as powerful as this, and Attorney General Barr is correct when he says that this kind of bait and switch. That this was a situation that allowed for the growth of the internet, but now they're acting as if they're still the small scrappy upstarts when in reality they hold total dominant power over these ad networks, over the ability of companies to survive.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But a lot of people saw this building over a period of years, as these companies got bigger and bigger and bigger. And the conservative narrative has always been free market, don't get in the way, government shouldn't pick and choose what companies could be bought by a larger corporation. In fact, I think it was about three years ago, on The Federalist website, you all published, its long, article called Cool It on the Google Monopoly Talk.</p><p>DOMENECH: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Was that part of the problem? Is that the narrative was always that government needs to step back or hands off? And now these corporations are dangerously large.</p><p>DOMENECH: Well I think that there are two aspects at this. One is, of course, that we want to have companies that behave the right way. That are good actors within the marketplace. That are not trying to crush any kind of competition in ways that are underhanded or using government. On the other hand, that requires them to behave in certain ways that are responsible and not become the tools of these woke leftist mobs. If that kind of thing happens, and keep in mind, this is both right and left who have been criticizing these entities. Then inevitably you're going to see a political response. I actually think Google at this point, and a lot of these other companies should start to get their minds around the fact that 230 reform opening up the Communications Decency Act, as you made reference to, might end up being the moderate situation, because otherwise they might end up being viewed as public utilities, where people are completely over regulating them.</p><p>We saw this happen, frankly with the railroads back in the day. Where because of their bad behavior, government stepped in because there was so much consumer outcry. I think at this point, you know, these entities really have to take a hard look at the way that their behaving and who they're actually listening to when they make such serious decisions.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Have people talked about breaking these companies up? I think Elizabeth Warren has been pretty public about it, but is Google going the way of AT&amp;T?</p><p>DOMENECH: You know, I don't know about that. I think it's a little too early to say. But I will say that, you know, we're at a point now where it's kind of like do you want the Elizabeth Warren solution to this or do you want the Josh Hawley solution to this? Because, both right and left, when they agree on something in Washington, you know this Dagen, that's when companies should start to take notice. Because that's when things happen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ben, are you going to be able to bring back the comments section? How's that going to work?</p><p>DOMENECH: We absolutely will. You know, we had a completely unregulated comment section before. Because that's kind of my inclination. But we might to have to have a situation where people have to use a real name log in, or something like that in order to pass muster. We'll see, but we're going to bring back comments. I'm not actually all that big on comments section myself, because I don't think that they're all that productive, but we're not going to be pushed around by some big tech entity telling us what we can and can't do. Of course, now the comment section is essential.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I think everyone should be very very upset, disturbed and afraid of what happened to The Federalist, regard..if you're anybody in this country, regardless of where you fall politically. Because it is a huge abuse of a great deal of power and manipulation. Ben, it was great to see you. Hey, Happy Father's Day. I'm a little late, but you know, that's on deck for you. Mr. Domenech.</p><p>DOMENECH: Thank you so much Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Really exciting for you.</p><p>DOMENECH: Yes, it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Please come back.</p><p>DOMENECH: Thank you very much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Alright, take care.</p><p>DOMENECH: Absolutely.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Bye, Ben Domenech. Coming up, New York City bouncing back. One small business owner who defied state orders and opened his business early now able to legally reopen his business as New York City rolls into phase two. Plus, buying music history. Kurt Cobain's unplugged guitar fetching plenty at auction. We take a look ahead.</p><p>MCDOWELL: New York City once the national epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, coming back, trying to come strong. Restaurants and bars are now open for outdoor dining, while office spaces, in store retail, hair salons, barber shops can welcome people back with limited capacity. Joining me now, the Beard Barberia Founder, the Brooklyn business legally reopening after paying fines for defying lockdown orders last month. The move prompting swift action by the NYPD. Joining us now, the owner of Beard Barberia, Ilya Iskhakov. And I know I just butchered that, and I apologize. Ilya, what are your expectations for today? Do you have customers just on the books ready to come in and wear a mask?</p><p>ILYA ISKHAKOV, OWNER, BEARD BARBERIA: Well, yeah, my customers are ready. They coming in as it is.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ilya, what happened with you trying to reopen when the NYPD came in and then shut you down? What happened with that?</p><p>ISKHAKOV: Well, that was back in May. And they came they try to give a ticket and my customers as well. So, that's the reason why I closed, was because they were going to give my customers tickets. And I wasn't up for it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>ISKHAKOV: I told them to give me a fine, and they said they were going to summon you and your customers. So, that's why I closed. And then when I found out that Long Island was going to open June 10, the barber shops, I was going to risk my customers going to Long Island to get a haircut, because I was out of business for three months. And if I let that happen, then I probably would have been out of business.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Ilya, how are you holding up financially? Were you able to get Paycheck Protection money? Tell us about that.</p><p>ISKHAKOV: No, I didn't get no PPP, because I'm not even sure, but I wasn't qualified for it. But then I opened a small business loan, and now I got a small business loan, that's about it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Are you going to be able, what are your expectations for money coming in the door? Are you hopeful?</p><p>ISKHAKOV: Well, we were the first ones open back in June 8th, so it was a high demand for haircuts, because nobody had haircuts for about three months. And we were very busy, so we were happy with that. But we'll see what's going to happen now.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We wish you the best of luck. Ilya, I'm going to try this, my name Dagen gets mispronounced all the time, Iskhakov, did I get it right?</p><p>ISKHAKOV: It's Iskhakov, close enough.</p><p>MCDOWELL: With a southern accent, nothing sounds right, so, with respect, Ilya, of Beard Barberia, the best of luck to you sir. Coming up, owning music history. Kurt Cobain's unplugged guitar fetching a bundle on the auction block. We take a look.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's time for the morning buzz. First up a piece of rock and roll history. Kurt Cobain's guitar from Nirvana's iconic 1993 MTV unplugged appearance selling for, wait for it, $6 million dollars at auction. The sale, however, a bit controversial. Cobain's daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, lost the guitar to her ex-husband during their divorce. Big legal fight over it. Tom, your reaction.</p><p>BEVAN: Well, I'm from Seattle, so I get it. Kurt Cobain, obviously a huge icon. But, $6 million bucks is an awful lot for a guitar. You know, Dagen I was also thinking about this story, Nirvana and Kurt Cobain, they hated the commercial aspect of the music business, so I was wondering what Kurt Cobain would think about this. Whether he would flattered by it, or horrified by the fact that his guitar sold for this much money.</p><p>MCDOWEL: Well said. Next up, no need to cop out. With call to end police and crime related television shows growing, the Hollywood Reporter says that networks do rely on the genre for their programming. Last season, crime related shows made up 20 percent, 1/5 of all programming on major networks. In 2014 the genre made 29 percent of programming. Mitch.</p><p>MITCH ROSCHELLE, PARTNER AND BUSINESS DEVELOPER, PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS: As far back as I can remember, Dagen, I was watching cop shows on TV. Adam 12, Dragnet, Chips, they were sort of part of my TV upbringing, so I couldn't imagine TV without them, and I hope the cancel culture doesn't eliminate cop shows in television.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Most definitely. And finally, talk about a dream job. Anheuser- Busch owned Devil's Backbone Brewery has created the position of Chief Hiking Officer. The lucky guy or gal will be paid to hike across 14 Appalachian Trail states next year where it will beer parties and document their journey on social media. Lee, what do you think of this? Listen, the Appalachian Trail is extremely, extremely, if you try to hike the whole thing, it is treacherous. But what do you, beer and hiking? Discuss.</p><p>CARTER: Dangerous. But I do think it's an interesting strategy, because look, we're talking them. And this is probably a craft beer we might not have otherwise been talking about. So, I think it's good publicity to try and talk about a craft beer for a niche market. And, why not. But be careful, don't drink and hike too much.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Broken ankle. Torn ACL. I could go down the list. Tom, what do you think of this?</p><p>BEVAN: It's a, obviously, a gimmicky thing. And I think Lee's right, we're talking about, so in that sense it's a success. But yeah, I'm not sure that it's something that people are going be taking to necessarily drinking and hiking.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Mitch, I could see you drinking some booze or beer and hiking. You know, to work off the calories.</p><p>ROSCHELLE: Yeah, no, I could definitely see that. I also have college aged kids. I think there's going to be a whole lot of college aged kids looking for job so, that's who may be signing up. Of course, those who are 21, but those who will be signing up for jobs like this.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, I'm with you. Still ahead, New York City entering phase two. Lady Gaga's dad and restaurant owner Joe Germanotta on how the industry plans to bounce back. Coming up, Mornings with Maria.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020062201cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6067-8XP1-JB20-G4GN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6744\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 22, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

It now seems like \"a quaint relic of the company's early days, when the crayon colours of the Google logo still conveyed the cheerful, idealistic spirit of the enterprise. How long ago that feels.\" The opening lines of Rana Foroohar's new book, Don't Be Evil: The Case against Big Tech, are not only spot on, her timing is perfect. Sergey Brin and Larry Page announced last week that they were </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/google-ready-for-life-without-sergey-brin-and-larry-page-6n7b5xp7d\">stepping down as leaders at Alphabet</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">, parent company of Google, the search engine that the pair founded two decades ago, prompting many to question their record.</p><p>Critics say what started as a benign endeavour to organise the world's information and make it available to all has turned into a corporate Big Brother. The charge sheet is so lengthy it could take up most of this page, but here are some of Google's worst sins.</p><p>Hoovering up our vast digital footprint and using it to deliver hyper-targeted advertisements. Abusing the dominance of its search platform - Google accounts for 93% of search queries worldwide - to promote its own services over those of its rivals. Slashing - legally - its tax bills by setting up webs of overseas companies to funnel revenues away from high-tax economies, such as Britain and Germany, to tax havens.</p><p>Flogging online ads to Russian agents, enabling them to spread misinformation and manipulate the 2016 US presidential election. Publishing extremist material on YouTube, which Google owns, including videos on how to make bombs. Looking the other way on copyright - impoverishing newspapers, magazines, authors, film-makers and musicians.</p><p>Latterly, Brin and Page have been battling their own staff, who have revolted over Google's contracts with the American military and plans - now shelved - to create a Chinese search engine censored by Beijing. Last year 20,000 Google employees walked out over sexual harassment, discrimination and pay inequality.</p><p>It was not always that way, as I found out when I first stepped off a bio-diesel-powered bus and walked through the glistening glass-and-steel curves of the vast Googleplex in Silicon Valley in 2007. Back then Brin and Page were in fine fettle - and not just because of all the free muesli and massages available \"in the Plex\". The world's most successful business double act had convinced themselves and most of the rest of us that they were not just newer, shinier, smarter and, yes, richer than the average entrepreneur, but they were also better because they had a higher moral calling.</p><p>Google would never be like Microsoft, then the poster boy for aggressive monopolistic behaviour. As Page and Brin put it in their 2004 founders' IPO (stock market float) letter: \"Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.\"</p><p>There was nothing sinister about their mission to record, categorise and index \"all the world's information\" and make it available online. They were merely latter-day explorers, mapping human knowledge to help mankind navigate the new information economy. When I raised privacy concerns, they said I'd got the wrong end of the memory stick. Not a single byte of my Google-generated data would ever be made available - far less flogged - to advertisers.</p><p>What went wrong? Why did scrappy, innovative digital utopians become rapacious, arrogant capitalists? Money. Page and Brin soon realised that their hippie-ish dream could be the best cash machine capitalism had ever seen - and that sounded a lot more fun than running a free global public library.</p><p>By dicing and splicing the quadrillions of bytes of data that surge across Google's servers every few minutes, they could enable advertisers to target consumers precisely and effectively and charge a premium for it. So they did. Their firm now rakes in more than $100bn (\u00a376bn) in advertising revenue each year, helping it to a market value close to $1 trillion.</p><p>\"Google has been the pioneer of big data, targeted advertising and surveillance capitalism,\" Foroohar says. \"When it advised its employees not to be evil, it did so because it knew full well that evil was more than a powerful temptation. Evil was baked into the business plan.\"</p><p>Google insists it uses \"data to make our services more useful and to show relevant advertising and we give people the controls to manage, delete or transfer their data\". It adds that it is improving tools that let users limit how much data is captured and how long it is kept. Critics claim few people use these tools or even know they exist.</p><p>Until recently - and for far longer than the likes of Facebook, Uber and Amazon, whose reputations have been tarnished by consumer and regulatory backlash - Brin and Page continued to pull the wool over most people's eyes. It was not hard to see why. Google makes whizzy, free software - not only the best search engine but services that we use every day such as Gmail, Maps, Docs, spreadsheets, YouTube and Waze. Android software powers three-quarters of the world's smartphones. YouTube has all but supplanted television for many.</p><p>Yet the penny has finally dropped that Google's teeth are as sharp as the other Faangs - Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Netflix. As Rob Cox, a leading American technology writer, puts it: \"Underneath the haughty language of moral superiority lies the same profit motive that drives all business - and a ruthlessness rivalling history's greatest industrial bullies.\"</p><p>In her book, Foroohar lays the blame at Brin and Page's door but also says regulators have been dazzled by the \"free\" services the tech giants offer - missing the point that we all \"pay dearly with our data and our attention\". Regulatory \"get out of jail free cards\" have enabled the \"tech bros\" to become the modern equivalent of 19th-century \"railroad barons\" who were also \"able to drive competitors out of business and avoid taxation and regulation\".</p><p>That is beginning to change. The European Commission last week launched a fresh investigation into how Google and the companies it works with gather, process, use and monetise data. It has already fined the company more than (EURO)8bn (\u00a36.7bn) for anti-competitive practices. The US justice department, Federal Trade Commission and House judiciary committee are pursuing inquiries into potential antitrust violations by leading technology firms, including Google.</p><p>Authorities on both sides of the Atlantic are trying to close loopholes to force Google and the other tech behemoths to pay more tax. Boris Johnson has vowed to impose a digital sales tax of 2% of the UK revenues of big tech outfits. California has proposed that a \"digital dividend\" be paid by data collectors to the owners of this resource - people living in the state.</p><p>Germany has laws requiring platforms to delete illegal content within 24 hours of being notified or face large fines. Australia is considering similar legislation. To protect copyright, two anti-piracy bills have been proposed in America.</p><p>Page and Brin, both now 46, steadfastly refuse to engage with their firm's critics. A chair labelled \"Google\" was left conspicuously empty at last year's congressional hearings into state-sponsored election meddling on Capitol Hill. When you are worth $50bn each, you can get away with stuff like that.</p><p>Sundar Pichai, the new chief executive of Alphabet, will have no such luxury. He will be spending less time talking to his flip-flop-wearing staff and more time jousting with buttoned-up lawyers, regulators and legislators.</p><p>\"The next chapter is going to be a lot around policy, data privacy and regulation,\" points out Gene Munster, an analyst with Loup Ventures.</p><p>Or, to put it another way, the </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/google-ready-for-life-without-sergey-brin-and-larry-page-6n7b5xp7d\">announcement by Brin and Page</url></p><p> that they are leaving the Googleplex formally marks the end of the free-wheeling era in Silicon Valley.

It now seems like \"a quaint relic of the company's early days, when the crayon colours of the Google logo still conveyed the cheerful, idealistic spirit of the enterprise. How long ago that feels.\" The opening lines of Rana Foroohar's new book, Don't Be Evil: The Case against Big Tech, are not only spot on, her timing is perfect. Sergey Brin and Larry Page announced last week that they were stepping down as leaders at Alphabet, parent company of Google, the search engine that the pair founded two decades ago, prompting many to question their record.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Critics say what started as a benign endeavour to organise the world's information and make it available to all has turned into a corporate Big Brother. The charge sheet is so lengthy it could take up most of this page, but here are some of Google's worst sins.</p><p>Hoovering up our vast digital footprint and using it to deliver hyper-targeted advertisements. Abusing the dominance of its search platform - Google accounts for 93% of search queries worldwide - to promote its own services over those of its rivals. Slashing - legally - its tax bills by setting up webs of overseas companies to funnel revenues away from high-tax economies, such as Britain and Germany, to tax havens.</p><p>Flogging online ads to Russian agents, enabling them to spread misinformation and manipulate the 2016 US presidential election. Publishing extremist material on YouTube, which Google owns, including videos on how to make bombs. Looking the other way on copyright - impoverishing newspapers, magazines, authors, film-makers and musicians.</p><p>Latterly, Brin and Page have been battling their own staff, who have revolted over Google's contracts with the American military and plans - now shelved - to create a Chinese search engine censored by Beijing. Last year 20,000 Google employees walked out over sexual harassment, discrimination and pay inequality.</p><p>It was not always that way, as I found out when I first stepped off a bio-dieselpowered bus and walked through the glistening glass-and-steel curves of the vast Googleplex in Silicon Valley in 2007. Back then Brin and Page were in fine fettle - and not just because of all the free muesli and massages available \"in the Plex\". The world's most successful business double act had convinced themselves and most of the rest of us that they were not just newer, shinier, smarter and, yes, richer than the average entrepreneur, but they were also better because they had a higher moral calling.</p><p>Google would never be like Microsoft, then the poster boy for aggressive monopolistic behaviour. As Page and Brin put it in their 2004 founders' IPO (stock market float) letter: \"Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one.\"</p><p>There was nothing sinister about their mission to record, categorise and index \"all the world's information\" and make it available online. They were merely latterday explorers, mapping human knowledge to help mankind navigate the new information economy. When I raised privacy concerns, they said I'd got the wrong end of the memory stick. Not a single byte of my Google-generated data would ever be made available - far less flogged - to advertisers.</p><p>What went wrong? Why did scrappy, innovative digital utopians become rapacious, arrogant capitalists? Money. Page and Brin soon realised that their hippie-ish dream could be the best cash machine capitalism had ever seen - and that sounded a lot more fun than running a free global public library.</p><p>By dicing and splicing the quadrillions of bytes of data that surge across Google's servers every few minutes, they could enable advertisers to target consumers precisely and effectively and charge a premium for it. So they did. Their firm now rakes in more than $100bn (\u00a376bn) in advertising revenue each year, helping it to a market value close to $1 trillion.</p><p>\"Google has been the pioneer of big data, targeted advertising and surveillance capitalism,\" Foroohar says. \"When it advised its employees not to be evil, it did so because it knew full well that evil was more than a powerful temptation. Evil was baked into the business plan.\"</p><p>Google insists it uses \"data to make our services more useful and to show relevant advertising and we give people the controls to manage, delete or transfer their data\". It adds that it is improving tools that let users limit how much data is captured and how long it is kept. Critics claim few people use these tools or even know they exist.</p><p>Until recently - and for far longer than the likes of Facebook, Uber and Amazon, whose reputations have been tarnished by consumer and regulatory backlash - Brin and Page continued to pull the wool over most people's eyes. It was not hard to see why. Google makes whizzy, free software - not only the best search engine but services that we use every day such as Gmail, Maps, Docs, spreadsheets, YouTube and Waze. Android software powers three-quarters of the world's smartphones. YouTube has all but supplanted television for many.</p><p>Yet the penny has finally dropped that Google's teeth are as sharp as the other Faangs - Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Netflix. As Rob Cox, a leading American technology writer, puts it: \"Underneath the haughty language of moral superiority lies the same profit motive that drives all business - and a ruthlessness rivalling history's greatest industrial bullies.\"</p><p>In her book, Foroohar lays the blame at Brin and Page's door but also says regulators have been dazzled by the \"free\" services the tech giants offer - missing the point that we all \"pay dearly with our data and our attention\". Regulatory \"get out of jail free cards\" have enabled the \"tech bros\" to become the modern equivalent of 19th-century \"railroad barons\" who were also \"able to drive competitors out of business and avoid taxation and regulation\".</p><p>That is beginning to change. The European Commission last week launched a fresh investigation into how Google and the companies it works with gather, process, use and monetise data. It has already fined the company more than (EURO)8bn (\u00a36.7bn) for anti-competitive practices. The US justice department, Federal Trade Commission and House judiciary committee are pursuing inquiries into potential antitrust violations by leading technology firms, including Google.</p><p>Authorities on both sides of the Atlantic are trying to close loopholes to force Google and the other tech behemoths to pay more tax. Boris Johnson has vowed to impose a digital sales tax of 2% of the UK revenues of big tech outfits. California has proposed that a \"digital dividend\" be paid by data collectors to the owners of this resource - people living in the state.</p><p>Germany has laws requiring platforms to delete illegal content within 24 hours of being notified or face large fines. Australia is considering similar legislation. To protect copyright, two anti-piracy bills have been proposed in America.</p><p>Page and Brin, both now 46, steadfastly refuse to engage with their firm's critics. A chair labelled \"Google\" was left conspicuously empty at last year's congressional hearings into state-sponsored election meddling on Capitol Hill. When you are worth $50bn each, you can get away with stuff like that.</p><p>Sundar Pichai, the new chief executive of Alphabet, will have no such luxury. He will be spending less time talking to his flip-flop-wearing staff and more time jousting with buttoned-up lawyers, regulators and legislators.</p><p>\"The next chapter is going to be a lot around policy, data privacy and regulation,\" points out Gene Munster, an analyst with Loup Ventures.</p><p>Or, to put it another way, the announcement by Brin and Page that they are leaving the Googleplex formally marks the end of the free-wheeling era in Silicon Valley. We've reached a tipping point - that has tipped the dynamic duo off their golden Segways.</p><p>Perhaps it's a good thing they will be spending more time with their flying cars and other \"moonshots\".

The move was prompted by uncertainty surrounding the UK's data laws after Brexit. Experts told Business Insider the problem boils down to whether the UK can obtain an \"adequacy agreement\" with the EU which would guarantee that EU citizens' data would be protected with the same rigor as under GDPR. Although originally the UK said it would adhere to GDPR standards, Google's decision suggests it doesn't trust Britain to achieve an adequacy agreement. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. News broke on Wednesday that Google has decided to migrate its UK user data from Ireland (where it's currently kept) to the US[2], prompted by Brexit uncertainty. Ireland is part of the European Union, and so its data laws are subject to the EU's robust General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) laws which came into force in 2018. Three sources told Reuters that Google's decision was prompted by uncertainty surrounding Britain's exit from the EU, because it is now unclear whether the UK will adopt GDPR-like rules or set its own standards on data protection. This isn't immediately a big deal for user privacy. UK users remain protected by Europe's strict privacy rules for now, even if their data is legally owned by a US entity. It does, however, raise the specter of reduced privacy in future if a post-Brexit UK alters its laws to become less privacy-oriented. Business Insider spoke to privacy and data policy experts to get an idea of what this decision means for UK citizens.1. It shows Google doesn't have faith in the UK achieving \"adequacy\"Part of what the UK will have to negotiate with the EU in its Brexit talks is whether it continues to cleave to the GDPR, or something like it. One of the provisions of GDPR is that EU citizens' data has to be safeguarded to European standards even if it is held outside the EU \u2014 as is the case with most large American social media companies. Tech policy expert Heather Burns told Business Insider this happens in one of two ways. \"The first is that a company - say, a US social media business - which collects and processes European citizens' data does so under contractual clauses, corporate agreements, or the like. The second is that a third country[3] as a whole commits to a legally recognised system of adequacy, such as the U.S. Privacy Shield system, which is mandatory for any US company collecting European data,\" she said. Originally Britain maintained that it would seek the second option, otherwise known as an \"adequacy agreement,\" with the EU. This would mean Europe accepts that the UK provides data protection that's up to the EU's standards. Whether the UK will actually get such an agreement has become more and more uncertain, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement earlier this month that the UK would develop[4] a \"separate and independent\" data protection policy. Broader threats that the UK might leave the EU without a deal exacerbate the possibility that it might not get an adequacy agreement, according to Burns.\"That political context is critical to understanding Google's decision. This is not the action of a company which believes the UK will secure an adequacy agreement or intends to continue aligning itself with the European data protection framework and its user rights. They are moving fast on that belief, and it's safe to say they are not engaging in this work out of a concern for UK citizens' human rights,\" said Burns. \"My reading of Google's plans is that it, like many data protection and privacy academics, is sceptical of the UK's ability to be accepted for and retain the 'adequacy' status with the European Union which would allow free flow of data,\" said digital rights expert Michael Veale. \"Furthermore, by remaining in Ireland, Google risks double-jeopardy for fines and other sanctions in relation to any breach of data protection affecting those in the UK, as it would be a breach of both EU law (as the data was processed in the EU) and UK law (as the data concerned UK residents). Moving its contractual body to the US would somewhat remedy this,\" he added.Google sources said the move could help law enforcementReuters' sources said that moving user data to the US would make it easier for UK law enforcement to request access to data for investigations than if the data were left in Ireland due to the CLOUD (Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data) act agreement signed between the US and Britain in October 2019[5]. The agreement was designed to allow US and UK law enforcement to demand data from tech companies based in the other country. Burns was unconvinced by this. \"Google's announcement is about moving user data outside the EU data protection framework, which is a completely separate thing from the CLOUD Act. This is about everyday data, even the information on your phone right now, and where it lives and how it is protected, well outside the realm of law enforcement,\" she said. \"Google mentioning law enforcement at all in the Reuters announcement was a bit of a red herring, in other words, to distract from the everyday user data at stake,\" Burns added. Jim Killock, head of the UK-based digital rights organisation Open Rights Group, voiced strong opposition to Google's decision. \"Moving people's personal information to the USA makes it easier for mass surveillance programmes to access it. There is nearly no privacy protection for non-US citizens. We have no reason to trust a Donald Trump government with information about UK citizens. The possibilities for abuse are enormous, from US immigration programmes through to attempts to politically and racially profile people for alleged extremist links,\" he said. For the time being however the UK \u2014 and by extension UK citizens' Google data \u2014 still falls under GDPR.NOW WATCH: What it's like to ride the world's longest flight[6]See Also: Google's users

But two, look at what we've done with the controls. We have private web browsing, we have intelligent tracking prevention.<br/> \"What we've tried to do is come up with ways to help our users through their course of the day. It's not a perfect thing, but it goes a long way in helping,\" Cool told the Axios technology correspondent.<br/>Google will reportedly pay Apple a whopping $9 billion in 2018 to remain the default search engine for iPhone's Safari browser on iOS.<br/> According to Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall (via Business Insider), this number would only continue to grow, potentially leading to a payment of $12 billion in 2019.<br/> Cook has opposed privacy practices of some big tech companies, like Facebook, in the past, calling them a form of \"surveillance\".<br/> When it comes to regulating the tech companies, Cook said while he is \"not a big fan of regulation,\" but there comes time to \"admit when the free market is not working\".<br/> \"I think it's inevitable that there will be some level of regulation. I think Congress and the administration at some point will pass something,\" Cook said.<br/> \"This is not a matter of privacy versus profits or privacy versus technical innovation. That's a false choice.<br/> \"Your device has incredible intelligence about you, but as a company, I don't have to have that,\" the Apple CEO added.<br/> On a question on diversity at the workplace, Cook said the Silicon Valley has been open and accepting to many different people from different walks of life.<br/> \"But I agree 100 per cent from a gender point of view, that the Valley has missed it and tech, in general, has missed it,\" he said.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10745501</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TSR-F8X1-DYDW-7068-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"338\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 21, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Details: The company told the court that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is leading the states' investigation, has refused to agree to give Google notice before it shares documents with third parties or consultants, and won't prohibit its consultants from working for Google competitors now or in the next year. The consultants in contention are Cristina Caffara, an economist with Charles River Associates, and Eugene Burrus, a former Microsoft lawyer.Google said Caffara has worked for its 'adversaries on antitrust and competition matters' including News Corp and Microsoft, and also notes that her contract with the Texas AG's office indicates she's not charging for her advice.Burrus worked as Microsoft's assistant general counsel and has represented clients in cases against Google while in private practice, Google said. </p><p>What they're saying: Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda noted the company has provided \"millions of pages\" of documents in regulatory inquiries and is committed to cooperating with the states' probe. 'But this is an extraordinarily irregular arrangement and it's only fair to have assurances that our confidential business information won't be shared with competitors or vocal complainants,\" Castaneda said in a statement.Marc Rylander, communications director for the Texas AG, said the office offered several proposals to protect Google's information, but in the midst of the negotiations, Google went to court to challenge \"our right to employ many of the most knowledgeable in this complex field.\"\"We are not willing to compromise our ability to discharge our obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of Google's conduct,\" Rylander said in a statement. \"The protective order requested by Google would do just that. Google's petition is nothing more than an effort to hamstring the investigation. But Google is not entitled to choose the states' expert or run the states' investigation.' The big picture: Antitrust investigators rely on information from both the targets and their rivals to build cases, but Google doesn't want its competitors to gain an edge through sensitive material it's forced to hand over.Go deeper: The full list of antitrust investigations into Big Tech[2] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/google-antitrust-investigation-state-attorneys-general-f5adf04f-63ed-44cd-b1a9-8c060c4b68b5.html\">https://www.axios.com/google-antitrust-investigation-state-attorneys-general-f5adf04f-63ed-44cd-b1a9-8c060c4b68b5.html</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.axios.com/the-growing-list-of-us-government-inquiries-into-big-tech-a67c870e-129f-4372-9397-4597e0c06ae9.html\">https://www.axios.com/the-growing-list-of-us-government-inquiries-into-big-tech-a67c870e-129f-4372-9397-4597e0c06ae9.html</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-AXIO100095441572619244836757762900124</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AXIO-10009544</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XDB-BXV1-JCMN-Y06H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"481\"/><timeReceived>2:40 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Axios</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 1, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009FIF</classCode><className>CRA INTERNATIONAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>TEXAS STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

That's fourteen years dedicated to bringing you the latest medical technology news, FDA approvals, exclusive interviews, product reviews, reports from conferences, and special contests such as our Medical Sci-Fi competition[1]. We are a group of MDs, biomed engineers, and medical students interested in medical technologies. We believe that by reporting real medtech news we deliver something special to the world. We educate clinicians on possibilities of new technologies. We give hope to patients about progress in medicine. </p><p>We are a trusted and proud independent publication. Meet our competitors, a new face of the publishing industry. An alphabet of genres, everything from ABC to XXX, brought to you by abc.xyz. We believe in hard work, and we believe that hard work has to result in at least a modicum of financial success. And yet, after 14 years of online publishing, Medgadget is struggling to survive. How can it be? After all, we approach everything with integrity. We don't outsource our work to strangers on the internet. We don't bombard readers with intrusive ads, we don't do 'top ten' lists or spam posts. We don't believe in a free ride: our writers and editors are paid for their stories. We invest in technology: Medgadget runs on a powerful and dedicated WP Engine server aided by Amazon's cloud and supported by a sophisticated team of WordPress programmers based in San Francisco. Our editorial team has always been composed of top notch talent from some of the most elite schools in the world: Harvard Medical School, Johns Hopkins Medical School, MIT, University of Toronto, Harvard Business School, Leiden University Medical Center, to name a few. Some of our alumni founded very successful startups in medtech, such as OssoVR[2], Osmosis[3], and Omada Health[4]. We have had alumni do space medicine at NASA. We proudly display our journalistic ethics[5] and have a business person who deals with customers and makes sure that there's not even a hint of conflict of interest between the editorial process and advertisers. Medgadget has been named by Fox News and others as the best medical blog in the world[6]. We've partnered with some of the biggest players: The Atlantic magazine, TEDMED and Exponential Medicine conferences, to name a few. Big medical technology companies know us and keep in touch with us about their R...new product launches, and they readily give us interview access: companies like Johnson ...hnson, 3M, GE Healthcare, Samsung, and Phillips. But when it comes to publishing, how is it possible that the hard work, integrity, professionalism, clinical knowledge and love of what we are doing produce such meager results? Please enter the digital world of serfdom created by Google. Medgadget is a serf in that kingdom, and so are you, and so is our entire society. Below we will document for you the different domains that Google has monopolized and successfully exploited at the expense of publishers and their readers. Google has not only appropriated the entire Internet to its aims, not only it is destroying small publications like ours, Google is destroying what the Internet stands for: creative freedom and decentralized sharing of information. Google has become an evil company.Advertisement DomainVitalyzdTv, a Google partner, delivers hours and hours of misogyny supported by various AdWords campaigns from companies like Epson and 20th Century Fox. Medgadget videos are not eligible for YouTube Partner Program (YPP) because we don't generate 4000 hours of watch time. In the advertisement domain, GoogleFacebook is essentially a duopoly. While publishers produce all the content, GoogleFacebook control more than 70% of the digital ad market in the United States.[7] That's two companies that produce no content! Google's revenue 'climbed to an all-time high of $32 billion[8]' in 2017, reports the Washington Post, which is more than the revenue of the entire U.S. newspaper publishing industry, and yet Google creates almost no content! Where does it advertise? It advertises on top of its search results (duping people because many think it is a search result), on YouTube, on games on your smartphone, and on its AdSense partners like Medgadget. How much does it pay us? It pays us pennies, literally pennies. Here's how it works. Because Google follows you through little pieces of code called cookies, Google knows everything about you. Google knows your searches and websites you visit. Google follows you from your work, to the restaurant, to your bedroom. It probably knows your sexual orientation and who your friends are. It knows your tastes, your health problems, your political affiliations, where you've been and how you traveled there. Its tracking cookies are so pervasive, and it invades your privacy so thoroughly, that it can display an ad for you on any of its platforms, on any web page, on any Android game. It does not need Medgadget or The Wall Street Journal. For Google, Medgadget is just another space for an advertisement. Medgadget literally competes with cellphone games for advertisement income. For Google, we are no different than your Candy Crush Saga game, or some spam site, or a YouTube video of a teenage prankster. In the world of Google, everything boils down to the lowest common denominator to display an ad, quality information or hard work be damned! And since Google and Facebook control the advertising market, there's almost nowhere else for us to go.Information DomainWomen in Tech: Misogyny today, Jennifer Lawrence on Friday. Brought to you by 20th Century Fox and Google. Despite its claim that it exists to 'organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful,' Google actually exists to display an ad to you. Google is an advertisement agency. And Google does everything in its power to show you more and more ads on more and more channels. If Google cared about the information on the internet, all the reputable publishers would get quality ads, and Candy Crush Saga and teenage pranksters would get the same cheap ads that porn sites get. That's how things are supposed to be, but they are not, and everyone among publishers suffers. Everyone. All because Google channels ads to itself and its garbage content. And, actually, you, our readers, are suffering as well, as pay walls are rising and regional newspapers and niche sites like ours are disappearing. Your choices for quality content are disappearing. You don't even know what sites have never even been born that could have entertained and educated you and your children. Furthermore, an ominous sign of our times is that venture capital investment in publishing is essentially non-existent. No one wants to invest in publishers. There are no startups in publishing. Think about it: isn't the internet supposed to be about information gathering? Abbott's Similac AdWord campaign supports sexual objectification of women. We simply can't compete with low quality material in which Google makes its billions of dollars and makes the populace dumb in return. Google cares more about the teenage prankster with 1.5M views than about a Medgadget article seen by 1,000 cardiologists. Speaking of dumbing down the population, you've heard about the fake news? Follow the money trail. All these fake news come as a direct result of GoogleFacebook incentives. Who needs to pay to travel to a medical conference, write a report or do a product review, like Medgadget does day in and day out, if you can publish a fake news story and get paid the same or even more? Maybe Google needs to explain to its shareholders and advertisers, and to us, why it stopped ads on Medgadget's YouTube channel because we don't generate enough of 'required 4000 minutes of views in 12 months period,' but it continues to pour advertisements into filthy, misogynistic, sadistic channels like this[9] and this[10] and this[11]. Maybe Epson or 20th Century Fox, the distributor of the Red Sparrow movie, need to explain their choices for advertisement placements with those who profit from misogyny? How about Abbott outsourcing its Similac ads to Google and supporting the sexual objectification of women in an aptly named game called 'Virtual Lover'? We can't compete with stuff like this. Remember, these YouTube channels and games are just a tip of the iceberg in the Google billion dollar money making machine that left Medgadget and our readers as road kill, and was replaced by filth, degeneracy, misogyny, sadism, sexism, and racism. That's right, decent website like ours get squashed, and the lowest common denominator spam flourishes. And the result is the lowest common denominator in content and news for the lowest common denominator of our society. That's not where we are headed, folks, this Orwellian society is already here.Internet DomainGoogle is making the Internet a 'better' place one Orwellian step at a time. On the internet, Google is the ultimate self proclaimed Lord of the Manor. Nothing happens on the internet without the Big Brother Google. No process, no website is designed without efforts to appease Google. There is a billion dollar industry out there called SEO (Search Engine Optimization) that tries to figure out how to best please Google. Everything from the speed of a server, to website structure, to the way to display images, to where to put a piece of code is dictated by Google. There are hundreds, even thousands, of edicts that Google proclaims that have to be followed. Google says that it enforces the highest standards on the internet, but nothing could be further from the truth. The standards would evolve through competition, like in every other industry. By creating these 'standards' and strangling its competitors, Google is only interested in enlarging a moat around its own castle. One wonders how much innovation in internet technologies has been killed, or have never even been born, as a result of Google's hegemony. For more on this, see a recent New York Times report, The Case Against Google[12]. Speaking of SEO, despondent at our inability to make ends meet, we hired a consultancy a while back to look at the structural problems with the website. They found no major problems. According to them, (and this is a direct quote from their report) Medgadget experienced 'decline in visibility that started with the Panda Update in 2011. ('Google Panda[13] is a change to Google's search results ranking algorithm that was first released in February 2011. The change aimed to lower the rank of 'low-quality sites' or 'thin sites', in particular 'content farms', and return higher-quality sites near the top of the search results.')' Anti-vaccination pornography on thin site YouTube. The ads that you don't see on Medgadget now belong to Panda. You see, somehow we are a 'thin site'. In other words, a team of 20-year olds in Menlo Park (or an algorithm designed to accommodate the lowest common denominator), downgraded us because we mentioned Viagra, colonoscopy, or something else medically related, for crying out loud. The Viagra misunderstanding is an easy explanation, but one can come up with more sinister motives. What if Google unleashed Panda to squash Medgadget and others like us, plus some content farms, to capture consumers and the digital ad market to itself? After all, YouTube is a pretty thin site, if you ask us. And so is Google Groups, and Blogger, and all the Android games (except for Scrabble). That's just a theory, but it can smell pretty delicious to some hungry anti-trust regulator with a bamboo stick and a panda appetite. But for now there's nothing, NOTHING, we can do about it and no one to complain to. Google, The Lord of the Internet Manor, decides our fate, silently in Menlo Park. No matter our exclusives, no matter the reports, no matter the product reviews, no matter our clinical expertise, no matter our MDs and PhDs, no matter the hard work, no matter our families, no matter the love, no matter the public service. That's serfdom, folks.SummaryGoogle, through its monopoly and its strong-arm tactics, is butchering the internet of its spirit and its content, and it is now the most pernicious corporation of all the big techs. One is not forced to use Facebook or Amazon or Apple, but you can't escape the iron grip of Google on the Internet. Through its control of the digital ad market, Google channels advertising revenue to itself, and leaves crumbs to the content creators. Through its blatant invasion of privacy and through its control of Android, YouTube, Chrome, AMP, and other technologies, Google is destroying the quality of content on the internet and leaves en masse corpses of publishers, from small regional news outlets to niche sites to big publishers. Through its search dominance, Google strangles the future of the internet and internet technologies. Google may have violated anti-trust laws. Google is an evil monopoly.Recommendations We ask you, our readers, to ring alarm bells. Tell your relatives, tell your friends, tell your representatives and senators about Google. Educate yourself about Google. Share this post with others. There's a reason Google has the most financed cadre of lobbyists in Washington[14]. Google bosses know full well about the company's devious ways, and they keep lobbyists busy to protect the company's stranglehold on the entire internet. Google did not create the internet, and it's time to take the internet back from Google. It's time to demand that no corporation, no matter how cuddly its logo looks, is allowed to blatantly invade our privacy. Without its snooping, without its cookies, Google's power to manipulate the market will be reduced and the quality of your internet will improve. Maybe it's time to break Google into pieces, and allow newcomers to flourish. But that's a job for policy makers. Also, demand that companies that advertise on Google know where their ads are going. It's their money and their reputation that is on the line. And ask advertisers if they are happy with the destruction of civility that Google peddles. We cannot let Google build a future for our children. As for us, we will keep on doing our best, as we have done in the past 14 years, and hope that we can continue to deliver the quality medical technology content as long as we can.

The search giant, which spent US$4.9 million in the last three months of the year, according to a Tuesday filing, beat its previous record of more than US$18 million from 2017.<br/>Facebook spent nearly US$13 million on lobbying, the filings say, as it dealt with the fallout from privacy scandals, the congressional testimony of its chief executive officer, Mark Zuckerberg, and data vulnerabilities. It spent US$2.83 million during the quarter. In 2017, Facebook spent more than US$11.5 million on lobbying, the previous record.<br/> The industry had good reason to up its influence game last year: It faces a so-called techlash of greater congressional and regulatory scrutiny after numerous privacy breaches and disclosures that Russia used social media platforms to distribute propaganda meant to influence the 2016 presidential election.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNRCOM-n10839160</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TNRCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V8K-H431-DYDW-70SP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410684</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"201\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Tendernews.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 23, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Business Opportunities</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The project is a partnership through which the Silicon Valley behemoth will store and analyze millions of Ascension's patient records.</p><p>Since the reveal, patient privacy concerns have sparked pushback, and a federal inquiry as to whether the partnership has violated health care privacy regulations.</p><p>Fueling the controversy are an anonymous whistleblower's reports that the data stored by Google may contain patient names. Additionally, these reports state that these names are accessible to Google's employees, and that several of them may have downloaded some of that sensitive data.</p><p>Google isn't the only tech company breaking into the health care market.</p><p>Arnav Garg, co-president of DataRes, a data science and analytics club at UCLA, said that other companies like Microsoft, Facebook and Apple are also collecting public health data, but aren't facing as much scrutiny as Google.</p><p>\"Your Apple Watch essentially keeps track of your health data, like heart rate, menstrual cycles, (your electrocardiogram),\" said Garg, a third-year computer science student. \"Apple is constantly collecting this data as well, but no one's said anything to Apple, people are only questioning Google.\"</p><p>Brynne Gosch, a public health graduate student, said the acquisition of health data by these companies carries a significant amount of potential for public benefit.</p><p>\"Large datasets like this have the opportunity not only to streamline health systems, which is kind of what Ascension and Google are trying to do right now, but really bring about a lot of medical advancement and a lot of innovation and save lives,\" Gosch said.</p><p>Garg said such partnerships would enable tech companies to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to find trends in data that humans might not, allowing them to develop new solutions to health care problems.</p><p>However, making positive progress in the quality of care is not the only factor making the pairings between big tech and medicine possibly beneficial for public health, Garg added.</p><p>\"It has the potential to make health care more accessible, even to people who can't afford to go to a doctor or a hospital,\" said Garg.</p><p>But tech giants accumulating vast amounts of data on the public do not just stand to improve the way patients receive medical treatment, said Irene Pasquetto, a postdoctoral fellow at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University who has used big data for her research, in an emailed statement.</p><p>\"Having more data, from multiple sources, about the same subject, provide companies with a great power in terms of predicting (consumer's) behavior and micro-targeting products,\" Pasquetto, a former research assistant at the UCLA Center for Knowledge Infrastructures, said in the statement.</p><p>However, Pasquetto added that companies can acquire donated patient data from research organizations to develop products and then sell them back to those patients at steep prices, possibly through micro-targeted online advertising, profiting off patients never compensated for or informed of their data usage in the first place.</p><p>Unfortunately, for those at risk of these practices, guaranteeing the separation of a patient's identity and their data is very difficult to do when companies like Google are involved, Garg said.</p><p>\"They can track things like your location, your searches, everything on Google Docs, and then they also know (your) health care (information), and technically (they) could put location data and some of the health care data together to figure out who you are,\" Garg said.</p><p>Dubious advertising practices aren't the only risk when people's health records are tracked back to them. Anonymity is something to be concerned about because maintaining a patient's privacy is potentially critical for their interpersonal relationships, Gosch said.</p><p>\"If people's health data is compromised, that can affect their relationships with their family members, their communities, their employers,\" Gosch said. \"It affects relationships with the people most important to them.\"</p><p>The current major legislation guiding medical data handling, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, doesn't effectively address every issue that comes up, Gosch said.</p><p>The federal government needs to update these policies, Gosch added. But before it can do that, the public needs to figure out what standards for health privacy it wants. Until then, companies with access to data are left to decide how to properly handle it, Gosch said.</p><p>\"At this point, society at large doesn't fully trust large companies to handle sensitive data like health information and that's because they haven't really shown us so far that they are ready to be trusted,\" she said.</p><p>Regardless of whether it earns your trust, Google may know more about its users than they're aware of.</p><p>\"I think that at some level, Google knows maybe more about you than you know about yourself,\" Garg said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4416721</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKV-58G1-JBSN-30H5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Bruin: University of California - Los Angeles</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 27, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA (LOS ANGELES)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

A new report states that the $2.1 billion acquisition is under a second request review, meaning the companies must provide the Justice Department with more details. Google will have to pay $250 million to Fitbit if it terminates the deal. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories[1]. It seems the coronavirus hasn't completely distracted Big Tech regulation, with the US Department of Justice reportedly amping up its investigation into Google's proposed buy of Fitbit. The $2.1 billion deal, which would see Google completely acquire the wearables maker, was already under scrutiny from the Justice Department. Now the New York Post[2] reports that the deal has been put under a second request review, asking both companies to provide more documents for the DoJ to sift through \u2014 and giving more time to the investigation. The DoJ declined to comment to Business Insider. A Fitbit spokesperson said the company still expects the deal to secure regulatory approval by the end of 2020. The main cause for concern here is personal data. An acquisition would give Google access to the data Fitbit's 28 million users, and although Google said it will not use people's health data for advertising purposes, there are still unanswered questions over how else that information might be used. The New York Post's sources said that Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, head of the DOJ antitrust division, has stepped away from the case due to his previous work lobbying for Google. Attorney General William Barr has reportedly taken the reins and begun issuing civil investigative demands to both companies. It's possible that Google will have to make compromises on how it handles user data. That could take the shine off Fitbit's appeal - but if Google pulls out of the deal it will have to pay Fitbit $250 million as a termination fee. It's still unclear what Google's exact intentions with Fitbit are. It clearly wants to use Fitbit to bolster its own wearable efforts, which have lagged behind Apple and other companies in this space. Google still hasn't launched its own wearable hardware - despite coming close[3] - and has instead leaned on third parties to build around its Wear OS software. But access to data may be more appealing than the hardware itself here, particularly as Google inches further into the health space. The outcome of this investigation could also have a bearing on the DoJ's wider ongoing investigation into Google, which extends into various parts of the business including advertising, Android, and search.NOW WATCH: Apple just revealed its AirPods Pro for $249, which feature noise cancellation.

Google L...</p><p>Google's deal for fitness tracking outfit Fitbit comes amid mounting global pressure to address the dominance of large technology firms. European watchdogs have already raised concerns, but it's not clear U.S. antitrust enforcers will follow suit.  Google LLC's CEO Sundar Pichai appeared before Congress last month alongside the heads of Amazon, Apple and Facebook to face questions from lawmakers about their companies' dominance and business practices, as well as acquisitions they've made. The public grilling was just the latest indication that the tech giants, especially Google, might soon face litigation or enforcement actions in the U.S.  State and federal enforcers are conducting investigations into the industry and the Federal Trade Commission is also studying past deals in the sector to see if the agencies have overlooked smaller transactions that should have been challenged. Enforcers around the world have also been investigating the dominance of digital platforms more generally and exploring potential regulations, including those aimed at data, arguably Google's greatest asset.  The existing regime in Europe also provides enforcers the flexibility to target issues that include the overall dominance of a company and its use of data during merger reviews, potential areas of concern for the Fitbit deal. U.S. merger law is largely aimed at preventing damage to competition in a specific market, though lawmakers have nonetheless called for a close look at Google's latest move.  Yet despite the focus and attention on tech, and in particular the acquisition of nascent or potential competitors, Google is forging ahead with the $2.1 billion bid for Fitbit. While the search giant contends the move is meant to add Fitbit's wearable hardware to its stable, the devices capture an enormous amount of personal and health data.  Europe has raised concerns about Google's potential use of the data for its targeted advertising business, which enforcers say can be used to further Google's dominance. Michael Carrier, a professor at Rutgers Law School, told Law360 that similar concerns in the U.S. may not normally result in a merger challenge, but that the current climate could impact the outcome of the U.S. review.  \"Even though a case in the U.S. might be a stretch based on existing case law, we're in uncertain times, as the glaring scrutiny of Big Tech has shown,\" Carrier said. \"The agencies might target conduct a bit beyond what they otherwise would.\"  The EU Probe  The European Commission has been far more aggressive than the U.S. in its approach to big tech, having already fined Google a cumulative \u20ac8 billion ($9.4 billion) for abusing its dominance through its comparison shopping service, mobile operating system and search advertising business. It also has investigations open into Amazon, Apple and Facebook for anti-competitive conduct.  Europe is also ahead when it comes to concerns around privacy with the bloc's General Data Protection Regulation coming into force in 2018. The U.S. has no national privacy legislation on the books, though the FTC has brought a number of consumer protection cases surrounding the issue.  \"The EU has always been far more interested in data than the United States,\" said Joel Mitnick, a partner at Cadwalader Wickersham &amp; Taft LLP and a former FTC trial attorney. \"The U.S. is very much a 'Johnny Come Lately' to the concerns about data, both in terms of privacy and antitrust.\"  Enforcers in Europe see data as an issue at the intersection of consumer protection and antitrust, said George Peretz of Monckton Chambers. A report commissioned by the European Commission has called for regulations on the use and access to data in an attempt to balance privacy concerns with the competitive advantage data can convey. The report also looked at data considerations for merger reviews.  Competition authorities in the U.K., Australia and elsewhere have also issued reports calling for regulations and more scrutiny over data and digital firms.  The commission's in-depth investigation into Google's Fitbit deal launched last week raised issues with the search giant's dominance in the online advertising space and its potential ability to use Fitbit's data trove to further entrench that position.  The commission said Google could combine the data collected by Fitbit's wearables with its existing data to use it for targeted personal ads, making it even more difficult for rivals to match the advertising services Google provides. While the idea of big data being a potential antitrust problem is not new, Peretz said that with the combination of antitrust and consumer protection associated with health data, \"it's hard to think of parallel cases.\"  Google offered to implement a \"data silo\" that would separate some of the information collected by the wearables from the rest of the search giant's vast data stores, but enforcers in Europe said the measure didn't go far enough. The company is likely still negotiating with the commission over what the silo should cover and Mitnick said he thinks they'll eventually reach some kind of middle ground.  \"Presumably, the value to Google in the transaction is in the use of some of the data, so I don't know that the deal will ever make sense if they have to protect all of the data,\" he said.  The U.S. Probe  Exactly what role data accumulation plays in U.S. competition law has been the subject of considerable debate in antitrust circles, especially about how to apply a current system largely focused on consumer prices to industries where many products are offered for free.  Makan Delrahim, head of the U.S. Department of Justice's Antitrust Division, has said during speeches that data should be analyzed for its competitive implications and that the current laws can handle the analysis of nonpricing effects. But he has also cautioned against seeing the accumulation of data as a problem in itself and has maintained that antitrust should not be used to address privacy and other social issues.  The type of competitive harm alleged by the European Commission for the Fitbit deal is not typically seen in U.S. merger challenges, where enforcers give more scrutiny to combinations between direct competitors. The agencies have raised concerns about data in merger challenges before, though they have generally focused on competitors that looked to combine valuable datasets.  Google does compete with Fitbit to some extent in the wearables segment, but neither is dominant and there are a number of other big players in the space, such as Apple and Samsung. Fitbit doesn't sell advertising services at all and so doesn't compete with Google in its primary lines of business.  Mitnick said this means a merger challenge would not \"really fit well within traditional U.S. antitrust law,\" which is largely centered around market concentration levels following a merger. He said this is especially true if you consider the potential defenses Google could raise, including that Fitbit will be better able to compete against Apple and the others after the deal.  The agencies do analyze other types of competitive effects and Google's purchase of Fitbit could be seen as a vertical merger, with Google purchasing a set of data to use as an input for its advertising operations. The DOJ tried unsuccessfully to challenge AT&amp;T's purchase of Time Warner in 2018, a vertical deal that combined AT&amp;T's DirecTV satellite service with Time Warner's valuable content.  The DOJ alleged the tie-up would give AT&amp;T too much leverage over rival video distribution services when negotiating licensing agreements for Time Warner. But the courts rejected the government's economic evidence in favor of real-world data showing no pricing impact from past vertical mergers.  A case targeting the Fitbit purchase could contend that the move would increase the level of personalization Google offers advertisers through the more robust set of data, increasing its bargaining leverage and allowing it to charge more. The AT&amp;T case was the DOJ's first litigated challenge of a vertical merger in decades and while it was rejected, Carrier said a Fitbit case could fare differently.  \"It might \u2026 be a bit different here given the number of markets Google is involved in and perhaps its more widespread exploitation of the new data,\" Carrier said.  A U.S. case against the Fitbit deal could also contend the move furthers Google's monopoly position and violates Section 2 of the Sherman Act, the prong barring monopolization and the maintenance of monopolies. But Mitnick said this would be a tough sell because it's difficult to define specific markets around data, since there's so much of it out there and it varies so greatly.  \"I just don't see them carrying the burden of proof under the current standards of antitrust law,\" he said, noting that this helps illustrate why there is so much discussion about potentially amending the U.S. laws.  European enforcers said they would also be looking at a secondary concern about the deal's potential impact on what it called the nascent digital health care market. A DOJ case could stake out a theory that the deal hurts innovation, but again, Mitnick said, defining markets would be an issue.  \"The current digital market may, in fact, not be well suited to analysis under current antitrust law,\" he said.  With all the public attention and the looming prospect of cases targeting Google's conduct, the company will be under pressure to reach an agreement with U.S. enforcers, rather than force a litigated challenge. U.S. enforcers have historically accepted agreements from companies involved in a vertical merger to behave in certain ways through consent decrees, although they have increasingly shied away from \"behavioral remedies,\" preferring instead structural tweaks.  Google could make an offer similar to the one it made in Europe to try and cure concerns at home and will likely try to harmonize any agreements it makes with enforcers on both sides of the pond.  \"That's the end result, I think, is in everybody's interest,\" Mitnick said.  --Additional reporting by Bryan Koenig.

Google faces a lengthy European Union probe into its $2.1 billion takeover of Fitbit Inc. amid concerns about how health data could strengthen the search giant\u2019s power in online advertising.    The EU will investigate how information from Fitbit\u2019s fitness trackers will increase Google\u2019s \u201cdata advantage\u201d in online advertising that rivals would struggle to match, the European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday. Officials set an initial December 9 deadline to approve or veto the deal.    Regulators are increasingly scrutinising Silicon Valley takeovers, aiming to prevent the already powerful firms from conquering innovative new markets where data is often the most prized asset. Privacy and consumer advocates have been calling on the EU to examine how the deal could allow the Alphabet Inc. unit to expand into healthcare .    \u201cThis data provides key insights about the life and the health situation of the users of these devices,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, the EU\u2019s antitrust commissioner. \u201cOur investigation aims to ensure that control by Google over data collected through wearable devices as a result of the transaction does not distort competition.\u201d    The EU will focus on online search advertising where it says Google is dominant in most of Europe and on online display ads where it says Google holds a strong market position in 20 European countries. It will also examine ad tech services, how the deal will affect digital  healthcare  and whether Google could make it harder for rivals to make devices that work well with its Android mobile phone software.    Google insisted the \u201cdeal is about devices, not data,\u201d according to a blog post. \u201cThere\u2019s vibrant competition when it comes to smartwatches and fitness trackers, with Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fossil, Huawei, Xiaomi and many others offering numerous products at a range of prices. We don\u2019t currently make or sell wearable devices like these today.\u201d    Google said it won\u2019t use Fitbit health data for Google ads and will give Fitbit users the choice to review, move or delete their data. The company will also \u201csupport wide connectivity and interoperability\u201d of Google products with others.    Google and Fitbit shares were little changed at 11 a.m. in New York.   \u2018Insufficient\u2019 concessions   The EU said Google had offered to store some of Fitbit\u2019s data separately from other Google data. Regulators said that was insufficient to address its concerns and would not have covered all of the Fitbit data that could be valuable for advertising.    The wide scope of the probe seems to be a response to criticisms that antitrust authorities have failed to curb deals that extended Silicon Valley\u2019s control into new industries.    The Fitbit deal is set to be \u201ca worrying game-changer\u201d said Monique Guyens, the head of European consumer advocacy group BEUC. The EU probe is crucial \u201cbecause wearable devices like Fitbit\u2019s could in future give companies details of essentially everything consumers do 24/7 and feed digital services back.\u201d    Many big tech takeovers of small firms have escaped EU regulatory reviews since target firms made little or no revenue.    The US Justice Department is also investigating the takeover, while Australia\u2019s merger authority flagged preliminary worries in June over Google\u2019s access to health data.    The deal sparked antitrust and privacy concerns as soon as it was announced in November with US lawmakers and consumer groups voicing criticism. It came in the midst of a separate antitrust investigation by the Justice Department into whether Google illegally monopolised digital advertising markets.    EU regulators started a sweeping inquiry into devices made by Google and others that collect consumer data last month. Vestager mentioned wearable devices such as Fitbit as one of the many data-collecting products that officials will scrutinise.    \u00a9 2020

The EU will investigate how information from Fitbit\u2019s fit...</p><p>Google faces a lengthy European Union probe into its US$2.1bil (RM8.86bil) takeover of Fitbit Inc amid concerns about how health data could strengthen the search giant\u2019s power in online advertising.    The EU will investigate how information from Fitbit\u2019s fitness trackers will increase Google\u2019s \u201cdata advantage\u201d in online advertising that rivals would struggle to match, the European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday. Officials set an initial Dec 9 deadline to approve or veto the deal.    Regulators are increasingly scrutinising Silicon Valley takeovers, aiming to prevent the already powerful firms from conquering innovative new markets where data is often the most prized asset. Privacy and consumer advocates have been calling on the EU to examine how the deal could allow the Alphabet Inc unit to expand into healthcare.    \u201cThis data provides key insights about the life and the health situation of the users of these devices,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, the EU\u2019s antitrust commissioner. \u201cOur investigation aims to ensure that control by Google over data collected through wearable devices as a result of the transaction does not distort competition.\u201d    The EU will focus on online search advertising where it says Google is dominant in most of Europe and on online display ads where it says Google holds a strong market position in 20 European countries. It will also examine ad tech services, how the deal will affect digital healthcare and whether Google could make it harder for rivals to make devices that work well with its Android mobile phone software.    Google insisted the \u201cdeal is about devices, not data\u201d, according to a blog post. \u201cThere\u2019s vibrant competition when it comes to smartwatches and fitness trackers, with Apple, Samsung, Garmin, Fossil, Huawei, Xiaomi and many others offering numerous products at a range of prices. We don\u2019t currently make or sell wearable devices like these today.\u201d    Google said it won\u2019t use Fitbit health data for Google ads and will give Fitbit users the choice to review, move or delete their data. The company will also \u201csupport wide connectivity and interoperability\u201d of Google products with others.    Google and Fitbit shares were little changed at 11am in New York.    \u2018Insufficient\u2019 concessions    The EU said Google had offered to store some of Fitbit\u2019s data separately from other Google data. Regulators said that was insufficient to address its concerns and would not have covered all of the Fitbit data that could be valuable for advertising.    The wide scope of the probe seems to be a response to criticisms that antitrust authorities have failed to curb deals that extended Silicon Valley\u2019s control into new industries.    The Fitbit deal is set to be \u201ca worrying game-changer\u201d said Monique Guyens, the head of European consumer advocacy group BEUC. The EU probe is crucial \u201cbecause wearable devices like Fitbit\u2019s could in future give companies details of essentially everything consumers do 24/7 and feed digital services back\u201d.    Many big tech takeovers of small firms have escaped EU regulatory reviews since target firms made little or no revenue.    The US Justice Department is also investigating the takeover, while Australia\u2019s merger authority flagged preliminary worries in June over Google\u2019s access to health data.    The deal sparked antitrust and privacy concerns as soon as it was announced in November with US lawmakers and consumer groups voicing criticism. It came in the midst of a separate antitrust investigation by the US Justice Department into whether Google illegally monopolised digital advertising markets.    EU regulators started a sweeping inquiry into devices made by Google and others that collect consumer data last month. Vestager mentioned wearable devices such as Fitbit as one of the many data-collecting products that officials will scrutinise. \u2013

The EU will investigate how information from Fitbit\u2019s fitness trackers will increase Google\u2019s \u201cdata advantage\u201d in online advertising that rivals would struggle to match, the European Commission said in a statement on Tuesday. Officials set an initial Dec 9 deadline to approve or veto the deal.    Regulators are increasingly scrutinizing Silicon Valley takeovers, aiming to prevent the already powerful firms from conquering innovative new markets where data is often the most prized asset. Privacy and consumer advocates have been calling on the EU to examine how the deal could allow the Alphabet Inc unit to expand into healthcare.    \u201cThis data provides key insights about the life and the health situation of the users of these devices,\u201d said Margrethe Vestager, the EU\u2019s antitrust commissioner. \u201cOur investigation aims to ensure that control by Google over data collected through wearable devices as a result of the transaction does not distort competition.\u201d    The EU will focus on online search advertising where it says Google is dominant in most of Europe and on online display ads where it says Google holds a strong market position in 20 European countries. It will also examine ad tech services, how the deal will affect digital healthcare and whether Google could make it harder for rivals to make devices that work well with its Android mobile phone software.    Google insisted the \u201cdeal is about devices, not data,\u201d according to a blog post. \u201cThere\u2019s vibrant competition when it comes to smartwatches and fitness trackers, with Apple , Samsung , Garmin, Fossil, Huawei , Xiaomi and many others offering numerous products at a range of prices. We don\u2019t currently make or sell wearable devices like these today.\u201d    Google said it won\u2019t use Fitbit health data for Google ads and will give Fitbit users the choice to review, move or delete their data. The company will also \u201csupport wide connectivity and interoperability\u201d of Google products with others.    Google and Fitbit shares were little changed at 11 am in New York.   \u2018Insufficient\u2019 Concessions   The EU said Google had offered to store some of Fitbit\u2019s data separately from other Google data. Regulators said that was insufficient to address its concerns and would not have covered all of the Fitbit data that could be valuable for advertising.    The wide scope of the probe seems to be a response to criticisms that antitrust authorities have failed to curb deals that extended Silicon Valley\u2019s control into new industries.    The Fitbit deal is set to be \u201ca worrying game-changer\u201d said Monique Guyens, the head of European consumer advocacy group BEUC. The EU probe is crucial \u201cbecause wearable devices like Fitbit\u2019s could in future give companies details of essentially everything consumers do 24/7 and feed digital services back.\u201d    Many big tech takeovers of small firms have escaped EU regulatory reviews since target firms made little or no revenue.    The US Justice Department is also investigating the takeover, while Australia\u2019s merger authority flagged preliminary worries in June over Google\u2019s access to health data.    The deal sparked antitrust and privacy concerns as soon as it was announced in November with US lawmakers and consumer groups voicing criticism. It came in the midst of a separate antitrust investigation by the Justice Department into whether Google illegally monopolized digital advertising markets.    EU regulators started a sweeping inquiry into devices made by Google and others that collect consumer data last month. Vestager mentioned wearable devices such as Fitbit as one of the many data-collecting products that officials will scrutinize.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata
