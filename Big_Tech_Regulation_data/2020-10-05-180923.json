In a moment, we'll speak with two leading members of that panel.</p><p>But first, the nations long goodbye to Senator John McCain. McCain will be laid to rest today in a private ceremony at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, which meant so much to him.</p><p>FOX News correspondent Peter Doocy reports on a very public farewell yesterday in Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Lawmakers, loved ones and diplomats gathered Saturday for a final goodbye to Senator John McCain.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The world will be lonelier without John McCain.</p><p>DOOCY: One of McCain's best friends, former Senator Joe Lieberman, told mourners about the time McCain asked him to join the GOP ticket even though he was a registered Democrat.</p><p>JOHN LIEBERMAN, MCCAIN'S BEST FRIEND: John's response was direct and really ennobling. That's the point, Joe, he said with a certain impatience. You are a Democrat, I'm a Republican. We could give our country the bipartisan leadership it needs for a change.</p><p>DOOCY: McCain's former political rivals spoke on his behalf too.</p><p>BUSH: In recent years, we sometimes talk about that intense period like football players remembering a big game. In the process, rivalry melted away.</p><p>OBAMA: So much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can seem small and mean and petty. John called on us to be bigger than that.</p><p>DOOCY: McCain's daughter Meghan broke from her tear-filled tribute to more sharply criticize the current president who wasn't invited.</p><p>MEGHAN MCCAIN, DAUGHTER OF SEN. MCCAIN: America has no need to be made great again because America was always great.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: And joining me now here in Washington, John McCain's good friend, Senator Lindsey Graham.</p><p>Welcome again to \"FOX News Sunday.\"</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Thank you for having me.</p><p>WALLACE: You are speaking today at the private ceremony at the U.S. naval academy. Your tribute, first of all, how are you doing, and secondly, what are you going to say?</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, I'm doing OK. These things help. Thank you to everybody who has called and asked me how I'm doing. Cindy and everyone else around the family has helped me, as much I helped them, probably more so.</p><p>I'm going to say that nobody loved a soldier more than John McCain, that I bear witness to his commitment to have their back, travel where they go, never let them be forgotten. The public may be tired of this war called the war on terrorism, but John McCain never was. And he had their back and he gave them what they need to win a fight we can't afford to lose. And he was willing to lose a political race, but not a war. So, I'm going to talk about all my travels with the troops and how much they love John McCain.</p><p>WALLACE: I have to ask you about the passionate, heartfelt but sometimes angry tribute by Meghan McCain who took some pretty clear shots at President Trump. Here's a clip.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEGHAN MCCAIN, DAUGHTER OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN: We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness. The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Was that appropriate? Was it fair?</p><p>GRAHAM: If you say something bad about Meghan's father, you will know it, she didn't like it. So, it's OK, she is grieving.</p><p>All I can say is there's a lesson to be learned this week about John McCain. Number one, Americans appreciate military service. If we've learned nothing this week you know the fact that John served our country in extraordinary circumstances. It was appreciated by everybody.</p><p>What else do we know? If you work hard and do your homework and know what you're talking about, people will listen to you. That if you pick big causes bigger than yourself, you'll be remembered.</p><p>He tried to drain the swamp before it was cool, that you can fight hard and still be respected. If you forgive, people appreciate it, and if you admit to mistakes, you look good as a stronger man. That's the formula, John McCain. This was a civics lesson for anybody who wanted to listen. Why do remember this man, because of the way he conducted his public life.</p><p>WALLACE: Do you think there's a lesson there for President Trump?</p><p>GRAHAM: There's a lesson here for everybody, including President Trump. Everybody makes mistakes. Those who admit it are seen by the public as bigger, not smaller. Know what you're talking about, fight hard, forgive, and have passion, strength and kindness are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>WALLACE: Let's turn to your day job and this week, you're going to be spending a lot of time as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh --</p><p>GRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>WALLACE: -- to be confirmed to the Supreme Court.</p><p>First of all, does he have the votes to win confirmation of the court?</p><p>GRAHAM: If he does well at the hearing he will get, my belief is 55 or higher. If he does well enough, I'm sure he will do well.</p><p>WALLACE: When you say 55, you've got to have 51 Republicans, with the appointment of McCain's replacement. So, you are saying as many as four Democrats?</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, that's 55. Last time I checked --</p><p>WALLACE: So, that's what you think.</p><p>GRAHAM: Yes. I'm not good at math, but yes, I think there are a handful of Democrats will vote for Judge Kavanaugh if he does well and maybe even more. A lot of people should vote for Judge Kavanaugh. If you are looking to a Republican president to pick a qualified conservative, he would be on the top of anyone's list including not just Donald Trump.</p><p>He's the one person I think every Republican president would see is the most qualified of their generation.</p><p>WALLACE: Democrats say that the confirmation should be delayed until we know whether or not there's going to be either a criminal prosecution of President Trump or impeachment proceedings against President Trump.</p><p>Here is Senator Dick Durbin, who was going to be on the program next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: We should be withholding this decision on the Supreme Court nominee until the air is cleared and we know exactly where we stand when it comes to this president and (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Given that his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, says that candidate Trump in 2016 directed him to commit a crime, does the senator have a point?</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, it wasn't the point he had when Clinton was under investigation, we approved Justice Breyer. So, my Democratic friends did not have this view when Clinton was president.</p><p>WALLACE: We should point, I'm going to bring it up with Senator Durbin. 1994, Clinton is under investigation by the independent counsel in Whitewater and he was nominated.</p><p>GRAHAM: I think --</p><p>WALLACE: Stephen Breyer was confirmed to the court.</p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Grassley has been very fair. More documents than the person ever nominated to the Supreme Court. We're going to have a hearing and there's no drama in this hearing. The only drama is those running for president, how will they handle this hearing on the Democratic side? You know, we're going to get this good man confirmed.</p><p>WALLACE: Let me ask you, though, about this question of criminal liability. I want to look at some Kavanaugh's statements on that issue. Let's put them up. In 1999, Kavanaugh said the Nixon ruling, that President Nixon had to turn over all of the White House Watergate tapes may have been, quote, wrongly decided. In 2009, Kavanaugh wrote: criminal investigations take the president's focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people.</p><p>Is there a legitimate concern that Justice Kavanaugh, if you were faced with a case on the Supreme Court, would side with the president against either Congress or the court?</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, what I think you'll find is somebody that has had 308 decisions. So, you can get a pretty good idea of what he thinks based on his time on the court of appeals but the bottom line here is that most people are unsure as to whether or not a president can be indicted, a sitting president.</p><p>Impeachment is a process to remove a president, their criminal liability aspects are very much in debate. I think he's going to be mainstream in his thinking. He's going to look at both sides of the issue and decide appropriately.</p><p>WALLACE: One issue that pro-choice senators of both sides have pressed Kavanaugh on in their meetings with him on Capitol Hill is abortion. And Kavanaugh reportedly told them that Roe v. Wade is, quote, \"settled law\". Is that a firm commitment in your regard, in your view, to not overturn Roe? And if it is a firm commitment, how can you as a pro-life senator support him?</p><p>GRAHAM: I wouldn't vote for anybody that says that every decision the Supreme Court cannot be revisited. They revisit through a process. There's a process of overturning long precedent. There's a four-part test you have to apply.</p><p>From my point of view, what he will do is when that case comes, if it ever does, you just don't wake up one day and say, hey, I'd like to overturn Roe v. Wade. If there's a conflict that makes it to the Supreme Court, he will apply the test of precedent to that decision, Roe v. Wade, and every other precedent.</p><p>WALLACE: But to make it clear, you're saying you don't view his statement, for instance, to Senator Collins, a pro-choice Republican, that it settled law means that therefore it can't be re-examined and conceivably overturn?</p><p>GRAHAM: He would be disqualified, in my opinion, if you would not listen to both sides of the story and decide accordingly. This idea that Roe v. Wade is going to be challenged at state level, there are all kinds of laws out there. Some may work their way up to Supreme Court. He will give great deference I'm sure to Roe v. Wade. But it can be overturned like every other decision but that will be up to the facts on the record.</p><p>WALLACE: Senator Graham, thank you, thanks for your time on on the tough weekend. Our deepest sympathies in a loss of a dear friend, sir.</p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. Thank you so much.</p><p>Joining me now from Illinois, another member of the committee that will be questioning Judge Kavanaugh, Dick Durbin, the Senate's number two Democrat.</p><p>Senator, Democrats have tried a variety of efforts to upend and derail the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh. I want to put some of them up.</p><p>The argument that there is a midterm election. The argument that President Trump is under investigation. If you want to see millions of pages of documents from when he was staff secretary for President George W. Bush, and the White House has no invoked executive privilege to withhold 100,000 pages from when he worked for the White House counsel.</p><p>I think it's fair to say that none of that has worked and the question is, why is it the Democrats have so far been unable to gain any traction against Judge Kavanaugh, and in the public debate, you don't seem to have laid a glove on him?</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Let me say at the outset before we get into that and I will address it -- I joined with Lindsey Graham, every word he said John McCain John McCain. I respect John McCain so much and yesterday was a great display of the respect so many people across this country had for this great American. I was lucky enough to be with Lindsey and John involved in some very important negotiations for more than a year on comprehensive immigration reform. So I back up every word.</p><p>So let me start with Brett Kavanaugh in this way. He is the most unpopular Supreme Court nominee in the last 40 years. How did he reach that point so quickly? Well, I think there were a number of reasons for it.</p><p>You look at first and foremost is the fact that this president said I'm not going to put a man on the Supreme Court unless he is going to overturn Roe versus Wade and the Affordable Care Act. The president is never at a loss for words and he was very explicit in terms of what he wanted in a Supreme Court nominee. Those positions may be popular with his Republican base. They're not popular with the American people.</p><p>WALLACE: Wait, wait --</p><p>GRAHAM: An issue that you have raised --</p><p>WALLACE: Wait. I mean, he said he was going to appoint pro-life judges. He never said that he asked him or on a litmus test about that. And also, I have to say, I'm a little surprised that you are saying he's the most unpopular. When did we nominate and confirm Supreme Court justices based on public opinion polls?</p><p>DURBIN: Well, we shouldn't be. But you started off with the premise you've never laid a glove on him. The fact of the matter is the American people have gone through this nomination and come to the conclusion that he's not the right person for the job.</p><p>Let me go a little bit further here. He comes before us at a time when people are concerned about whether this president or any president is above the law. Think about his role, Kavanaugh's role, when it came to Judge Ken Starr going after President Clinton. He was the aggressive prosecutor in that respect and a few years later after working in the Bush White House said that completely reversed my position. A president should not be subject to the subject of prosecution while he's in office.</p><p>WALLACE: Can I -- can I let me just ask you about that because as Lindsey Graham brought up, and I was going to ask you anyway, in 1994, Bill Clinton was under investigation by an independent counsel on Whitewater and he nominated and the Senate confirmed Stephen Breyer and that was also in a midterm election year. That relate directly contradicts two of the arguments that you're making against Kavanaugh.</p><p>DURBIN: Let me just say that I was not a member of the Senate when Justice Breyer came before that body, but it will tell you at the time the investigation was underway, there was no suspicion at that moment that Clinton was going to brush it aside and say, you have no authority to even question me. It went forward. He was subpoenaed, he was deposed, he was tried in the House -- and I should say indicted under the impeachment clause and tried in the Senate. I was at the Senate at the time.</p><p>And now, we have a different situation completely. There is a serious question as to whether this president, given the opportunity, will end the Mueller investigation, something which most Republicans and the overwhelming majority of Americans say would be a serious mistake and we ask, of course, Judge Kavanaugh, what do you think, and he says it's hands off when it comes to a president during his term in office.</p><p>I think that's a mistake and it's one of the major reasons people had misgivings about his nomination.</p><p>WALLACE: Let's look at some specific issues. As I pointed out, Kavanaugh has told some pro-choice senators that he views Roe as settled law, he was asked about Obamacare, there's a Texas case that would try to take it all down because of the fact that the individual mandate has been repealed. He said that he was very skeptical of that.</p><p>Obviously, these aren't confirmed commitments. You wouldn't expect that from any judge.</p><p>Isn't it the real problem that this is a conservative judge, Donald Trump went to the country and promised to nominate conservative judges, originalists who would -- who would interpret the Constitution as written, it hasn't healed well within the mainstream, yes conservative, but within the judicial mainstream?</p><p>DURBIN: Well, you overlook one of the most important elements of his nomination, and that is the fact that there has been more concealment of documents concerning his public service and his position on issues than ever in the history of the United States.</p><p>WALLACE: He's given you half a million documents, sir.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DURBIN: Let me just make my point here, Chris. The assertion of executive privilege by the White House to take 100,000 documents and say the American people will not get a chance to see them as they reflect on Kavanaugh's background is the first time in history. This denial of access to documents violates a role that we thought was a tradition of the Senate under Senator Sessions and Senator Leahy, time and again when it came to Obama nominees.</p><p>They are suppressing these documents. If we are lucky we will see 6 percent, 6 percent, of all of the documents that have been produced -- that could be produced to reflect on Kavanaugh's true position on issues. He saying and the White House saying the American people have no right to know.</p><p>So, if he so proud of his conservative credentials show us the record, stand before us, trust the American people and they will trust you. I would say that to Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p>WALLACE: I -- and you will have the opportunity to do that starting on Tuesday. Let me just say as a point of saying goodbye, they have turned over half a million documents and the issue, part of it is about 3 million documents when he was staff secretary and every document that went to the president went to his desk.</p><p>But, Senator Durbin, thank you. Thanks for joining us. We look forward to your questioning of Judge Kavanaugh starting this week.</p><p>DURBIN: Thanks, Chris.</p><p>WALLACE: Always good to talk with you, sir.</p><p>Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what to expect from this week's showdown between the president's Supreme Court pick and Senate Democrats.</p><p>Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about how Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation would change the Supreme Court? Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We need to elect senators who will vote for judges to follow our laws and our Constitution as written.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST: President Trump on the campaign trail this week making the case for his choice of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court and it's time now for our Sunday group.</p><p>Former press secretary for Vice President Pence, Marc Lotter, Charles Lane of \"The Washington Post\", former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards, and \"Washington Post\" columnist and former White House speechwriter Marc Thiessen.</p><p>Chuck, when Justice Kennedy, the swing vote on the court, stepped down and there was talk about replacing him, we heard all this talk about a fierce battle for the future of the court and I want to ask you the same question that I asked Senator Durbin, why hasn't it happen? The Democrats don't seem to have gained much traction against Brett Kavanaugh so far.</p><p>CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: I think there's a lot of reasons, starting with the fact that it's just possible Republicans care a little bit more about this than actually Democrats do. I did a little checking and Democrats were a little bit less likely than Republicans to vote in 2016 based on the future of the Supreme Court. So, there's a little bit of a surprising passion gap there.</p><p>Secondly, I think it's the very simple fact that this is about 51 votes and the Republicans have 51 votes, and that means two things, one, Mitch McConnell can control the pace of this thing, control the calendar and so forth. And secondly, it means the Democrats are just struggling to get over that work and they are divided. Not divided down the middle, but they are divided between the main block of the party and several people who have to run for reelection in red states.</p><p>That's created a very difficult problem in messaging for them and so they are left dealing not with the substance of the Kavanaugh thing but procedural issues like document disclosure, arcane matters, very important but very arcane about executive privilege and the net effect is they have yet to identify some hot button things that can get the public excited against Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p>WALLACE: We ask you for questions for the panel and we got this on Twitter from Waris Waldo, which after I read it several times realize some persons interpretation of where is Waldo.</p><p>When did adhering to the United States Constitution became radical and threatening?</p><p>Marc Lotter, how do you answer that?</p><p>MARC LOTTER, FORMER PENCE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, I think that's the basis of this argument. And we have -- and Judge Kavanaugh and in Justice Gorsuch -- we have someone who adheres to the Constitution and many on the liberal side prefer to appoint justices who interpret the law to mean things other than what it says. That's the heart of the argument.</p><p>WALLACE: I want to turn to the nation's farewell to John McCain which has been the big story this week and his daughter Meghan's tribute to him at the National Cathedral yesterday, which still has a lot of people talking. Here's part of that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEGHAN MCCAIN, DAUGHTER OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN: The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Marc Thiessen, it's her dad.</p><p>MARC THIESSEN, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE SPEECHWRITER: Yes.</p><p>WALLACE: She obviously feels passionately about the fact that she thinks that President Trump didn't treat her dad well and he didn't, what did you think of her remarks?</p><p>THIESSEN: Well, first of all, just watching her this week has been heartbreaking because her grief has been palpable and so was her anger palpable yesterday and with good reason because Donald Trump treated her father disgracefully.</p><p>If you want to put this in perspective, there have been 1,974 United States senators since the founding of the republic. John McCain is only the sixth senator to lie in state who wasn't either a vice president or president. So, this is a tremendous testament and there are only 31 people in American history who had laid in state.</p><p>This may very well be the first time that the sitting president of the United States has not participated in honoring that person, and that as a result of his disgraceful behavior towards him. He was even criticizing John McCain by name a few weeks ago on the campaign trail to suggest that he wasn't a war hero and never apologized for that.</p><p>This is one of the reasons, Chris, why I think Donald Trump, despite a booming economy, his disapproval has reached now 60 percent in the country. It's not because people don't like his policies, because his policies are obviously improving the lives of people, the economy is booming and on employment is low. But his inability to be presidential and to rise to the occasion at a moment like this, put aside his petty grievances against John McCain, I think that's one of the reasons why his popularity doesn't match his success as president.</p><p>WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, I promise I'm going to bring one but Marc Lotter is out someone often defends this president. Your reaction?</p><p>LOTTER: Well, I think it takes two to tango. And I think John McCain and Senator McCain has made a very good career out of attacking presidents when he disagreed on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>WALLACE: But in fairness, he somehow had a good enough relationship with George W. Bush and Barack Obama that they spoke at his funeral.</p><p>LOTTER: And he did. This is one that continued on this week. And I think once we get past this, we will remember John McCain for all of his great service. The president is going to continue to go on and is going to do many things that John McCain supported like supporting our troops, investing in our military and we'll let their -- we'll let their disagreement I guess go on in history.</p><p>WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, your reaction to Meghan McCain's remarks and when you take in addition, because it wasn't just McCain, it was Joe Biden and it was Barack Obama, and it was George W. Bush, the last Republican president before Trump. Was this week a rebuke of President Trump?</p><p>DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (D-MD): Well, I think that Meghan McCain's remarks and all of the remarks of the various speakers were John McCain speaking. His hand was clearly evident in those remarks and particularly Meghan's remarks and I think that there were spot on for where we are in this nation.</p><p>You know, I come from a military family too and I think for the president of the United States not to have honored and recognized Senator McCain's service, irrespective of policy disagreement I think was disgraceful and I think the nation stood up and said that it was disgraceful too. And that all of those speakers indicated that what was valued and Senator McCain in addition to his service in his honor was his commitment to this country and that we had a president of the United States who seemed incapable of even acknowledging that.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. We're going to leave it on that note. Panel, we will take a break here. We'll see you a little later.</p><p>Up next, President Trump threatens to cut Canada out of a new NAFTA deal and forge ahead just with Mexico. What would that mean for workers in the economy?</p><p>On this Labor Day weekend, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka joins us next.</p><p>WALLACE: Coming up, President Trump looks to replace NAFTA as he works on a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And we're going to call it the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement. And we'll get rid of the name NAFTA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: We'll talk with the head of the largest group of unions in the country, Richard Trumka, next.</p><p>WALLACE: Negotiations to hammer out a deal to reshape NAFTA, the three nation trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, will continue this weeks after talks between the White House and Canada stalled amid some bitterness.</p><p>Joining us now to discuss the potential fallout for American workers is the president of the AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka.</p><p>Mr. Trumka, President Trump has negotiated a new NAFTA deal with Mexico, but talks with Canada stalled after some off the record comments that he made were published that he acknowledged that he won't make any concessions to Canada. And here's what he said about that afterwards.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Here's the good news, at least Canada knows where I stand, because we can't have these countries taking advantage of the United States anymore. It's very simple.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Question, can you support a deal that leads Canada out of a new NAFTA and will Congress pass it?</p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, AFL-CIO PRESIDENT: Well, Chris, before I get to that, just let me say, on behalf of the hardworking men and women of this country who wake our country up every day, make her run all day and put it to bed at night, let me wish you a happy Labor Day and all your listeners a happy Labor Day.</p><p>Look, our economies are integrated, the three countries in North America, the economy is pretty emigrated. And it's pretty hard to see how that would work without having Canada in the deal. You said that the Mexican deal is close, but there's still a lot of work to be left -- to be done, even on the Mexican deal, Chris, because the language isn't drafted. We haven't seen whole chapters of the thing. We're anxious to move forward with it and anxious to have all three countries involved, because NAFTA has had a devastating effect on the working people of this country for the last 25 years. So we've been aggressively pursuing an agreement that works for the workers in all three countries and I can say we're not done yet.</p><p>WALLACE: OK, but let's talk about the parts of the deal we do know about that the Trump administration has negotiated with Mexico that it seems to me would be pretty good for workers. Let's put them up on the screen.</p><p>Seventy-five percent of a car's value would have to be manufactured in North America. That's up from 62.5 percent. Forty to forty-five percent of the car must be made by workers in whatever country earning at least $16 an hour.</p><p>Do you support both of those provisions and, frankly, do you think that Mexico would live up to them? For instance, the salary for car workers, because in Mexico right now the salary for a car worker on average is $3 an hour. Do you think they actually are going to boost that to $16 an hour?</p><p>TRUMKA: Well, first of all, those provisions can be very, very good. And you said that the current provision is really 62.5. In actuality, Chris, it's only in the 40s because they -- they do a little cheating saying if you put in 62 percent and China puts in 38 percent, it counts as 100 percent. So it's really lower and the change is really more -- more effective. We haven't seen the details of it yet.</p><p>But you hit the nail right on the head. It doesn't matter what's in that agreement. If we can't monitor it and effect it -- and enforce it effectively, then the agreement will fail for workers and it will fail for the country. So what we're pushing right now, and we're working with Ambassador Lighthizer is, is a way to let us effectively monitor what's going on the ground and then enforce the agreement regardless of who's in the White House, because we've been told for over 25 years, trust us, this agreement will be good for workers. What we need is an agreement that we can enforce no matter who's in the White House.</p><p>WALLACE: Let me --</p><p>TRUMKA: That's what we're looking for.</p><p>WALLACE: Let me step back for a minute and go broader view.</p><p>How does big labor feel about President Trump at this point? I mean the fact is growth is up. Unemployment is down. He's using tariffs to try to break down trade barriers that I know that you hate. So, I mean, what mark do you give Donald Trump on this Labor Day weekend?</p><p>TRUMKA: Well, when he was elected, I said I would call balls and strikes. When he did something that was good for workers, we'd support him. When he did something that was bad for workers, we would oppose him.</p><p>Unfortunately, to date, the things that he's done to hurt workers outpace what he's done to help workers. He hasn't come up with an infrastructure program that could put a lot of us back to work. He overturned a regulation that would actually denied over 5 million people overtime that they would have had. He overturned some health and safety regulations that will hurt us on the job. Enforcement of OSHA and MSHA isn't what it should be.</p><p>So we keep trying to find areas where we can work with him. And where we can, we do.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, but let me ask you -- Mr. Trumka, let me ask you, I mean, 3.9 percent unemployment. 3.5 million jobs created, 4 percent -- 4.2 percent GDP in the last quarter. I mean don't you give him something for that?</p><p>TRUMKA: No, those are good, but wages have been down since the first of the year. Gas prices have been up since the first of the year. So, overall, workers aren't doing as well. He passed the tax bill that encourages companies to outsource. We can't agree to support something like that. He's -- every place we can, Chris, we do. But, unfortunately, right now, the scale is weighted against him because he's done more to hurt workers than to help workers.</p><p>WALLACE: So you have launched a new big political campaign for the midterms. You have an ad out on the web right now. Is it your hope that Democrats would take back control of the House and Senate and block the Trump agenda, even those parts that have been good for workers, like creating 3.5 million new jobs?</p><p>TRUMKA: It's not about Democrats or Republicans. It's about electing people who will support working people in this country. That's what we're looking to do.</p><p>We started a couple of months ago, going door-to-door, member to member with our members saying, what issues are important to you? We put those together. We're going to put them in front of candidates. Those candidates that support the issues that our members say they want, need and should have are the candidates that we'll support.</p><p>It probably will be Democrats because, unfortunately, Democrats support working people more than Republicans have. We'd like to change that. But the reality is, Democrats support working people more than Republicans, although we go candidate by candidate and we support those Republicans that support working people.</p><p>WALLACE: Finally, this week I looked at the presidential exit polls from 2016. Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump in union households by just nine points, 51 percent to 42, which interestingly enough is the smallest Democratic advantage since Reagan ran against Mondale in 1984. Question, don't a lot of your members, union members, don't they support Donald Trump?</p><p>TRUMKA: Well, actually, three percentage points more of our members voted for Donald Trump than they did for Mitt Romney. Unfortunately, 10 percent of our members -- 10 percent fewer of our members voted for Hillary Clinton. They didn't believe her on trade. They didn't believe her on a couple of other issues.</p><p>But you talked about households. Union members themselves are a much higher percentage in there. Again, we give them all the facts and I believe in my membership, the rank and file, that when they get the facts, they make the right decision every time. We're giving them the facts on this president and anybody who's running against him and they will ultimately decide which one of those candidates that they want to support.</p><p>WALLACE: Mr. Trumka, thank you. Thanks for sharing part of this Labor Day holiday weekend with us. We'll stay on top of all this, sir.</p><p>TRUMKA: Chris, thanks for having me on. And, again, happy Labor Day.</p><p>WALLACE: When we come back, the Trump administration opens the door to regulating Google. Our Sunday panel returns to discuss the battle with big tech. That's next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think Canada very much wants to make the deal and I think it's going to be obviously very good for Canada if they do and I think it's probably not going to be good at all if they don't.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: President Trump playing hardball with Canada as he tries to rewrite the quarter century old North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.</p><p>And we're back now with the panel.</p><p>Well, Congresswoman Edwards, there was a lot of howling, I think it's fair to say, from Democrats when President Trump said that he was going to revamp NAFTA. But aren't there, and it talked about it with Mr. Trumka, aren't there a number of provisions in this agreement with Mexico at least that are good for American workers?</p><p>DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (D-MD): Well, I think there are also a lot of Democrats who very much wanted to see a North American Free Trade Agreement that really invests in workers, that makes sure that we have protections across both borders. And I think you heard that from what Mr. Trumka was saying. And I -- you know, I think it --</p><p>WALLACE: But raising -- but raising the wage to $16 an hour?</p><p>EDWARDS: Raising the wages. Exactly.</p><p>WALLACE: Raising the amount that has to be content from North America?</p><p>EDWARDS: Right. And all -- those are -- those are actually things that many of us is Democrats have been calling for, for a long time because, you know, we can have free trade, but if it's not fair on both sides of the border, it really doesn't work. It doesn't keep workers here working and it doesn't make sure that workers in Mexico are being paid what they need. And I don't think you can have a North American Free Trade Agreement without having the other part of North America, which is Canada, in the deal too.</p><p>WALLACE: Let me pick up on that with you, Marc Lotter, because talks with Canada stalled on Friday over it seems to issues, one is continued dairy protections inside Canada and, secondly, the publishing of off the record comments by President Trump where he basically said, I'm not going to offer any concessions at all to Canada. Does this deal go through? And -- and I'm primarily, I guess, I'm talking about Congress, does this deal go through without Canada onboard?</p><p>MARC LOTTER, FORMER PENCE PRESS SECRETARY: I think it makes it much easier if Canada is on board to get it through Congress. But this is -- this is very tough negotiating with the president and the prime minister and the Canadian officials. The president is very clear, he wants to get this done. He wants Canada to be involved. And it's going to be a question now of, can they make enough concessions to make it fair on both sides? I think they will.</p><p>WALLACE: Let's turn to another big story this week and that is President Trump complaining that Google's search engine, when you put in \"President Trump news,\" it has been calibrated to drown out conservative voices. The president and his team this week complained about that and even talked about regulating Google.</p><p>Here's the president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've made it clear that we, as a country, cannot tolerate political censorship, blacklisting and rigged search results.</p><p>We're not going to let them control what we can and cannot see, read, and learn from. We can't do that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Chuck, first of all, from the best of your knowledge, is there political bias in the Google search? I mean is it calibrated to drown out conservative voices and to push liberal points of view? And, secondly, what do you make of the threat by the president that the government might get involved in regulating Google?</p><p>CHARLES LANE, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Well, the best of my knowledge about Google's algorithms is not very good.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, that's why I asked you. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>LANE: But I -- I would be very surprised if somebody at Google said, let's set up the algorithm to drown out Donald Trump in any specific sense like that. I think these searches work in an incredibly complex ways that for some unconscious or otherwise neutral reason may be turning up what President Trump claims they're turning up. But, of course, it's just his claim.</p><p>But there's a bigger context for this, which is, a lot of stuff going on at Google, like a few months back an employee circulating a memo internally claiming that the company isolates conservatives internally, then he winds up on the outs. There's a movement within Google to decouple Google, so to speak, from defense contracting and so forth. And I think the president's pushing back against those things and he's more generally trying to turn Google into just another part of this big, fake news media that has been his big foil all through his political career.</p><p>You know, there's a lot of suspicion, both on the left and the right, in sort of populist America about these giant technology companies. And I think in that sense, he's just trying to turn them into another one of his scapegoats to show like everything is stacked against us, even the search engine.</p><p>WALLACE: Marc, your thoughts about whether the government should be regulating a company like Google? Are their First Amendment issues there? And if they were (ph) going to regulate Google in terms of its search engine, they can do a number of things just to make life difficult for Google.</p><p>MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No doubt. And I -- look, I think the - - the fact that there -- there is conservative bias in social media. It's not just Google. It's FaceBook. It's Twitter. There's been a lot of accusations. They probably -- the only place where there's more anti- conservative bias than the legacy media is Silicon Valley. So, you know, and the fact is, a lot of people getting their news from Silicon Valley in a ways that they weren't a few years ago. But -- and so Trump is raising a valid point.</p><p>Where he loses me is when he says that he wants the government to start regulating it, because I -- the only institution I trust less than Google to regulate my -- my search is the federal government. So I think what we need is for people to be more proactive in terms of where they get their news and how they -- they consume their news.</p><p>One of the -- the -- the avenue of social media has given conservatives an incredible voice that they didn't have before because they didn't have to go through \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times.\" So they have a voice that they never had before. But we're also in these ideological silos were conservatives only read conservative news sources. Liberals only read -- Washington (ph) read liberal news sources. And I think we all need to do a better job of policing ourselves and getting out of our silos and listening to the other side because that's how we get over the division in the country.</p><p>WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, I want to pick up on the last point that Chuck made, and that is, isn't there a legitimate concern -- and on this populist issue about companies, whether it's Google or FaceBook or Twitter or Amazon, these huge companies that have so much power and so much money and so much influence?</p><p>EDWARDS: Well, I mean, but the concern, I think, is really misplaced because if you look at these entities, every time there, you know, is this sort of massive growth in this industry, something else starts up that becomes the next new thing. And we remember when Twitter was the next new thing and Instagram the next new thing. And so I think that the dynamism that's in the industry allows that to, you know, to create an environment where, you know, you can have a lot of different kinds of voices in there. And I think if anything is getting in the way of it in terms of the government, I think it's saying, you know, this -- these decisions around net neutrality because then that makes it even more difficult for conservative or even, you know, far left views to get into the mainstream if you're put on this secondary highway.</p><p>So -- but the idea that the government should have the -- the -- the ability to figure out what the search engine is, I don't think so. I mean most of the people I know in Congress can't even operate their Twitter handle.</p><p>WALLACE: I am remaining silent in this conversation. I'm -- I'm a luddite, which go to Google and look up what it means.</p><p>Thank you panel. See you next Sunday.</p><p>Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week,\" Dolly Parton on why kids around the world call her \"the book lady.\"</p><p>WALLACE: Most of us know her as a legendary singer and songwriter, but as we told you back in March, for millions of kids, she's the one who help them start reading early.</p><p>Here is our \"Power Player of the Week.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOLLY PARTON, FOUNDER, IMAGINATION LIBRARY: I just always thought there was magic in books because it takes you to other places. Anywhere you want to go, you can find it in a book.</p><p>It says Dolly Parton, that's my name.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): The Library of Congress is not the first place you'd expect to see Dolly Parton, but there she was celebrating her love of books.</p><p>PARTON (singing): In my Tennessee mountain home --</p><p>WALLACE: It's a story that begins back when she was growing up, one of 12 children, in the Smoky Mountains of east Tennessee, the daughter of Robert Lee Parton.</p><p>PARTON: Daddy never had a chance to go to school. And daddy couldn't read nor write, but he was really a smart person enough and wondered what all he might have done had he had an education.</p><p>WALLACE: Fast-forward to 1995, when the country music star decided to start the Imagination Library, to give free books to children in her hometown.</p><p>Over the years, the program has spread across the country and overseas. A book every month to kids who sign up from birth until they turn five and go to kindergarten.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to a child to get their own book mailed to them in their own name?</p><p>PARTON: It makes them feel important. It makes them feel special. So, of course, it makes them want to do what the book is all about, learn to read it.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Local communities pay for the books, but Dolly's group pays for sending out more than a million a month, which she helps cover through her companies and concerts and even a children's album.</p><p>PARTON (singing): I am a rainbow.</p><p>PARTON: Oh, millions of dollars, I'm sure.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): And it's that important to you?</p><p>PARTON: Oh, it's very important, because it's my charity. Although there are many things that I do, this is the one that's nearest and dearest to my heart.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Dolly has been performing for more than 60 years. She's won eight Grammy's and is in the Country Music Hall of Fame. But she shows no sign at all of slowing down.</p><p>PARTON: My music is everything to me. It's my gift. It's my joy. It's my job. And it's just something that I love to do. And I never think about that I should quit it.</p><p>WALLACE: Which brings us back to the Imagination Library.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): Though I understand that you have gotten a nickname from this program.</p><p>PARTON: I'm the book lady. Who knew?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are so honored that the hundred millionth book --</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): So there was Dolly with the librarian of Congress donating the 100 millionth book, unveiling a copy of her own \"Coat of Many Colors,\" based on the coat her mother made for her out of scraps of cloth.</p><p>PARTON: Maybe we'll be back for our billionth book one of these days.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All right.</p><p>PARTON: Wouldn't that be nice!</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to you, Library of Congress?</p><p>PARTON: I know. Here I am. A little old country girl from the Smoky Mountains of east Tennessee. Now one of my little books about my mom and a story about my dad is going to be here forever in the Library of Congress.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Dolly even gave us a little concert about the coat and her family and what led her to share her dream with so many children.</p><p>PARTON (singing): In my coat of many colors that my mama made for me, made only from rags but I wore it so proudly. And although we had no money, I was rich as I could be, in my coat of many colors mama made for me, because she made it just for me.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: Dolly's Imagination Library now teams up with the Library of Congress for a special story time for kids, the last Friday of each month streaming online.</p><p>And speaking of kids, I want to introduce you to a special one. Jack Henry Wallace, who was born on Friday, 8 pounds 6 ounces. Jack will make his television debut in December as part of our annual Christmas greeting from now the six Wallace grandkids. Jack, his mom and dad, and, yes, his proud grandpa are all doing well.</p><p>And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018090201cb250</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T5N-P3J1-JB20-G4J0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8045\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 2, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>AFL-CIO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Mexico</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAFTA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trade</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>President Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Google</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Dolly Parton</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Children</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Education</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Supreme Court</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Brett Kavanagh</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Evidence</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUVGQkU0QjJFMTIzNDNBM0FCNTVEQjAxQTM3RDcwOTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Executive Privilege</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTFDMDlDMjBFMDRCNDI1M0JGMTUyNDFENzI5RDNDNUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjE0NTg5RTY2RjY1NDA4NTgzOEU0MkJDN0UzNDc5ODk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>International Trade Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>Labor Provisions</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjM2REZGRTc4MTg3NDM2REFBOTk5ODRFNUM2MTE5QjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkMzNkQyQzU0NEIxNDQ2MUE1MTlEQTA4MjFEQ0UyQzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>GATT &amp;

In the process, rivalry melted away.</p><p>OBAMA: So much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can seem small and mean and petty. John called on us to be bigger than that.</p><p>DOOCY: McCain's daughter Meghan broke from her tear-filled tribute to more sharply criticize the current president who wasn't invited.</p><p>MEGHAN MCCAIN, DAUGHTER OF SEN. MCCAIN: America has no need to be made great again because America was always great.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: And joining me now here in Washington, John McCain's good friend, Senator Lindsey Graham.</p><p>Welcome again to \"FOX News Sunday.\"</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Thank you for having me.</p><p>WALLACE: You are speaking today at the private ceremony at the U.S. naval academy. Your tribute, first of all, how are you doing, and secondly, what are you going to say?</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, I'm doing OK. These things help. Thank you to everybody who has called and asked me how I'm doing. Cindy and everyone else around the family has helped me, as much I helped them, probably more so.</p><p>I'm going to say that nobody loved a soldier more than John McCain, that I bear witness to his commitment to have their back, travel where they go, never let them be forgotten. The public may be tired of this war called the war on terrorism, but John McCain never was. And he had their back and he gave them what they need to win a fight we can't afford to lose. And he was willing to lose a political race, but not a war. So, I'm going to talk about all my travels with the troops and how much they love John McCain.</p><p>WALLACE: I have to ask you about the passionate, heartfelt but sometimes angry tribute by Meghan McCain who took some pretty clear shots at President Trump. Here's a clip.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEGHAN MCCAIN, DAUGHTER OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN: We gather here to mourn the passing of American greatness. The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and privilege while he suffered and served.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Was that appropriate? Was it fair?</p><p>GRAHAM: If you say something bad about Meghan's father, you will know it, she didn't like it. So, it's OK, she is grieving.</p><p>All I can say is there's a lesson to be learned this week about John McCain. Number one, Americans appreciate military service. If we've learned nothing this week you know the fact that John served our country in extraordinary circumstances. It was appreciated by everybody.</p><p>What else do we know? If you work hard and do your homework and know what you're talking about, people will listen to you. That if you pick big causes bigger than yourself, you'll be remembered.</p><p>He tried to drain the swamp before it was cool, that you can fight hard and still be respected. If you forgive, people appreciate it, and if you admit to mistakes, you look good as a stronger man. That's the formula, John McCain. This was a civics lesson for anybody who wanted to listen. Why do remember this man, because of the way he conducted his public life.</p><p>WALLACE: Do you think there's a lesson there for President Trump?</p><p>GRAHAM: There's a lesson here for everybody, including President Trump. Everybody makes mistakes. Those who admit it are seen by the public as bigger, not smaller. Know what you're talking about, fight hard, forgive, and have passion, strength and kindness are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>WALLACE: Let's turn to your day job and this week, you're going to be spending a lot of time as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh --</p><p>GRAHAM: Yes.</p><p>WALLACE: -- to be confirmed to the Supreme Court.</p><p>First of all, does he have the votes to win confirmation of the court?</p><p>GRAHAM: If he does well at the hearing he will get, my belief is 55 or higher. If he does well enough, I'm sure he will do well.</p><p>WALLACE: When you say 55, you've got to have 51 Republicans, with the appointment of McCain's replacement. So, you are saying as many as four Democrats?</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, that's 55. Last time I checked --</p><p>WALLACE: So, that's what you think.</p><p>GRAHAM: Yes. I'm not good at math, but yes, I think there are a handful of Democrats will vote for Judge Kavanaugh if he does well and maybe even more. A lot of people should vote for Judge Kavanaugh. If you are looking to a Republican president to pick a qualified conservative, he would be on the top of anyone's list including not just Donald Trump.</p><p>He's the one person I think every Republican president would see is the most qualified of their generation.</p><p>WALLACE: Democrats say that the confirmation should be delayed until we know whether or not there's going to be either a criminal prosecution of President Trump or impeachment proceedings against President Trump.</p><p>Here is Senator Dick Durbin, who was going to be on the program next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: We should be withholding this decision on the Supreme Court nominee until the air is cleared and we know exactly where we stand when it comes to this president and (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Given that his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, says that candidate Trump in 2016 directed him to commit a crime, does the senator have a point?</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, it wasn't the point he had when Clinton was under investigation, we approved Justice Breyer. So, my Democratic friends did not have this view when Clinton was president.</p><p>WALLACE: We should point, I'm going to bring it up with Senator Durbin. 1994, Clinton is under investigation by the independent counsel in Whitewater and he was nominated.</p><p>GRAHAM: I think --</p><p>WALLACE: Stephen Breyer was confirmed to the court.</p><p>GRAHAM: Senator Grassley has been very fair. More documents than the person ever nominated to the Supreme Court. We're going to have a hearing and there's no drama in this hearing. The only drama is those running for president, how will they handle this hearing on the Democratic side? You know, we're going to get this good man confirmed.</p><p>WALLACE: Let me ask you, though, about this question of criminal liability. I want to look at some Kavanaugh's statements on that issue. Let's put them up. In 1999, Kavanaugh said the Nixon ruling, that President Nixon had to turn over all of the White House Watergate tapes may have been, quote, wrongly decided. In 2009, Kavanaugh wrote: criminal investigations take the president's focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people.</p><p>Is there a legitimate concern that Justice Kavanaugh, if you were faced with a case on the Supreme Court, would side with the president against either Congress or the court?</p><p>GRAHAM: Well, what I think you'll find is somebody that has had 308 decisions. So, you can get a pretty good idea of what he thinks based on his time on the court of appeals but the bottom line here is that most people are unsure as to whether or not a president can be indicted, a sitting president.</p><p>Impeachment is a process to remove a president, their criminal liability aspects are very much in debate. I think he's going to be mainstream in his thinking. He's going to look at both sides of the issue and decide appropriately.</p><p>WALLACE: One issue that pro-choice senators of both sides have pressed Kavanaugh on in their meetings with him on Capitol Hill is abortion. And Kavanaugh reportedly told them that Roe v. Wade is, quote, \"settled law\". Is that a firm commitment in your regard, in your view, to not overturn Roe? And if it is a firm commitment, how can you as a pro-life senator support him?</p><p>GRAHAM: I wouldn't vote for anybody that says that every decision the Supreme Court cannot be revisited. They revisit through a process. There's a process of overturning long precedent. There's a four-part test you have to apply.</p><p>From my point of view, what he will do is when that case comes, if it ever does, you just don't wake up one day and say, hey, I'd like to overturn Roe v. Wade. If there's a conflict that makes it to the Supreme Court, he will apply the test of precedent to that decision, Roe v. Wade, and every other precedent.</p><p>WALLACE: But to make it clear, you're saying you don't view his statement, for instance, to Senator Collins, a pro-choice Republican, that it settled law means that therefore it can't be re-examined and conceivably overturn?</p><p>GRAHAM: He would be disqualified, in my opinion, if you would not listen to both sides of the story and decide accordingly. This idea that Roe v. Wade is going to be challenged at state level, there are all kinds of laws out there. Some may work their way up to Supreme Court. He will give great deference I'm sure to Roe v. Wade. But it can be overturned like every other decision but that will be up to the facts on the record.</p><p>WALLACE: Senator Graham, thank you, thanks for your time on on the tough weekend. Our deepest sympathies in a loss of a dear friend, sir.</p><p>GRAHAM: Thank you. Thank you so much.</p><p>Joining me now from Illinois, another member of the committee that will be questioning Judge Kavanaugh, Dick Durbin, the Senate's number two Democrat.</p><p>Senator, Democrats have tried a variety of efforts to upend and derail the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh. I want to put some of them up.</p><p>The argument that there is a midterm election. The argument that President Trump is under investigation. If you want to see millions of pages of documents from when he was staff secretary for President George W. Bush, and the White House has no invoked executive privilege to withhold 100,000 pages from when he worked for the White House counsel.</p><p>I think it's fair to say that none of that has worked and the question is, why is it the Democrats have so far been unable to gain any traction against Judge Kavanaugh, and in the public debate, you don't seem to have laid a glove on him?</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Let me say at the outset before we get into that and I will address it -- I joined with Lindsey Graham, every word he said John McCain John McCain. I respect John McCain so much and yesterday was a great display of the respect so many people across this country had for this great American. I was lucky enough to be with Lindsey and John involved in some very important negotiations for more than a year on comprehensive immigration reform. So I back up every word.</p><p>So let me start with Brett Kavanaugh in this way. He is the most unpopular Supreme Court nominee in the last 40 years. How did he reach that point so quickly? Well, I think there were a number of reasons for it.</p><p>You look at first and foremost is the fact that this president said I'm not going to put a man on the Supreme Court unless he is going to overturn Roe versus Wade and the Affordable Care Act. The president is never at a loss for words and he was very explicit in terms of what he wanted in a Supreme Court nominee. Those positions may be popular with his Republican base. They're not popular with the American people.</p><p>WALLACE: Wait, wait --</p><p>GRAHAM: An issue that you have raised --</p><p>WALLACE: Wait. I mean, he said he was going to appoint pro-life judges. He never said that he asked him or on a litmus test about that. And also, I have to say, I'm a little surprised that you are saying he's the most unpopular. When did we nominate and confirm Supreme Court justices based on public opinion polls?</p><p>DURBIN: Well, we shouldn't be. But you started off with the premise you've never laid a glove on him. The fact of the matter is the American people have gone through this nomination and come to the conclusion that he's not the right person for the job.</p><p>Let me go a little bit further here. He comes before us at a time when people are concerned about whether this president or any president is above the law. Think about his role, Kavanaugh's role, when it came to Judge Ken Starr going after President Clinton. He was the aggressive prosecutor in that respect and a few years later after working in the Bush White House said that completely reversed my position. A president should not be subject to the subject of prosecution while he's in office.</p><p>WALLACE: Can I -- can I let me just ask you about that because as Lindsey Graham brought up, and I was going to ask you anyway, in 1994, Bill Clinton was under investigation by an independent counsel on Whitewater and he nominated and the Senate confirmed Stephen Breyer and that was also in a midterm election year. That relate directly contradicts two of the arguments that you're making against Kavanaugh.</p><p>DURBIN: Let me just say that I was not a member of the Senate when Justice Breyer came before that body, but it will tell you at the time the investigation was underway, there was no suspicion at that moment that Clinton was going to brush it aside and say, you have no authority to even question me. It went forward. He was subpoenaed, he was deposed, he was tried in the House -- and I should say indicted under the impeachment clause and tried in the Senate. I was at the Senate at the time.</p><p>And now, we have a different situation completely. There is a serious question as to whether this president, given the opportunity, will end the Mueller investigation, something which most Republicans and the overwhelming majority of Americans say would be a serious mistake and we ask, of course, Judge Kavanaugh, what do you think, and he says it's hands off when it comes to a president during his term in office.</p><p>I think that's a mistake and it's one of the major reasons people had misgivings about his nomination.</p><p>WALLACE: Let's look at some specific issues. As I pointed out, Kavanaugh has told some pro-choice senators that he views Roe as settled law, he was asked about Obamacare, there's a Texas case that would try to take it all down because of the fact that the individual mandate has been repealed. He said that he was very skeptical of that.</p><p>Obviously, these aren't confirmed commitments. You wouldn't expect that from any judge.</p><p>Isn't it the real problem that this is a conservative judge, Donald Trump went to the country and promised to nominate conservative judges, originalists who would -- who would interpret the Constitution as written, it hasn't healed well within the mainstream, yes conservative, but within the judicial mainstream?</p><p>DURBIN: Well, you overlook one of the most important elements of his nomination, and that is the fact that there has been more concealment of documents concerning his public service and his position on issues than ever in the history of the United States.</p><p>WALLACE: He's given you half a million documents, sir.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DURBIN: Let me just make my point here, Chris. The assertion of executive privilege by the White House to take 100,000 documents and say the American people will not get a chance to see them as they reflect on Kavanaugh's background is the first time in history. This denial of access to documents violates a role that we thought was a tradition of the Senate under Senator Sessions and Senator Leahy, time and again when it came to Obama nominees.</p><p>They are suppressing these documents. If we are lucky we will see 6 percent, 6 percent, of all of the documents that have been produced -- that could be produced to reflect on Kavanaugh's true position on issues. He saying and the White House saying the American people have no right to know.</p><p>So, if he so proud of his conservative credentials show us the record, stand before us, trust the American people and they will trust you. I would say that to Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p>WALLACE: I -- and you will have the opportunity to do that starting on Tuesday. Let me just say as a point of saying goodbye, they have turned over half a million documents and the issue, part of it is about 3 million documents when he was staff secretary and every document that went to the president went to his desk.</p><p>But, Senator Durbin, thank you. Thanks for joining us. We look forward to your questioning of Judge Kavanaugh starting this week.</p><p>DURBIN: Thanks, Chris.</p><p>WALLACE: Always good to talk with you, sir.</p><p>Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what to expect from this week's showdown between the president's Supreme Court pick and Senate Democrats.</p><p>Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about how Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation would change the Supreme Court? Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We need to elect senators who will vote for judges to follow our laws and our Constitution as written.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST: President Trump on the campaign trail this week making the case for his choice of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court and it's time now for our Sunday group.</p><p>Former press secretary for Vice President Pence, Marc Lotter, Charles Lane of \"The Washington Post\", former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards, and \"Washington Post\" columnist and former White House speechwriter Marc Thiessen.</p><p>Chuck, when Justice Kennedy, the swing vote on the court, stepped down and there was talk about replacing him, we heard all this talk about a fierce battle for the future of the court and I want to ask you the same question that I asked Senator Durbin, why hasn't it happen? The Democrats don't seem to have gained much traction against Brett Kavanaugh so far.</p><p>CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: I think there's a lot of reasons, starting with the fact that it's just possible Republicans care a little bit more about this than actually Democrats do. I did a little checking and Democrats were a little bit less likely than Republicans to vote in 2016 based on the future of the Supreme Court. So, there's a little bit of a surprising passion gap there.</p><p>Secondly, I think it's the very simple fact that this is about 51 votes and the Republicans have 51 votes, and that means two things, one, Mitch McConnell can control the pace of this thing, control the calendar and so forth. And secondly, it means the Democrats are just struggling to get over that work and they are divided. Not divided down the middle, but they are divided between the main block of the party and several people who have to run for reelection in red states.</p><p>That's created a very difficult problem in messaging for them and so they are left dealing not with the substance of the Kavanaugh thing but procedural issues like document disclosure, arcane matters, very important but very arcane about executive privilege and the net effect is they have yet to identify some hot button things that can get the public excited against Judge Kavanaugh.</p><p>WALLACE: We ask you for questions for the panel and we got this on Twitter from Waris Waldo, which after I read it several times realize some persons interpretation of where is Waldo.</p><p>When did adhering to the United States Constitution became radical and threatening?</p><p>Marc Lotter, how do you answer that?</p><p>MARC LOTTER, FORMER PENCE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, I think that's the basis of this argument. And we have -- and Judge Kavanaugh and in Justice Gorsuch -- we have someone who adheres to the Constitution and many on the liberal side prefer to appoint justices who interpret the law to mean things other than what it says. That's the heart of the argument.</p><p>WALLACE: I want to turn to the nation's farewell to John McCain which has been the big story this week and his daughter Meghan's tribute to him at the National Cathedral yesterday, which still has a lot of people talking. Here's part of that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEGHAN MCCAIN, DAUGHTER OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN: The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great.</p><p>(APPLAUSE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Marc Thiessen, it's her dad.</p><p>MARC THIESSEN, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE SPEECHWRITER: Yes.</p><p>WALLACE: She obviously feels passionately about the fact that she thinks that President Trump didn't treat her dad well and he didn't, what did you think of her remarks?</p><p>THIESSEN: Well, first of all, just watching her this week has been heartbreaking because her grief has been palpable and so was her anger palpable yesterday and with good reason because Donald Trump treated her father disgracefully.</p><p>If you want to put this in perspective, there have been 1,974 United States senators since the founding of the republic. John McCain is only the sixth senator to lie in state who wasn't either a vice president or president. So, this is a tremendous testament and there are only 31 people in American history who had laid in state.</p><p>This may very well be the first time that the sitting president of the United States has not participated in honoring that person, and that as a result of his disgraceful behavior towards him. He was even criticizing John McCain by name a few weeks ago on the campaign trail to suggest that he wasn't a war hero and never apologized for that.</p><p>This is one of the reasons, Chris, why I think Donald Trump, despite a booming economy, his disapproval has reached now 60 percent in the country. It's not because people don't like his policies, because his policies are obviously improving the lives of people, the economy is booming and on employment is low. But his inability to be presidential and to rise to the occasion at a moment like this, put aside his petty grievances against John McCain, I think that's one of the reasons why his popularity doesn't match his success as president.</p><p>WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, I promise I'm going to bring one but Marc Lotter is out someone often defends this president. Your reaction?</p><p>LOTTER: Well, I think it takes two to tango. And I think John McCain and Senator McCain has made a very good career out of attacking presidents when he disagreed on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>WALLACE: But in fairness, he somehow had a good enough relationship with George W. Bush and Barack Obama that they spoke at his funeral.</p><p>LOTTER: And he did. This is one that continued on this week. And I think once we get past this, we will remember John McCain for all of his great service. The president is going to continue to go on and is going to do many things that John McCain supported like supporting our troops, investing in our military and we'll let their -- we'll let their disagreement I guess go on in history.</p><p>WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, your reaction to Meghan McCain's remarks and when you take in addition, because it wasn't just McCain, it was Joe Biden and it was Barack Obama, and it was George W. Bush, the last Republican president before Trump. Was this week a rebuke of President Trump?</p><p>DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (D-MD): Well, I think that Meghan McCain's remarks and all of the remarks of the various speakers were John McCain speaking. His hand was clearly evident in those remarks and particularly Meghan's remarks and I think that there were spot on for where we are in this nation.</p><p>You know, I come from a military family too and I think for the president of the United States not to have honored and recognized Senator McCain's service, irrespective of policy disagreement I think was disgraceful and I think the nation stood up and said that it was disgraceful too. And that all of those speakers indicated that what was valued and Senator McCain in addition to his service in his honor was his commitment to this country and that we had a president of the United States who seemed incapable of even acknowledging that.</p><p>WALLACE: All right. We're going to leave it on that note. Panel, we will take a break here. We'll see you a little later.</p><p>Up next, President Trump threatens to cut Canada out of a new NAFTA deal and forge ahead just with Mexico. What would that mean for workers in the economy?</p><p>On this Labor Day weekend, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka joins us next.</p><p>WALLACE: Coming up, President Trump looks to replace NAFTA as he works on a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And we're going to call it the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement. And we'll get rid of the name NAFTA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: We'll talk with the head of the largest group of unions in the country, Richard Trumka, next.</p><p>WALLACE: Negotiations to hammer out a deal to reshape NAFTA, the three nation trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, will continue this weeks after talks between the White House and Canada stalled amid some bitterness.</p><p>Joining us now to discuss the potential fallout for American workers is the president of the AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka.</p><p>Mr. Trumka, President Trump has negotiated a new NAFTA deal with Mexico, but talks with Canada stalled after some off the record comments that he made were published that he acknowledged that he won't make any concessions to Canada. And here's what he said about that afterwards.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Here's the good news, at least Canada knows where I stand, because we can't have these countries taking advantage of the United States anymore. It's very simple.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Question, can you support a deal that leads Canada out of a new NAFTA and will Congress pass it?</p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, AFL-CIO PRESIDENT: Well, Chris, before I get to that, just let me say, on behalf of the hardworking men and women of this country who wake our country up every day, make her run all day and put it to bed at night, let me wish you a happy Labor Day and all your listeners a happy Labor Day.</p><p>Look, our economies are integrated, the three countries in North America, the economy is pretty emigrated. And it's pretty hard to see how that would work without having Canada in the deal. You said that the Mexican deal is close, but there's still a lot of work to be left -- to be done, even on the Mexican deal, Chris, because the language isn't drafted. We haven't seen whole chapters of the thing. We're anxious to move forward with it and anxious to have all three countries involved, because NAFTA has had a devastating effect on the working people of this country for the last 25 years. So we've been aggressively pursuing an agreement that works for the workers in all three countries and I can say we're not done yet.</p><p>WALLACE: OK, but let's talk about the parts of the deal we do know about that the Trump administration has negotiated with Mexico that it seems to me would be pretty good for workers. Let's put them up on the screen.</p><p>Seventy-five percent of a car's value would have to be manufactured in North America. That's up from 62.5 percent. Forty to forty-five percent of the car must be made by workers in whatever country earning at least $16 an hour.</p><p>Do you support both of those provisions and, frankly, do you think that Mexico would live up to them? For instance, the salary for car workers, because in Mexico right now the salary for a car worker on average is $3 an hour. Do you think they actually are going to boost that to $16 an hour?</p><p>TRUMKA: Well, first of all, those provisions can be very, very good. And you said that the current provision is really 62.5. In actuality, Chris, it's only in the 40s because they -- they do a little cheating saying if you put in 62 percent and China puts in 38 percent, it counts as 100 percent. So it's really lower and the change is really more -- more effective. We haven't seen the details of it yet.</p><p>But you hit the nail right on the head. It doesn't matter what's in that agreement. If we can't monitor it and effect it -- and enforce it effectively, then the agreement will fail for workers and it will fail for the country. So what we're pushing right now, and we're working with Ambassador Lighthizer is, is a way to let us effectively monitor what's going on the ground and then enforce the agreement regardless of who's in the White House, because we've been told for over 25 years, trust us, this agreement will be good for workers. What we need is an agreement that we can enforce no matter who's in the White House.</p><p>WALLACE: Let me --</p><p>TRUMKA: That's what we're looking for.</p><p>WALLACE: Let me step back for a minute and go broader view.</p><p>How does big labor feel about President Trump at this point? I mean the fact is growth is up. Unemployment is down. He's using tariffs to try to break down trade barriers that I know that you hate. So, I mean, what mark do you give Donald Trump on this Labor Day weekend?</p><p>TRUMKA: Well, when he was elected, I said I would call balls and strikes. When he did something that was good for workers, we'd support him. When he did something that was bad for workers, we would oppose him.</p><p>Unfortunately, to date, the things that he's done to hurt workers outpace what he's done to help workers. He hasn't come up with an infrastructure program that could put a lot of us back to work. He overturned a regulation that would actually denied over 5 million people overtime that they would have had. He overturned some health and safety regulations that will hurt us on the job. Enforcement of OSHA and MSHA isn't what it should be.</p><p>So we keep trying to find areas where we can work with him. And where we can, we do.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, but let me ask you -- Mr. Trumka, let me ask you, I mean, 3.9 percent unemployment. 3.5 million jobs created, 4 percent -- 4.2 percent GDP in the last quarter. I mean don't you give him something for that?</p><p>TRUMKA: No, those are good, but wages have been down since the first of the year. Gas prices have been up since the first of the year. So, overall, workers aren't doing as well. He passed the tax bill that encourages companies to outsource. We can't agree to support something like that. He's -- every place we can, Chris, we do. But, unfortunately, right now, the scale is weighted against him because he's done more to hurt workers than to help workers.</p><p>WALLACE: So you have launched a new big political campaign for the midterms. You have an ad out on the web right now. Is it your hope that Democrats would take back control of the House and Senate and block the Trump agenda, even those parts that have been good for workers, like creating 3.5 million new jobs?</p><p>TRUMKA: It's not about Democrats or Republicans. It's about electing people who will support working people in this country. That's what we're looking to do.</p><p>We started a couple of months ago, going door-to-door, member to member with our members saying, what issues are important to you? We put those together. We're going to put them in front of candidates. Those candidates that support the issues that our members say they want, need and should have are the candidates that we'll support.</p><p>It probably will be Democrats because, unfortunately, Democrats support working people more than Republicans have. We'd like to change that. But the reality is, Democrats support working people more than Republicans, although we go candidate by candidate and we support those Republicans that support working people.</p><p>WALLACE: Finally, this week I looked at the presidential exit polls from 2016. Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump in union households by just nine points, 51 percent to 42, which interestingly enough is the smallest Democratic advantage since Reagan ran against Mondale in 1984. Question, don't a lot of your members, union members, don't they support Donald Trump?</p><p>TRUMKA: Well, actually, three percentage points more of our members voted for Donald Trump than they did for Mitt Romney. Unfortunately, 10 percent of our members -- 10 percent fewer of our members voted for Hillary Clinton. They didn't believe her on trade. They didn't believe her on a couple of other issues.</p><p>But you talked about households. Union members themselves are a much higher percentage in there. Again, we give them all the facts and I believe in my membership, the rank and file, that when they get the facts, they make the right decision every time. We're giving them the facts on this president and anybody who's running against him and they will ultimately decide which one of those candidates that they want to support.</p><p>WALLACE: Mr. Trumka, thank you. Thanks for sharing part of this Labor Day holiday weekend with us. We'll stay on top of all this, sir.</p><p>TRUMKA: Chris, thanks for having me on. And, again, happy Labor Day.</p><p>WALLACE: When we come back, the Trump administration opens the door to regulating Google. Our Sunday panel returns to discuss the battle with big tech. That's next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think Canada very much wants to make the deal and I think it's going to be obviously very good for Canada if they do and I think it's probably not going to be good at all if they don't.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: President Trump playing hardball with Canada as he tries to rewrite the quarter century old North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.</p><p>And we're back now with the panel.</p><p>Well, Congresswoman Edwards, there was a lot of howling, I think it's fair to say, from Democrats when President Trump said that he was going to revamp NAFTA. But aren't there, and it talked about it with Mr. Trumka, aren't there a number of provisions in this agreement with Mexico at least that are good for American workers?</p><p>DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (D-MD): Well, I think there are also a lot of Democrats who very much wanted to see a North American Free Trade Agreement that really invests in workers, that makes sure that we have protections across both borders. And I think you heard that from what Mr. Trumka was saying. And I -- you know, I think it --</p><p>WALLACE: But raising -- but raising the wage to $16 an hour?</p><p>EDWARDS: Raising the wages. Exactly.</p><p>WALLACE: Raising the amount that has to be content from North America?</p><p>EDWARDS: Right. And all -- those are -- those are actually things that many of us is Democrats have been calling for, for a long time because, you know, we can have free trade, but if it's not fair on both sides of the border, it really doesn't work. It doesn't keep workers here working and it doesn't make sure that workers in Mexico are being paid what they need. And I don't think you can have a North American Free Trade Agreement without having the other part of North America, which is Canada, in the deal too.</p><p>WALLACE: Let me pick up on that with you, Marc Lotter, because talks with Canada stalled on Friday over it seems to issues, one is continued dairy protections inside Canada and, secondly, the publishing of off the record comments by President Trump where he basically said, I'm not going to offer any concessions at all to Canada. Does this deal go through? And -- and I'm primarily, I guess, I'm talking about Congress, does this deal go through without Canada onboard?</p><p>MARC LOTTER, FORMER PENCE PRESS SECRETARY: I think it makes it much easier if Canada is on board to get it through Congress. But this is -- this is very tough negotiating with the president and the prime minister and the Canadian officials. The president is very clear, he wants to get this done. He wants Canada to be involved. And it's going to be a question now of, can they make enough concessions to make it fair on both sides? I think they will.</p><p>WALLACE: Let's turn to another big story this week and that is President Trump complaining that Google's search engine, when you put in \"President Trump news,\" it has been calibrated to drown out conservative voices. The president and his team this week complained about that and even talked about regulating Google.</p><p>Here's the president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've made it clear that we, as a country, cannot tolerate political censorship, blacklisting and rigged search results.</p><p>We're not going to let them control what we can and cannot see, read, and learn from. We can't do that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Chuck, first of all, from the best of your knowledge, is there political bias in the Google search? I mean is it calibrated to drown out conservative voices and to push liberal points of view? And, secondly, what do you make of the threat by the president that the government might get involved in regulating Google?</p><p>CHARLES LANE, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Well, the best of my knowledge about Google's algorithms is not very good.</p><p>WALLACE: Well, that's why I asked you. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>LANE: But I -- I would be very surprised if somebody at Google said, let's set up the algorithm to drown out Donald Trump in any specific sense like that. I think these searches work in an incredibly complex ways that for some unconscious or otherwise neutral reason may be turning up what President Trump claims they're turning up. But, of course, it's just his claim.</p><p>But there's a bigger context for this, which is, a lot of stuff going on at Google, like a few months back an employee circulating a memo internally claiming that the company isolates conservatives internally, then he winds up on the outs. There's a movement within Google to decouple Google, so to speak, from defense contracting and so forth. And I think the president's pushing back against those things and he's more generally trying to turn Google into just another part of this big, fake news media that has been his big foil all through his political career.</p><p>You know, there's a lot of suspicion, both on the left and the right, in sort of populist America about these giant technology companies. And I think in that sense, he's just trying to turn them into another one of his scapegoats to show like everything is stacked against us, even the search engine.</p><p>WALLACE: Marc, your thoughts about whether the government should be regulating a company like Google? Are their First Amendment issues there? And if they were (ph) going to regulate Google in terms of its search engine, they can do a number of things just to make life difficult for Google.</p><p>MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No doubt. And I -- look, I think the - - the fact that there -- there is conservative bias in social media. It's not just Google. It's FaceBook. It's Twitter. There's been a lot of accusations. They probably -- the only place where there's more anti- conservative bias than the legacy media is Silicon Valley. So, you know, and the fact is, a lot of people getting their news from Silicon Valley in a ways that they weren't a few years ago. But -- and so Trump is raising a valid point.</p><p>Where he loses me is when he says that he wants the government to start regulating it, because I -- the only institution I trust less than Google to regulate my -- my search is the federal government. So I think what we need is for people to be more proactive in terms of where they get their news and how they -- they consume their news.</p><p>One of the -- the -- the avenue of social media has given conservatives an incredible voice that they didn't have before because they didn't have to go through \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times.\" So they have a voice that they never had before. But we're also in these ideological silos were conservatives only read conservative news sources. Liberals only read -- Washington (ph) read liberal news sources. And I think we all need to do a better job of policing ourselves and getting out of our silos and listening to the other side because that's how we get over the division in the country.</p><p>WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, I want to pick up on the last point that Chuck made, and that is, isn't there a legitimate concern -- and on this populist issue about companies, whether it's Google or FaceBook or Twitter or Amazon, these huge companies that have so much power and so much money and so much influence?</p><p>EDWARDS: Well, I mean, but the concern, I think, is really misplaced because if you look at these entities, every time there, you know, is this sort of massive growth in this industry, something else starts up that becomes the next new thing. And we remember when Twitter was the next new thing and Instagram the next new thing. And so I think that the dynamism that's in the industry allows that to, you know, to create an environment where, you know, you can have a lot of different kinds of voices in there. And I think if anything is getting in the way of it in terms of the government, I think it's saying, you know, this -- these decisions around net neutrality because then that makes it even more difficult for conservative or even, you know, far left views to get into the mainstream if you're put on this secondary highway.</p><p>So -- but the idea that the government should have the -- the -- the ability to figure out what the search engine is, I don't think so. I mean most of the people I know in Congress can't even operate their Twitter handle.</p><p>WALLACE: I am remaining silent in this conversation. I'm -- I'm a luddite, which go to Google and look up what it means.</p><p>Thank you panel. See you next Sunday.</p><p>Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week,\" Dolly Parton on why kids around the world call her \"the book lady.\"</p><p>WALLACE: Most of us know her as a legendary singer and songwriter, but as we told you back in March, for millions of kids, she's the one who help them start reading early.</p><p>Here is our \"Power Player of the Week.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOLLY PARTON, FOUNDER, IMAGINATION LIBRARY: I just always thought there was magic in books because it takes you to other places. Anywhere you want to go, you can find it in a book.</p><p>It says Dolly Parton, that's my name.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): The Library of Congress is not the first place you'd expect to see Dolly Parton, but there she was celebrating her love of books.</p><p>PARTON (singing): In my Tennessee mountain home --</p><p>WALLACE: It's a story that begins back when she was growing up, one of 12 children, in the Smoky Mountains of east Tennessee, the daughter of Robert Lee Parton.</p><p>PARTON: Daddy never had a chance to go to school. And daddy couldn't read nor write, but he was really a smart person enough and wondered what all he might have done had he had an education.</p><p>WALLACE: Fast-forward to 1995, when the country music star decided to start the Imagination Library, to give free books to children in her hometown.</p><p>Over the years, the program has spread across the country and overseas. A book every month to kids who sign up from birth until they turn five and go to kindergarten.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to a child to get their own book mailed to them in their own name?</p><p>PARTON: It makes them feel important. It makes them feel special. So, of course, it makes them want to do what the book is all about, learn to read it.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Local communities pay for the books, but Dolly's group pays for sending out more than a million a month, which she helps cover through her companies and concerts and even a children's album.</p><p>PARTON (singing): I am a rainbow.</p><p>PARTON: Oh, millions of dollars, I'm sure.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): And it's that important to you?</p><p>PARTON: Oh, it's very important, because it's my charity. Although there are many things that I do, this is the one that's nearest and dearest to my heart.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Dolly has been performing for more than 60 years. She's won eight Grammy's and is in the Country Music Hall of Fame. But she shows no sign at all of slowing down.</p><p>PARTON: My music is everything to me. It's my gift. It's my joy. It's my job. And it's just something that I love to do. And I never think about that I should quit it.</p><p>WALLACE: Which brings us back to the Imagination Library.</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): Though I understand that you have gotten a nickname from this program.</p><p>PARTON: I'm the book lady. Who knew?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are so honored that the hundred millionth book --</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): So there was Dolly with the librarian of Congress donating the 100 millionth book, unveiling a copy of her own \"Coat of Many Colors,\" based on the coat her mother made for her out of scraps of cloth.</p><p>PARTON: Maybe we'll be back for our billionth book one of these days.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All right.</p><p>PARTON: Wouldn't that be nice!</p><p>WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to you, Library of Congress?</p><p>PARTON: I know. Here I am. A little old country girl from the Smoky Mountains of east Tennessee. Now one of my little books about my mom and a story about my dad is going to be here forever in the Library of Congress.</p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Dolly even gave us a little concert about the coat and her family and what led her to share her dream with so many children.</p><p>PARTON (singing): In my coat of many colors that my mama made for me, made only from rags but I wore it so proudly. And although we had no money, I was rich as I could be, in my coat of many colors mama made for me, because she made it just for me.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: Dolly's Imagination Library now teams up with the Library of Congress for a special story time for kids, the last Friday of each month streaming online.</p><p>And speaking of kids, I want to introduce you to a special one. Jack Henry Wallace, who was born on Friday, 8 pounds 6 ounces. Jack will make his television debut in December as part of our annual Christmas greeting from now the six Wallace grandkids. Jack, his mom and dad, and, yes, his proud grandpa are all doing well.</p><p>And that's it for today.

Kavanaugh faces days of tough  questioning from a Senate Judiciary Committee.  In a moment, we'll speak  with two leading members of that panel.  </p><p> But first, the nations long goodbye to Senator John McCain.  McCain will be  laid to rest today in a private ceremony at the U.S. Naval Academy in  Annapolis, which meant so much to him.  </p><p>FOX News correspondent Peter Doocy reports on a very public farewell  yesterday in Washington.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Lawmakers, loved ones and diplomats  gathered Saturday for a final goodbye to Senator John McCain.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The world will be lonelier without John McCain.  </p><p> DOOCY:  One of McCain's best friends, former Senator Joe Lieberman, told  mourners about the time McCain asked him to join the GOP ticket even though  he was a registered Democrat.  </p><p> JOHN LIEBERMAN, MCCAIN'S BEST FRIEND:  John's response was direct and  really ennobling.  That's the point, Joe, he said with a certain  impatience.  You are a Democrat, I'm a Republican.  We could give our  country the bipartisan leadership it needs for a change.  </p><p> DOOCY:  McCain's former political rivals spoke on his behalf too.  </p><p> BUSH:  In recent years, we sometimes talk about that intense period like  football players remembering a big game.  In the process, rivalry melted  away.  </p><p> OBAMA:  So much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can  seem small and mean and petty.  John called on us to be bigger than that.  </p><p> DOOCY:  McCain's daughter Meghan broke from her tear-filled tribute to more  sharply criticize the current president who wasn't invited.  </p><p> MEGHAN MCCAIN, DAUGHTER OF SEN. MCCAIN:  America has no need to be made  great again because America was always great.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> WALLACE:  And joining me now here in Washington, John McCain's good friend,  Senator Lindsey Graham.  </p><p> Welcome again to \"FOX News Sunday.\" </p><p> SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  Thank you for  having me.  </p><p> WALLACE:  You are speaking today at the private ceremony at the U.S. naval  academy.  Your tribute, first of all, how are you doing, and secondly, what  are you going to say?  </p><p> GRAHAM:  Well, I'm doing OK.  These things help.  Thank you to everybody  who has called and asked me how I'm doing.  Cindy and everyone else around  the family has helped me, as much I helped them, probably more so.  </p><p> I'm going to say that nobody loved a soldier more than John McCain, that I  bear witness to his commitment to have their back, travel where they go,  never let them be forgotten.  The public may be tired of this war called  the war on terrorism, but John McCain never was.  And he had their back and  he gave them what they need to win a fight we can't afford to lose.  And he  was willing to lose a political race, but not a war.  So, I'm going to talk  about all my travels with the troops and how much they love John McCain.  </p><p> WALLACE:  I have to ask you about the passionate, heartfelt but sometimes  angry tribute by Meghan McCain who took some pretty clear shots at  President Trump.  Here's a clip.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MEGHAN MCCAIN, DAUGHTER OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN:  We gather here to mourn  the passing of American greatness.  The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from  men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the  opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and  privilege while he suffered and served.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Was that appropriate?  Was it fair?  </p><p> GRAHAM:  If you say something bad about Meghan's father, you will know it,  she didn't like it.  So, it's OK, she is grieving.  </p><p> All I can say is there's a lesson to be learned this week about John  McCain.  Number one, Americans appreciate military service.  If we've  learned nothing this week you know the fact that John served our country in  extraordinary circumstances.  It was appreciated by everybody.  </p><p> What else do we know?  If you work hard and do your homework and know what  you're talking about, people will listen to you.  That if you pick big  causes bigger than yourself, you'll be remembered.  </p><p> He tried to drain the swamp before it was cool, that you can fight hard and  still be respected.  If you forgive, people appreciate it, and if you admit  to mistakes, you look good as a stronger man.  That's the formula, John  McCain.  This was a civics lesson for anybody who wanted to listen.  Why do  remember this man, because of the way he conducted his public life.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Do you think there's a lesson there for President Trump?  </p><p> GRAHAM:  There's a lesson here for everybody, including President Trump.   Everybody makes mistakes.  Those who admit it are seen by the public as  bigger, not smaller.  Know what you're talking about, fight hard, forgive,  and have passion, strength and kindness are not mutually exclusive.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let's turn to your day job and this week, you're going to be  spending a lot of time as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and  confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh -- </p><p> GRAHAM:  Yes.</p><p> WALLACE:  -- to be confirmed to the Supreme Court.  </p><p> First of all, does he have the votes to win confirmation of the court?  </p><p> GRAHAM:  If he does well at the hearing he will get, my belief is 55 or  higher.  If he does well enough, I'm sure he will do well.  </p><p> WALLACE:  When you say 55, you've got to have 51 Republicans, with the  appointment of McCain's replacement.  So, you are saying as many as four  Democrats?  </p><p> GRAHAM:  Well, that's 55.  Last time I checked --  </p><p> WALLACE:  So, that's what you think.</p><p> GRAHAM:  Yes.  I'm not good at math, but yes, I think there are a handful  of Democrats will vote for Judge Kavanaugh if he does well and maybe even  more.  A lot of people should vote for Judge Kavanaugh.  If you are looking  to a Republican president to pick a qualified conservative, he would be on  the top of anyone's list including not just Donald Trump.  </p><p> He's the one person I think every Republican president would see is the  most qualified of their generation.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Democrats say that the confirmation should be delayed until we  know whether or not there's going to be either a criminal prosecution of  President Trump or impeachment proceedings against President Trump.  </p><p> Here is Senator Dick Durbin, who was going to be on the program next.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  We should be  withholding this decision on the Supreme Court nominee until the air is  cleared and we know exactly where we stand when it comes to this president  and (INAUDIBLE) </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Given that his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, says that candidate  Trump in 2016 directed him to commit a crime, does the senator have a  point?  </p><p> GRAHAM:  Well, it wasn't the point he had when Clinton was under  investigation, we approved Justice Breyer.  So, my Democratic friends did  not have this view when Clinton was president.  </p><p> WALLACE:  We should point, I'm going to bring it up with Senator Durbin.   1994, Clinton is under investigation by the independent counsel in  Whitewater and he was nominated.  </p><p> GRAHAM:  I think --  </p><p> WALLACE:  Stephen Breyer was confirmed to the court.  </p><p> GRAHAM:  Senator Grassley has been very fair.  More documents than the  person ever nominated to the Supreme Court.  We're going to have a hearing  and there's no drama in this hearing.  The only drama is those running for  president, how will they handle this hearing on the Democratic side?  You  know, we're going to get this good man confirmed.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let me ask you, though, about this question of criminal  liability.  I want to look at some Kavanaugh's statements on that issue.   Let's put them up.  In 1999, Kavanaugh said the Nixon ruling, that  President Nixon had to turn over all of the White House Watergate tapes may  have been, quote, wrongly decided.  In 2009, Kavanaugh wrote: criminal  investigations take the president's focus away from his or her  responsibilities to the people.  </p><p> Is there a legitimate concern that Justice Kavanaugh, if you were faced  with a case on the Supreme Court, would side with the president against  either Congress or the court?  </p><p> GRAHAM:  Well, what I think you'll find is somebody that has had 308  decisions.  So, you can get a pretty good idea of what he thinks based on  his time on the court of appeals but the bottom line here is that most  people are unsure as to whether or not a president can be indicted, a  sitting president.  </p><p> Impeachment is a process to remove a president, their criminal liability  aspects are very much in debate.  I think he's going to be mainstream in  his thinking.  He's going to look at both sides of the issue and decide  appropriately.  </p><p> WALLACE:  One issue that pro-choice senators of both sides have pressed  Kavanaugh on in their meetings with him on Capitol Hill is abortion.  And  Kavanaugh reportedly told them that Roe v. Wade is, quote, \"settled law\".   Is that a firm commitment in your regard, in your view, to not overturn  Roe?  And if it is a firm commitment, how can you as a pro-life senator  support him?  </p><p> GRAHAM:  I wouldn't vote for anybody that says that every decision the  Supreme Court cannot be revisited.  They revisit through a process.   There's a process of overturning long precedent.  There's a four-part test  you have to apply.  </p><p> From my point of view, what he will do is when that case comes, if it ever  does, you just don't wake up one day and say, hey, I'd like to overturn Roe  v. Wade.  If there's a conflict that makes it to the Supreme Court, he will  apply the test of precedent to that decision, Roe v. Wade, and every other  precedent.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But to make it clear, you're saying you don't view his statement,  for instance, to Senator Collins, a pro-choice Republican, that it settled  law means that therefore it can't be re-examined and conceivably overturn?  </p><p> GRAHAM:  He would be disqualified, in my opinion, if you would not listen  to both sides of the story and decide accordingly.  This idea that Roe v.  Wade is going to be challenged at state level, there are all kinds of laws  out there.  Some may work their way up to Supreme Court.  He will give  great deference I'm sure to Roe v. Wade.  But it can be overturned like  every other decision but that will be up to the facts on the record.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Senator Graham, thank you, thanks for your time on on the tough  weekend.  Our deepest sympathies in a loss of a dear friend, sir.</p><p> GRAHAM:  Thank you.  Thank you so much.</p><p> Joining me now from Illinois, another member of the committee that will be  questioning Judge Kavanaugh, Dick Durbin, the Senate's number two Democrat.  </p><p> Senator, Democrats have tried a variety of efforts to upend and derail the  confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh.  I want to put some of them up.  </p><p> The argument that there is a midterm election.  The argument that President  Trump is under investigation.  If you want to see millions of pages of  documents from when he was staff secretary for President George W. Bush,  and the White House has no invoked executive privilege to withhold 100,000  pages from when he worked for the White House counsel.  </p><p> I think it's fair to say that none of that has worked and the question is,  why is it the Democrats have so far been unable to gain any traction  against Judge Kavanaugh, and in the public debate, you don't seem to have  laid a glove on him?</p><p> SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  Let me say at the  outset before we get into that and I will address it -- I joined with  Lindsey Graham, every word he said John McCain John McCain.  I respect John  McCain so much and yesterday was a great display of the respect so many  people across this country had for this great American.  I was lucky enough  to be with Lindsey and John involved in some very important negotiations  for more than a year on comprehensive immigration reform.  So I back up  every word.  </p><p> So let me start with Brett Kavanaugh in this way.  He is the most unpopular  Supreme Court nominee in the last 40 years.  How did he reach that point so  quickly?  Well, I think there were a number of reasons for it.  </p><p> You look at first and foremost is the fact that this president said I'm not  going to put a man on the Supreme Court unless he is going to overturn Roe  versus Wade and the Affordable Care Act.  The president is never at a loss  for words and he was very explicit in terms of what he wanted in a Supreme  Court nominee.  Those positions may be popular with his Republican base.   They're not popular with the American people.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Wait, wait -- </p><p> GRAHAM:  An issue that you have raised --  </p><p> WALLACE:  Wait.  I mean, he said he was going to appoint pro-life judges.   He never said that he asked him or on a litmus test about that.  And also,  I have to say, I'm a little surprised that you are saying he's the most  unpopular.  When did we nominate and confirm Supreme Court justices based  on public opinion polls?  </p><p> DURBIN:  Well, we shouldn't be.  But you started off with the premise  you've never laid a glove on him.  The fact of the matter is the American  people have gone through this nomination and come to the conclusion that  he's not the right person for the job.  </p><p> Let me go a little bit further here.  He comes before us at a time when  people are concerned about whether this president or any president is above  the law.  Think about his role, Kavanaugh's role, when it came to Judge Ken  Starr going after President Clinton.  He was the aggressive prosecutor in  that respect and a few years later after working in the Bush White House  said that completely reversed my position.  A president should not be  subject to the subject of prosecution while he's in office.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Can I -- can I let me just ask you about that because as Lindsey  Graham brought up, and I was going to ask you anyway, in 1994, Bill Clinton  was under investigation by an independent counsel on Whitewater and he  nominated and the Senate confirmed Stephen Breyer and that was also in a  midterm election year.  That relate directly contradicts two of the  arguments that you're making against Kavanaugh.  </p><p> DURBIN:  Let me just say that I was not a member of the Senate when Justice  Breyer came before that body, but it will tell you at the time the  investigation was underway, there was no suspicion at that moment that  Clinton was going to brush it aside and say, you have no authority to even  question me.  It went forward.  He was subpoenaed, he was deposed, he was  tried in the House -- and I should say indicted under the impeachment  clause and tried in the Senate.  I was at the Senate at the time.</p><p> And now, we have a different situation completely.  There is a serious  question as to whether this president, given the opportunity, will end the  Mueller investigation, something which most Republicans and the  overwhelming majority of Americans say would be a serious mistake and we  ask, of course, Judge Kavanaugh, what do you think, and he says it's hands  off when it comes to a president during his term in office.  </p><p> I think that's a mistake and it's one of the major reasons people had  misgivings about his nomination.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Let's look at some specific issues.  As I pointed out, Kavanaugh  has told some pro-choice senators that he views Roe as settled law, he was  asked about Obamacare, there's a Texas case that would try to take it all  down because of the fact that the individual mandate has been repealed.  He  said that he was very skeptical of that.  </p><p> Obviously, these aren't confirmed commitments.  You wouldn't expect that  from any judge.  </p><p> Isn't it the real problem that this is a conservative judge, Donald Trump  went to the country and promised to nominate conservative judges,  originalists who would -- who would interpret the Constitution as written,  it hasn't healed well within the mainstream, yes conservative, but within  the judicial mainstream?  </p><p> DURBIN:  Well, you overlook one of the most important elements of his  nomination, and that is the fact that there has been more concealment of  documents concerning his public service and his position on issues than  ever in the history of the United States.  </p><p> WALLACE:  He's given you half a million documents, sir.</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> DURBIN:  Let me just make my point here, Chris.  The assertion of executive  privilege by the White House to take 100,000 documents and say the American  people will not get a chance to see them as they reflect on Kavanaugh's  background is the first time in history.  This denial of access to  documents violates a role that we thought was a tradition of the Senate  under Senator Sessions and Senator Leahy, time and again when it came to  Obama nominees.  </p><p> They are suppressing these documents.  If we are lucky we will see 6  percent, 6 percent, of all of the documents that have been produced -- that  could be produced to reflect on Kavanaugh's true position on issues.  He  saying and the White House saying the American people have no right to  know.  </p><p> So, if he so proud of his conservative credentials show us the record,  stand before us, trust the American people and they will trust you.  I  would say that to Judge Kavanaugh.  </p><p> WALLACE:  I -- and you will have the opportunity to do that starting on  Tuesday.  Let me just say as a point of saying goodbye, they have turned  over half a million documents and the issue, part of it is about 3 million  documents when he was staff secretary and every document that went to the  president went to his desk.  </p><p> But, Senator Durbin, thank you.  Thanks for joining us.  We look forward to  your questioning of Judge Kavanaugh starting this week.  </p><p> DURBIN:  Thanks, Chris.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Always good to talk with you, sir.  </p><p> Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what to expect from  this week's showdown between the president's Supreme Court pick and Senate  Democrats.  </p><p> Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about how Judge Kavanaugh's  confirmation would change the Supreme Court?  Just go to Facebook or  Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We need to elect senators  who will vote for judges to follow our laws and our Constitution as  written.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST:  President Trump on the campaign trail this  week making the case for his choice of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme  Court and it's time now for our Sunday group.  </p><p> Former press secretary for Vice President Pence, Marc Lotter, Charles Lane  of \"The Washington Post\", former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards,  and \"Washington Post\" columnist and former White House speechwriter Marc  Thiessen.  </p><p> Chuck, when Justice Kennedy, the swing vote on the court, stepped down and  there was talk about replacing him, we heard all this talk about a fierce  battle for the future of the court and I want to ask you the same question  that I asked Senator Durbin, why hasn't it happen?  The Democrats don't  seem to have gained much traction against Brett Kavanaugh so far.  </p><p> CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST:  I think there's a lot of reasons,  starting with the fact that it's just possible Republicans care a little  bit more about this than actually Democrats do.  I did a little checking  and Democrats were a little bit less likely than Republicans to vote in  2016 based on the future of the Supreme Court.  So, there's a little bit of  a surprising passion gap there.  </p><p> Secondly, I think it's the very simple fact that this is about 51 votes and  the Republicans have 51 votes, and that means two things, one, Mitch  McConnell can control the pace of this thing, control the calendar and so  forth.  And secondly, it means the Democrats are just struggling to get  over that work and they are divided.  Not divided down the middle, but they  are divided between the main block of the party and several people who have  to run for reelection in red states.  </p><p> That's created a very difficult problem in messaging for them and so they  are left dealing not with the substance of the Kavanaugh thing but  procedural issues like document disclosure, arcane matters, very important  but very arcane about executive privilege and the net effect is they have  yet to identify some hot button things that can get the public excited  against Judge Kavanaugh.  </p><p> WALLACE:  We ask you for questions for the panel and we got this on Twitter  from Waris Waldo, which after I read it several times realize some persons  interpretation of where is Waldo.  </p><p> When did adhering to the United States Constitution became radical and  threatening?</p><p> Marc Lotter, how do you answer that?  </p><p> MARC LOTTER, FORMER PENCE PRESS SECRETARY:  Well, I think that's the basis  of this argument.  And we have -- and Judge Kavanaugh and in Justice  Gorsuch -- we have someone who adheres to the Constitution and many on the  liberal side prefer to appoint justices who interpret the law to mean  things other than what it says.  That's the heart of the argument.  </p><p> WALLACE:  I want to turn to the nation's farewell to John McCain which has  been the big story this week and his daughter Meghan's tribute to him at  the National Cathedral yesterday, which still has a lot of people talking.   Here's part of that.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MEGHAN MCCAIN, DAUGHTER OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN:  The America of John McCain  has no need to be made great again because America was always great.  </p><p> (APPLAUSE) </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE:  Marc Thiessen, it's her dad.</p><p> MARC THIESSEN, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE SPEECHWRITER:  Yes.</p><p> WALLACE:  She obviously feels passionately about the fact that she thinks  that President Trump didn't treat her dad well and he didn't, what did you  think of her remarks?  </p><p> THIESSEN:  Well, first of all, just watching her this week has been  heartbreaking because her grief has been palpable and so was her anger  palpable yesterday and with good reason because Donald Trump treated her  father disgracefully.  </p><p> If you want to put this in perspective, there have been 1,974 United States  senators since the founding of the republic.  John McCain is only the sixth  senator to lie in state who wasn't either a vice president or president.   So, this is a tremendous testament and there are only 31 people in American  history who had laid in state.  </p><p> This may very well be the first time that the sitting president of the  United States has not participated in honoring that person, and that as a  result of his disgraceful behavior towards him.  He was even criticizing  John McCain by name a few weeks ago on the campaign trail to suggest that  he wasn't a war hero and never apologized for that.  </p><p> This is one of the reasons, Chris, why I think Donald Trump, despite a  booming economy, his disapproval has reached now 60 percent in the country.   It's not because people don't like his policies, because his policies are  obviously improving the lives of people, the economy is booming and on  employment is low.  But his inability to be presidential and to rise to the  occasion at a moment like this, put aside his petty grievances against John  McCain, I think that's one of the reasons why his popularity doesn't match  his success as president.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Congresswoman Edwards, I promise I'm going to bring one but Marc  Lotter is out someone often defends this president.  Your reaction?  </p><p> LOTTER:  Well, I think it takes two to tango.  And I think John McCain and  Senator McCain has made a very good career out of attacking presidents when  he disagreed on both sides of the aisle.  </p><p> WALLACE:  But in fairness, he somehow had a good enough relationship with  George W. Bush and Barack Obama that they spoke at his funeral.  </p><p> LOTTER:  And he did.  This is one that continued on this week.  And I think  once we get past this, we will remember John McCain for all of his great  service.  The president is going to continue to go on and is going to do  many things that John McCain supported like supporting our troops,  investing in our military and we'll let their -- we'll let their  disagreement I guess go on in history.  </p><p> WALLACE:  Congresswoman Edwards, your reaction to Meghan McCain's remarks  and when you take in addition, because it wasn't just McCain, it was Joe  Biden and it was Barack Obama, and it was George W. Bush, the last  Republican president before Trump.  Was this week a rebuke of President  Trump?  </p><p> DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (D-MD):  Well, I think that Meghan  McCain's remarks and all of the remarks of the various speakers were John  McCain speaking.  His hand was clearly evident in those remarks and  particularly Meghan's remarks and I think that there were spot on for where  we are in this nation.  </p><p> You know, I come from a military family too and I think for the president  of the United States not to have honored and recognized Senator McCain's  service, irrespective of policy disagreement I think was disgraceful and I  think the nation stood up and said that it was disgraceful too.  And that  all of those speakers indicated that what was valued and Senator McCain in  addition to his service in his honor was his commitment to this country and  that we had a president of the United States who seemed incapable of even  acknowledging that.  </p><p> WALLACE:  All right.  We're going to leave it on that note.  Panel, we will  take a break here.  We'll see you a little later.  </p><p> Up next, President Trump threatens to cut Canada out of a new NAFTA deal  and forge ahead just with Mexico.  What would that mean for workers in the  economy?  </p><p> On this Labor Day weekend, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka joins us next.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE: Coming up, President Trump looks to replace NAFTA as he works on a  new trade deal with Mexico and Canada. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And we're going to call it  the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement. And we'll get rid of the name  NAFTA. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: We'll talk with the head of the largest group of unions in the  country, Richard Trumka, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE: Negotiations to hammer out a deal to reshape NAFTA, the three  nation trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, will continue  this weeks after talks between the White House and Canada stalled amid some  bitterness. </p><p> Joining us now to discuss the potential fallout for American workers is the  president of the AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka. </p><p> Mr. Trumka, President Trump has negotiated a new NAFTA deal with Mexico,  but talks with Canada stalled after some off the record comments that he  made were published that he acknowledged that he won't make any concessions  to Canada. And here's what he said about that afterwards. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Here's the good news, at  least Canada knows where I stand, because we can't have these countries  taking advantage of the United States anymore. It's very simple. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: Question, can you support a deal that leads Canada out of a new  NAFTA and will Congress pass it? </p><p> RICHARD TRUMKA, AFL-CIO PRESIDENT: Well, Chris, before I get to that, just  let me say, on behalf of the hardworking men and women of this country who  wake our country up every day, make her run all day and put it to bed at  night, let me wish you a happy Labor Day and all your listeners a happy  Labor Day. </p><p> Look, our economies are integrated, the three countries in North America,  the economy is pretty emigrated. And it's pretty hard to see how that would  work without having Canada in the deal. You said that the Mexican deal is  close, but there's still a lot of work to be left -- to be done, even on  the Mexican deal, Chris, because the language isn't drafted. We haven't  seen whole chapters of the thing. We're anxious to move forward with it and  anxious to have all three countries involved, because NAFTA has had a  devastating effect on the working people of this country for the last 25  years. So we've been aggressively pursuing an agreement that works for the  workers in all three countries and I can say we're not done yet. </p><p> WALLACE: OK, but let's talk about the parts of the deal we do know about  that the Trump administration has negotiated with Mexico that it seems to  me would be pretty good for workers. Let's put them up on the screen. </p><p> Seventy-five percent of a car's value would have to be manufactured in  North America. That's up from 62.5 percent. Forty to forty-five percent of  the car must be made by workers in whatever country earning at least $16 an  hour. </p><p> Do you support both of those provisions and, frankly, do you think that  Mexico would live up to them? For instance, the salary for car workers,  because in Mexico right now the salary for a car worker on average is $3 an  hour. Do you think they actually are going to boost that to $16 an hour? </p><p> TRUMKA: Well, first of all, those provisions can be very, very good. And  you said that the current provision is really 62.5. In actuality, Chris,  it's only in the 40s because they -- they do a little cheating saying if  you put in 62 percent and China puts in 38 percent, it counts as 100  percent. So it's really lower and the change is really more -- more  effective. We haven't seen the details of it yet.</p><p> But you hit the nail right on the head. It doesn't matter what's in that  agreement. If we can't monitor it and effect it -- and enforce it  effectively, then the agreement will fail for workers and it will fail for  the country. So what we're pushing right now, and we're working with  Ambassador Lighthizer is, is a way to let us effectively monitor what's  going on the ground and then enforce the agreement regardless of who's in  the White House, because we've been told for over 25 years, trust us, this  agreement will be good for workers. What we need is an agreement that we  can enforce no matter who's in the White House. </p><p> WALLACE: Let me --</p><p> TRUMKA: That's what we're looking for. </p><p> WALLACE: Let me step back for a minute and go broader view. </p><p> How does big labor feel about President Trump at this point? I mean the  fact is growth is up. Unemployment is down. He's using tariffs to try to  break down trade barriers that I know that you hate. So, I mean, what mark  do you give Donald Trump on this Labor Day weekend?</p><p> TRUMKA: Well, when he was elected, I said I would call balls and strikes.  When he did something that was good for workers, we'd support him. When he  did something that was bad for workers, we would oppose him. </p><p> Unfortunately, to date, the things that he's done to hurt workers outpace  what he's done to help workers. He hasn't come up with an infrastructure  program that could put a lot of us back to work. He overturned a regulation  that would actually denied over 5 million people overtime that they would  have had. He overturned some health and safety regulations that will hurt  us on the job. Enforcement of OSHA and MSHA isn't what it should be. </p><p> So we keep trying to find areas where we can work with him. And where we  can, we do. </p><p> WALLACE: Well, but let me ask you -- Mr. Trumka, let me ask you, I mean,  3.9 percent unemployment. 3.5 million jobs created, 4 percent -- 4.2  percent GDP in the last quarter. I mean don't you give him something for  that? </p><p> TRUMKA: No, those are good, but wages have been down since the first of the  year. Gas prices have been up since the first of the year. So, overall,  workers aren't doing as well. He passed the tax bill that encourages  companies to outsource. We can't agree to support something like that. He's  -- every place we can, Chris, we do. But, unfortunately, right now, the  scale is weighted against him because he's done more to hurt workers than  to help workers. </p><p> WALLACE: So you have launched a new big political campaign for the  midterms. You have an ad out on the web right now. Is it your hope that  Democrats would take back control of the House and Senate and block the  Trump agenda, even those parts that have been good for workers, like  creating 3.5 million new jobs? </p><p> TRUMKA: It's not about Democrats or Republicans. It's about electing people  who will support working people in this country. That's what we're looking  to do. </p><p> We started a couple of months ago, going door-to-door, member to member  with our members saying, what issues are important to you? We put those  together. We're going to put them in front of candidates. Those candidates  that support the issues that our members say they want, need and should  have are the candidates that we'll support. </p><p> It probably will be Democrats because, unfortunately, Democrats support  working people more than Republicans have. We'd like to change that. But  the reality is, Democrats support working people more than Republicans,  although we go candidate by candidate and we support those Republicans that  support working people. </p><p> WALLACE: Finally, this week I looked at the presidential exit polls from  2016. Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump in union households by just nine  points, 51 percent to 42, which interestingly enough is the smallest  Democratic advantage since Reagan ran against Mondale in 1984. Question,  don't a lot of your members, union members, don't they support Donald  Trump? </p><p> TRUMKA: Well, actually, three percentage points more of our members voted  for Donald Trump than they did for Mitt Romney. Unfortunately, 10 percent  of our members -- 10 percent fewer of our members voted for Hillary  Clinton. They didn't believe her on trade. They didn't believe her on a  couple of other issues. </p><p> But you talked about households. Union members themselves are a much higher  percentage in there. Again, we give them all the facts and I believe in my  membership, the rank and file, that when they get the facts, they make the  right decision every time. We're giving them the facts on this president  and anybody who's running against him and they will ultimately decide which  one of those candidates that they want to support. </p><p> WALLACE: Mr. Trumka, thank you. Thanks for sharing part of this Labor Day  holiday weekend with us. We'll stay on top of all this, sir. </p><p> TRUMKA: Chris, thanks for having me on. And, again, happy Labor Day. </p><p> WALLACE: When we come back, the Trump administration opens the door to  regulating Google. Our Sunday panel returns to discuss the battle with big  tech. That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think Canada very much  wants to make the deal and I think it's going to be obviously very good for  Canada if they do and I think it's probably not going to be good at all if  they don't. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: President Trump playing hardball with Canada as he tries to  rewrite the quarter century old North American Free Trade Agreement, or  NAFTA. </p><p> And we're back now with the panel.</p><p> Well, Congresswoman Edwards, there was a lot of howling, I think it's fair  to say, from Democrats when President Trump said that he was going to  revamp NAFTA. But aren't there, and it talked about it with Mr. Trumka,  aren't there a number of provisions in this agreement with Mexico at least  that are good for American workers? </p><p> DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (D-MD): Well, I think there are  also a lot of Democrats who very much wanted to see a North American Free  Trade Agreement that really invests in workers, that makes sure that we  have protections across both borders. And I think you heard that from what  Mr. Trumka was saying. And I -- you know, I think it --</p><p> WALLACE: But raising -- but raising the wage to $16 an hour? </p><p> EDWARDS: Raising the wages. Exactly.</p><p> WALLACE: Raising the amount that has to be content from North America? </p><p> EDWARDS: Right. And all -- those are -- those are actually things that many  of us is Democrats have been calling for, for a long time because, you  know, we can have free trade, but if it's not fair on both sides of the  border, it really doesn't work. It doesn't keep workers here working and it  doesn't make sure that workers in Mexico are being paid what they need. And  I don't think you can have a North American Free Trade Agreement without  having the other part of North America, which is Canada, in the deal too. </p><p> WALLACE: Let me pick up on that with you, Marc Lotter, because talks with  Canada stalled on Friday over it seems to issues, one is continued dairy  protections inside Canada and, secondly, the publishing of off the record  comments by President Trump where he basically said, I'm not going to offer  any concessions at all to Canada. Does this deal go through? And -- and I'm  primarily, I guess, I'm talking about Congress, does this deal go through  without Canada onboard? </p><p> MARC LOTTER, FORMER PENCE PRESS SECRETARY: I think it makes it much easier  if Canada is on board to get it through Congress. But this is -- this is  very tough negotiating with the president and the prime minister and the  Canadian officials. The president is very clear, he wants to get this done.  He wants Canada to be involved. And it's going to be a question now of, can  they make enough concessions to make it fair on both sides? I think they  will. </p><p> WALLACE: Let's turn to another big story this week and that is President  Trump complaining that Google's search engine, when you put in \"President  Trump news,\" it has been calibrated to drown out conservative voices. The  president and his team this week complained about that and even talked  about regulating Google. </p><p> Here's the president. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've made it clear that we,  as a country, cannot tolerate political censorship, blacklisting and rigged  search results. </p><p> We're not going to let them control what we can and cannot see, read, and  learn from. We can't do that. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> WALLACE: Chuck, first of all, from the best of your knowledge, is there  political bias in the Google search? I mean is it calibrated to drown out  conservative voices and to push liberal points of view? And, secondly, what  do you make of the threat by the president that the government might get  involved in regulating Google? </p><p> CHARLES LANE, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Well, the best of my knowledge about  Google's algorithms is not very good. </p><p> WALLACE: Well, that's why I asked you. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p> LANE: But I -- I would be very surprised if somebody at Google said, let's  set up the algorithm to drown out Donald Trump in any specific sense like  that. I think these searches work in an incredibly complex ways that for  some unconscious or otherwise neutral reason may be turning up what  President Trump claims they're turning up. But, of course, it's just his  claim. </p><p> But there's a bigger context for this, which is, a lot of stuff going on at  Google, like a few months back an employee circulating a memo internally  claiming that the company isolates conservatives internally, then he winds  up on the outs. There's a movement within Google to decouple Google, so to  speak, from defense contracting and so forth. And I think the president's  pushing back against those things and he's more generally trying to turn  Google into just another part of this big, fake news media that has been  his big foil all through his political career. </p><p> You know, there's a lot of suspicion, both on the left and the right, in  sort of populist America about these giant technology companies. And I  think in that sense, he's just trying to turn them into another one of his  scapegoats to show like everything is stacked against us, even the search  engine. </p><p> WALLACE: Marc, your thoughts about whether the government should be  regulating a company like Google? Are their First Amendment issues there?  And if they were (ph) going to regulate Google in terms of its search  engine, they can do a number of things just to make life difficult for  Google. </p><p> MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No doubt. And I -- look, I think the - - the fact that there -- there is conservative bias in social media. It's  not just Google. It's FaceBook. It's Twitter. There's been a lot of  accusations. They probably -- the only place where there's more anti- conservative bias than the legacy media is Silicon Valley. So, you know,  and the fact is, a lot of people getting their news from Silicon Valley in  a ways that they weren't a few years ago. But -- and so Trump is raising a  valid point. </p><p> Where he loses me is when he says that he wants the government to start  regulating it, because I -- the only institution I trust less than Google  to regulate my -- my search is the federal government. So I think what we  need is for people to be more proactive in terms of where they get their  news and how they -- they consume their news. </p><p> One of the -- the -- the avenue of social media has given conservatives an  incredible voice that they didn't have before because they didn't have to  go through \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times.\" So they have a  voice that they never had before. But we're also in these ideological silos  were conservatives only read conservative news sources. Liberals only read  -- Washington (ph) read liberal news sources. And I think we all need to do  a better job of policing ourselves and getting out of our silos and  listening to the other side because that's how we get over the division in  the country.</p><p> WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, I want to pick up on the last point that  Chuck made, and that is, isn't there a legitimate concern -- and on this  populist issue about companies, whether it's Google or FaceBook or Twitter  or Amazon, these huge companies that have so much power and so much money  and so much influence? </p><p> EDWARDS: Well, I mean, but the concern, I think, is really misplaced  because if you look at these entities, every time there, you know, is this  sort of massive growth in this industry, something else starts up that  becomes the next new thing. And we remember when Twitter was the next new  thing and Instagram the next new thing. And so I think that the dynamism  that's in the industry allows that to, you know, to create an environment  where, you know, you can have a lot of different kinds of voices in there.  And I think if anything is getting in the way of it in terms of the  government, I think it's saying, you know, this -- these decisions around  net neutrality because then that makes it even more difficult for  conservative or even, you know, far left views to get into the mainstream  if you're put on this secondary highway. </p><p> So -- but the idea that the government should have the -- the -- the  ability to figure out what the search engine is, I don't think so. I mean  most of the people I know in Congress can't even operate their Twitter  handle. </p><p> WALLACE: I am remaining silent in this conversation. I'm -- I'm a luddite,  which go to Google and look up what it means. </p><p> Thank you panel. See you next Sunday. </p><p> Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week,\" Dolly Parton on why kids around  the world call her \"the book lady.\"</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> WALLACE: Most of us know her as a legendary singer and songwriter, but as  we told you back in March, for millions of kids, she's the one who help  them start reading early. </p><p> Here is our \"Power Player of the Week.\" </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DOLLY PARTON, FOUNDER, IMAGINATION LIBRARY: I just always thought there was  magic in books because it takes you to other places. Anywhere you want to  go, you can find it in a book. </p><p> It says Dolly Parton, that's my name. </p><p> WALLACE (voice over): The Library of Congress is not the first place you'd  expect to see Dolly Parton, but there she was celebrating her love of  books. </p><p> PARTON (singing): In my Tennessee mountain home --</p><p> WALLACE: It's a story that begins back when she was growing up, one of 12  children, in the Smoky Mountains of east Tennessee, the daughter of Robert  Lee Parton. </p><p> PARTON: Daddy never had a chance to go to school. And daddy couldn't read  nor write, but he was really a smart person enough and wondered what all he  might have done had he had an education. </p><p> WALLACE: Fast-forward to 1995, when the country music star decided to start  the Imagination Library, to give free books to children in her hometown. </p><p> Over the years, the program has spread across the country and overseas. A  book every month to kids who sign up from birth until they turn five and go  to kindergarten. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to a child to get their own book  mailed to them in their own name? </p><p> PARTON: It makes them feel important. It makes them feel special. So, of  course, it makes them want to do what the book is all about, learn to read  it. </p><p> WALLACE (voice over): Local communities pay for the books, but Dolly's  group pays for sending out more than a million a month, which she helps  cover through her companies and concerts and even a children's album. </p><p> PARTON (singing): I am a rainbow.</p><p> PARTON: Oh, millions of dollars, I'm sure. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): And it's that important to you? </p><p> PARTON: Oh, it's very important, because it's my charity. Although there  are many things that I do, this is the one that's nearest and dearest to my  heart. </p><p> WALLACE (voice over): Dolly has been performing for more than 60 years.  She's won eight Grammy's and is in the Country Music Hall of Fame. But she  shows no sign at all of slowing down. </p><p> PARTON: My music is everything to me. It's my gift. It's my joy. It's my  job. And it's just something that I love to do. And I never think about  that I should quit it. </p><p> WALLACE: Which brings us back to the Imagination Library. </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): Though I understand that you have gotten a nickname  from this program. </p><p> PARTON: I'm the book lady. Who knew?</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are so honored that the hundred millionth book -- </p><p> WALLACE (voice over): So there was Dolly with the librarian of Congress  donating the 100 millionth book, unveiling a copy of her own \"Coat of Many  Colors,\" based on the coat her mother made for her out of scraps of cloth. </p><p> PARTON: Maybe we'll be back for our billionth book one of these days. </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All right.</p><p> PARTON: Wouldn't that be nice! </p><p> WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to you, Library of Congress? </p><p> PARTON: I know. Here I am. A little old country girl from the Smoky  Mountains of east Tennessee. Now one of my little books about my mom and a  story about my dad is going to be here forever in the Library of Congress. </p><p> WALLACE (voice over): Dolly even gave us a little concert about the coat  and her family and what led her to share her dream with so many children. </p><p> PARTON (singing): In my coat of many colors that my mama made for me, made  only from rags but I wore it so proudly. And although we had no money, I  was rich as I could be, in my coat of many colors mama made for me, because  she made it just for me. </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> WALLACE: Dolly's Imagination Library now teams up with the Library of  Congress for a special story time for kids, the last Friday of each month  streaming online. </p><p> And speaking of kids, I want to introduce you to a special one. Jack Henry  Wallace, who was born on Friday, 8 pounds 6 ounces. Jack will make his  television debut in December as part of our annual Christmas greeting from  now the six Wallace grandkids. Jack, his mom and dad, and, yes, his proud  grandpa are all doing well. </p><p> And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next FOX NEWS  SUNDAY.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Kavanaugh faces days of tough  questioning from a Senate Judiciary Committee.  In a moment, we'll speak  with two leading members of that panel.  </p><p>But first, the nations long goodbye to Senator John McCain.  McCain will be  laid to rest today in a private ceremony at the U.S. Naval Academy in  Annapolis, which meant so much to him.  </p><p>FOX News correspondent Peter Doocy reports on a very public farewell  yesterday in Washington.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Lawmakers, loved ones and diplomats  gathered Saturday for a final goodbye to Senator John McCain.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The world will be lonelier without John McCain.  </p><p>DOOCY:  One of McCain's best friends, former Senator Joe Lieberman, told  mourners about the time McCain asked him to join the GOP ticket even though  he was a registered Democrat.  </p><p>JOHN LIEBERMAN, MCCAIN'S BEST FRIEND:  John's response was direct and  really ennobling.  That's the point, Joe, he said with a certain  impatience.  You are a Democrat, I'm a Republican.  We could give our  country the bipartisan leadership it needs for a change.  </p><p>DOOCY:  McCain's former political rivals spoke on his behalf too.  </p><p>BUSH:  In recent years, we sometimes talk about that intense period like  football players remembering a big game.  In the process, rivalry melted  away.  </p><p>OBAMA:  So much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can  seem small and mean and petty.  John called on us to be bigger than that.  </p><p>DOOCY:  McCain's daughter Meghan broke from her tear-filled tribute to more  sharply criticize the current president who wasn't invited.  </p><p>MEGHAN MCCAIN, DAUGHTER OF SEN. MCCAIN:  America has no need to be made  great again because America was always great.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE:  And joining me now here in Washington, John McCain's good friend,  Senator Lindsey Graham.  </p><p>Welcome again to \"FOX News Sunday.\" </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  Thank you for  having me.  </p><p>WALLACE:  You are speaking today at the private ceremony at the U.S. naval  academy.  Your tribute, first of all, how are you doing, and secondly, what  are you going to say?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Well, I'm doing OK.  These things help.  Thank you to everybody  who has called and asked me how I'm doing.  Cindy and everyone else around  the family has helped me, as much I helped them, probably more so.  </p><p>I'm going to say that nobody loved a soldier more than John McCain, that I  bear witness to his commitment to have their back, travel where they go,  never let them be forgotten.  The public may be tired of this war called  the war on terrorism, but John McCain never was.  And he had their back and  he gave them what they need to win a fight we can't afford to lose.  And he  was willing to lose a political race, but not a war.  So, I'm going to talk  about all my travels with the troops and how much they love John McCain.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I have to ask you about the passionate, heartfelt but sometimes  angry tribute by Meghan McCain who took some pretty clear shots at  President Trump.  Here's a clip.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEGHAN MCCAIN, DAUGHTER OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN:  We gather here to mourn  the passing of American greatness.  The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from  men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the  opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and  privilege while he suffered and served.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Was that appropriate?  Was it fair?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  If you say something bad about Meghan's father, you will know it,  she didn't like it.  So, it's OK, she is grieving.  </p><p>All I can say is there's a lesson to be learned this week about John  McCain.  Number one, Americans appreciate military service.  If we've  learned nothing this week you know the fact that John served our country in  extraordinary circumstances.  It was appreciated by everybody.  </p><p>What else do we know?  If you work hard and do your homework and know what  you're talking about, people will listen to you.  That if you pick big  causes bigger than yourself, you'll be remembered.  </p><p>He tried to drain the swamp before it was cool, that you can fight hard and  still be respected.  If you forgive, people appreciate it, and if you admit  to mistakes, you look good as a stronger man.  That's the formula, John  McCain.  This was a civics lesson for anybody who wanted to listen.  Why do  remember this man, because of the way he conducted his public life.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Do you think there's a lesson there for President Trump?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  There's a lesson here for everybody, including President Trump.   Everybody makes mistakes.  Those who admit it are seen by the public as  bigger, not smaller.  Know what you're talking about, fight hard, forgive,  and have passion, strength and kindness are not mutually exclusive.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's turn to your day job and this week, you're going to be  spending a lot of time as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and  confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh -- </p><p>GRAHAM:  Yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- to be confirmed to the Supreme Court.  </p><p>First of all, does he have the votes to win confirmation of the court?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  If he does well at the hearing he will get, my belief is 55 or  higher.  If he does well enough, I'm sure he will do well.  </p><p>WALLACE:  When you say 55, you've got to have 51 Republicans, with the  appointment of McCain's replacement.  So, you are saying as many as four  Democrats?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Well, that's 55.  Last time I checked --  </p><p>WALLACE:  So, that's what you think.</p><p>GRAHAM:  Yes.  I'm not good at math, but yes, I think there are a handful  of Democrats will vote for Judge Kavanaugh if he does well and maybe even  more.  A lot of people should vote for Judge Kavanaugh.  If you are looking  to a Republican president to pick a qualified conservative, he would be on  the top of anyone's list including not just Donald Trump.  </p><p>He's the one person I think every Republican president would see is the  most qualified of their generation.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Democrats say that the confirmation should be delayed until we  know whether or not there's going to be either a criminal prosecution of  President Trump or impeachment proceedings against President Trump.  </p><p>Here is Senator Dick Durbin, who was going to be on the program next.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  We should be  withholding this decision on the Supreme Court nominee until the air is  cleared and we know exactly where we stand when it comes to this president  and (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Given that his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, says that candidate  Trump in 2016 directed him to commit a crime, does the senator have a  point?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Well, it wasn't the point he had when Clinton was under  investigation, we approved Justice Breyer.  So, my Democratic friends did  not have this view when Clinton was president.  </p><p>WALLACE:  We should point, I'm going to bring it up with Senator Durbin.   1994, Clinton is under investigation by the independent counsel in  Whitewater and he was nominated.  </p><p>GRAHAM:  I think --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Stephen Breyer was confirmed to the court.  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Senator Grassley has been very fair.  More documents than the  person ever nominated to the Supreme Court.  We're going to have a hearing  and there's no drama in this hearing.  The only drama is those running for  president, how will they handle this hearing on the Democratic side?  You  know, we're going to get this good man confirmed.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let me ask you, though, about this question of criminal  liability.  I want to look at some Kavanaugh's statements on that issue.   Let's put them up.  In 1999, Kavanaugh said the Nixon ruling, that  President Nixon had to turn over all of the White House Watergate tapes may  have been, quote, wrongly decided.  In 2009, Kavanaugh wrote: criminal  investigations take the president's focus away from his or her  responsibilities to the people.  </p><p>Is there a legitimate concern that Justice Kavanaugh, if you were faced  with a case on the Supreme Court, would side with the president against  either Congress or the court?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Well, what I think you'll find is somebody that has had 308  decisions.  So, you can get a pretty good idea of what he thinks based on  his time on the court of appeals but the bottom line here is that most  people are unsure as to whether or not a president can be indicted, a  sitting president.  </p><p>Impeachment is a process to remove a president, their criminal liability  aspects are very much in debate.  I think he's going to be mainstream in  his thinking.  He's going to look at both sides of the issue and decide  appropriately.  </p><p>WALLACE:  One issue that pro-choice senators of both sides have pressed  Kavanaugh on in their meetings with him on Capitol Hill is abortion.  And  Kavanaugh reportedly told them that Roe v. Wade is, quote, \"settled law\".   Is that a firm commitment in your regard, in your view, to not overturn  Roe?  And if it is a firm commitment, how can you as a pro-life senator  support him?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  I wouldn't vote for anybody that says that every decision the  Supreme Court cannot be revisited.  They revisit through a process.   There's a process of overturning long precedent.  There's a four-part test  you have to apply.  </p><p>From my point of view, what he will do is when that case comes, if it ever  does, you just don't wake up one day and say, hey, I'd like to overturn Roe  v. Wade.  If there's a conflict that makes it to the Supreme Court, he will  apply the test of precedent to that decision, Roe v. Wade, and every other  precedent.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But to make it clear, you're saying you don't view his statement,  for instance, to Senator Collins, a pro-choice Republican, that it settled  law means that therefore it can't be re-examined and conceivably overturn?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  He would be disqualified, in my opinion, if you would not listen  to both sides of the story and decide accordingly.  This idea that Roe v.  Wade is going to be challenged at state level, there are all kinds of laws  out there.  Some may work their way up to Supreme Court.  He will give  great deference I'm sure to Roe v. Wade.  But it can be overturned like  every other decision but that will be up to the facts on the record.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Senator Graham, thank you, thanks for your time on on the tough  weekend.  Our deepest sympathies in a loss of a dear friend, sir.</p><p>GRAHAM:  Thank you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Joining me now from Illinois, another member of the committee that will be  questioning Judge Kavanaugh, Dick Durbin, the Senate's number two Democrat.  </p><p>Senator, Democrats have tried a variety of efforts to upend and derail the  confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh.  I want to put some of them up.  </p><p>The argument that there is a midterm election.  The argument that President  Trump is under investigation.  If you want to see millions of pages of  documents from when he was staff secretary for President George W. Bush,  and the White House has no invoked executive privilege to withhold 100,000  pages from when he worked for the White House counsel.  </p><p>I think it's fair to say that none of that has worked and the question is,  why is it the Democrats have so far been unable to gain any traction  against Judge Kavanaugh, and in the public debate, you don't seem to have  laid a glove on him?</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  Let me say at the  outset before we get into that and I will address it -- I joined with  Lindsey Graham, every word he said John McCain John McCain.  I respect John  McCain so much and yesterday was a great display of the respect so many  people across this country had for this great American.  I was lucky enough  to be with Lindsey and John involved in some very important negotiations  for more than a year on comprehensive immigration reform.  So I back up  every word.  </p><p>So let me start with Brett Kavanaugh in this way.  He is the most unpopular  Supreme Court nominee in the last 40 years.  How did he reach that point so  quickly?  Well, I think there were a number of reasons for it.  </p><p>You look at first and foremost is the fact that this president said I'm not  going to put a man on the Supreme Court unless he is going to overturn Roe  versus Wade and the Affordable Care Act.  The president is never at a loss  for words and he was very explicit in terms of what he wanted in a Supreme  Court nominee.  Those positions may be popular with his Republican base.   They're not popular with the American people.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Wait, wait -- </p><p>GRAHAM:  An issue that you have raised --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Wait.  I mean, he said he was going to appoint pro-life judges.   He never said that he asked him or on a litmus test about that.  And also,  I have to say, I'm a little surprised that you are saying he's the most  unpopular.  When did we nominate and confirm Supreme Court justices based  on public opinion polls?  </p><p>DURBIN:  Well, we shouldn't be.  But you started off with the premise  you've never laid a glove on him.  The fact of the matter is the American  people have gone through this nomination and come to the conclusion that  he's not the right person for the job.  </p><p>Let me go a little bit further here.  He comes before us at a time when  people are concerned about whether this president or any president is above  the law.  Think about his role, Kavanaugh's role, when it came to Judge Ken  Starr going after President Clinton.  He was the aggressive prosecutor in  that respect and a few years later after working in the Bush White House  said that completely reversed my position.  A president should not be  subject to the subject of prosecution while he's in office.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Can I -- can I let me just ask you about that because as Lindsey  Graham brought up, and I was going to ask you anyway, in 1994, Bill Clinton  was under investigation by an independent counsel on Whitewater and he  nominated and the Senate confirmed Stephen Breyer and that was also in a  midterm election year.  That relate directly contradicts two of the  arguments that you're making against Kavanaugh.  </p><p>DURBIN:  Let me just say that I was not a member of the Senate when Justice  Breyer came before that body, but it will tell you at the time the  investigation was underway, there was no suspicion at that moment that  Clinton was going to brush it aside and say, you have no authority to even  question me.  It went forward.  He was subpoenaed, he was deposed, he was  tried in the House -- and I should say indicted under the impeachment  clause and tried in the Senate.  I was at the Senate at the time.</p><p>And now, we have a different situation completely.  There is a serious  question as to whether this president, given the opportunity, will end the  Mueller investigation, something which most Republicans and the  overwhelming majority of Americans say would be a serious mistake and we  ask, of course, Judge Kavanaugh, what do you think, and he says it's hands  off when it comes to a president during his term in office.  </p><p>I think that's a mistake and it's one of the major reasons people had  misgivings about his nomination.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's look at some specific issues.  As I pointed out, Kavanaugh  has told some pro-choice senators that he views Roe as settled law, he was  asked about Obamacare, there's a Texas case that would try to take it all  down because of the fact that the individual mandate has been repealed.  He  said that he was very skeptical of that.  </p><p>Obviously, these aren't confirmed commitments.  You wouldn't expect that  from any judge.  </p><p>Isn't it the real problem that this is a conservative judge, Donald Trump  went to the country and promised to nominate conservative judges,  originalists who would -- who would interpret the Constitution as written,  it hasn't healed well within the mainstream, yes conservative, but within  the judicial mainstream?  </p><p>DURBIN:  Well, you overlook one of the most important elements of his  nomination, and that is the fact that there has been more concealment of  documents concerning his public service and his position on issues than  ever in the history of the United States.  </p><p>WALLACE:  He's given you half a million documents, sir.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DURBIN:  Let me just make my point here, Chris.  The assertion of executive  privilege by the White House to take 100,000 documents and say the American  people will not get a chance to see them as they reflect on Kavanaugh's  background is the first time in history.  This denial of access to  documents violates a role that we thought was a tradition of the Senate  under Senator Sessions and Senator Leahy, time and again when it came to  Obama nominees.  </p><p>They are suppressing these documents.  If we are lucky we will see 6  percent, 6 percent, of all of the documents that have been produced -- that  could be produced to reflect on Kavanaugh's true position on issues.  He  saying and the White House saying the American people have no right to  know.  </p><p>So, if he so proud of his conservative credentials show us the record,  stand before us, trust the American people and they will trust you.  I  would say that to Judge Kavanaugh.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I -- and you will have the opportunity to do that starting on  Tuesday.  Let me just say as a point of saying goodbye, they have turned  over half a million documents and the issue, part of it is about 3 million  documents when he was staff secretary and every document that went to the  president went to his desk.  </p><p>But, Senator Durbin, thank you.  Thanks for joining us.  We look forward to  your questioning of Judge Kavanaugh starting this week.  </p><p>DURBIN:  Thanks, Chris.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Always good to talk with you, sir.  </p><p>Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what to expect from  this week's showdown between the president's Supreme Court pick and Senate  Democrats.  </p><p>Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about how Judge Kavanaugh's  confirmation would change the Supreme Court?  Just go to Facebook or  Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We need to elect senators  who will vote for judges to follow our laws and our Constitution as  written.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST:  President Trump on the campaign trail this  week making the case for his choice of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme  Court and it's time now for our Sunday group.  </p><p>Former press secretary for Vice President Pence, Marc Lotter, Charles Lane  of \"The Washington Post\", former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards,  and \"Washington Post\" columnist and former White House speechwriter Marc  Thiessen.  </p><p>Chuck, when Justice Kennedy, the swing vote on the court, stepped down and  there was talk about replacing him, we heard all this talk about a fierce  battle for the future of the court and I want to ask you the same question  that I asked Senator Durbin, why hasn't it happen?  The Democrats don't  seem to have gained much traction against Brett Kavanaugh so far.  </p><p>CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST:  I think there's a lot of reasons,  starting with the fact that it's just possible Republicans care a little  bit more about this than actually Democrats do.  I did a little checking  and Democrats were a little bit less likely than Republicans to vote in  2016 based on the future of the Supreme Court.  So, there's a little bit of  a surprising passion gap there.  </p><p>Secondly, I think it's the very simple fact that this is about 51 votes and  the Republicans have 51 votes, and that means two things, one, Mitch  McConnell can control the pace of this thing, control the calendar and so  forth.  And secondly, it means the Democrats are just struggling to get  over that work and they are divided.  Not divided down the middle, but they  are divided between the main block of the party and several people who have  to run for reelection in red states.  </p><p>That's created a very difficult problem in messaging for them and so they  are left dealing not with the substance of the Kavanaugh thing but  procedural issues like document disclosure, arcane matters, very important  but very arcane about executive privilege and the net effect is they have  yet to identify some hot button things that can get the public excited  against Judge Kavanaugh.  </p><p>WALLACE:  We ask you for questions for the panel and we got this on Twitter  from Waris Waldo, which after I read it several times realize some persons  interpretation of where is Waldo.  </p><p>When did adhering to the United States Constitution became radical and  threatening?</p><p>Marc Lotter, how do you answer that?  </p><p>MARC LOTTER, FORMER PENCE PRESS SECRETARY:  Well, I think that's the basis  of this argument.  And we have -- and Judge Kavanaugh and in Justice  Gorsuch -- we have someone who adheres to the Constitution and many on the  liberal side prefer to appoint justices who interpret the law to mean  things other than what it says.  That's the heart of the argument.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I want to turn to the nation's farewell to John McCain which has  been the big story this week and his daughter Meghan's tribute to him at  the National Cathedral yesterday, which still has a lot of people talking.   Here's part of that.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEGHAN MCCAIN, DAUGHTER OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN:  The America of John McCain  has no need to be made great again because America was always great.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Marc Thiessen, it's her dad.</p><p>MARC THIESSEN, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE SPEECHWRITER:  Yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  She obviously feels passionately about the fact that she thinks  that President Trump didn't treat her dad well and he didn't, what did you  think of her remarks?  </p><p>THIESSEN:  Well, first of all, just watching her this week has been  heartbreaking because her grief has been palpable and so was her anger  palpable yesterday and with good reason because Donald Trump treated her  father disgracefully.  </p><p>If you want to put this in perspective, there have been 1,974 United States  senators since the founding of the republic.  John McCain is only the sixth  senator to lie in state who wasn't either a vice president or president.   So, this is a tremendous testament and there are only 31 people in American  history who had laid in state.  </p><p>This may very well be the first time that the sitting president of the  United States has not participated in honoring that person, and that as a  result of his disgraceful behavior towards him.  He was even criticizing  John McCain by name a few weeks ago on the campaign trail to suggest that  he wasn't a war hero and never apologized for that.  </p><p>This is one of the reasons, Chris, why I think Donald Trump, despite a  booming economy, his disapproval has reached now 60 percent in the country.   It's not because people don't like his policies, because his policies are  obviously improving the lives of people, the economy is booming and on  employment is low.  But his inability to be presidential and to rise to the  occasion at a moment like this, put aside his petty grievances against John  McCain, I think that's one of the reasons why his popularity doesn't match  his success as president.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Congresswoman Edwards, I promise I'm going to bring one but Marc  Lotter is out someone often defends this president.  Your reaction?  </p><p>LOTTER:  Well, I think it takes two to tango.  And I think John McCain and  Senator McCain has made a very good career out of attacking presidents when  he disagreed on both sides of the aisle.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But in fairness, he somehow had a good enough relationship with  George W. Bush and Barack Obama that they spoke at his funeral.  </p><p>LOTTER:  And he did.  This is one that continued on this week.  And I think  once we get past this, we will remember John McCain for all of his great  service.  The president is going to continue to go on and is going to do  many things that John McCain supported like supporting our troops,  investing in our military and we'll let their -- we'll let their  disagreement I guess go on in history.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Congresswoman Edwards, your reaction to Meghan McCain's remarks  and when you take in addition, because it wasn't just McCain, it was Joe  Biden and it was Barack Obama, and it was George W. Bush, the last  Republican president before Trump.  Was this week a rebuke of President  Trump?  </p><p>DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (D-MD):  Well, I think that Meghan  McCain's remarks and all of the remarks of the various speakers were John  McCain speaking.  His hand was clearly evident in those remarks and  particularly Meghan's remarks and I think that there were spot on for where  we are in this nation.  </p><p>You know, I come from a military family too and I think for the president  of the United States not to have honored and recognized Senator McCain's  service, irrespective of policy disagreement I think was disgraceful and I  think the nation stood up and said that it was disgraceful too.  And that  all of those speakers indicated that what was valued and Senator McCain in  addition to his service in his honor was his commitment to this country and  that we had a president of the United States who seemed incapable of even  acknowledging that.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  We're going to leave it on that note.  Panel, we will  take a break here.  We'll see you a little later.  </p><p>Up next, President Trump threatens to cut Canada out of a new NAFTA deal  and forge ahead just with Mexico.  What would that mean for workers in the  economy?  </p><p>On this Labor Day weekend, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka joins us next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: Coming up, President Trump looks to replace NAFTA as he works on a  new trade deal with Mexico and Canada. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And we're going to call it  the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement. And we'll get rid of the name  NAFTA. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: We'll talk with the head of the largest group of unions in the  country, Richard Trumka, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: Negotiations to hammer out a deal to reshape NAFTA, the three  nation trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, will continue  this weeks after talks between the White House and Canada stalled amid some  bitterness. </p><p>Joining us now to discuss the potential fallout for American workers is the  president of the AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka. </p><p>Mr. Trumka, President Trump has negotiated a new NAFTA deal with Mexico,  but talks with Canada stalled after some off the record comments that he  made were published that he acknowledged that he won't make any concessions  to Canada. And here's what he said about that afterwards. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Here's the good news, at  least Canada knows where I stand, because we can't have these countries  taking advantage of the United States anymore. It's very simple. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Question, can you support a deal that leads Canada out of a new  NAFTA and will Congress pass it? </p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, AFL-CIO PRESIDENT: Well, Chris, before I get to that, just  let me say, on behalf of the hardworking men and women of this country who  wake our country up every day, make her run all day and put it to bed at  night, let me wish you a happy Labor Day and all your listeners a happy  Labor Day. </p><p>Look, our economies are integrated, the three countries in North America,  the economy is pretty emigrated. And it's pretty hard to see how that would  work without having Canada in the deal. You said that the Mexican deal is  close, but there's still a lot of work to be left -- to be done, even on  the Mexican deal, Chris, because the language isn't drafted. We haven't  seen whole chapters of the thing. We're anxious to move forward with it and  anxious to have all three countries involved, because NAFTA has had a  devastating effect on the working people of this country for the last 25  years. So we've been aggressively pursuing an agreement that works for the  workers in all three countries and I can say we're not done yet. </p><p>WALLACE: OK, but let's talk about the parts of the deal we do know about  that the Trump administration has negotiated with Mexico that it seems to  me would be pretty good for workers. Let's put them up on the screen. </p><p>Seventy-five percent of a car's value would have to be manufactured in  North America. That's up from 62.5 percent. Forty to forty-five percent of  the car must be made by workers in whatever country earning at least $16 an  hour. </p><p>Do you support both of those provisions and, frankly, do you think that  Mexico would live up to them? For instance, the salary for car workers,  because in Mexico right now the salary for a car worker on average is $3 an  hour. Do you think they actually are going to boost that to $16 an hour? </p><p>TRUMKA: Well, first of all, those provisions can be very, very good. And  you said that the current provision is really 62.5. In actuality, Chris,  it's only in the 40s because they -- they do a little cheating saying if  you put in 62 percent and China puts in 38 percent, it counts as 100  percent. So it's really lower and the change is really more -- more  effective. We haven't seen the details of it yet.</p><p>But you hit the nail right on the head. It doesn't matter what's in that  agreement. If we can't monitor it and effect it -- and enforce it  effectively, then the agreement will fail for workers and it will fail for  the country. So what we're pushing right now, and we're working with  Ambassador Lighthizer is, is a way to let us effectively monitor what's  going on the ground and then enforce the agreement regardless of who's in  the White House, because we've been told for over 25 years, trust us, this  agreement will be good for workers. What we need is an agreement that we  can enforce no matter who's in the White House. </p><p>WALLACE: Let me --</p><p>TRUMKA: That's what we're looking for. </p><p>WALLACE: Let me step back for a minute and go broader view. </p><p>How does big labor feel about President Trump at this point? I mean the  fact is growth is up. Unemployment is down. He's using tariffs to try to  break down trade barriers that I know that you hate. So, I mean, what mark  do you give Donald Trump on this Labor Day weekend?</p><p>TRUMKA: Well, when he was elected, I said I would call balls and strikes.  When he did something that was good for workers, we'd support him. When he  did something that was bad for workers, we would oppose him. </p><p>Unfortunately, to date, the things that he's done to hurt workers outpace  what he's done to help workers. He hasn't come up with an infrastructure  program that could put a lot of us back to work. He overturned a regulation  that would actually denied over 5 million people overtime that they would  have had. He overturned some health and safety regulations that will hurt  us on the job. Enforcement of OSHA and MSHA isn't what it should be. </p><p>So we keep trying to find areas where we can work with him. And where we  can, we do. </p><p>WALLACE: Well, but let me ask you -- Mr. Trumka, let me ask you, I mean,  3.9 percent unemployment. 3.5 million jobs created, 4 percent -- 4.2  percent GDP in the last quarter. I mean don't you give him something for  that? </p><p>TRUMKA: No, those are good, but wages have been down since the first of the  year. Gas prices have been up since the first of the year. So, overall,  workers aren't doing as well. He passed the tax bill that encourages  companies to outsource. We can't agree to support something like that. He's  -- every place we can, Chris, we do. But, unfortunately, right now, the  scale is weighted against him because he's done more to hurt workers than  to help workers. </p><p>WALLACE: So you have launched a new big political campaign for the  midterms. You have an ad out on the web right now. Is it your hope that  Democrats would take back control of the House and Senate and block the  Trump agenda, even those parts that have been good for workers, like  creating 3.5 million new jobs? </p><p>TRUMKA: It's not about Democrats or Republicans. It's about electing people  who will support working people in this country. That's what we're looking  to do. </p><p>We started a couple of months ago, going door-to-door, member to member  with our members saying, what issues are important to you? We put those  together. We're going to put them in front of candidates. Those candidates  that support the issues that our members say they want, need and should  have are the candidates that we'll support. </p><p>It probably will be Democrats because, unfortunately, Democrats support  working people more than Republicans have. We'd like to change that. But  the reality is, Democrats support working people more than Republicans,  although we go candidate by candidate and we support those Republicans that  support working people. </p><p>WALLACE: Finally, this week I looked at the presidential exit polls from  2016. Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump in union households by just nine  points, 51 percent to 42, which interestingly enough is the smallest  Democratic advantage since Reagan ran against Mondale in 1984. Question,  don't a lot of your members, union members, don't they support Donald  Trump? </p><p>TRUMKA: Well, actually, three percentage points more of our members voted  for Donald Trump than they did for Mitt Romney. Unfortunately, 10 percent  of our members -- 10 percent fewer of our members voted for Hillary  Clinton. They didn't believe her on trade. They didn't believe her on a  couple of other issues. </p><p>But you talked about households. Union members themselves are a much higher  percentage in there. Again, we give them all the facts and I believe in my  membership, the rank and file, that when they get the facts, they make the  right decision every time. We're giving them the facts on this president  and anybody who's running against him and they will ultimately decide which  one of those candidates that they want to support. </p><p>WALLACE: Mr. Trumka, thank you. Thanks for sharing part of this Labor Day  holiday weekend with us. We'll stay on top of all this, sir. </p><p>TRUMKA: Chris, thanks for having me on. And, again, happy Labor Day. </p><p>WALLACE: When we come back, the Trump administration opens the door to  regulating Google. Our Sunday panel returns to discuss the battle with big  tech. That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think Canada very much  wants to make the deal and I think it's going to be obviously very good for  Canada if they do and I think it's probably not going to be good at all if  they don't. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: President Trump playing hardball with Canada as he tries to  rewrite the quarter century old North American Free Trade Agreement, or  NAFTA. </p><p>And we're back now with the panel.</p><p>Well, Congresswoman Edwards, there was a lot of howling, I think it's fair  to say, from Democrats when President Trump said that he was going to  revamp NAFTA. But aren't there, and it talked about it with Mr. Trumka,  aren't there a number of provisions in this agreement with Mexico at least  that are good for American workers? </p><p>DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (D-MD): Well, I think there are  also a lot of Democrats who very much wanted to see a North American Free  Trade Agreement that really invests in workers, that makes sure that we  have protections across both borders. And I think you heard that from what  Mr. Trumka was saying. And I -- you know, I think it --</p><p>WALLACE: But raising -- but raising the wage to $16 an hour? </p><p>EDWARDS: Raising the wages. Exactly.</p><p>WALLACE: Raising the amount that has to be content from North America? </p><p>EDWARDS: Right. And all -- those are -- those are actually things that many  of us is Democrats have been calling for, for a long time because, you  know, we can have free trade, but if it's not fair on both sides of the  border, it really doesn't work. It doesn't keep workers here working and it  doesn't make sure that workers in Mexico are being paid what they need. And  I don't think you can have a North American Free Trade Agreement without  having the other part of North America, which is Canada, in the deal too. </p><p>WALLACE: Let me pick up on that with you, Marc Lotter, because talks with  Canada stalled on Friday over it seems to issues, one is continued dairy  protections inside Canada and, secondly, the publishing of off the record  comments by President Trump where he basically said, I'm not going to offer  any concessions at all to Canada. Does this deal go through? And -- and I'm  primarily, I guess, I'm talking about Congress, does this deal go through  without Canada onboard? </p><p>MARC LOTTER, FORMER PENCE PRESS SECRETARY: I think it makes it much easier  if Canada is on board to get it through Congress. But this is -- this is  very tough negotiating with the president and the prime minister and the  Canadian officials. The president is very clear, he wants to get this done.  He wants Canada to be involved. And it's going to be a question now of, can  they make enough concessions to make it fair on both sides? I think they  will. </p><p>WALLACE: Let's turn to another big story this week and that is President  Trump complaining that Google's search engine, when you put in \"President  Trump news,\" it has been calibrated to drown out conservative voices. The  president and his team this week complained about that and even talked  about regulating Google. </p><p>Here's the president. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've made it clear that we,  as a country, cannot tolerate political censorship, blacklisting and rigged  search results. </p><p>We're not going to let them control what we can and cannot see, read, and  learn from. We can't do that. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Chuck, first of all, from the best of your knowledge, is there  political bias in the Google search? I mean is it calibrated to drown out  conservative voices and to push liberal points of view? And, secondly, what  do you make of the threat by the president that the government might get  involved in regulating Google? </p><p>CHARLES LANE, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Well, the best of my knowledge about  Google's algorithms is not very good. </p><p>WALLACE: Well, that's why I asked you. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>LANE: But I -- I would be very surprised if somebody at Google said, let's  set up the algorithm to drown out Donald Trump in any specific sense like  that. I think these searches work in an incredibly complex ways that for  some unconscious or otherwise neutral reason may be turning up what  President Trump claims they're turning up. But, of course, it's just his  claim. </p><p>But there's a bigger context for this, which is, a lot of stuff going on at  Google, like a few months back an employee circulating a memo internally  claiming that the company isolates conservatives internally, then he winds  up on the outs. There's a movement within Google to decouple Google, so to  speak, from defense contracting and so forth. And I think the president's  pushing back against those things and he's more generally trying to turn  Google into just another part of this big, fake news media that has been  his big foil all through his political career. </p><p>You know, there's a lot of suspicion, both on the left and the right, in  sort of populist America about these giant technology companies. And I  think in that sense, he's just trying to turn them into another one of his  scapegoats to show like everything is stacked against us, even the search  engine. </p><p>WALLACE: Marc, your thoughts about whether the government should be  regulating a company like Google? Are their First Amendment issues there?  And if they were (ph) going to regulate Google in terms of its search  engine, they can do a number of things just to make life difficult for  Google. </p><p>MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No doubt. And I -- look, I think the - - the fact that there -- there is conservative bias in social media. It's  not just Google. It's FaceBook. It's Twitter. There's been a lot of  accusations. They probably -- the only place where there's more anti- conservative bias than the legacy media is Silicon Valley. So, you know,  and the fact is, a lot of people getting their news from Silicon Valley in  a ways that they weren't a few years ago. But -- and so Trump is raising a  valid point. </p><p>Where he loses me is when he says that he wants the government to start  regulating it, because I -- the only institution I trust less than Google  to regulate my -- my search is the federal government. So I think what we  need is for people to be more proactive in terms of where they get their  news and how they -- they consume their news. </p><p>One of the -- the -- the avenue of social media has given conservatives an  incredible voice that they didn't have before because they didn't have to  go through \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times.\" So they have a  voice that they never had before. But we're also in these ideological silos  were conservatives only read conservative news sources. Liberals only read  -- Washington (ph) read liberal news sources. And I think we all need to do  a better job of policing ourselves and getting out of our silos and  listening to the other side because that's how we get over the division in  the country.</p><p>WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, I want to pick up on the last point that  Chuck made, and that is, isn't there a legitimate concern -- and on this  populist issue about companies, whether it's Google or FaceBook or Twitter  or Amazon, these huge companies that have so much power and so much money  and so much influence? </p><p>EDWARDS: Well, I mean, but the concern, I think, is really misplaced  because if you look at these entities, every time there, you know, is this  sort of massive growth in this industry, something else starts up that  becomes the next new thing. And we remember when Twitter was the next new  thing and Instagram the next new thing. And so I think that the dynamism  that's in the industry allows that to, you know, to create an environment  where, you know, you can have a lot of different kinds of voices in there.  And I think if anything is getting in the way of it in terms of the  government, I think it's saying, you know, this -- these decisions around  net neutrality because then that makes it even more difficult for  conservative or even, you know, far left views to get into the mainstream  if you're put on this secondary highway. </p><p>So -- but the idea that the government should have the -- the -- the  ability to figure out what the search engine is, I don't think so. I mean  most of the people I know in Congress can't even operate their Twitter  handle. </p><p>WALLACE: I am remaining silent in this conversation. I'm -- I'm a luddite,  which go to Google and look up what it means. </p><p>Thank you panel. See you next Sunday. </p><p>Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week,\" Dolly Parton on why kids around  the world call her \"the book lady.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: Most of us know her as a legendary singer and songwriter, but as  we told you back in March, for millions of kids, she's the one who help  them start reading early. </p><p>Here is our \"Power Player of the Week.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOLLY PARTON, FOUNDER, IMAGINATION LIBRARY: I just always thought there was  magic in books because it takes you to other places. Anywhere you want to  go, you can find it in a book. </p><p>It says Dolly Parton, that's my name. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): The Library of Congress is not the first place you'd  expect to see Dolly Parton, but there she was celebrating her love of  books. </p><p>PARTON (singing): In my Tennessee mountain home --</p><p>WALLACE: It's a story that begins back when she was growing up, one of 12  children, in the Smoky Mountains of east Tennessee, the daughter of Robert  Lee Parton. </p><p>PARTON: Daddy never had a chance to go to school. And daddy couldn't read  nor write, but he was really a smart person enough and wondered what all he  might have done had he had an education. </p><p>WALLACE: Fast-forward to 1995, when the country music star decided to start  the Imagination Library, to give free books to children in her hometown. </p><p>Over the years, the program has spread across the country and overseas. A  book every month to kids who sign up from birth until they turn five and go  to kindergarten. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to a child to get their own book  mailed to them in their own name? </p><p>PARTON: It makes them feel important. It makes them feel special. So, of  course, it makes them want to do what the book is all about, learn to read  it. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Local communities pay for the books, but Dolly's  group pays for sending out more than a million a month, which she helps  cover through her companies and concerts and even a children's album. </p><p>PARTON (singing): I am a rainbow.</p><p>PARTON: Oh, millions of dollars, I'm sure. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): And it's that important to you? </p><p>PARTON: Oh, it's very important, because it's my charity. Although there  are many things that I do, this is the one that's nearest and dearest to my  heart. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Dolly has been performing for more than 60 years.  She's won eight Grammy's and is in the Country Music Hall of Fame. But she  shows no sign at all of slowing down. </p><p>PARTON: My music is everything to me. It's my gift. It's my joy. It's my  job. And it's just something that I love to do. And I never think about  that I should quit it. </p><p>WALLACE: Which brings us back to the Imagination Library. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): Though I understand that you have gotten a nickname  from this program. </p><p>PARTON: I'm the book lady. Who knew?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are so honored that the hundred millionth book -- </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): So there was Dolly with the librarian of Congress  donating the 100 millionth book, unveiling a copy of her own \"Coat of Many  Colors,\" based on the coat her mother made for her out of scraps of cloth. </p><p>PARTON: Maybe we'll be back for our billionth book one of these days. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All right.</p><p>PARTON: Wouldn't that be nice! </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to you, Library of Congress? </p><p>PARTON: I know. Here I am. A little old country girl from the Smoky  Mountains of east Tennessee. Now one of my little books about my mom and a  story about my dad is going to be here forever in the Library of Congress. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Dolly even gave us a little concert about the coat  and her family and what led her to share her dream with so many children. </p><p>PARTON (singing): In my coat of many colors that my mama made for me, made  only from rags but I wore it so proudly. And although we had no money, I  was rich as I could be, in my coat of many colors mama made for me, because  she made it just for me. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: Dolly's Imagination Library now teams up with the Library of  Congress for a special story time for kids, the last Friday of each month  streaming online. </p><p>And speaking of kids, I want to introduce you to a special one. Jack Henry  Wallace, who was born on Friday, 8 pounds 6 ounces. Jack will make his  television debut in December as part of our annual Christmas greeting from  now the six Wallace grandkids. Jack, his mom and dad, and, yes, his proud  grandpa are all doing well. </p><p>And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next FOX NEWS  SUNDAY.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Kavanaugh faces days of tough  questioning from a Senate Judiciary Committee.  In a moment, we'll speak  with two leading members of that panel.  </p><p>But first, the nations long goodbye to Senator John McCain.  McCain will be  laid to rest today in a private ceremony at the U.S. Naval Academy in  Annapolis, which meant so much to him.  </p><p>FOX News correspondent Peter Doocy reports on a very public farewell  yesterday in Washington.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Lawmakers, loved ones and diplomats  gathered Saturday for a final goodbye to Senator John McCain.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  The world will be lonelier without John McCain.  </p><p>DOOCY:  One of McCain's best friends, former Senator Joe Lieberman, told  mourners about the time McCain asked him to join the GOP ticket even though  he was a registered Democrat.  </p><p>JOHN LIEBERMAN, MCCAIN'S BEST FRIEND:  John's response was direct and  really ennobling.  That's the point, Joe, he said with a certain  impatience.  You are a Democrat, I'm a Republican.  We could give our  country the bipartisan leadership it needs for a change.  </p><p>DOOCY:  McCain's former political rivals spoke on his behalf too.  </p><p>BUSH:  In recent years, we sometimes talk about that intense period like  football players remembering a big game.  In the process, rivalry melted  away.  </p><p>OBAMA:  So much of our politics, our public life, our public discourse can  seem small and mean and petty.  John called on us to be bigger than that.  </p><p>DOOCY:  McCain's daughter Meghan broke from her tear-filled tribute to more  sharply criticize the current president who wasn't invited.  </p><p>MEGHAN MCCAIN, DAUGHTER OF SEN. MCCAIN:  America has no need to be made  great again because America was always great.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE:  And joining me now here in Washington, John McCain's good friend,  Senator Lindsey Graham.  </p><p>Welcome again to \"FOX News Sunday.\" </p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-SC), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  Thank you for  having me.  </p><p>WALLACE:  You are speaking today at the private ceremony at the U.S. naval  academy.  Your tribute, first of all, how are you doing, and secondly, what  are you going to say?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Well, I'm doing OK.  These things help.  Thank you to everybody  who has called and asked me how I'm doing.  Cindy and everyone else around  the family has helped me, as much I helped them, probably more so.  </p><p>I'm going to say that nobody loved a soldier more than John McCain, that I  bear witness to his commitment to have their back, travel where they go,  never let them be forgotten.  The public may be tired of this war called  the war on terrorism, but John McCain never was.  And he had their back and  he gave them what they need to win a fight we can't afford to lose.  And he  was willing to lose a political race, but not a war.  So, I'm going to talk  about all my travels with the troops and how much they love John McCain.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I have to ask you about the passionate, heartfelt but sometimes  angry tribute by Meghan McCain who took some pretty clear shots at  President Trump.  Here's a clip.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEGHAN MCCAIN, DAUGHTER OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN:  We gather here to mourn  the passing of American greatness.  The real thing, not cheap rhetoric from  men who will never come near the sacrifice he gave so willingly, nor the  opportunistic appropriation of those who live lives of comfort and  privilege while he suffered and served.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Was that appropriate?  Was it fair?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  If you say something bad about Meghan's father, you will know it,  she didn't like it.  So, it's OK, she is grieving.  </p><p>All I can say is there's a lesson to be learned this week about John  McCain.  Number one, Americans appreciate military service.  If we've  learned nothing this week you know the fact that John served our country in  extraordinary circumstances.  It was appreciated by everybody.  </p><p>What else do we know?  If you work hard and do your homework and know what  you're talking about, people will listen to you.  That if you pick big  causes bigger than yourself, you'll be remembered.  </p><p>He tried to drain the swamp before it was cool, that you can fight hard and  still be respected.  If you forgive, people appreciate it, and if you admit  to mistakes, you look good as a stronger man.  That's the formula, John  McCain.  This was a civics lesson for anybody who wanted to listen.  Why do  remember this man, because of the way he conducted his public life.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Do you think there's a lesson there for President Trump?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  There's a lesson here for everybody, including President Trump.   Everybody makes mistakes.  Those who admit it are seen by the public as  bigger, not smaller.  Know what you're talking about, fight hard, forgive,  and have passion, strength and kindness are not mutually exclusive.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's turn to your day job and this week, you're going to be  spending a lot of time as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and  confirmation hearings for Judge Brett Kavanaugh -- </p><p>GRAHAM:  Yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  -- to be confirmed to the Supreme Court.  </p><p>First of all, does he have the votes to win confirmation of the court?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  If he does well at the hearing he will get, my belief is 55 or  higher.  If he does well enough, I'm sure he will do well.  </p><p>WALLACE:  When you say 55, you've got to have 51 Republicans, with the  appointment of McCain's replacement.  So, you are saying as many as four  Democrats?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Well, that's 55.  Last time I checked --  </p><p>WALLACE:  So, that's what you think.</p><p>GRAHAM:  Yes.  I'm not good at math, but yes, I think there are a handful  of Democrats will vote for Judge Kavanaugh if he does well and maybe even  more.  A lot of people should vote for Judge Kavanaugh.  If you are looking  to a Republican president to pick a qualified conservative, he would be on  the top of anyone's list including not just Donald Trump.  </p><p>He's the one person I think every Republican president would see is the  most qualified of their generation.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Democrats say that the confirmation should be delayed until we  know whether or not there's going to be either a criminal prosecution of  President Trump or impeachment proceedings against President Trump.  </p><p>Here is Senator Dick Durbin, who was going to be on the program next.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  We should be  withholding this decision on the Supreme Court nominee until the air is  cleared and we know exactly where we stand when it comes to this president  and (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Given that his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, says that candidate  Trump in 2016 directed him to commit a crime, does the senator have a  point?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Well, it wasn't the point he had when Clinton was under  investigation, we approved Justice Breyer.  So, my Democratic friends did  not have this view when Clinton was president.  </p><p>WALLACE:  We should point, I'm going to bring it up with Senator Durbin.   1994, Clinton is under investigation by the independent counsel in  Whitewater and he was nominated.  </p><p>GRAHAM:  I think --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Stephen Breyer was confirmed to the court.  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Senator Grassley has been very fair.  More documents than the  person ever nominated to the Supreme Court.  We're going to have a hearing  and there's no drama in this hearing.  The only drama is those running for  president, how will they handle this hearing on the Democratic side?  You  know, we're going to get this good man confirmed.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let me ask you, though, about this question of criminal  liability.  I want to look at some Kavanaugh's statements on that issue.   Let's put them up.  In 1999, Kavanaugh said the Nixon ruling, that  President Nixon had to turn over all of the White House Watergate tapes may  have been, quote, wrongly decided.  In 2009, Kavanaugh wrote: criminal  investigations take the president's focus away from his or her  responsibilities to the people.  </p><p>Is there a legitimate concern that Justice Kavanaugh, if you were faced  with a case on the Supreme Court, would side with the president against  either Congress or the court?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  Well, what I think you'll find is somebody that has had 308  decisions.  So, you can get a pretty good idea of what he thinks based on  his time on the court of appeals but the bottom line here is that most  people are unsure as to whether or not a president can be indicted, a  sitting president.  </p><p>Impeachment is a process to remove a president, their criminal liability  aspects are very much in debate.  I think he's going to be mainstream in  his thinking.  He's going to look at both sides of the issue and decide  appropriately.  </p><p>WALLACE:  One issue that pro-choice senators of both sides have pressed  Kavanaugh on in their meetings with him on Capitol Hill is abortion.  And  Kavanaugh reportedly told them that Roe v. Wade is, quote, \"settled law\".   Is that a firm commitment in your regard, in your view, to not overturn  Roe?  And if it is a firm commitment, how can you as a pro-life senator  support him?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  I wouldn't vote for anybody that says that every decision the  Supreme Court cannot be revisited.  They revisit through a process.   There's a process of overturning long precedent.  There's a four-part test  you have to apply.  </p><p>From my point of view, what he will do is when that case comes, if it ever  does, you just don't wake up one day and say, hey, I'd like to overturn Roe  v. Wade.  If there's a conflict that makes it to the Supreme Court, he will  apply the test of precedent to that decision, Roe v. Wade, and every other  precedent.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But to make it clear, you're saying you don't view his statement,  for instance, to Senator Collins, a pro-choice Republican, that it settled  law means that therefore it can't be re-examined and conceivably overturn?  </p><p>GRAHAM:  He would be disqualified, in my opinion, if you would not listen  to both sides of the story and decide accordingly.  This idea that Roe v.  Wade is going to be challenged at state level, there are all kinds of laws  out there.  Some may work their way up to Supreme Court.  He will give  great deference I'm sure to Roe v. Wade.  But it can be overturned like  every other decision but that will be up to the facts on the record.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Senator Graham, thank you, thanks for your time on on the tough  weekend.  Our deepest sympathies in a loss of a dear friend, sir.</p><p>GRAHAM:  Thank you.  Thank you so much.</p><p>Joining me now from Illinois, another member of the committee that will be  questioning Judge Kavanaugh, Dick Durbin, the Senate's number two Democrat.  </p><p>Senator, Democrats have tried a variety of efforts to upend and derail the  confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh.  I want to put some of them up.  </p><p>The argument that there is a midterm election.  The argument that President  Trump is under investigation.  If you want to see millions of pages of  documents from when he was staff secretary for President George W. Bush,  and the White House has no invoked executive privilege to withhold 100,000  pages from when he worked for the White House counsel.  </p><p>I think it's fair to say that none of that has worked and the question is,  why is it the Democrats have so far been unable to gain any traction  against Judge Kavanaugh, and in the public debate, you don't seem to have  laid a glove on him?</p><p>SEN. DICK DURBIN (D-IL), SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:  Let me say at the  outset before we get into that and I will address it -- I joined with  Lindsey Graham, every word he said John McCain John McCain.  I respect John  McCain so much and yesterday was a great display of the respect so many  people across this country had for this great American.  I was lucky enough  to be with Lindsey and John involved in some very important negotiations  for more than a year on comprehensive immigration reform.  So I back up  every word.  </p><p>So let me start with Brett Kavanaugh in this way.  He is the most unpopular  Supreme Court nominee in the last 40 years.  How did he reach that point so  quickly?  Well, I think there were a number of reasons for it.  </p><p>You look at first and foremost is the fact that this president said I'm not  going to put a man on the Supreme Court unless he is going to overturn Roe  versus Wade and the Affordable Care Act.  The president is never at a loss  for words and he was very explicit in terms of what he wanted in a Supreme  Court nominee.  Those positions may be popular with his Republican base.   They're not popular with the American people.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Wait, wait -- </p><p>GRAHAM:  An issue that you have raised --  </p><p>WALLACE:  Wait.  I mean, he said he was going to appoint pro-life judges.   He never said that he asked him or on a litmus test about that.  And also,  I have to say, I'm a little surprised that you are saying he's the most  unpopular.  When did we nominate and confirm Supreme Court justices based  on public opinion polls?  </p><p>DURBIN:  Well, we shouldn't be.  But you started off with the premise  you've never laid a glove on him.  The fact of the matter is the American  people have gone through this nomination and come to the conclusion that  he's not the right person for the job.  </p><p>Let me go a little bit further here.  He comes before us at a time when  people are concerned about whether this president or any president is above  the law.  Think about his role, Kavanaugh's role, when it came to Judge Ken  Starr going after President Clinton.  He was the aggressive prosecutor in  that respect and a few years later after working in the Bush White House  said that completely reversed my position.  A president should not be  subject to the subject of prosecution while he's in office.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Can I -- can I let me just ask you about that because as Lindsey  Graham brought up, and I was going to ask you anyway, in 1994, Bill Clinton  was under investigation by an independent counsel on Whitewater and he  nominated and the Senate confirmed Stephen Breyer and that was also in a  midterm election year.  That relate directly contradicts two of the  arguments that you're making against Kavanaugh.  </p><p>DURBIN:  Let me just say that I was not a member of the Senate when Justice  Breyer came before that body, but it will tell you at the time the  investigation was underway, there was no suspicion at that moment that  Clinton was going to brush it aside and say, you have no authority to even  question me.  It went forward.  He was subpoenaed, he was deposed, he was  tried in the House -- and I should say indicted under the impeachment  clause and tried in the Senate.  I was at the Senate at the time.</p><p>And now, we have a different situation completely.  There is a serious  question as to whether this president, given the opportunity, will end the  Mueller investigation, something which most Republicans and the  overwhelming majority of Americans say would be a serious mistake and we  ask, of course, Judge Kavanaugh, what do you think, and he says it's hands  off when it comes to a president during his term in office.  </p><p>I think that's a mistake and it's one of the major reasons people had  misgivings about his nomination.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Let's look at some specific issues.  As I pointed out, Kavanaugh  has told some pro-choice senators that he views Roe as settled law, he was  asked about Obamacare, there's a Texas case that would try to take it all  down because of the fact that the individual mandate has been repealed.  He  said that he was very skeptical of that.  </p><p>Obviously, these aren't confirmed commitments.  You wouldn't expect that  from any judge.  </p><p>Isn't it the real problem that this is a conservative judge, Donald Trump  went to the country and promised to nominate conservative judges,  originalists who would -- who would interpret the Constitution as written,  it hasn't healed well within the mainstream, yes conservative, but within  the judicial mainstream?  </p><p>DURBIN:  Well, you overlook one of the most important elements of his  nomination, and that is the fact that there has been more concealment of  documents concerning his public service and his position on issues than  ever in the history of the United States.  </p><p>WALLACE:  He's given you half a million documents, sir.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>DURBIN:  Let me just make my point here, Chris.  The assertion of executive  privilege by the White House to take 100,000 documents and say the American  people will not get a chance to see them as they reflect on Kavanaugh's  background is the first time in history.  This denial of access to  documents violates a role that we thought was a tradition of the Senate  under Senator Sessions and Senator Leahy, time and again when it came to  Obama nominees.  </p><p>They are suppressing these documents.  If we are lucky we will see 6  percent, 6 percent, of all of the documents that have been produced -- that  could be produced to reflect on Kavanaugh's true position on issues.  He  saying and the White House saying the American people have no right to  know.  </p><p>So, if he so proud of his conservative credentials show us the record,  stand before us, trust the American people and they will trust you.  I  would say that to Judge Kavanaugh.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I -- and you will have the opportunity to do that starting on  Tuesday.  Let me just say as a point of saying goodbye, they have turned  over half a million documents and the issue, part of it is about 3 million  documents when he was staff secretary and every document that went to the  president went to his desk.  </p><p>But, Senator Durbin, thank you.  Thanks for joining us.  We look forward to  your questioning of Judge Kavanaugh starting this week.  </p><p>DURBIN:  Thanks, Chris.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Always good to talk with you, sir.  </p><p>Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what to expect from  this week's showdown between the president's Supreme Court pick and Senate  Democrats.  </p><p>Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about how Judge Kavanaugh's  confirmation would change the Supreme Court?  Just go to Facebook or  Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We need to elect senators  who will vote for judges to follow our laws and our Constitution as  written.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS HOST:  President Trump on the campaign trail this  week making the case for his choice of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme  Court and it's time now for our Sunday group.  </p><p>Former press secretary for Vice President Pence, Marc Lotter, Charles Lane  of \"The Washington Post\", former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards,  and \"Washington Post\" columnist and former White House speechwriter Marc  Thiessen.  </p><p>Chuck, when Justice Kennedy, the swing vote on the court, stepped down and  there was talk about replacing him, we heard all this talk about a fierce  battle for the future of the court and I want to ask you the same question  that I asked Senator Durbin, why hasn't it happen?  The Democrats don't  seem to have gained much traction against Brett Kavanaugh so far.  </p><p>CHARLES LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST:  I think there's a lot of reasons,  starting with the fact that it's just possible Republicans care a little  bit more about this than actually Democrats do.  I did a little checking  and Democrats were a little bit less likely than Republicans to vote in  2016 based on the future of the Supreme Court.  So, there's a little bit of  a surprising passion gap there.  </p><p>Secondly, I think it's the very simple fact that this is about 51 votes and  the Republicans have 51 votes, and that means two things, one, Mitch  McConnell can control the pace of this thing, control the calendar and so  forth.  And secondly, it means the Democrats are just struggling to get  over that work and they are divided.  Not divided down the middle, but they  are divided between the main block of the party and several people who have  to run for reelection in red states.  </p><p>That's created a very difficult problem in messaging for them and so they  are left dealing not with the substance of the Kavanaugh thing but  procedural issues like document disclosure, arcane matters, very important  but very arcane about executive privilege and the net effect is they have  yet to identify some hot button things that can get the public excited  against Judge Kavanaugh.  </p><p>WALLACE:  We ask you for questions for the panel and we got this on Twitter  from Waris Waldo, which after I read it several times realize some persons  interpretation of where is Waldo.  </p><p>When did adhering to the United States Constitution became radical and  threatening?</p><p>Marc Lotter, how do you answer that?  </p><p>MARC LOTTER, FORMER PENCE PRESS SECRETARY:  Well, I think that's the basis  of this argument.  And we have -- and Judge Kavanaugh and in Justice  Gorsuch -- we have someone who adheres to the Constitution and many on the  liberal side prefer to appoint justices who interpret the law to mean  things other than what it says.  That's the heart of the argument.  </p><p>WALLACE:  I want to turn to the nation's farewell to John McCain which has  been the big story this week and his daughter Meghan's tribute to him at  the National Cathedral yesterday, which still has a lot of people talking.   Here's part of that.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEGHAN MCCAIN, DAUGHTER OF SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN:  The America of John McCain  has no need to be made great again because America was always great.  </p><p>(APPLAUSE) </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE:  Marc Thiessen, it's her dad.</p><p>MARC THIESSEN, FORMER BUSH WHITE HOUSE SPEECHWRITER:  Yes.</p><p>WALLACE:  She obviously feels passionately about the fact that she thinks  that President Trump didn't treat her dad well and he didn't, what did you  think of her remarks?  </p><p>THIESSEN:  Well, first of all, just watching her this week has been  heartbreaking because her grief has been palpable and so was her anger  palpable yesterday and with good reason because Donald Trump treated her  father disgracefully.  </p><p>If you want to put this in perspective, there have been 1,974 United States  senators since the founding of the republic.  John McCain is only the sixth  senator to lie in state who wasn't either a vice president or president.   So, this is a tremendous testament and there are only 31 people in American  history who had laid in state.  </p><p>This may very well be the first time that the sitting president of the  United States has not participated in honoring that person, and that as a  result of his disgraceful behavior towards him.  He was even criticizing  John McCain by name a few weeks ago on the campaign trail to suggest that  he wasn't a war hero and never apologized for that.  </p><p>This is one of the reasons, Chris, why I think Donald Trump, despite a  booming economy, his disapproval has reached now 60 percent in the country.   It's not because people don't like his policies, because his policies are  obviously improving the lives of people, the economy is booming and on  employment is low.  But his inability to be presidential and to rise to the  occasion at a moment like this, put aside his petty grievances against John  McCain, I think that's one of the reasons why his popularity doesn't match  his success as president.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Congresswoman Edwards, I promise I'm going to bring one but Marc  Lotter is out someone often defends this president.  Your reaction?  </p><p>LOTTER:  Well, I think it takes two to tango.  And I think John McCain and  Senator McCain has made a very good career out of attacking presidents when  he disagreed on both sides of the aisle.  </p><p>WALLACE:  But in fairness, he somehow had a good enough relationship with  George W. Bush and Barack Obama that they spoke at his funeral.  </p><p>LOTTER:  And he did.  This is one that continued on this week.  And I think  once we get past this, we will remember John McCain for all of his great  service.  The president is going to continue to go on and is going to do  many things that John McCain supported like supporting our troops,  investing in our military and we'll let their -- we'll let their  disagreement I guess go on in history.  </p><p>WALLACE:  Congresswoman Edwards, your reaction to Meghan McCain's remarks  and when you take in addition, because it wasn't just McCain, it was Joe  Biden and it was Barack Obama, and it was George W. Bush, the last  Republican president before Trump.  Was this week a rebuke of President  Trump?  </p><p>DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (D-MD):  Well, I think that Meghan  McCain's remarks and all of the remarks of the various speakers were John  McCain speaking.  His hand was clearly evident in those remarks and  particularly Meghan's remarks and I think that there were spot on for where  we are in this nation.  </p><p>You know, I come from a military family too and I think for the president  of the United States not to have honored and recognized Senator McCain's  service, irrespective of policy disagreement I think was disgraceful and I  think the nation stood up and said that it was disgraceful too.  And that  all of those speakers indicated that what was valued and Senator McCain in  addition to his service in his honor was his commitment to this country and  that we had a president of the United States who seemed incapable of even  acknowledging that.  </p><p>WALLACE:  All right.  We're going to leave it on that note.  Panel, we will  take a break here.  We'll see you a little later.  </p><p>Up next, President Trump threatens to cut Canada out of a new NAFTA deal  and forge ahead just with Mexico.  What would that mean for workers in the  economy?  </p><p>On this Labor Day weekend, AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka joins us next.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: Coming up, President Trump looks to replace NAFTA as he works on a  new trade deal with Mexico and Canada. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: And we're going to call it  the United States-Mexico Trade Agreement. And we'll get rid of the name  NAFTA. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: We'll talk with the head of the largest group of unions in the  country, Richard Trumka, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: Negotiations to hammer out a deal to reshape NAFTA, the three  nation trade agreement between the U.S., Mexico and Canada, will continue  this weeks after talks between the White House and Canada stalled amid some  bitterness. </p><p>Joining us now to discuss the potential fallout for American workers is the  president of the AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka. </p><p>Mr. Trumka, President Trump has negotiated a new NAFTA deal with Mexico,  but talks with Canada stalled after some off the record comments that he  made were published that he acknowledged that he won't make any concessions  to Canada. And here's what he said about that afterwards. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Here's the good news, at  least Canada knows where I stand, because we can't have these countries  taking advantage of the United States anymore. It's very simple. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Question, can you support a deal that leads Canada out of a new  NAFTA and will Congress pass it? </p><p>RICHARD TRUMKA, AFL-CIO PRESIDENT: Well, Chris, before I get to that, just  let me say, on behalf of the hardworking men and women of this country who  wake our country up every day, make her run all day and put it to bed at  night, let me wish you a happy Labor Day and all your listeners a happy  Labor Day. </p><p>Look, our economies are integrated, the three countries in North America,  the economy is pretty emigrated. And it's pretty hard to see how that would  work without having Canada in the deal. You said that the Mexican deal is  close, but there's still a lot of work to be left -- to be done, even on  the Mexican deal, Chris, because the language isn't drafted. We haven't  seen whole chapters of the thing. We're anxious to move forward with it and  anxious to have all three countries involved, because NAFTA has had a  devastating effect on the working people of this country for the last 25  years. So we've been aggressively pursuing an agreement that works for the  workers in all three countries and I can say we're not done yet. </p><p>WALLACE: OK, but let's talk about the parts of the deal we do know about  that the Trump administration has negotiated with Mexico that it seems to  me would be pretty good for workers. Let's put them up on the screen. </p><p>Seventy-five percent of a car's value would have to be manufactured in  North America. That's up from 62.5 percent. Forty to forty-five percent of  the car must be made by workers in whatever country earning at least $16 an  hour. </p><p>Do you support both of those provisions and, frankly, do you think that  Mexico would live up to them? For instance, the salary for car workers,  because in Mexico right now the salary for a car worker on average is $3 an  hour. Do you think they actually are going to boost that to $16 an hour? </p><p>TRUMKA: Well, first of all, those provisions can be very, very good. And  you said that the current provision is really 62.5. In actuality, Chris,  it's only in the 40s because they -- they do a little cheating saying if  you put in 62 percent and China puts in 38 percent, it counts as 100  percent. So it's really lower and the change is really more -- more  effective. We haven't seen the details of it yet.</p><p>But you hit the nail right on the head. It doesn't matter what's in that  agreement. If we can't monitor it and effect it -- and enforce it  effectively, then the agreement will fail for workers and it will fail for  the country. So what we're pushing right now, and we're working with  Ambassador Lighthizer is, is a way to let us effectively monitor what's  going on the ground and then enforce the agreement regardless of who's in  the White House, because we've been told for over 25 years, trust us, this  agreement will be good for workers. What we need is an agreement that we  can enforce no matter who's in the White House. </p><p>WALLACE: Let me --</p><p>TRUMKA: That's what we're looking for. </p><p>WALLACE: Let me step back for a minute and go broader view. </p><p>How does big labor feel about President Trump at this point? I mean the  fact is growth is up. Unemployment is down. He's using tariffs to try to  break down trade barriers that I know that you hate. So, I mean, what mark  do you give Donald Trump on this Labor Day weekend?</p><p>TRUMKA: Well, when he was elected, I said I would call balls and strikes.  When he did something that was good for workers, we'd support him. When he  did something that was bad for workers, we would oppose him. </p><p>Unfortunately, to date, the things that he's done to hurt workers outpace  what he's done to help workers. He hasn't come up with an infrastructure  program that could put a lot of us back to work. He overturned a regulation  that would actually denied over 5 million people overtime that they would  have had. He overturned some health and safety regulations that will hurt  us on the job. Enforcement of OSHA and MSHA isn't what it should be. </p><p>So we keep trying to find areas where we can work with him. And where we  can, we do. </p><p>WALLACE: Well, but let me ask you -- Mr. Trumka, let me ask you, I mean,  3.9 percent unemployment. 3.5 million jobs created, 4 percent -- 4.2  percent GDP in the last quarter. I mean don't you give him something for  that? </p><p>TRUMKA: No, those are good, but wages have been down since the first of the  year. Gas prices have been up since the first of the year. So, overall,  workers aren't doing as well. He passed the tax bill that encourages  companies to outsource. We can't agree to support something like that. He's  -- every place we can, Chris, we do. But, unfortunately, right now, the  scale is weighted against him because he's done more to hurt workers than  to help workers. </p><p>WALLACE: So you have launched a new big political campaign for the  midterms. You have an ad out on the web right now. Is it your hope that  Democrats would take back control of the House and Senate and block the  Trump agenda, even those parts that have been good for workers, like  creating 3.5 million new jobs? </p><p>TRUMKA: It's not about Democrats or Republicans. It's about electing people  who will support working people in this country. That's what we're looking  to do. </p><p>We started a couple of months ago, going door-to-door, member to member  with our members saying, what issues are important to you? We put those  together. We're going to put them in front of candidates. Those candidates  that support the issues that our members say they want, need and should  have are the candidates that we'll support. </p><p>It probably will be Democrats because, unfortunately, Democrats support  working people more than Republicans have. We'd like to change that. But  the reality is, Democrats support working people more than Republicans,  although we go candidate by candidate and we support those Republicans that  support working people. </p><p>WALLACE: Finally, this week I looked at the presidential exit polls from  2016. Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump in union households by just nine  points, 51 percent to 42, which interestingly enough is the smallest  Democratic advantage since Reagan ran against Mondale in 1984. Question,  don't a lot of your members, union members, don't they support Donald  Trump? </p><p>TRUMKA: Well, actually, three percentage points more of our members voted  for Donald Trump than they did for Mitt Romney. Unfortunately, 10 percent  of our members -- 10 percent fewer of our members voted for Hillary  Clinton. They didn't believe her on trade. They didn't believe her on a  couple of other issues. </p><p>But you talked about households. Union members themselves are a much higher  percentage in there. Again, we give them all the facts and I believe in my  membership, the rank and file, that when they get the facts, they make the  right decision every time. We're giving them the facts on this president  and anybody who's running against him and they will ultimately decide which  one of those candidates that they want to support. </p><p>WALLACE: Mr. Trumka, thank you. Thanks for sharing part of this Labor Day  holiday weekend with us. We'll stay on top of all this, sir. </p><p>TRUMKA: Chris, thanks for having me on. And, again, happy Labor Day. </p><p>WALLACE: When we come back, the Trump administration opens the door to  regulating Google. Our Sunday panel returns to discuss the battle with big  tech. That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think Canada very much  wants to make the deal and I think it's going to be obviously very good for  Canada if they do and I think it's probably not going to be good at all if  they don't. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: President Trump playing hardball with Canada as he tries to  rewrite the quarter century old North American Free Trade Agreement, or  NAFTA. </p><p>And we're back now with the panel.</p><p>Well, Congresswoman Edwards, there was a lot of howling, I think it's fair  to say, from Democrats when President Trump said that he was going to  revamp NAFTA. But aren't there, and it talked about it with Mr. Trumka,  aren't there a number of provisions in this agreement with Mexico at least  that are good for American workers? </p><p>DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER U.S. CONGRESSWOMAN (D-MD): Well, I think there are  also a lot of Democrats who very much wanted to see a North American Free  Trade Agreement that really invests in workers, that makes sure that we  have protections across both borders. And I think you heard that from what  Mr. Trumka was saying. And I -- you know, I think it --</p><p>WALLACE: But raising -- but raising the wage to $16 an hour? </p><p>EDWARDS: Raising the wages. Exactly.</p><p>WALLACE: Raising the amount that has to be content from North America? </p><p>EDWARDS: Right. And all -- those are -- those are actually things that many  of us is Democrats have been calling for, for a long time because, you  know, we can have free trade, but if it's not fair on both sides of the  border, it really doesn't work. It doesn't keep workers here working and it  doesn't make sure that workers in Mexico are being paid what they need. And  I don't think you can have a North American Free Trade Agreement without  having the other part of North America, which is Canada, in the deal too. </p><p>WALLACE: Let me pick up on that with you, Marc Lotter, because talks with  Canada stalled on Friday over it seems to issues, one is continued dairy  protections inside Canada and, secondly, the publishing of off the record  comments by President Trump where he basically said, I'm not going to offer  any concessions at all to Canada. Does this deal go through? And -- and I'm  primarily, I guess, I'm talking about Congress, does this deal go through  without Canada onboard? </p><p>MARC LOTTER, FORMER PENCE PRESS SECRETARY: I think it makes it much easier  if Canada is on board to get it through Congress. But this is -- this is  very tough negotiating with the president and the prime minister and the  Canadian officials. The president is very clear, he wants to get this done.  He wants Canada to be involved. And it's going to be a question now of, can  they make enough concessions to make it fair on both sides? I think they  will. </p><p>WALLACE: Let's turn to another big story this week and that is President  Trump complaining that Google's search engine, when you put in \"President  Trump news,\" it has been calibrated to drown out conservative voices. The  president and his team this week complained about that and even talked  about regulating Google. </p><p>Here's the president. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I've made it clear that we,  as a country, cannot tolerate political censorship, blacklisting and rigged  search results. </p><p>We're not going to let them control what we can and cannot see, read, and  learn from. We can't do that. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Chuck, first of all, from the best of your knowledge, is there  political bias in the Google search? I mean is it calibrated to drown out  conservative voices and to push liberal points of view? And, secondly, what  do you make of the threat by the president that the government might get  involved in regulating Google? </p><p>CHARLES LANE, \"THE WASHINGTON POST\": Well, the best of my knowledge about  Google's algorithms is not very good. </p><p>WALLACE: Well, that's why I asked you. (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>LANE: But I -- I would be very surprised if somebody at Google said, let's  set up the algorithm to drown out Donald Trump in any specific sense like  that. I think these searches work in an incredibly complex ways that for  some unconscious or otherwise neutral reason may be turning up what  President Trump claims they're turning up. But, of course, it's just his  claim. </p><p>But there's a bigger context for this, which is, a lot of stuff going on at  Google, like a few months back an employee circulating a memo internally  claiming that the company isolates conservatives internally, then he winds  up on the outs. There's a movement within Google to decouple Google, so to  speak, from defense contracting and so forth. And I think the president's  pushing back against those things and he's more generally trying to turn  Google into just another part of this big, fake news media that has been  his big foil all through his political career. </p><p>You know, there's a lot of suspicion, both on the left and the right, in  sort of populist America about these giant technology companies. And I  think in that sense, he's just trying to turn them into another one of his  scapegoats to show like everything is stacked against us, even the search  engine. </p><p>WALLACE: Marc, your thoughts about whether the government should be  regulating a company like Google? Are their First Amendment issues there?  And if they were (ph) going to regulate Google in terms of its search  engine, they can do a number of things just to make life difficult for  Google. </p><p>MARC THIESSEN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: No doubt. And I -- look, I think the - - the fact that there -- there is conservative bias in social media. It's  not just Google. It's FaceBook. It's Twitter. There's been a lot of  accusations. They probably -- the only place where there's more anti- conservative bias than the legacy media is Silicon Valley. So, you know,  and the fact is, a lot of people getting their news from Silicon Valley in  a ways that they weren't a few years ago. But -- and so Trump is raising a  valid point. </p><p>Where he loses me is when he says that he wants the government to start  regulating it, because I -- the only institution I trust less than Google  to regulate my -- my search is the federal government. So I think what we  need is for people to be more proactive in terms of where they get their  news and how they -- they consume their news. </p><p>One of the -- the -- the avenue of social media has given conservatives an  incredible voice that they didn't have before because they didn't have to  go through \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times.\" So they have a  voice that they never had before. But we're also in these ideological silos  were conservatives only read conservative news sources. Liberals only read  -- Washington (ph) read liberal news sources. And I think we all need to do  a better job of policing ourselves and getting out of our silos and  listening to the other side because that's how we get over the division in  the country.</p><p>WALLACE: Congresswoman Edwards, I want to pick up on the last point that  Chuck made, and that is, isn't there a legitimate concern -- and on this  populist issue about companies, whether it's Google or FaceBook or Twitter  or Amazon, these huge companies that have so much power and so much money  and so much influence? </p><p>EDWARDS: Well, I mean, but the concern, I think, is really misplaced  because if you look at these entities, every time there, you know, is this  sort of massive growth in this industry, something else starts up that  becomes the next new thing. And we remember when Twitter was the next new  thing and Instagram the next new thing. And so I think that the dynamism  that's in the industry allows that to, you know, to create an environment  where, you know, you can have a lot of different kinds of voices in there.  And I think if anything is getting in the way of it in terms of the  government, I think it's saying, you know, this -- these decisions around  net neutrality because then that makes it even more difficult for  conservative or even, you know, far left views to get into the mainstream  if you're put on this secondary highway. </p><p>So -- but the idea that the government should have the -- the -- the  ability to figure out what the search engine is, I don't think so. I mean  most of the people I know in Congress can't even operate their Twitter  handle. </p><p>WALLACE: I am remaining silent in this conversation. I'm -- I'm a luddite,  which go to Google and look up what it means. </p><p>Thank you panel. See you next Sunday. </p><p>Up next, our \"Power Player of the Week,\" Dolly Parton on why kids around  the world call her \"the book lady.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WALLACE: Most of us know her as a legendary singer and songwriter, but as  we told you back in March, for millions of kids, she's the one who help  them start reading early. </p><p>Here is our \"Power Player of the Week.\" </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOLLY PARTON, FOUNDER, IMAGINATION LIBRARY: I just always thought there was  magic in books because it takes you to other places. Anywhere you want to  go, you can find it in a book. </p><p>It says Dolly Parton, that's my name. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): The Library of Congress is not the first place you'd  expect to see Dolly Parton, but there she was celebrating her love of  books. </p><p>PARTON (singing): In my Tennessee mountain home --</p><p>WALLACE: It's a story that begins back when she was growing up, one of 12  children, in the Smoky Mountains of east Tennessee, the daughter of Robert  Lee Parton. </p><p>PARTON: Daddy never had a chance to go to school. And daddy couldn't read  nor write, but he was really a smart person enough and wondered what all he  might have done had he had an education. </p><p>WALLACE: Fast-forward to 1995, when the country music star decided to start  the Imagination Library, to give free books to children in her hometown. </p><p>Over the years, the program has spread across the country and overseas. A  book every month to kids who sign up from birth until they turn five and go  to kindergarten. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to a child to get their own book  mailed to them in their own name? </p><p>PARTON: It makes them feel important. It makes them feel special. So, of  course, it makes them want to do what the book is all about, learn to read  it. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Local communities pay for the books, but Dolly's  group pays for sending out more than a million a month, which she helps  cover through her companies and concerts and even a children's album. </p><p>PARTON (singing): I am a rainbow.</p><p>PARTON: Oh, millions of dollars, I'm sure. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): And it's that important to you? </p><p>PARTON: Oh, it's very important, because it's my charity. Although there  are many things that I do, this is the one that's nearest and dearest to my  heart. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Dolly has been performing for more than 60 years.  She's won eight Grammy's and is in the Country Music Hall of Fame. But she  shows no sign at all of slowing down. </p><p>PARTON: My music is everything to me. It's my gift. It's my joy. It's my  job. And it's just something that I love to do. And I never think about  that I should quit it. </p><p>WALLACE: Which brings us back to the Imagination Library. </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): Though I understand that you have gotten a nickname  from this program. </p><p>PARTON: I'm the book lady. Who knew?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We are so honored that the hundred millionth book -- </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): So there was Dolly with the librarian of Congress  donating the 100 millionth book, unveiling a copy of her own \"Coat of Many  Colors,\" based on the coat her mother made for her out of scraps of cloth. </p><p>PARTON: Maybe we'll be back for our billionth book one of these days. </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: All right.</p><p>PARTON: Wouldn't that be nice! </p><p>WALLACE (on camera): What does it mean to you, Library of Congress? </p><p>PARTON: I know. Here I am. A little old country girl from the Smoky  Mountains of east Tennessee. Now one of my little books about my mom and a  story about my dad is going to be here forever in the Library of Congress. </p><p>WALLACE (voice over): Dolly even gave us a little concert about the coat  and her family and what led her to share her dream with so many children. </p><p>PARTON (singing): In my coat of many colors that my mama made for me, made  only from rags but I wore it so proudly. And although we had no money, I  was rich as I could be, in my coat of many colors mama made for me, because  she made it just for me. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WALLACE: Dolly's Imagination Library now teams up with the Library of  Congress for a special story time for kids, the last Friday of each month  streaming online. </p><p>And speaking of kids, I want to introduce you to a special one. Jack Henry  Wallace, who was born on Friday, 8 pounds 6 ounces. Jack will make his  television debut in December as part of our annual Christmas greeting from  now the six Wallace grandkids. Jack, his mom and dad, and, yes, his proud  grandpa are all doing well. </p><p>And that's it for today.

That's the latest model that the CDC is projecting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We continue to see a downward trend, though, in the rate of new cases nationwide. More than half of the states are now seeing declines, even as much of the country moves to reopen. However, fears of a second wave are persistent, and they are real.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Also tonight, the Trump administration is making very ambitious claims that a vaccine will be available to the public by the end of the year, the president sending mixed messages about that potential breakthrough, declaring the country is coming back -- and I'm quoting the president right now -- \"vaccine or no vaccine.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Let's get some more from our chief White House correspondent Jim, Acosta.</p><p>Jim, a very disturbing new forecast of deaths. We just heard it from the CDC director.</p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Wolf.</p><p>And Dr. Robert Redfield, you just mentioned, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, just tweeted this out, that his agency is expecting 100,000 deaths, a total of 100,000 deaths by June 1.</p><p>Here's this tweet. We can put it up on screen.</p><p>It says: \"CDC tracks 12 different forecasting models of possible COVID-19 deaths in the U.S. as of May 11. All forecast an increase in deaths in the coming weeks and a cumulative total exceeding 100,000 by June 1.\"</p><p>Now, earlier in the day, President Trump sent some conflicting signals on the development of a coronavirus vaccine, a sorely needed vaccine. As the president other Trump administration officials were touting a warp speed effort to have a vaccine ready by the end of the year, Mr. Trump also said he wants to reopen the country with or without one. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ACOSTA (voice-over): As President Trump introduced the two men who will lead the government's race for a coronavirus vaccine, he made one thing clear: He's ready to reopen the country even without a medical breakthrough.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I just want to make something clear. It's very important. Vaccine or no vaccine, we're back, and we're starting the process.</p><p>ACOSTA: Still, one of the two leaders of what's being called Operation Warp Speed, Moncef Slaoui, said he's optimistic the U.S. could have hundreds of millions of doses of the vaccine ready by the end of the year.</p><p>MONCEF SLAOUI, CHIEF ADVISER TO VACCINE EFFORT: I have very recently seen early data from a clinical trial with a coronavirus vaccine. And this data made me feel even more confident that we will be able to deliver a few hundred million doses of vaccine by the end of 2020. And we will do the best we can.</p><p>ACOSTA: That's an ambitious timeline, and many health experts aren't so sure it's achievable.</p><p>Coronavirus Task Force doctor Anthony Fauci is hopeful the government can meet that goal, but cautions Americans should be realistic.</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: There's no guarantee that the vaccine is actually going to be effective. You can have everything you think that's in place, and you don't induce the kind of immune response that turns out to be protective and durably protective.</p><p>Given the way the body responds to viruses of this type, I'm cautiously optimistic that we will, with one of the candidates, get an efficacy signal.</p><p>ACOSTA: At his own Rose Garden event, Mr. Trump appeared at times to downplay the importance of a vaccine.</p><p>TRUMP: Other things have never had a vaccine and they go away. So I don't want people to think that this is all dependent on a vaccine. But a vaccine would be a tremendous thing.</p><p>ACOSTA: The president also speculated that many Americans may already be immune to the virus, even though the scientific community isn't certain of that.</p><p>TRUMP: The vast majority, many people don't even know they have it. They have it or they have sniffles or they have a very minor sign. And they recover, not only recover. They probably have immunity, whether it's short term, long term, but they have probably immunity.</p><p>ACOSTA: Mr. Trump's comments came one day after he questioned the helpfulness of testing. TRUMP: It could be that testing is, frankly, overrated. Maybe it is overrated. When you test, you have a case. When you test, you find something is wrong with people. If we didn't do any testing, we would have very few cases. They don't want to write that. It's common sense.</p><p>ACOSTA: The president returned to his argument that schools should reopen in the fall, but without older teachers. Mr. Trump didn't sound concerned students could bring the virus home to their families.</p><p>TRUMP: I don't think that you should have 70-year-old teachers back yet. They should wait until everything is gone. I don't think you should have a professor that is 65 and has diabetes or has a bad heart back, necessarily, or somebody that's older than that.</p><p>But we want to see our schools back. We want to see our country start to work again.</p><p>ACOSTA: Fauci warned earlier this week, that is risky.</p><p>FAUCI: I think we have got to be careful if we are not cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects.</p><p>ACOSTA: As for a vaccine, the president said he would be willing to accept one from China, even as he's been warning of halting trade talks with Beijing.</p><p>QUESTION: What happens if it's China? Will the U.S. still have access to that vaccine?</p><p>TRUMP: I would say the answer to that would be yes.</p><p>[18:05:00]</p><p>ACOSTA: The president was touting other potential advances, like a new high-speed missile for Mr. Trump's pet project, the Space Force.</p><p>TRUMP: I call it the super-duper missile. Space is going to be -- it's going to be the future. We're now the leader in space.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ACOSTA: Now, in case people were wondering what all of that noise was, that low roar during the news conference earlier today, those were truckers, truck drivers in Washington, honking their horns and protesting that their industry is being hammered during this pandemic.</p><p>We can show you some video of these truckers down on Constitution Avenue in Washington, D.C. The president said the truckers were demonstrating in some kind of show of support for him. But that's not true. They were protesting on behalf of their industry.</p><p>Now, as for Vice President Mike Pence, he was not at the Rose Garden news conference earlier today. Officials say he is steering clear of some White House events, out of an abundance of caution, but that he is healthy, will be more visible next week. The vice president is, of course, taking those precautions after his press secretary tested positive for the virus last week -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: Interesting. All right, thanks very much, Jim Acosta, reporting.</p><p>As the total number of deaths in the United States keeps rising, more and more states are reopening, at least partially.</p><p>Let's go to CNN's Nick Watt. He is joining us from California.</p><p>Nick, nearly every state will be in some phase of reopening by this weekend.</p><p>NICK WATT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Wolf.</p><p>Just two states still yet to start. One of them is Massachusetts. And we just heard that they're going to lay out their plan for us on Monday. Meanwhile, so many businesses around this country just trying to make it work.</p><p>This is Milo &amp; Olive, a spot near where I live. And the sign on the door doesn't say \"Welcome\" anymore. It says \"Do not come in.\" And they have been serving takeout all day through that tiny window.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WATT (voice-over): Across Louisiana, dinner and a movie is now an option once more, but your server might be masked.</p><p>COLLIN ARNOLD, DIRECTOR, NEW ORLEANS OFFICE OF HOMELAND SECURITY AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS: We really have kind of crushed the curve, and because -- it's due to our residents, really. They stayed at home.</p><p>WATT: Forty-eight states now have an opening plan under way. Today, half of New York state begins is long road back.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: All I can do is get back to work and hope that they'll come.</p><p>WATT: Beaches in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut will, we're told, be open in time for Memorial Day.</p><p>But New York's pause order extended another two weeks for millions in the state, including everyone in New York City, unless numbers improve.</p><p>MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO (D-NY), NEW YORK CITY: We need a massive citywide apparatus, testing, tracing.</p><p>WATT: Meanwhile, in Michigan, resistance to regulations goes on. The blue governor says they're red protesters.</p><p>GOV. GRETCHEN WHITMER (D-MI): These are not just citizens who are unhappy about having to stay home. This is a political rally, essentially. WATT: That might actually delay reopening.</p><p>WHITMER: It's the congregating of big groups of people who aren't wearing masks, who aren't staying six feet apart that will perpetuate the community spread.</p><p>WATT: And April's retail numbers are out, another historic low, retail sales down 16.4 percent, clothing sales down nearly 90 percent.</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF TRADE AND MANUFACTURING POLICY: Most of the 50 states are going back to work in some form. So I like to look forward.</p><p>WATT: Ford will start making cars again Monday, and restaurants will reopen in hard-hit Miami as the county looks to hire up to 1,000 contact tracers.</p><p>Texas just set a record, most recorded COVID deaths in 24 hours, gyms and offices still scheduled to reopen Monday.</p><p>In North Carolina, big box stores can reopen, but church gatherings still limited to just 10 people.</p><p>KEITH STONE, NASH COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA, SHERIFF: I have not enforced it, and I don't intend to enforce it.</p><p>WATT: Other sheriffs say the same.</p><p>STONE: And I would rather you turn towards the lord than the liquor store.</p><p>WATT: Meanwhile, in Sin City, now you can buy a mask from a vending machine at the airport, as Caesars gets ready to reopen.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: In the new world, there will only be three chairs and nobody will be able to be within six feet.</p><p>WATT: Good news from L.A. The USNS Mercy hospital ship just left, after seven weeks supporting the COVID-19 fight. The curve here has flattened.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WATT: So, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Connecticut will be opening their beaches, but New York City will not.</p><p>And we heard why from the mayor. He explained, listen, in New Jersey, people drive cars. They can spread out along the shore, along the coastline. Not so in New York. People don't drive so much, and maybe we would get a big crush at Coney Island -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: All right, very interesting, indeed, Nick Watt reporting for us. Thank you.</p><p>Joining us now, the governor of Washington state, Jay Inslee.</p><p>Governor Inslee, thank you so much for spending a few moments with us.</p><p>GOV. JAY INSLEE (D-WA): Thank you.</p><p>BLITZER: You just heard the news.</p><p>The CDC director, Robert Redfield, now says all the models that they're tracking predict that 100,000 Americans will be dead from the virus over by June 1. That's in two weeks, by June 1. That's a staggering number, given the fact the first deaths were recorded, what, in early March.</p><p>[18:10:02]</p><p>So, over three months, he now says more than 100,000 Americans will have died from coronavirus.</p><p>When you hear that, what's your reaction?</p><p>INSLEE: Well, my actual reaction is, it's a number, but the number -- we should never allow that number to camouflage the personal tragedies.</p><p>That's a number, but each one of these digits represents a family that's had a horrific loss. And I actually think that's important to pause on occasion and think about.</p><p>As we're making hard decisions about the pace of reopening our society, I think it's appropriate to think about, those are real people and read some of the stories. I read the stories every morning to be in touch with the real losses that these families are having, because, if you aren't aware of that, you can make some really bad decisions, instead of having our communities walk down the mountain, to force us to jump off the cliff.</p><p>And we are not going to jump off the cliff in Washington. We have had very good success flattening the curve. But we realize the science is, is, if we did jump off the cliff, as the president has argued for, we would just have a very, very rapid exponential growth of this very, very infectious disease.</p><p>And we're not going to do that. We're going to make -- continue to make smart decisions.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes, right now, more than 87,000 Americans have died over these past several weeks, 87,000.</p><p>But the CDC director says that number will go over 100,000 by June 1. And you're absolutely right. They're not just numbers. These are real people. They are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters. And we always express our deepest, deepest condolences. And we honor many of them here in THE SITUATION ROOM every day.</p><p>The president also says, Governor, that, vaccine or no vaccine, we're back. That's a quote from him earlier in the day.</p><p>Twenty-eight states are seeing a downward trend in cases. But does that rhetoric match the scale of the challenge that's still facing this country?</p><p>INSLEE: Heavens no.</p><p>And if the president is saying, we're back to speak, in the past tense, to think this is behind us is to wholly ignore the biological evidence, the epidemiological evidence, the clear biology.</p><p>And we just ought to follow science. And the science is very clear. Today, I had one of a series of briefings by the Institute of Disease Modeling. And they and virtually every other modeler who have looked at this said, if you do think of this as being a past problem that has been solved, this thing's going to come roaring back.</p><p>All of the epidemiological models show that, if you go back to the number of physical and social interactions that we typically would have, that is just going to go up, and very quickly -- and this is a hard thing to contemplate, because we have had some early success -- we would get back to the rate of fatalities and growth in the rate of fatalities just as desperate and fatal and the kind of thing we saw in New York.</p><p>We could be right back into that soup. And that's just a reality. So, we can't make decisions based on wishful thinking or refusal to worry about your approval numbers, or worrying about whether a cruise ship docks because it'll show the numbers will go up and make you look bad.</p><p>We can't allow our decision-making to be influenced. That is another virus, which is the virus of self-interest and wishful thinking. And I think you're seeing a lot of good decision-making by governors, Republican and Democrats, to do this in a phased basis, where we can take an incremental approach and innovate as we go along, as we find out what really works, what kind of measures really do work, and which do not.</p><p>So, that's the approach we're taking. And I think we're on the right track here in our state, and many other governors as well.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes, that model from the University of Washington Medical School that is often cited by the Coronavirus Task Force over at the White House projects, by August 4, 147,000 Americans will have died from coronavirus.</p><p>And now the CDC says, by June 1, 100,000-plus will have died.</p><p>The president says he expects we will have a vaccine before the end of this year, Governor. You heard him say that earlier today. Does it worry you to see him set such potentially very optimistic expectations?</p><p>INSLEE: Well, I don't think there's anything wrong with optimism or hope.</p><p>I think it would be a wonderment if we did have a vaccine by the end of the year. And there's nothing wrong with that, unless it blinds you to today's responsibilities and today's necessities. And I'm afraid, with the president, it might have, because we have a desperate need to increase our testing capability. It requires the president to use the Defensive Production Act and help the states.</p><p>[18:15:03]</p><p>All the states have been very active trying to get this material on our own. And we're still so far behind the eight ball to get testing material. We're still working to try to get our nursing home facilities tested. We now have outbreaks in food production facilities, where it's difficult to get everyone tested.</p><p>And yet, when we were promised our May delivery for test swabs, we have only got 10 percent of them. And it's mid-May. And I got a call yesterday that a shipment of over 150,000 got delayed or lost somewhere. And they said they will try to make it up next month.</p><p>We are experiencing these failures of the federal government to help the states on this testing. And so, if the reason for that is not having enough commitment to getting this job done because you have this desire that, around -- we will get a Christmas president in December of a vaccine, that would be injurious.</p><p>And we have so much need to act so much more quickly on testing equipment and PPE, which is continuing to bedevil us.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes.</p><p>Do you expect, Governor, to let your stay-at-home order in Washington state expire at the end of the month and move into your phase two of reopening?</p><p>INSLEE: We would like to, but that is not a certainty. It's not written in concrete. We will have to look at the virus.</p><p>We have at least a dozen metrics we look at on a daily basis. Like I said, we have had some progress. We have had massive compliance of Washingtonians. And the real reason we have been successful in Washington is because Washingtonians get it.</p><p>We act on the science. We act with common sense. And we act together. And so, so far, that has -- holds us in good stead. So, we will have to let the virus play out to see what we can do come June.</p><p>There will be restrictions, we know, through June of a variety of measures. And we're going to do smart things to open up some businesses. I did talk to some businesses yesterday, auto dealers, some construction. We have been able to open up some of our businesses, because we have used really strong protocols to keep people safe.</p><p>And we're going to continue to do that.</p><p>BLITZER: Well, good luck, Governor Inslee. Good luck to everybody in Washington state.</p><p>INSLEE: Thank you.</p><p>BLITZER: I know these are really tough, difficult, difficult days for everyone.</p><p>Just ahead...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>INSLEE: Wash your hands.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes, OK. Thank you.</p><p>Is President Trump raising false hopes for a coronavirus vaccine by the end of this year? Our experts are standing by.</p><p>And we will also have more on that staggering number, 100,000 deaths now forecast in the United States by June 1.</p><p>[18:22:03]</p><p>BLITZER: A new warning tonight that the U.S. death toll is now forecast to increase significantly over the next couple of weeks.</p><p>The CDC director, Dr. Robert Redfield, now releasing a new estimate of 100,000 deaths here in the United States by June 1.</p><p>Let's bring back our chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta, along with Dr. Ashish Jha, the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.</p><p>Sanjay, you know Dr. Robert Redfield. He says, all the models they're tracking at the CDC have now converged to predict that the death toll will reach 100,000 Americans by June 1. These are mothers and fathers, as I say, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters, not just numbers. These are real people.</p><p>But how do we wrap our heads around this enormous loss of life since early March?</p><p>DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CHIEF MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: It gives me a pit in my stomach, Wolf, when I saw those modeling numbers come out.</p><p>And you're absolutely right. I mean, how do you wrap your head around it? I don't know. I mean, I think, as somebody who works in a hospital and has seen these patients, it's -- I think it's -- I have known patients who become sick. And, sadly, I have known people who've died of this disease.</p><p>And I think, for people, a lot of people out there, they still hear these numbers, and they're just numbers to them. They don't -- they have not been directly affected by this. They don't know anybody who has this disease.</p><p>So, I mean, but these are jarring numbers, Wolf. When the pause -- the first pause went into effect for the country back in the middle of March, some 80 people had died. And now we're talking about 100,000 by the end of this month.</p><p>It's just -- I -- it's terrible. I don't know how else to describe it, Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: Well, what about that, Dr. Jha?</p><p>What does that say about how much more that death toll potentially could rise, considering we know this virus isn't going away, and could even get worse later this year in the fall and winter?</p><p>DR. ASHISH JHA, DIRECTOR, HARVARD GLOBAL HEALTH INSTITUTE: yes, Wolf. So thanks for having me on.</p><p>The 100,000 number, as Dr. Gupta said, is stunning and catastrophic in many ways, and tells us how deadly this virus is. And this is 100,000 after we shut the country down for nearly two months, so really a reminder that, if we had not acted, things would have surely been much, much worse.</p><p>It's also reminder that we have got to get ready. We have got to get ready for the fall, when there's going to be a second wave. Most analysts are predicting a much bigger second wave. I think we can get through it without all of these tests, but we have a lot of work to do to get ready for the fall, and really be prepared for what's coming.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes, we certainly do.</p><p>Sanjay, the president is projecting that we could have a real vaccine before the end of this year. Do you worry that that statement from the president could give people false hope?</p><p>GUPTA: I think hope is important, Wolf.</p><p>But I think honesty and hope are always a balance, but I think honesty has got to be in the first position here. I think hope is good, as long as it's channeled and it's strategic and it moves us forward.</p><p>[18:25:05]</p><p>But it is -- it is very audacious, and it doesn't fit, to be honest, with what a lot of other public health officials that we have been doing stories with are talking about in terms of the timeline.</p><p>I mean, you have to have a vaccine. They're going to do things try and manufacture this vaccine earlier, plan distribution channels earlier. They're going to make some gambles and start manufacturing vaccines that haven't even been approved yet.</p><p>But you have got to show that it's a safe and effective vaccine. If, in the end, -- I mean, false hope is obviously terrible. But having a vaccine that doesn't actually work, despite pinning all of our hopes on it, that would be tragic.</p><p>So, I want this as much as anybody else, but we -- I'm not sure. That timeline does seem very audacious, still.</p><p>BLITZER: Well, Dr. Jha, what do you make of that timeline that was put out by the president today?</p><p>JHA: Yes, so it's worth for people to remember that it typically takes us many years to build a vaccine.</p><p>So, the 12 to-18-month timeline line that we have all been hoping for was already quite aggressive. If we shorten that further, like, I -- I'm with Dr. Gupta. Like, it would be great if we had a vaccine by the end of this year. That would be wonderful.</p><p>But we have to make sure it's safe and it's effective. And the more corners we cut to get there, the more we're going to worry about the safety of the vaccine, and as well as its effectiveness.</p><p>So I would rather take an extra couple of months, if we need to, to really ensure that the vaccine is safe. My best guess is, it's going to be sometime in 2021.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes. People are going to have to have confidence that there's not some complications from that vaccine. They're going to want to go out and be assured that it's OK.</p><p>All right, guys, thank you. Thank you so much for joining us, Dr. Ashish Jha and Dr. Sanjay Gupta.</p><p>Just ahead: Millions of people in New York state will have to stay at home longer. We will have more on that.</p><p>We will also talk to the mayor of Houston about the biggest one-day death toll in Texas since the start of the pandemic.</p><p>There you see him.</p><p>We will be right back.</p><p>[18:30:00]</p><p>BLITZER: We are following breaking news this hour. The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Robert Redfield, has just issued a new forecast of 100,000 coronavirus deaths here in the United States by June 1st. This come as most state are starting to reopen, the summer moving very, very cautiously tonight.</p><p>CNN's Shimon Prokupecz, is joining us from New York City, right now. Shimon, millions in New York are being told they'll have to stay home for, what, at least another two weeks, is that what is going on?</p><p>SHIMON PROKUPECZ, CNN CRIME AND JUSTICE REPORTER: Yes. The governor today, in parts of the state -- we know some parts of the state have opened. They were open today. New York pause was set to expire today. The governor announcing that they're going to extend that now until at least May 28. And, of course, the whole thing here, as you say the summer is coming. Beaches in New York City are not going to be open. But across New York state, outside New York City, you could see some beaches open. And of course, New Jersey, Wolf, a lot of people getting ready for the summer, for their kids with no camps. They're going to need things to do, and beaches is perhaps one of the things the city here just not ready to do that. There still too many people, it's still too crowded and, of course, there are still a lot of concern that infection here, while it's going down and we're on the good side of the mountain, at some point, once people start coming out and going to beaches and getting on trains to get on the beaches, you could start to see the number of cases rise.</p><p>And that is what the mayor certainly doesn't want and of course the governor, which is why he is being so careful in doing these openings in these phases. We're still in phase one across some of the parts of the state. New York City, of course, still closed. We still have a ways to go before any decisions on opening the city are made, Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: All right, Shimon, thank you very much. Shimon Prokupecz, in New York.</p><p>This just in, the NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell, just told teams they can reopen they're facilities on May 19th if they follow state guidelines as well as league guidelines spelled in his letter.</p><p>Texas is home to NFL football teams, including the Houston Texans. We're joined now by the mayor of the Houston, Sylvester Turner. Mayor Turner, thank you so much for joining us. Do you feel that Houston is ready for a step like this, making a step closer to eventually holding major sporting events in your city?</p><p>MAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER (D-TX), HOUSTON: Well, you know, Wolf, I would love to see the Texans play and with the fans in the stands but we're not at that point yet. A lot is going to depend on what the data says, what the medical professionals are saying and whether or not we see spikes with the states starting to reopen. So let's just take a very cautious approach, take it one step at a time. But right now we're still seeing people testing positive for COVID-19 and we're still seeing people dying in our state. So we just need to be very careful.</p><p>BLITZER: That's smart. You know, Texas, as you well know, Mayor, saw its largest number of reported deaths yesterday, more than 1,200. Is this the result of opening up too early?</p><p>TURNER: Well, I can't directly say it's the result of. We've been in this phase now for about two weeks. We started on May the 1st. I will say that there still too many people that are dying in our state.</p><p>[18:35:01]</p><p>In the City of Houston, Wolf, three weeks ago, we had about 30 people who had died. As of today that number is now at 114, where 26 of that 114 coming from nursing homes.</p><p>So I want to see that number go down, even though it's relatively low, when you look at other places across the country, but they still were heading in the wrong direction. And that's why we just have to be very, very careful and safe as we start to reopen. I think the numbers, when we take a look at the numbers over the next week or two, I think those numbers will be instructive for us.</p><p>BLITZER: Yes, I just want to be precise of the number of the number of your cases yesterday, going up more than 1200, but there are still a considerable number of deaths as well. As you know, Mayor, the Houston Independent School District is says, it's considering year-round remote classes. Can you get behind that proposal about 35 percent of the student in the district don't necessarily have internet access?</p><p>TURNER: Well, and that's something that we're having to work on right now. It is -- we just had that discussion on yesterday about how to increase digital access to make sure that our kids get everything that they need. That's the other reason why, Wolf, it's so important for us to be careful and methodical on how we open up. If we manage the virus right, if we don't rush and open up too soon, then I think we can -- when we start looking at August, September, it might be a possibility of kids returning to campus.</p><p>But if we handle it wrong on the front end, it's going to prolong things in the long-term. And that's why what we do right now, can be -- will have a direct impact on what happens four, five, six months from now. I would love to see the kids back on campus. I grew up in one of these underserved and under-resourced communities. I still live in one of these under-served, under-resourced community. And many of our kids need that personal contact instruction, teachers right there in front of them, don't have access in many of these communities. But if we handle the management of this virus poorly, those kids, those communities are the ones that's going to be disproportionately impacted.</p><p>BLITZER: Mayor Turner, good luck to you, good luck to everyone in Houston. We'll stay in very close touch. I appreciate you joining us.</p><p>TURNER: Thanks, Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: And just ahead, the question on the minds of so many students and their parents, will schools actually reopen in the fall?</p><p>And you may be allowed to eat inside the McDonald's very soon, but it won't necessarily look or feel the same.</p><p>[18:40:00]</p><p>BLITZER: The students waiting to hear if their schools will resume in person classes. Some colleges are already making the decisions to keep campuses closed for the fall semester.</p><p>Let's bring in Scott Galloway, Professor of Marketing at the NYU Stern School of Business. He featured in the new article in New York Magazine, Looking How the Pandemic May Reshape Higher Education. Professor Galloway, thank you so much for joining us. You're predicting a higher education will be dramatically different because of this pandemic in the immediate future. What changes do you expect to see in college registration, for example?</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, MARKETING PROFESSOR, NYU STEM SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: We're going to see incredible demand structure (ph). If you look at the industries that have been hit hardest, they all have one thing in common, and that is they put people shoulder to shoulder, whether it's restaurants, or live events, or movie theaters. And who else does that? Universities.</p><p>So we're probably going to see some, if not, the majority of universities unless there's a vaccine not reopen for the typical on campus experience in the fall. And we may see hundreds never reopen, because they just don't have the endowments or the financial cushions to survive a kind of a dramatic revenue loss we're looking at.</p><p>So just as equity analysts are looking at how much cash is on the balance sheet of companies to see who might be most vulnerable, we're going to start pretty soon talking about who has the endowments to survive this pandemic.</p><p>BLITZER: You told New York Magazine that this change in the moment could pave the way for what, big tech companies like Facebook, or Google, or Apple, to partnership with elite universities. What would these partnerships look like?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, I think the best universities, the best brands in the world aren't Apple or Coca-Cola, or MIT and Stanford. Nobody pays Apple a $100 million to put their names on the side of the building of the Apple campus, but I think these larger universities will be able to welcome 3, 5, 10 maybe in 20 thousand people to campus to capture some of those or recapture some of those students in those margin dollars. And the partners I believe that will help them get there will be small and big tech, whether it's Google or whether it's Zoom or whether it's Slack.</p><p>So you could end up in the situation where you have big tech entering, what is probably the most disruptible business in the world right now other than healthcare, where tuition has exploded 15-fold in the last 40 years. I mean, when you look at big tech going game hunting (ph) for how they increase their top line to justify their incredible market capitalizations, they'll immediately zero in on two industries, health care and education.</p><p>So it's just likely we're going to see a warm embrace between big tech looking for high margin, large revenue businesses, they're awry (ph) for disruption, which is education.</p><p>[18:45:12]</p><p>And education institutions which aren't known for having fantastic technology who need to dramatically expand their enrollment from some sort of a mixed of a hybrid remote offering.</p><p>So, I think this is a marriage made in a pandemic, if you will, between big tech and a better university.</p><p>BLITZER: Should universities, Professor, be offering any type of tuition reimbursement for in-person classes that are now taking place online.</p><p>GALLOWAY: There is already 25 lawsuits from students asking for some sort of tuition remission from what they fell was a spring semester that did not deliver again just what was promised. I probably met with or have spoken to ten advisory boards of different universities all over the nation. And one thing they are not discussing is a reduction in price.</p><p>So whether they want to give some sort of rebates, they are going to market, the market is going to force them to lower their prices, whether it's to increase financial aid or grants, or simply lowering their price.</p><p>But you're going to have kind of a high, low if you will. You are going to have the top tier universities, sort of the Tiffany, if you will, will be just fine, and the value oriented -- California State will be fine. It only charges $7,000 and $19,000 for in state and out of state tuition. And the I-Campus experience was never a big part of that experience in the low price point.</p><p>But all the guys in the middle, the JCPenneys and the Sears, if you will, who charge $55,000 for a nice leafy on campus liberal arts experience without a great brand, they probably go away.</p><p>BLITZER: What a change that will be.</p><p>All right, Scott Galloway, Professor, thank you so much for joining us. We'll continue this conversation with you down the road. Appreciate it very much.</p><p>Just ahead, states loosen stay-at-home orders. We're going to tell you how McDonald's is preparing to open dining rooms, and how they will drastically look different.</p><p>[18:51:29]</p><p>BLITZER: As states ease stay-at-home orders, dining at McDonald's will soon be vastly different. The fast food giant outlining its plan to serve customers safely inside its restaurants.</p><p>CNN's Brian Todd has the details.</p><p>Brian, what are you learning?</p><p>BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Wolf, it's a bold move by McDonald's all the way around. Tonight, despite extensive new safety measures planned by McDonald's, health experts are concerned it's way too early and may carry way too much risk.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) TODD (voice-over): Tonight, McDonald's is planning to reopen its restaurants for people to dine in -- a bold step for America's oldest fast food icon. The McDonald's experience may never look the same again.</p><p>Some tables will be closed. A table will be sanitized after each customers use. The bathrooms cleaned every 30 minutes.</p><p>And you won't be able to tap your drink from those famous self-serve beverage fountains with the free refills, an employee will port for you. Experts say these days, even that simple tap and pour fountain is a risk.</p><p>PROF. ANNE RIMOIN, EPIDEMIOLOGIST, UCLA SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH: You are stepping over people, you are topping talking in line, that's a problem. Also, any area where you are going to have multiple people touching something is problematic.</p><p>TODD: The McDonald's reopening playbook, a nearly 60-page document obtained by CNN, also says, employees have to wash their hands every hour. Touch screen pay kiosks have to be cleaned after each use. Other restaurants opening for dining in our taking additional creative measures, like the federal American Grill in Houston.</p><p>MATT BRICE, OWNER-OPERATOR, FEDERAL AMERICAN GRILL: Disposable men use, masks, gloves, we have different color linens on our tables. So if it has a black linen on it right now, that we're not seating it.</p><p>TODD: McDonald's internal guidelines first reported by \"The Wall Street Journal\", don't say that every McDonald's restaurant has to reopen for dining in services right away. Each franchise operator gets to make that call as they weigh the reopening guidelines of their local governments. But public health experts say, all restaurants in America are getting ready to throw open their doors have to think about even more stepped up measures, like what one expert says restaurants he went to in Hong Kong did recently, where servers gave how to instructions for customers.</p><p>GAVIN MACGREGOR-SKINNER, DIRECTOR OF TRAINING, GLOBAL BIORISK ADVISORY COUNCIL: Every time I went to a restaurant, they would take my temperature for me. When I sat down, they would explain, here is the knife, fork and spoon that is used to pick up the food, this is the separate knife fork and spoon that is going to be used to put the food in your mouth.</p><p>Even with all the safety measures McDonald's is taking, some health experts are not comfortable with reopenings at this stage of the pandemic.</p><p>RIMOIN: We know that current transition is spread through small droplets, and so it makes it very difficult to be bringing people into small, enclosed spaces, like a McDonald's restaurant, and to be able to say to people it's OK to eat, to take your mask off, top.</p><p>DR. CELINE GOUNDER, INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST, NYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE: Who is going to enforce? This and how do you enforce that employees adhere to this, how do you make sure that they are indeed sanitizing surfaces, tabletops, bathrooms, as often as outlined in his plan?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TODD: Then there is the matter of McDonald's employees having to enforce healthy behaviors on the part of customers. The new playbook instructs employees how to gently tell customers to distance and stay clean, but that can be dangerous. One woman in Oklahoma was arrested recently on suspicion of shooting a McDonald's employee when she was asked to leave a restaurant, because of coronavirus restrictions -- Wolf.</p><p>BLITZER: All right, Brian. Thank you very much.</p><p>We'll have much more news right after this.</p><p>[18:59:26]</p><p>BLITZER: Finally, tonight, we have more finally tonight we have more personal stories of Americans who have died from coronavirus.</p><p>Bill Mantell of New York was 68 years old. He ran a pharmacy for 31 years, with a community hit hard by the pandemic. He insisted on keeping it open for customers to get their medication. His wife and two daughters say he was selfless.</p><p>Varsenik Morse of Michigan was 93. \"Vi\" as she was known leaves behind nine children, 37 grandchildren and 51 great grandchildren, and one great great grandchild. She loved bowling and playing slots at the casino.</p><p>May they all rest in peace and may their memories be a blessing.</p><p>\"ERIN BURNETT OUTFRONT\" starts right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2020051502CNV16</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YX8-6K41-JB20-G24R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6542\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 15, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL &amp;

He is likely to have two main areas of focus: culture and costs.</p><p>Based on McEwan's approach at Royal Bank of Scotland, it's a fair bet that a good chunk of his early months will be spent on the road, working on the former.</p><p>Perhaps because of the depths of problems at RBS and the intense public scrutiny of the bank - it is, after all, still two-thirds owned by the British taxpayer following a GFC bailout - McEwan is seen to have personally led the rebuilding of the bank's culture.</p><p>This experience will be crucial as he steers NAB through its cultural rebuild after the royal commission. For example, when he was appointed in July, McEwan said he was particularly proud of an indicator in the most recent RBS employee survey that showed staff had never felt safer to speak up.</p><p>That shift took five years to come through and no doubt he'll be hoping for a speedier response at NAB. But the example emphasises why McEwan will put culture near the top of his priority list.</p><p>The second big priority for investors will be around costs. Under the three-year transformation plan announced by McEwan's predecessor Andrew Thorburn in November 2017, NAB is aiming to cut $1 billion in costs, slash product numbers in half, cut IT applications by between 15 and 20 per cent and remove 4000 net jobs by the end of the 2020 financial year.</p><p>The bank has made good progress - as recently as NAB's June quarter trading update, we saw expenses had been held flat - and McEwan will no doubt be keen to finish the job. But the market will be looking for what's next.</p><p>In November 2017, Thorburn and chairman Ken Henry set the bank a long-term target of getting its cost-to-income ratio towards 35 per cent; on JP Morgan's numbers it will sit at 46.6 per cent as of September 30, falling to 43.3 per cent at the same time in 2020.</p><p>And while it is true that NAB's target was set before the royal commission unleashed a barrage of new risk and compliance costs, the market will want to see whether McEwan and Chronican re-endorse the aspirational goal.</p><p>Getting towards a 35 per cent cost-to-income ratio would require some very hard and probably unpopular decisions. Slashing branch numbers - something McEwan has been prepared to do at RBS - would be an example.</p><p>The other question is what McEwan's leadership team will look like as he tackles culture and costs. Banking sector history says changes are inevitable in this area.</p><p>Competition calls</p><p>confound bankers</p><p>It's not often you get the two ends of the Australian banking sector singing from the same hymnsheet on the issue of competition.</p><p>But when the spectre of a new inquiry into the industry by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) was raised last week, the symmetry was quite remarkable.</p><p>Behind the scenes, one big four chief executive and one regional bank chief executive used almost the same words to make two key points.</p><p>First, yet another inquiry is the last thing the sector needs. And second, the issue to be focused on isn't the quantity of competitors in the market, but the quality of competition.</p><p>Now, it's still not exactly clear what the ACCC wants to look at next, what form its next inquiry into the market will take, and when it will occur. Any big bang inquiry, such as the ACCC's examination of the mortgage pricing that was ordered by then-treasurer Scott Morrison in May 2017 and which delivered its final report in December, will need a tick from Treasurer Josh Frydenberg.</p><p>And it's understood that Frydenberg is more focused on ensuring credit is flowing to the housing sector just now, given the rather fragile state of economic growth.</p><p>Still, considering the ACCC got more funding in 2017 to set up a permanent financial services unit, we shouldn't be surprised that chairman Rod Sims wants to do more.</p><p>The first point of unity from the two banking chiefs with whom Chanticleer spoke - on inquiry fatigue - is well made.</p><p>The sector argues that over the past five years there have been four big inquiries that have looked into competition, or at least touched on adjacent issues: David Murray's Financial Systems Inquiry, which reported in 2014; the Productivity Commission's look at competition in the Australian financial systems, which reported in August 2018; the aforementioned ACCC inquiry and the Hayne commission.</p><p>That the big banks have enough on their plates responding to these previous inquiries is not surprising.</p><p>But it was the regional bank chief executive who was most dreading the work involved in another inquiry.</p><p>Indeed, he suggested these inquiries actually hurt competition in and of themselves, given the bigger banks could more easily absorb the cost and distraction required to formulate appropriate responses.</p><p>The second point - that regulators should be more worried about the quality of competition than the number of competitors - is more nuanced.</p><p>Sims told a parliamentary committee last week that \"even though you've got some quite big players outside the big four, it's not clear that any of them are really displacing any of the big four or making serious inroads\".</p><p>But the view from within the banks is very different. The big four chief says the mortgage market - which is now really the only prize as the big four simplify themselves - is currently ultra-competitive and the majors are giving ground.</p><p>The statistics from the year ended June 30 show that while the big four's market share is still dominant at 75.1 per cent, this has retreated from 76.2 per cent.</p><p>This share has been mainly taken by the so-called challenger banks - led by Macquarie Bank, Members Equity Bank, AMP Bank and three foreign challengers - ING, HSBC and Citigroup - which have had their overall share rise 70 basis points to 8.7 per cent.</p><p>Meanwhile, the non-bank sector's market share has risen to 6.2 per cent from 5.8 per cent.</p><p>Perhaps more interesting is the momentum enjoyed by some of these challengers versus the big four.</p><p>As of June 30, the majors were increasing their mortgage books at 0.57 times the growth of the entire banking system, well down from 0.81 times a year earlier.</p><p>But the challengers are growing at 3.4 times the system, up from 2.06 times a year earlier.</p><p>The non-banks are also growing at 2.85 times, up from 2.33 times.</p><p>There are some fascinating moves among the challenger cohort.</p><p>For example, HSBC is growing at 12.16 times the system, up from 4.75 times at the end of financial 2018. And Macquarie is growing at 3.62 times, up from 2.51.</p><p>Obviously, these challengers' loan books remain tiny compared with the big four. And Sims is right that it's far too early to claim that any of them are making \"serious inroads\" into the market position of the big four, particularly given their huge customer bases.</p><p>But it does appear that the fight for new loans is intense - and that's before any neobanks really get going, and before big tech giants, such as Apple and Amazon, make the market forays that everyone expects over the longer term.</p><p>Our regional bank chief would also like to finally see some movement on the changes to capital rules that would call for regional banks to hold much higher levels of capital against their home loans than the big ones.</p><p>These changes were recommended by the Murray inquiry and rubber-stamped by the productivity inquiry, but there's been little movement.</p><p>While the regional banks do concede their size does require them to hold more capital than the big banks, seeing this gap closed is much more important to them than yet another inquiry that might not hand down its findings until 2021.</p><p>JAMES THOMSON</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:j.thomson@afr.com\">j.thomson@afr.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc777pqyycrz85a6qf5re</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X3S-CS11-F0J6-J2NP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1343\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Magellan is a major investor in big tech stocks through its holdings in Apple, Facebook, Google and Microsoft.</p><p>During a six-year stint atop the country's most popular destination for buying and selling homes, Mr McLennan has helped build REA's realestate.com.au into a multinational tech company despite pressure from Fairfax Media's Domain.</p><p>He said the investment in Hometrack was aimed at \"tapping into the power of big data\" to \"deliver real-time analytics -insights\" for vendors, buyers and agents.</p><p>It is nearly three years since McLennan vacated his roles as chairman and chief executive at Ten Network, where he halted a revenue and ratings slide through an \"event-TV\" strategy based on programs viewers want to watch live rather than record and watch later.</p><p>The approach was best summed up by the Big Bash League, which cost Ten about $20m annually including contra advertising under Cricket Australia's last rights deal, but is now worth four times that amount under a new cricket rights deal.</p><p>When Mr McLennan left Ten, then communications minister, and now Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull said of him: \"He's a very smart, experienced media executive.\" Since then, Mr McLennan has juggled various board positions and advisory roles, mainly in the digital start-up space.</p><p>Last year he joined digital ad network Tiger Pistol as an adviser to help fuel the Australian start-up's next leg of growth.</p><p>Before joining Ten, McLennan worked on global ad deals for News Corp as executive vice-president, reporting to executive chairman Rupert -Murdoch.</p><p>He joined News Corp after rising through the ranks at ad giant WPP. Mr McLennan was appointed by former WPP CEO Martin -Sorrell as the youngest-ever global chairman and CEO of Young &amp; Rubicam in 2006.</p><p>During his time at Y&amp;R -Advertising, Mr McLennan helped -revitalise the agency, which had been losing clients for several years. He won a series of big -accounts including global giants LG, Bacardi, Dell, Goldman Sachs and Virgin Atlantic. In 2010 Y&amp;R was one of the most awarded ad networks in the world, led by a rejuvenated New York office.</p><p>Mr McLennan left Y&amp;R the following year to return to Australia to raise his young family. He began his career in Sydney, working for advertising firm George Patterson Bates, eventually -becoming national managing -director at just 32 in 1999.Three years later, in 2002, he moved to Young &amp; Rubicam where he led the acquisition of his former agency to form George Patterson Y&amp;R.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-f8b09f04655411e8a140e8650c4619cfb24bc356f48af35b249abe38cf6067e0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SG8-X991-JD3N-54V6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"839\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 4, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N4494111M</classCode><className>INTERNET RETAILING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CM7M</classCode><className>CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000205</classCode><className>BRANDING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000571</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC COMMERCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N523210MM</classCode><className>STOCK EXCHANGES</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZDMDg5MEQ3OTlGNEJCMkI0M0EyM0MwN0E1Njk1MEQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDBGREFBMDgyNTQ0NERFRUI3MEUwNDBFOTM5NDExREI</classCode><className>Stock Exchanges</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000194</classCode><className>BOARDS OF DIRECTORS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STLL00093DN</classCode><className>GOODS &amp;

Its technical superiority is diminishing, and more companies are opting for cheaper computers powered by Intel chips and Microsoft or Linux software -- not Sun's chips and software.<br/></p><p>What's more, McNealy's plan for Sun's future will put it ever more in direct competition with giants IBM and Hewlett-Packard, both of which have larger financial resources and customer bases.<br/></p><p>\"Sun is becoming a second-tier company in the tech industry,\" proclaims Jim Milton, senior vice president of H-P Americas.<br/></p><p>Founded in 1982, Sun went public two years later and topped $ 1 billion in revenue by 1988 -- the quickest of any computer company to reach that milestone. It widened its dominance in the computer server market based on the venerable Unix operating system in the 1990s -- first with its popular Java programming language and Solaris-Unix operating system, then with the dot-com and telecom boom that enriched many.<br/></p><p>McNealy in the 1990s gained national prominence as one of the most outspoken Silicon Valley executives against Microsoft, calling it \"incorrigible and unrepentant\" and urging regulators to \"get the chain saw out\" and break up the software giant.<br/></p><p>But then the dot-com bubble burst and a rash of telecom companies and Internet service providers folded, depriving Sun of customers. Amid a weak economy and tech-spending hangover, corporate customers clamped down on tech spending, which will inch up just 0.9% this year, researcher Aberdeen Group says.<br/></p><p>The combined result: Sun's fiscal 2002 revenue of $ 12.5 billion was off 32% from 2001. It lost $ 587 million in fiscal 2002 vs. a $ 925 million profit in 2001 and a $ 1.9 billion profit in 2000.<br/></p><p>What's more, its revenue picture is darker than those of its peers. Sun's revenue for the quarter ended Sept. 29 dipped 4% from a year earlier, after plunging 14% and 24% year-over-year in the previous two quarters, respectively. Meanwhile, revenue for the top 20 tech suppliers climbed 1.9% to $ 62.5 billion in the third quarter, Aberdeen Group says.<br/></p><p>Adding to Sun and McNealy's concerns: Microsoft earlier this year emerged virtually unscathed from its four-year antitrust battle, in which Sun played a key role as an advocate for change.<br/></p><p>Squeezed high and low</p><p>The challenges facing Sun are most evident at customers like CBSSportsLine.com.<br/></p><p>In the past year, it junked 40 Sun servers that cost $ 50,000 each and replaced them with 70 Intel-powered Dell servers running the Linux operating system that cost just $ 5,000 each.<br/></p><p>In addition to being cheaper than buying new Sun servers -- which use Sun chips and Sun software -- CBSSportsLine.com's strategy also lets the Web site avoid $ 400,000 in annual maintenance contracts with Sun, it says.<br/></p><p>Total savings: $ 2 million. \"Given budget constraints, we needed to cut tech costs without hindering performance. It was a no-brainer,\" says Peter Pezaris, president of operations at CBSSportsLine.com.<br/></p><p>At the same time, some high-end customers are reluctant to buy Sun's complete hardware-chip-software system because they fear it won't take full advantage of Linux technology, tech analysts say.<br/></p><p>That upstart and low-cost operating system has begun seeping into corporate data centers, where it is increasingly displacing servers running Sun's and Microsoft's operating systems.<br/></p><p>\"Sun is literally being squeezed in the middle,\" says Tom Bradicich, chief technology officer of servers at Sun rival IBM.<br/></p><p>Sun's stubborn adherence to designing its own chips and software is, many analysts say, its biggest problem. The integrated approach -- while turbocharging technical performance -- also leaves Sun vulnerable to low-cost competitors as they catch up in performance.<br/></p><p>While Sun maintains that its products do perform better than others' and result in lower maintenance costs, it is slowly branching out. Sun in September said it plans to make inexpensive PCs based on Linux. Before that, it launched a low-end Linux server to better battle similar offerings from Dell.<br/></p><p>Still, McNealy isn't wavering much in his belief in Unix, which still runs on most servers.<br/></p><p>\"Linux isn't a market. It's a crankshaft, a widget,\" scoffs McNealy, using an analogy befitting the son of a former American Motors vice chairman.<br/></p><p>Fighting back</p><p>Sun's comeback plan befits its feisty leader.<br/></p><p>At the heart of Sun's assault is a grand software project called N1, in which complex computer networks run and repair themselves without costly human administrators.<br/></p><p>Sun would benefit from bigger server and software sales as companies relied more and more on computer networks. IBM and H-P are hard at work on similar ideas called \"on-demand computing\" and Utility Data Center, respectively.<br/></p><p>\"My theory is the more controversial the strategy, the better the opportunity for profit,\" says McNealy, 48, who looks youthful in trademark jeans and golf shirt. \"I always feel the company is on the verge of great things despite the negativity.\"<br/></p><p>It also doesn't hurt that Sun has a hefty $ 5.2 billion in cash and respected technology. The company says revenue for its December quarter will meet analysts' forecasts of $ 2.9 billion. It expects a profitable quarter ending in March 2003. And it is spending $ 70 million on a worldwide ad blitz.<br/></p><p>Additionally, Sun scored a big legal win last week in its $ 1 billion antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft when a judge ordered Microsoft to include Sun's Java software with Windows.<br/></p><p>Longtime Silicon Valley observers note that Sun has faced steep odds before. Many were writing its obituary in the early 1990s when pundits predicted that cheap Intel-Windows machines would skewer Sun.<br/></p><p>But the Internet and telecom industries took off, and Sun rode the wave to new heights. It could happen again with another emerging technology such as biotech, nanotech or something else, computer analyst Harry Fenik says.<br/></p><p>\"In these brutal times, you need a no-holds-barred, decisive type like Scott -- not some thumb sucker who hunkers down,\" says Jack Welch, the former General Electric CEO, whom McNealy considers his mentor. \"Scott has the passion, focus and vision to pull it off.\"<br/></p><p>Still, it won't be easy. Current and former Sun executives acknowledge Sun reacted too slowly to the tech downturn. IBM and H-P are strong competitors. But they insist Sun can bounce back because of its technology and McNealy's bulldog-like tenacity.<br/></p><p>With some tweaks, he seems intent on pursuing Sun's same old course: produce sparkling technology at a premium price.<br/></p><p>On average, Sun devotes 14% of revenue to research and development vs. 6% for H-P and IBM.<br/></p><p>\"There is very little risk with Sun machines, and they have excellent support,\" says Kurt Gastrock, vice president of hosting solutions at Sprint.<br/></p><p>Its national computer network runs a mix of Sun's Solaris, Microsoft's Windows 2000 and Linux operating systems.<br/></p><p>Then, too, there are benefits to being a niche player. Just ask Apple Computer, one of few profitable PC makers. It has rung up a string of moneymaking quarters by closely watching expenses and selling products to a fiercely loyal customer base.<br/></p><p>McNealy also claims a takeover is out of the question, even though, at $ 3.25 a share, Sun's current market value of $ 10.1 billion is about $ 200 billion less than in late 2000, and rumors have percolated for 18 months that Fujitsu is eyeing Sun.<br/></p><p>\"It's pretty absurd,\" McNealy says. \"I don't think there's anyone out there that could afford to buy us.\"<br/></p><p>Perhaps more important, McNealy still appears to have the support of Sun's board, which has watched him wiggle out of crises before.<br/></p><p>\"He will go down with the ship or turn it around,\" says Marc Andreessen, co-founder of Netscape Communications. \"Like Bill Gates or Larry Ellison, he is a Messianic cult leader who defines his company's culture. He's a fighter who will punch your teeth in.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>GRAPHIC, Color, Julie Snider, USA TODAY, Source: IDC (BAR GRAPH);

Mike Miller Jr.</p><p>'I figure it's better the Russian trolls help fund education than property tax, or income tax, or sales tax,' Miller (D-Calvert) said in an interview, referring to the Kremlin's use of social media platforms to interfere in the 2016 election. Miller, who ended his 33-year tenure in power this week, has forced some of Maryland's most controversial policies into law, most recently the legalization of casinos. </p><p>The proposal comes as big technology companies face increasing global and domestic pressure to submit to regulation.</p><p>The Maryland legislation would apply broadly to the most ubiquitous forms of online advertising: banner ads, pop-up ads in the middle of websites and search engine ads \" including the ones tailored from a user's browsing history.</p><p>The details of administering Maryland's proposed tax would be determined by the state's tax collector, but the legislation relies on self-reporting from tech companies. </p><p>Maryland leaves it up to companies to report how much revenue the firms earn from digital ads on devices that either have an Internet Protocol address in the state or 'is known or reasonably suspected' to be used here. If that revenue exceeds $1-million, the legislation would require companies to file a state tax return estimating how much they owe in digital advertising taxes. The companies would have to keep records of advertising sales.</p><p> Ferguson, the Baltimore Democrat who drafted the plan, said he was inspired by economist Paul Romer, a Nobel laureate who suggested earlier this year that such a tax could use market forces to shift tech companies' business models \" creating a disincentive for profiting off the collection of private data. </p><p>The proposal, Ferguson said, could both fund a sizable chunk of the education changes he's championing and put 'some guideposts around the intrusive aggregation of data of individual Marylanders.'</p><p>'It's an assessment on the platforms for the use of Marylanders' data, for which, right now, companies are not paying a cost to access,' he said. </p><p>Internet advertising is big business: The Interactive Advertising Bureau reported 2018 digital ad revenue exceeded $100-billion nationwide, and it grew 21.8-percent from 2017. </p><p>Representatives of Facebook and Google declined to comment on the legislation. </p><p> It was not immediately clear whether the legislation would apply to other online platforms that host digital ads, such as The Washington Post.</p><p>The approach also raised questions about the limits of taxing Internet commerce. While other states have expanded their sales taxes to apply to digital products such as streaming services or music downloads, it appears none has created a new tax for digital advertising, according to Maryland tax experts and others. </p><p>Robert Callahan, a senior vice president for the Internet Association, which represents many big tech firms, said in a statement: 'while we are still reviewing the proposal, we have serious initial concerns. The bill appears to stand on questionable legal footing and unfairly discriminate against a single segment of the advertising sector.'</p><p>Ferguson and other state lawmakers are searching for a way to raise money to pay for a $4-billion per year revamping of public schools, a set of proposals known as the Kirwan recommendations.

Mike Miller Jr.</p><p>'I figure it's better the Russian trolls help fund education than property tax, or income tax, or sales tax,' Miller (D-Calvert) said in an interview, referring to the Kremlin's use of social media platforms to interfere in the 2016 election. Miller, who ended his 33-year tenure in power this week, has forced some of Maryland's most controversial policies into law, most recently the legalization of casinos. </p><p>The proposal comes as big technology companies face increasing global and domestic pressure to submit to regulation.</p><p>The Maryland legislation would apply broadly to the most ubiquitous forms of online advertising: banner ads, pop-up ads in the middle of websites and search engine ads \" including the ones tailored from a user's browsing history.</p><p>The details of administering Maryland's proposed tax would be determined by the state's tax collector, but the legislation relies on self-reporting from tech companies. </p><p>Maryland leaves it up to companies to report how much revenue the firms earn from digital ads on devices that either have an Internet Protocol address in the state or 'is known or reasonably suspected' to be used here. If that revenue exceeds $1-million, the legislation would require companies to file a state tax return estimating how much they owe in digital advertising taxes. The companies would have to keep records of advertising sales.</p><p> Ferguson, the Baltimore Democrat who drafted the plan, said he was inspired by economist Paul Romer, a Nobel laureate who suggested earlier this year that such a tax could use market forces to shift tech companies' business models \" creating a disincentive for profiting off the collection of private data. </p><p>The proposal, Ferguson said, could both fund a sizable chunk of the education changes he's championing and put 'some guideposts around the intrusive aggregation of data of individual Marylanders.'</p><p>'It's an assessment on the platforms for the use of Marylanders' data, for which, right now, companies are not paying a cost to access,' he said. </p><p>Internet advertising is big business: The Interactive Advertising Bureau reported 2018 digital ad revenue exceeded $100-billion nationwide, and it grew 21.8-percent from 2017. </p><p>Representatives of Facebook and Google declined to comment on the legislation. </p><p> It was not immediately clear whether the legislation would apply to other online platforms that host digital ads, such as The Washington Post.</p><p>The approach also raised questions about the limits of taxing Internet commerce. While other states have expanded their sales taxes to apply to digital products such as streaming services or music downloads, it appears none has created a new tax for digital advertising, according to Maryland tax experts and others. </p><p>Robert Callahan, a senior vice president for the Internet Association, which represents many big tech firms, said in a statement: 'while we are still reviewing the proposal, we have serious initial concerns. The bill appears to stand on questionable legal footing and unfairly discriminate against a single segment of the advertising sector.'</p><p>Ferguson and other state lawmakers are searching for a way to raise money to pay for a $4-billion per year revamping of public schools, a set of proposals known as the Kirwan recommendations. Ferguson and his counterpart in the House of Delegates, Speaker Adrienne A. Jones (D-Baltimore County), pledged not to hike property, income or sales tax rates to pay for them. </p><p> Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who has derided the school changes as 'pie-in-the-sky' and too costly, declined to comment on the prospect of taxing targeted digital ads. </p><p>'If or when the legislature finally releases a detailed plan to pay for Kirwan's massive price tag, we will certainly take a look at it,' Hogan spokesman Michael Ricci said in an email.

Specifically, the region has seen a growth and importance in fintech, producing its own unique innovations, entrepreneurs and thought leaders in the space. As The FinTech Times in September celebrates the Women in Fintech we take a moment to hear more from some of the leading female leaders in both the Middle East and Africa. One of them is Nejoud Al Mulaik who is from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and is an expert in fintech and the Director at Fintech Saudi . She was previously a banker. Nejoud Al Mulaik is the Director for Fintech Saudi  Nejoud has worked for 10-years at JPMorgan Chase Bank in the corporate investment banking space.  She has vast experience in building client relationships and portfolios across finance, industry, and the  public sector, managing corporate sales portfolio for large corporates in Saudi Arabia, played vital roles in logistics, office management, human resource development, and event management, as well as business management and core banking services.   In early 2018 Nejoud joined the Small &amp; Medium Size Enterprises General Authority (SMEA/ Monshaat) as International Strategic Partnership Director. There she managed international relationships for SMEs including  startups and entrepreneurs to attract and design the desired partnerships to achieve growth and economic contribution across industries.   In October 2018 Nejoud was appointed as the Fintech Saudi Director. Fintech Saudi is part of the Financial Sector Development Program (FSDP) and sponsored by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) , helping enable and build the financial technology ecosystem in Saudi Arabia.   Describe your career journey   I started my career in early 2008 with JPMorgan Chase Bank in Saudi Arabia ,  I became the first female hired by the bank back then, where I started in an admin role supporting the CEO &amp; other lines of businesses during the set-up phase for the newly established operational activities of the JPMorgan Chase branch in Saudi Arabia   As JPMorgan expanded locally with treasury, cash management &amp; corporate banking services, in 2010 I had the opportunity move to a core banking role and cover relationships &amp; sales management as an analyst, later an associate for large corporates &amp; multinational corporations (MNCs).   After 10 years in the banking sector with JPM, in 2018 I had an opportunity to move to the Small &amp; Medium size Enterprises Authority (Monshaat) as Director for International Strategic Partnership, which was an amazing opportunity and close up chance to be involved at the heart of one of the most important Saudi Vision 2030 venues to diversify the kingdoms economy. However, my background, expertise and my heart were still close to banking &amp; the financial sector. Therefore, when the opportunity presented itself I was extremely delighted to have been chosen to be part of the Fintech Saudi initiative to lead and support the efforts of the central bank (SAMA) in building the foundations of the ecosystem in Saudi.   As a recognised thought leader and a female, what difficulties have you faced in your career?   I\u2019d rather using the term \u201cchallenging \u201d, moving forward in banking &amp; with my current role leading. The Fintech Saudi initiative was and still always an interesting learning curve that requires ongoing progress on developing industrial knowledge, defending a business cases, and deliver results, keeping up with regulatory &amp; compliance requirements,  assess risks and learn how to make decisions, along with ensuring that my communication skills are effective and social and emotional capabilities are professionally demonstrated while working with colleagues, clients, and stakeholders.   The road to any career progression would be bumpy at times connecting with colleagues and mentors seeking a second opinion and advice was one the most important elements on overcoming challenges.   What are the future trends and predictions you see happening in the region?   Even with the current economic conditions, payments and alternative lending will still remain pioneers within the fintech verticals. We already witnessed strong partnerships and investments from banks with some fintechs to capture market shares,  We will see more industrial fintechs enter the market, mainly in the healthcare and real estate sector.   I would expect that some central banks in our region will take further efforts in building use cases for CBDCs and test them for retail activities, with open data and open banking current movement in our region. We have already seen some progress driving big tech and telcos to navigate the financial sector in certain regulated activities, \u201cinterconnectedness\u201d  will be the driver of new era in the financial sector   Despite the low overall global representation of female in leadership positions in the financial sector including the emerging fintech industry, we have seen growth in the number of fintech female founders in MEA. In our \u201c Fintech Saudi Founders Network ,\u201d we are dedicating certain programs driven by collaboration between fintech hubs in the GCC to support women in fintech and the digital sector, which we believe will support the already accelerated women empowerment efforts in both the public &amp; private sector. Fintech is one of the unique growing industries where we believe women can impact strongly in both financial solutions and decision making \u2013 by being founders, chairwomen,  board members and hold executive positions.   What advice and recommendations do you want to give future female entrepreneurs and thought leaders who are based in the Middle East &amp; Africa (MEA) region?   As for female leaders in the field, mastering the ability to juggle between career progression and personal prioritization is key. Taking risks is \u201cunavoidable\u201d my advice is to mitigate risk carefully but without shying away completely, especially for female entrepreneurs in the field, and be visible in every venue that supports your goals and presents business growth opportunities.   For future female leaders in the financial  &amp; digital sector , \u201cchange is constant\u201d and  happens overnight, always approach &amp; find mentors and be part of the networks within the field and actively voice your opinion with confidence.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43121364797</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WH-DNK1-JCSC-J3TF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1105\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Fintech Times</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 20, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United Kingdom</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern Europe</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>Investment Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzI1QTAxRjkxOUUxNDBFREE3RUQxM0Y1OEY3NUVGOTg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjYwNzU1MEY2MzcyNDc1QUEzMjIyMkVGNDdBRTkxOUE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Mergers &amp;

Yet we must first get on the same page across the breadth of issues. That's what this report aspires to do,\" Earl J. Wilkinson says in the report's foreword.</p><p>\"We hear the daily developments, we hear the country-by-country and commission-by-commission stories, but nobody to date has wrapped their arms around the issues - both good and bad,\" Wilkinson added in a statement to the Star.</p><p>The INMA initiative was overseen by a blue-ribbon committee consisting of Damian Eales of News Corp Australia, Espen Egil Hansen of Aftenposten/Schibsted, Maribel Perez Wadsworth of the USA Today Network/Gannett and John Boynton, Torstar president and CEO, and publisher of the Toronto Star.</p><p>Building on the survey, conducted last spring, the report is based on dozens of interviews and analyses of regulatory developments. The committee hopes it will provide a much-needed roadmap for publishers to navigate increasingly complex and integrated digital relationships.</p><p>\"We are an industry of local companies that can't act globally. But there is no geographical nuance in the issues we face,\" Boynton says. \"The issues we face in Canada are the issues that publishers face everywhere.\"</p><p>For example, the World Association of News publishers condemned Google in September for announcing that it will not pay publishers in France for search results as a result of a copyright law that comes into force this fall.</p><p>The law means large platforms, such as Facebook, Google and YouTube, must pay for content beyond short extracts of work.</p><p>Google says, instead, they will block any results from European newspapers in France unless those papers grant free use of their content.</p><p>\"This stance is not only disrespectful of the French government, it is also against a law that will soon be applicable in the entire territory of the European Union,\" the publishers' association said in a statement.</p><p>Platforms aggregating, but not paying for content, has also been a bone of contention for publishers globally. They have long been lobbying for more transparency in the algorithms that the digital giants use to determine what comes up high in a search.</p><p>At stake is the way countries around the world, including Canada, access their information and culture. A lack of local news and investigative journalism means citizens are less informed about their world. And that has implications for democracy.</p><p>\"There needs to be more oversight by government because market forces won't be able to fix most of these issues,\" Torstar's Boynton says. \"That includes algorithms that determine what people see, whether it's Canadian or foreign content.</p><p>\"It's something that ultimately determines what people's business models will be and which Canadian companies survive.\"</p><p>Whitehead, the former editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, says the public first started to really become conscious of the impact of big tech during the Cambridge Analytica scandal of 2018, where the British firm harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users to target in political advertising.</p><p>Since then, 2019 has been a watershed year for the number of investigations into big tech. The Canadian government's own inquiry and report due this January looks into updating outdated laws to regulate platforms.</p><p>Significantly for the publishing industry, lawmakers are also understanding the importance of quality journalism to democracy and are leading inquiries into the impact of the big platforms on news media.</p><p>\"News and journalism are different to many other commercial activities in that they benefit both the individual and also society as a whole,\" Australian Competition and Consumer Competition chair Rod Sims said in a report this year. \"It is vital that media businesses are not disadvantaged through the exercise of market power or other mechanisms that make it difficult for them to compete on their merits.\"</p><p>The U.S. News Media Alliance estimated that Google alone made $4.7 billion in 2018 from publishers through its search engine. Google has denied that figure, but there is no doubt that the search engine, along with Facebook, takes the lion's share of the digital advertising market.</p><p>\"The regulation of the digital platforms is bigger than one country or even a region such as Europe can effectively handle,\" Whitehead says.</p><p>\"With so many countries setting up their own antitrust investigations, the plans to co-ordinate the regulator responses across their research efforts and prosecutions will prove critical.\"</p><p>INMA, which is not a lobby group, is trying to connect the dots not only for its 11,000 members at 700 news media companies in 70 countries, but also for the consumers of news.</p><p>\"I think finally people are starting to take notice and regulators are now seeing how important the issues are when it comes to the platforms,\" Boynton says. \"The public should rightfully be shocked at what's going on.\"</p><p>Based on the INMA survey, potential solutions to improving the publisher-platform relationship centre on three approaches:</p><p>Direct action by platforms, such as prioritizing subscription content and introducing mechanisms to distinguish quality journalism;</p><p>Changes in law where regulators would create a level playing field on a host of issues including taxation and copyright;</p><p>And solutions involving collective bargaining where publishers could negotiate with big platforms on payment for content.</p><p>But more research and work needs to be done, according to the report, which describes itself as a potential playbook to help publishers turn their \"wish lists into action.\"</p><p>\"Ideally, we hope that we can work things out and co-exist together and that it's mutually beneficial,\" Boynton says.</p><p>\"I'm hoping that someone realizes within the big platforms that in the long term, the best play is to have a business relationship with publishers that is ultimately good for both sides.\"</p><p>Over the next week, the Star will outline, in more detail, seven key issues identified in How to Decode the Publisher-Platform Relationship as the most concerning to publishers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019101555998418</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8M-VNW1-DY91-K0NR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1216\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 15, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

I'm not sure. You're going to have to repeat that for me. I'm not going to speak to that. I'm sorry, what was the question? I would have to refer you to the report on that question.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I think this has been a disaster for the Democrats. I think it has been a disaster for the reputation of Robert Mueller.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JAKE TAPPER, CNN CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: That's headline out of the hearing so far. Mueller says that his report does not exonerate the president despite the president claiming so.</p><p>DAN ABRAMS, ABC NEWS CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: From the democratic perspective, to me so far, this has been a bit of a bust. They needed this to come to life.</p><p>JESSE WATTERS, FOX NEWS HOST: I think everybody agrees, even the Democrats and even the media would agree that this was an absolute catastrophe for them.</p><p>CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC HOST: That's the message from today's testimony by special counsel Robert Mueller, a second term for Trump or a prison term for Trump.</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: We now know the truth about Robert Mueller, a mysterious prosecutor with unchecked power, revealed at last to be a daft old man blinking in the sunlight once his curtain was thrown away.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Did the press raised expectations for his testimony weigh too high? Are some of the pundits unfair in describing Mueller as confused and befuddle? Sean Spicer, the former White House press secretary, joins our discussion. And President Trump decidedly unhappy with those White House correspondents after the hearings.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Let me just tell you, the fact that you even asked that question, you're fake news.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: We will look at the reporter's questions that set him off. Plus, a new racially charged uproar as the president denounces Congressman Elijah Cummings for dirty conditions in his Baltimore area district, but should a CNN news anchor be using the story to trash Trump? I'm Howard Kurtz and this is MEDIA BUZZ.</p><p>There is little debate across the media spectrum that Robert Mueller struggled in Capitol Hill and said almost nothing that was new, haltingly answering or deflecting questions from Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D-NY): So the report did not conclude that he did not commit obstruction of justice. Is that correct?</p><p>MUELLER: That is correct.</p><p>NADLER: And what about total exoneration? Did you actually totally exonerate the president?</p><p>MUELLER: No.</p><p>REP. LOUIE GOHMERT (R-TX): What he is doing is not obstructing justice, he is pursuing justice. And the fact that you ran it out two years means you perpetuated injustice.</p><p>MUELLER: I take your question.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D-CA), CHAIRMAN, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE: Your investigation is not a witch hunt --</p><p>MUELLER: It's not a witch hunt.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: The president quickly unloaded on the man who spent two years investigating him.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I think Robert Mueller did a horrible job, both today and with respect to the investigation, but in all fairness to Robert Mueller, he had nothing to work with.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Mr. Mueller said the other day, confirmed, confirmed in the public mind that the president has obstructed justice.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Joining us now to analyze the coverage: Emily Jashinsky, culture editor of The Federalist; Sara Fischer, media reporter for Axios; and Capri Cafaro, host of \"The Cloak Room\" podcast and a Washington Examiner contributor.</p><p>Emily, the media consensus is that Robert Mueller was an awful witness, the hearings were a debacle for the Democrats, and even some liberal commentators and liberal public figures seemed to agree with that.</p><p>EMILY JASHINSKY, CULTURE EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST: How often is it that we have a media consensus that is --</p><p>KURTZ: Never.</p><p>JASHINSKY: -- bad for Democrats?</p><p>KURTZ: It never ever happens.</p><p>JASHINSKY: And on top of that -- I saw like maybe one or two consenting opinions, just completely objectively a bad performance by Robert Mueller, stumbling over things that not project the authority of his own report that people expected him to have, complete optical disaster for Democrats. There is just really no way around that.</p><p>KURTZ: But Capri, there are some media liberals including several hosts on MSNBC who insist this was a bad day for President Trump because Mueller, they say, said things that were damaging to the president.</p><p>CAPRI CAFARO, HOST OF \"THE CLOAK ROOM\" PODCAST, WASHINGTON EXAMINER CONTRIBUTOR: The way that I see Mueller's testimony is exactly how I saw the Mueller report and its coverage as well. There are three sides to every story, yours, mine, and the truth.</p><p>And so Democrats and Republicans in these hearings tried to advance their own agendas. And in the same manner, the press on the left and the right were basically trying to advance those agendas as well.</p><p>There were some, I think, notable exceptions to that ruling, Stone, for example, had a piece basically saying it was disaster for Democrats, boxed (ph) that there were no winners here. So, I think that, you know, it's definitely not a good day for Democrats, and even we saw Dan Abrams there with NBC saying the same thing as well.</p><p>KURTZ: Right. Sarah, Bob Mueller, who did not want to be there, (INAUDIBLE) subpoena, did not want to make news, was a fresh witness for both sides. For Democrats -- the Democrats couldn't get him to read from the report, the whole Robert De Niro thing, he just reads it then people will see in the movie and not read the book.</p><p>And for Republicans, they wanted to talk about the origin of the probe, the FISA warrant, the Steele dossier, and he wouldn't go there. That was before he was special counsel. Did the media really pump this thing up just way too high?</p><p>SARA FISCHER, MEDIA REPORTER, AXIOS: Way too high. We should have known this because there were allies of Robert Mueller going to the Washington Post and other members of the press saying, \"Don't expect him to say anything new.\" He has even said, \"Don't expect me to say anything further.\" So I can't imagine why anyone expected this hearing to be explosive at all.</p><p>KURTZ: Perhaps wishful thinking. I mean, I was on record in saying this is going to be a dud, folks, but I underestimated the dudeness (ph) of it.</p><p>Look, during the first hearing in Judiciary Committee, there was a question from Democrat Ted Lieu, who said, \"The reason again that you did not indict Donald Trump is because of the Office of Legal Counsel opinion, stating that you could not indict a sitting president, correct?\" Mueller said that is correct.</p><p>I think he thought he was answering hypothetically. He came back on second hearing and said -- that was not the correct way to say it -- \"We did not reach a determination as whether the president committed a crime.\"</p><p>The reason I read that to you is that Rachel Maddow and others were like, aha, he said, you know -- Chris Hayes, excuse me. Chris Hayes on MSNBC said, \"Well, he did correct it, but it is hard not to see his first answer as revealing.\" \"Yeah, except in the second part,\" he said.</p><p>JASHINSKY: Right, this is a case studying grasping at straws. When you want desperately to find something from this testimony, that's really all you had to work with. That's completely what we saw happened. I think it is an important point that not only did Mueller stumble a little bit, but he would not give Democrats what they wanted which was just a flat out read the script. I think his refusal to do that speaks volumes about how much he wanted to be there.</p><p>KURTZ: Let me play a little bit more from the hearings for you Capri, and this was something that was done by MSNBC's Rachel Maddow.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCHIFF: I gather that you believe that knowingly accepting foreign assistance during a presidential campaign is unethical thing to do.</p><p>MUELLER: And a crime.</p><p>SCHIFF: And a crime.</p><p>MUELLER: Circumstances, yes. And given circumstances.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: So, it was like, aha, it's a crime in certain circumstances, but the report itself doesn't say that Trump or his campaign team or his advisers did illegally cooperate with Russian efforts to hack the election.</p><p>CAFARO: Well, what you see here is I think a classic case again of Robert Mueller, you know, people trying to have a got-you moment, which was the entire point of this thing for both Democrats and Republicans. I would also argue that Robert Mueller didn't give Republicans in certain circumstances what they want and say, I can't talk about that, I can't --</p><p>KURTZ: He said it at the beginning of the hearing. He is not going to talk about A, B, and C.</p><p>CAFARO: Exactly. Back to my earlier point, I think that both the left and -- the media on the left and right would take these certain sound bites whether it was saying, you know, you didn't charge President Trump with a crime because he's the president or, you know, X, Y, Z in certain circumstances and tried to grasp at those straws.</p><p>KURTZ: Or for example, aha, he said the report didn't exonerate him. Well, it's in the report. That was four months ago, so that wasn't exactly breaking news.</p><p>Interestingly, Sara, The Washington Post did fact-check of the hearings, what certain members said, and they only fact-checked statements from Republicans even though Mueller several times disagreed with characterizations by the Democrats. Does that give appearance of one- sidedness?</p><p>FISCHER: I think it does. I also think that there is, as you mentioned, the Democrats are coming at it before this hearing, sort of making their own conclusions, and no one was coming out and sort of saying, hey, Chairman Nadler, why are you drawing that conclusion, we haven't heard from Bob Mueller yet.</p><p>So I think that was a really good example of the media kind of taking one side here, saying that Republicans are rushing to discredit the Bob Mueller hearing when in reality Democrats have said some things that needed some fact-checking, too.</p><p>KURTZ: Ah, needed some fact-checking from both sides. What a concept. There was a New York Times front page story the other day that I thought was a blockbuster and I wrote about it and I talked about it.</p><p>It basically said that special counsel Bob Mueller was hands off, that he didn't have as much stamina, that he didn't work long hours as he is used to, that he delegated substantial responsibility, that he didn't lead many of the meetings, he gave that to one of his top aides, and that he was particularly less and less involved with negotiation with Trump lawyers whether the president was going to testify which obviously ultimately he did not.</p><p>And when I read that, I said, \"Now, they're telling us this?\" Should that story -- could that story have been reported sooner?</p><p>JASHINSKY: That New York Times story also had specific details about meetings. It is really interesting --</p><p>KURTZ: Calendars.</p><p>JASHINSKY: Right, calendars. Interesting information from sources clearly, it was followed up by Washington Post story that emphasized these rumors had been circulating for months and months and months, and so I think it is fair to question, we do not know what the reporters know, but we do know that these rumors existed and it is fair to question the motives of people whose job it was to put this into the public.</p><p>KURTZ: I don't know if the reporters knew all of this, but of course, 24 hours after the hearing with the substantial detail --</p><p>JASHINSKY: Yes, right away.</p><p>KURTZ: Could there have been a temptation for any reporters, not just the Times, not to say Mueller is a little bit out of it or very hands off because it might jeopardize your access to that office or potential for any leaks to your organization?</p><p>JASHINSKY: I think it is fair to question the motive in terms of access, and I think it also fair to question the motive in terms of bias. But I do think that it is completely surprising -- not surprising but it is completely offsetting that this stuff -- this rumor circulated because that would have changed the narrative and the end of this investigation.</p><p>CAFARO: I would just say that I am not actually really shocked that given how many leaks we have seen in so many aspects here in Washington, whether it's on Capitol Hill or inside the White House or the administration, the fact that Mueller's involvement was, you know, an arm's length did not leak --</p><p>JASHINSKY: Is a big deal.</p><p>CAFARO: -- is shocking.</p><p>KURTZ: In fact, Emily mentioned the front page story today in The Washington Post which says that there were media inquiries last year, reporters were looking into what was described as whispers about Mueller -- not that he wasn't in charge, he made final decisions obviously, but not sort of running it on hands on day-to-day way, and then Mueller's team had to reassure congressional staff on the Hill that he was OK.</p><p>But there are a lot of counter spin to the Times story in this Washington Post piece with aides sometimes anonymously saying, oh, he is fine, he is being held in unfair standard because it is hard to -- it is hard to stand up there for seven hours and all these members are throwing this at you in rapid fire, well, page 336 and all that.</p><p>So that -- but the fact that journalists were looking into it, maybe they didn't have enough to go with, but it is just -- maybe this is a bit of an open secret in some circles.</p><p>JASHINSKY: But they did, like you said, like 24 hours after this testimony, they did find enough to go with.</p><p>FISCHER: It could be that people are coming out right now and sort of purposing this narrative in defense of the Democrats who dragged him on Capitol Hill, and now they look a little bit silly because the hearing was a bust. Now, they have something to point to and say, well, the hearing was only a bust because our key witness here was really not able to come to the stand. I mean, that's the defense on their end.</p><p>KURTZ: Right, some Democrats apparently regretting the fact that they even forced Mueller to testify clearly --</p><p>CAFARO: That was reported in The Hill.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes. But so, as well, here now, you have a lot of pundits talking about Robert Mueller, using words like \"doddering\" and \"deaf\" (ph). Here is a clip from that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: We saw what we saw. I thought the lawyer was a visiting angel, not a lawyer. He is an early-stage dementia.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Should there be speculation about his mental condition from people who don't really know?</p><p>FISCHER: I mean, you mentioned this earlier this week, Howie. Member of Congress knows the exact paragraph they are going to be citing. Let Robert Mueller ask again what page was that on, because he has 448 pages. I think that he did a pretty OK job. I think that these calls that he has dementia are completely outrageous.</p><p>And even if he slowed down a little bit, it's a tough hearing. You have so many members of Congress coming at you rapid fire. Don't blame the guy for not knowing the exact paragraph or asking to repeat questions.</p><p>KURTZ: It was an impressive performance, the man is 74 years old, but still, when you start getting into suggesting medical conditions and this has come up, people on both sides have done it, your reaction, Capri?</p><p>CAFARO: Yeah. We saw this actually with Hillary Clinton as well in the commentary surrounding Hillary Clinton's testimony on Capitol Hill that, you know, somehow that, you know, maybe she had a mini stroke before --</p><p>KURTZ: Fall down.</p><p>CAFARO: Exactly. There are all these speculations. I mean, to me, that's a bridge too far for anyone in the press, left or right, to speculate on people's medical conditions.</p><p>KURTZ: All right. Let me get a break here. When we come back, a pretty heated presser after the hearings, is the president, shall we say, takes strong reception to some of the reporter's question? And later, are some of the talents at MSNBC fixated on Fox?</p><p>KURTZ: President Trump was not pleased with some questions from the White House press corps soon after the Mueller hearings ended, especially about a comment on his legal jeopardy that Bob Mueller himself had corrected in his testimony. Trump mixed it up with NBC correspondent Hallie Jackson and with PBS News Hour correspondent Yamiche Alcindor.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>HALLIE JACKSON, NBC CORRESPONDENT: Are you concerned you could be indicted out of office?</p><p>TRUMP: When you saw Robert Mueller's statement, the earlier statement and then he did a recap, he did a correction later on in the afternoon. And you know what that correction was and you still asked the question, you know why? Because you're fake news and you're one of the most. And let me just tell you, the fact that you even asked that question, you're fake news. What about -- what about Mueller's end?</p><p>YAMICHE ALCINDOR, PBS NEWS HOUR CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): He said that White House and campaign aides lied and that your answers were generally untruthful. What do you think of that? He's accusing you and your campaign of lying.</p><p>TRUMP: He didn't say that at all. You're untruthful when you ask -- you are untruthful.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: OK. Emily, were those questions from NBC and PBS correspondents out of bounds in the wake of the Mueller hearing?</p><p>JASHINSKY: They got sound bites and you can understand why the president after what that hearing was why he would be in that kind of mood, right, because that was a good testimony for the president of the United States. I don't know if the questions were out of bounds so as much as there were a lot of transcripts of the press conferences, there were a lot of repetition.</p><p>I think the questions that were asked about immigration crisis made all the Mueller questions look particularly ridiculous because it was hammering, hammering, hammering these questions about the Mueller testimony. Those particular questions, I don't think they are necessarily out of bounds, but I can understand how they were kind of designed to poke at the president and to get the kind of response that they did.</p><p>KURTZ: Well, that would not be a brand-new invention in journalism. Reporters should question the president aggressively after such a major news event. But do you think the phrasing of some of those questions were unnecessarily adversarial?</p><p>FISCHER: I think they were trying, as Emily said, to get a sound bite. And so if you come out adversarial, then you're going to get something fiery back and that makes for great T.V.</p><p>KURTZ: Are you worried about --</p><p>JASHINSKY: Especially with this president and his press corps.</p><p>KURTZ: Yeah. Are you worried about being indicted? Mueller says you are being untruthful. Well, there is something -- there were couple of things Mueller said that could be read that way by his written answers.</p><p>FISCHER: When you're asking, are you worried, you're asking him to give an opinion. I mean, what kind of answer are you expecting here that is going to be newsworthy, right? You're not looking for a piece of news, you're not looking for him to get something that's breaking, you're just asking for him to yell at you.</p><p>KURTZ: And yet on a day when President Trump was obviously pleased or shouldn't be pleased at the hearing basically fizzled, when he said that even the two most nauseating networks said it was a bad day for the Democrats, their initials are MS and CNN, he was quick to pounce someone he called fake news. In other words, he was on the offense even though it was good day for him.</p><p>CAFARO: I think that is just in President Trump's nature. I think, you know, when it comes to these other outlets, I mean, they are looking for ratings for sure. But I think that -- honestly the issue of fake news continues to concern me because there is a difference between media bias and fake news.</p><p>And I think that, you know, President Trump takes every opportunity to turn bias into what he calls fake news. This was a prime opportunity for him to feel as if he's been treated unfairly. When he's treated unfairly, all of a sudden it's fake.</p><p>JASHINSKY: Any question from the press corps is out of bounds, but were these productive questions that were going to elicit useful answers for the public? I don't think that's the case.</p><p>KURTZ: Well, interestingly, the president later tweeted a video mash-up of TV pundits including many from CNN and MSNBC saying awful performance by Mueller, disaster for Democrat, this is it for impeachment, it's over. So, if these are fake news outlets, used the phrase that he has, how does he explain them -- the judgment where they basically for once are saying, agree with him and saying it was a bad day for the Dems?</p><p>CAFARO: We have seen him do this before, though. The failing New York Times, it is fakes news, and all of the sudden if it has a decent story that comes out, he flips it.</p><p>FISCHER: Yeah, he is only going to do something if it is to his advantage. So it is to his advantage to go after them in a live press conference like that, but it is also to his advantage to highlight when they are backing his point on Twitter.</p><p>KURTZ: Yeah.</p><p>JASHINSKY: I think that's just how bad the testimony was.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KURTZ: Well keep it -- you're saying they had to --</p><p>JASHINSKY: Yes.</p><p>KURTZ: Keep in mind, because there were no daily White House press briefings, the president's interactions often at the helicopter or sometimes in the Oval Office with reporters is how -- is not only how he communicates his message, drives the news cycle, but also he will not be shy about beating up on reporters, which his supporters love because they do not trust the media.</p><p>JASHINSKY: Right. It is this dynamic between this president and this press corps in particular that I doubt we'll ever see again where there so much energy on both sides, they know how -- that question about are you worried about indictment? For President Donald Trump, you know what you're doing with that question.</p><p>KURTZ: Waving a red flag.</p><p>JASHINSKY: And he likes that question because he can come out and say you're fake news.</p><p>KURTZ: All right. Well, no fake news, hopefully. Capri Cafaro, Emily Jashinsky, thanks so much. Sara, we will see you later.</p><p>Ahead, when is a $5 billion government fine criticized as way too light when it's against Facebook? But up next, MSNBC has a Trump-bashing commentator, co-anchor its coverage, its news coverage of the Mueller hearings, and some guests keep making false claims about Fox.</p><p>KURTZ: (INAUDIBLE) fixated on Fox over at MSNBC these days to the point that guests kept repeating a blatant falsehood before the Mueller hearings began. It started with MSNBC contributor Joyce Vance tweeting, \"Fox isn't showing Mueller's testimony Wednesday. Trump is afraid of what will happen if his base gets to hear Mueller's testimony for themselves.\"</p><p>That was quickly knocked down but anti-Trump Republican commentator Rick Wilson repeated the claim.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RICK WILSON, REPUBLICAN POLITICAL STRATEGIST: Fox isn't covering the hearings, which should tell you --</p><p>NICOLLE WALLACE, MSNBC AND NBC NEWS CHIEF POLITICAL ANALYST (voice-over): Really?</p><p>WILSON: -- how scared they are on what could happen this morning. It's going to be a very interesting and consequential moment. They are apparently not going to take them live. Everybody else is taking them live.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KURTZ: As did former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONNA EDWARDS, FORMER MARYLAND REPRESENTATIVE: It's notable, I think, that tomorrow, Fox News, for example, is not airing the Mueller testimony.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE (voice-over): I don't believe that's true.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KURTZ: So she was quickly corrected, sort of. MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace later offered this update without so much as, we regret the error.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: Fox News called us. They asked us to let you know that they're carrying the hearings. Don't watch them, though. Watch me and Brian. We'll be more fun, I promise.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: More fun or more partisan? Take a look at the teams anchoring the hearings.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARTHA MACCALLUM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: We will have a live look as you have been getting this morning inside the hearing room at the Rayburn Building here on Capitol Hill.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: See, not only did Fox cover it gavel-to-gavel but its ratings were higher than every other cable or broadcast network for veteran journalists Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum.</p><p>At CNN, the anchors were all straight journalists, Wolf Blitzer, Jake Tapper, and Dana Bash.</p><p>But the MSNBC anchor team was Brian Williams and Nicolle Wallace, the former Bush White House aide, who makes clear every day she despises Donald Trump, and that showed in her analysis.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WALLACE: The Democrats were -- considered this as a fact-finding mission. The Republicans were all auditioning for next weekend show on Fox News.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Well, there's the Fox fixation again. No one in the mainstream media questioned her role. That brings me to CNN moderators for this week's democratic presidential debates, Jake Tapper and Dana Bash, two solid choices, and Don Lemon, who constantly denounces Trump as a racist and a horrible president. And the reaction from the MSM? Crickets.</p><p>Coming up, President Trump takes a swipe at Fox News over new poll. That and much more with Sean Spicer, next.</p><p>KURTZ: Joining us from Rhode Island with the president's perspective is Sean Spicer, senior adviser for America First PAC and of course, the former White House press secretary.</p><p>So, Sean, new Fox News poll has Joe Biden leading President Trump 49 to 39 percent, the marginal almost identical to polls by ABC and NBC. The president tweeted there's no way he would lose to Biden.</p><p>Here's the tweet, put it up. \"Fox News is at it again. So different from what they used to be during the 2016 primaries, and before - proud warriors. Now New Fox polls which have always been terrible to me, they had me losing big to crooked Hillary have me down to sleepy Joe.\"</p><p>Now all these polls are way early, Sean. But Fox runs a very professional polling operation, why is the president suggesting that somehow these numbers were deliberate or twisted?</p><p>SEAN SPICER, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Well, I think if you look at his experience last cycle which he alludes to in the tweet that poll after poll had him losing, he ends up winning with 306 electoral votes, carrying states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Iowa that the GOP hadn't in decades.</p><p>This is a president who I think is rightly frustrated why the public polling that goes after. I know that the data operation we built at the Republican National Committee that is working hand in hand with the Trump campaign now is giving us a robust ability to understand exactly where all of the voters are that the president needs to talk to, whose on his side who are the gettable ones.</p><p>And if you think about it, again, a national poll when you're really talking about an election that's going to come down to handful of swing states.</p><p>KURTZ: I understand, you know, it probably come down to a few battleground states, I'm just interested in the attacks on Fox, which is one, the president has every right to criticize the network if he wants but it was noteworthy.</p><p>Look, President Trump these days seems very agitated after the Mueller hearings, even after telling the reporters, I mentioned this last segment that the two most nauseating networks, which the other two cable networks said it was bad day for the Democrats. Why does he not just declare a victory and move on?</p><p>SPICER: Well, because in one way they go on and talk about how Mueller did a horrible -- had a horrible performance, how the Democrats team get what they want and yet they won't let it die then they find some way to weave it back to President Trump.</p><p>So no matter how bad of a day that they have or how good of a day that he has, those networks always find the negative and I think it's frustrating to see it over and over again no matter how well he actually does or the economy does or how poorly the Democrats do on a particular topic, somehow it always comes back to figuring out where the negative is.</p><p>KURTZ: Right. Well, one of the reasons that Mueller's testimony was so ineffective in addition to his stumbles and bumbles, is that he didn't want to go beyond the report, he didn't want to be there, that was very clear. So, when the president attacks him for horrible testimony and even, you know, the consensus pretty much in the media as well, was Mueller ultimately fair to him not just in his report but in not, you know, using the forum of the congressional hearings to take some cheap shots?</p><p>SPICER: You mean, in terms of the president?</p><p>KURTZ: In terms of what Mueller said during those six hours.</p><p>SPICER: Yes.</p><p>KURTZ: He said he tried to stick to the language of his report as he had said he would do.</p><p>SPICER: Right. Now he did largely, but I think it still goes back to the nut of the report, right, this idea. And I think you saw this from the Republican side over and over again where there's presumption of innocence in our country.</p><p>And the idea that he says, well, I didn't exonerate him. Well, that's not how our system of justice works, and in other report know where their inquiry, if you're not guilty, you're not guilty. And I think there's a lot of frustration that somehow for this one case we are talking about, well, I didn't exonerate him. Well, in our system of justice you are either guilty or you're not guilty.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes. Well, that's a fair point. I think Mueller's point in the report was I'm not saying he did commit any crimes and I'm not saying he didn't.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SPICER: But Howie, look --</p><p>KURTZ: And of course, you can't prove a negative. I get it. Let me --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SPICER: But also, look, there's two important things, number one, he did do that on the first one and if the underlying issue is that there was no collusion, there was never collusion which is now been proven over and over and over again, then you cannot cover up that which didn't occur.</p><p>KURTZ: All right. I hear you. Let me move on to what is sort of dominating in the weekend news. From the beginning of the week the president renewed his attacks and of course he got lot of criticism from the media last week on the four freshmen Democratic members of Congress, all of them are women of color.</p><p>And he had some new tweets about AOC and company. He said, he referred to Ilhan Omar as America-hating anti-Semite, Rep. Omar, the squad, as they call themselves, he tweeted, is a very racist group of troublemakers who are young, inexperienced and not very smart. And then he said I don't believe the four congresswomen are capable of loving our country. Why does he want the media to keep covering this, why is he not moving on past these initial attacks?</p><p>SPICER: Well, look, I mean, go back to his time as a candidate, he was able to define each of his opponents and draw a contrast, so, you know --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KURTZ: But he's not running against them, they're all freshmen.</p><p>SPICER: No. But, look, we are all talking about them and what we are talking about is their extreme left-wing socialistic policies, so he has made them the leaders of the Democratic Party de facto.</p><p>So while you have 20 people running around to be president of the United States on the Democratic side, the fact of the matter is that we are spending all of our time talking about the policies and actions of four freshmen members of Congress, we are now having those Democratic candidates running for president answering and trying to suck up to these four freshmen and see how far to the left they can go.</p><p>He has clearly say, if you will, about everything else, but there's no question that we have now made this election a binary choice about freedom and capitalism versus socialism and progressivism.</p><p>KURTZ: Right, but now we have yesterday and again today the president going after the fifth member of Congress who happens to be black, Elijah Cummings, sort of in retaliation for his very tough criticism on the border and then tweeting that -- I will get into this in the next segment, his Baltimore area district is dirty, and disgusting, calling for an investigation of federal aid to his district.</p><p>And the president knew that if he did this the media would be attacking against him, aha, you're going after another minority lawmaker and so why does he want this fight? I mean, this is a little different that you're saying making these left-wing congresswomen the face of the party?</p><p>SPICER: I think you answered at the beginning of your question that, you know, when attacked, he hits back. He's made that clear since he was a candidate, in fact, well before that we know that when he received bad press or people attack him, he has fought back.</p><p>He sort of, made that a guiding principle, so I don't think it should be shocking. He's attacked Bill de Blasio, he's attacked the mayor of London, he has gone after people. When they attack him, he punch back. So, it's a consistent pattern that we've seen over and over again.</p><p>KURTZ: Sean, can you --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SPICER: I mean, the shock factor is worn off.</p><p>KURTZ: Can you -- can you deny that it's just a coincidence that these five Democrats he's gone after all happen to be people of color because that's the thrust of the media indictment right now against the president.</p><p>SPICER: I understand that, and as I just pointed out you can talk about Bill de Blasio, the governor of California, all white men as well. I mean, he has gone after -- he has an equal opportunity offender when it comes to going after people.</p><p>I know the voice but at the end of the day Elijah Cummings is the chair of the committee that was going after the president in this particular case, so he couldn't go after anybody else.</p><p>KURTZ: Right.</p><p>SPICER: But you name it, he's gone after Chuck Schumer ad nauseum.</p><p>KURTZ: That's right.</p><p>SPICER: So, I get it in this particular case --</p><p>KURTZ: All right.</p><p>SPICER: -- that we are trying to put a banner on it, but at the end of the day he has gone after everybody. And if you -- I've seen some of the list that other shows have done. It's ad nauseum, so --</p><p>KURTZ: I got to go, Sean.</p><p>SPICER: Look -- all right.</p><p>KURTZ: Thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it.</p><p>SPICER: You bet.</p><p>KURTZ: And coming up --</p><p>SPICER: You bet.</p><p>KURTZ: -- more on the president going after Elijah Cummings and his district. The controversial attack that followed a segment on Fox &amp; Friends, that's next.</p><p>KURTZ: President Trump as we just noticed launched a Twitter attack yesterday on a fifth House member of color after a Fox &amp; Friends segment featuring a local Republican who took video of some garbage strewn, abandoned row houses in Cummings Baltimore area district.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KIMBERLY KLACIK, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Congressman Cummings represents the most dangerous district in America.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Trump called the oversight chairman a brutal bully, called his Maryland district a disgusting, rat and rodent-infested mess. And ask without evidence whether federal aid there is being stolen. Quote, \"Investigate this corrupt mess immediately.\"</p><p>Joining us now from Los Angeles, Leslie Marshall, a radio talk show host and Fox News contributor. Leslie, Elijah Cummings responded that he fights for his constituents every day. The president, I'm sure same question that I just asked Sean Spicer, knew that the media would say he's again targeting a minority lawmaker. Why do you think he wants -- do you think he wants this fight despite what he knows will be the racially charged criticism?</p><p>LESLIE MARSHALL, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I don't think he thinks before he talks, I really don't. I just think he lets it rip and I think later either the ratings go up for him, his approval ratings or apologies are made, and I think there are people behind the scenes in his administration, you know, who are cringing.</p><p>The reality here is that whenever he uses the term infestation, when you look at all the times he has used the word infestation, it does refer either to a country, a district, a state or an individual that is under the umbrella of a minority whether it's a brown person, a black person, African-American, Mexican- American, Hispanic, Latino, that is the fact.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes.</p><p>MARSHALL: And therefore, when people start to say, you know, this is racist, this is one of the reasons why.</p><p>KURTZ: Now, Baltimore has a lot of problems like a lot of inner cities, though, that's not the entire district, it also includes a suburban county for Elijah Cummings, do you think the video footage that aired on Fox is enough to justify the president -- the tone of the president's attack?</p><p>MARSHALL: Absolutely not. Because when you look at the facts, I mean, the 53 percent of Congressman Cummings district is African-American, they are the second most educated African-American district in the United States, they also the second highest-income earners among African-Americans in the United States.</p><p>I don't consider John Hopkins University, John Hopkins hospital, the University of Maryland or headquarters for the NAACP, rat, or rodent, infested organizations.</p><p>KURTZ: Al right.</p><p>MARSHALL: So, no, I think that's very unfair. If you show picture here in L.A. and I know you know L.A. really well, if you show a picture of skid row, that's not Beverly Hills and all the other areas in between.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KURTZ: That's not the entire area, of course. Let me show you how, let me show you the audience how Victor Blackwell, a CNN weekend news anchor handled the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VICTOR BLACKWELL, CNN ANCHOR: The president says about Congressman Cummings district -- that no human would want to live there. You know who did, Mr. President? I did.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Now, I understand why Blackwell is emotional, he's a Baltimore native. He's being held as a hero by the media. But I got to ask this question. He is a news anchor when he accused the president of targeting black and brown people, whether you agree that or not, is that the role of a news anchor?</p><p>MARSHALL: You're not supposed to become the news and you're supposed to report the news. But I do think sometimes there is a mountain to die on and I think this was his mountain to dies on.</p><p>Look, I'm a white woman, I certainly don't know what it's like to walk in the skin of an individual such as Victor who is an African-American male, and all too often to have words like this hurled at them and their community, I don't know that pain. And I think the pain overcame the title and I don't think it takes away from his ability to be a journalist and have journalistic integrity going forward.</p><p>KURTZ: OK.</p><p>MARSHALL: And I understand -- I understand -- I thought it was touching, I thought it was real.</p><p>KURTZ: All right.</p><p>MARSHALL: That was real.</p><p>KURTZ: Not disputing that, I think if a Fox News anchor had a mountain of emotional attack on Nancy Pelosi it would be a lot of media criticism. By the way, now Fox News poll says that Trump's tweets about the four congresswomen crossed the line 63 percent, 27 percent says acceptable political attack.</p><p>Let me turn you briefly to the Mueller hearings. Now in the wake of the hearings, Jerry Nadler, the judiciary chairman says he's conducting an impeachment inquiry in effect by asking for Mueller's grand jury material and this is a way of getting around Nancy Pelosi who does want an impeachment inquiry. I see zero media criticism of this maneuver by Nadler, maybe because much of the media agree with the maneuver?</p><p>MARSHALL: I don't know if they agree with him, I don't know if they are just tired of it and they just want it to play out or it's kind of expected, isn't it? It's a bit predictable but at the end of the day, regardless of what comes forth Speaker Pelosi has been very, very clear, she said she has to have iron clad evidence to go forward with impeachment and she needs bipartisan support.</p><p>And even Congressman Schiff who said, look, even if we vote to impeach it's dead on arrival in the Senate, there's an acquittal and Democrats know all too well what happened in the Clinton administration.</p><p>KURTZ: Right.</p><p>MARSHALL: His ratings went up, he was president and it was Newt Gingrich, the speaker who resigned and at that time Republicans lost seats in both the House and the Senate.</p><p>KURTZ: I got to go. I think you're being a little generous. I think the media would love to see an impeachment investigation. Great story among other things and the feelings about Donald Trump I think in many quarters is well known.</p><p>Leslie Marshall, great to have you back. Good to see you. Take the rest of the day off.</p><p>MARSHALL: Thank you. Good to be here.</p><p>KURTZ: After the break, Mark Zuckerberg playing defense again as the government hits Facebook with a $5 billion fine and launches an antitrust poll with big tech. Are the Silicon Valley giants in some trouble?</p><p>KURTZ: It sounds like a pretty whopping penalty. The Federal Trade Commission imposing a $5 billion fine for privacy violations. And many critics are calling the fine a mere slap on the corporate wrist. Mark Zuckerberg figuring with upbeat take at a staff meeting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK: Privacy is more central than ever to our vision for the future and we are going to change the way that we operate across the whole company. I believe that companies should be held accountable on privacy. And this is what accountability looks like?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: And Sara Fischer is back with us. So, $5 billion fine for a company that's worth about $570 billion, also Facebook has to create an independent committee on its board to monitor this stuff, Zuckerberg has to certify he's in compliance privacy rules every quarter, many critics are saying, wow, this is just not enough?</p><p>SARA FISCHER, MEDIA REPORTER, AXIOS: Yes. And those critics include mostly Democrats that are actually with the FTC and what they are saying here is that you want these penalties to be punitive, you want this but to feel threatened by them that something like Cambridge Analytica could never happen again.</p><p>And when you're bringing in $63 billion of revenue a year and you're going to be taxing them $5 billion, critics are saying this is not enough to deter them from actually changing, fundamentally changing their business model.</p><p>KURTZ: I'm seeing a lot of the criticism from tech writers and columnist who would agree with what you just said, at least that's the argument.</p><p>Facebook has had so many private -- privacy breaches including the mess with Cambridge Analytica. So many time Mark Zuckerberg has had to apologize and promised to do better, and it's almost like a broken record. With this lousy track record has he kind of opened the door to more government regulation?</p><p>FISCHER: I think so. And it's not just the FTC that's calling for his. The DOJ says they are going to call into question FTC -- anti-competitive practices of all tech companies. So, what Mark Zuckerberg has done, what Facebook has done is they created this landslide of regulatory threats for every database company out there, whether you're Amazon and its e-commerce, you're Google and its search, everyone should be threatened because of what Facebook's track has created.</p><p>KURTZ: Well, I would say there may be some other culprits here beside Facebook. So, as you mentioned, the Justice Department probe, this is a new investigation, Facebook, Google, and Amazon anticompetitive practices and there may be some anticompetitive practices. Amazon, by the way, President Trump's least favorite company.</p><p>But the idea of these companies broke major laws and should be broken up when millions and millions of people willingly use their services for free by the way, seems a little far-fetch to me.</p><p>FISCHER: I mean, it's difficult to prove that there's anti-competitive practices when consumers are happy, remember, anticompetitive practice are when consumers are harmed. So, this is really hard for them to be able to prove and it's why we've left these tech giants grow so big.</p><p>How do you say that Google is a monopoly and anti-competitive when their ad rates are the lowest of anyone out there? The big question here is, do you have so much data any of these companies, it's almost like insider trading, that you have access to information about what other companies you should acquire or other trends are really good for business that other people don't. And that's what they are going to be looking into here, it's not just privacy practices.</p><p>KURTZ: Right.</p><p>FISCHER: It's really merges and acquisitions.</p><p>KURTZ: Well, it's essentially a version of whether they've gotten too big and too powerful.</p><p>Just briefly, $5 billion fine not many people unhappy about that for Facebook, if it had been 10 billion, if it had been 20 billion, wouldn't there a counterargument that this is too punitive?</p><p>FISCHER: I mean, if you take a look at what they're doing in Europe, that was more around the realm of where they would be charging. They actually charge for a 4 percent of your global turnover for every day that you don't comply with this fine.</p><p>So, if people think that it can get too punitive, I'd look over to our friends across the Atlantic and say other people don't think so, regulators.</p><p>KURTZ: All right. Sara Fischer, thanks very much. Still to come, an update on that Covington Catholic student lawsuit and a former MSNBC host rips her former network over the Mueller probe.</p><p>KURTZ: A judge has thrown the $250 million lawsuit by Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann against the Washington Post, saying that while the paper quoted what may have been false accusations from the Indian activist who confronted here on the Washington Mall, such opinions are protected speech under the First Amendment.</p><p>Now Sandmann was clearly maligned by an irresponsible rush to judgment by several outlets, but winning the libel suit as I've been saying is hard without showing deliberate falsehood.</p><p>Krystal Ball who used to work for MSNBC has just unloaded on her former network. Ball whose panel show was canceled in 2015 is a liberal commentator and former Democratic congressional candidate, but on her show on Hill TV she said MSNBC has damaged the left.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KRYSTAL BALL, NEWS TALK ANCHOR, THE HILL: Some talent did drink more deeply of the Russia conspiracy waters than others. Rachel Maddow, you've got some explaining to do.</p><p>For months, MSNBC built segment after segment, show after show on building anticipation for a big reveal in some of the most fevered speculation prime time shows actually invited Jonathan Chait on to lay out his wild theory that Trump had actually been a Russian asset since 1987. MSNBC, seriously, this is not journalism. It is Infowars conspiracy theory.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KURTZ: Look, comparing MSNBC to Infowars is a bit out there for me. And many outlets covered the Mueller investigation, it was a big story and many over covered it and overhyped it. But Krystal Ball deserves credit for taking on a place where she says she still has many friends.</p><p>That's it for this edition of MEDIA BUZZ. I'm Howard Kurtz.

Nine is the owner of this masthead.</p><p>\"I'm very pleased the government has strongly endorsed adopting those regulations,\" he said. \"It's obviously better if we can work it out directly with the platforms ... A voluntary code is the right way to go.\"</p><p>Seven West Media chief executive James Warburton also welcomed the majority of the response, saying that addressing outdated content requirements would bring certainty to the industry.</p><p>\"The urgent need for regulatory equality between foreign digital platforms and Australian companies has been recognised by the government. We see this as a real turning point, as for too long legislation has lagged well behind technological evolution, disadvantaging Australian companies and providing foreign digital platforms with a free ride,\" he said.</p><p>However, he said the network was disappointed the government had not backed a take-down scheme that would have required material infringing copyright rules to face more stringent requirements. The suggestion attracted mixed feedback from submissions throughout the consultation process.</p><p>Network Ten chief executive Paul Anderson said it was \"great the government is making a serious attempt to address the deep-rooted dominance of the online tech and streaming giants\".</p><p>The tech giants have not yet shared in detail their stance on the government's position.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc78dccqxebo41ilxzm9gr</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR1-W381-JD34-V003-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"451\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; First Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 13, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000DEIA</classCode><className>NINE ENTERTAINMENT CO HOLDINGS LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC2721 PERIODICALS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp; PRINTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Ten meanwhile will put its views forward via a submission by the FreeTV industry association, also expected later this week.</p><p>In its submission, Facebook said the final ACCC report had failed to acknowledge the significant power and influence held by Australian media companies. It said these companies did not require a regulator to protect them by intervening on their behalf in commercial relationships.</p><p>On Monday it went further, releasing a blog arguing against introducing a new \"bargaining code\" to regulate negotiations between Facebook and media companies.</p><p>\"News Corp, for example, has publicly stated that they have a monthly audience that matches, if not exceeds, Facebook's reach in Australia,\" Facebook wrote in its submission.</p><p>\"We do not agree ... that a 'bargaining code' between Facebook and some of the most influential and powerful media companies in Australia will promote public interest journalism. It is hard to imagine that such influential companies require the assistance of the Australian government to negotiate commercial terms with Facebook, especially in light of the lack of evidence or findings of unfair trading on our part.\"</p><p>In its original submission to the digital platforms inquiry, Nine argued the substantial market power of the tech platforms had disrupted its traditional business model and that Facebook profited from its content without there being any material benefit to Nine.</p><p>\"The business model of Facebook as a closed ecosystem should be a concern to policymakers. Due to its commercial model, which heavily restricts the media's ability to monetise their content, no incentive currently exists for Nine to distribute our news content widely,\" Nine said.</p><p>Nine opposed Facebook's rules about how advertising content operated, saying it meant news pieces could sometimes be unfairly classified as sponsored content if they contained an advertisement.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc774nax0lvbpd8nw33d3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2G-JKS1-JD34-V04V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"538\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

It said these companies did not require a regulator to protect them by intervening on their behalf in commercial relationships.</p><p>On Monday it went further, releasing a blog arguing against introducing a new \"bargaining code\" to regulate negotiations between Facebook and media companies.</p><p>\"News Corp, for example, has publicly stated that they have a monthly audience that matches, if not exceeds, Facebook's reach in Australia,\" Facebook wrote in its submission.</p><p>\"We do not agree ... that a 'bargaining code' between Facebook and some of the most influential and powerful media companies in Australia will promote public interest journalism.</p><p>\"It is hard to imagine that such influential companies require the assistance of the Australian government to negotiate commercial terms with Facebook, especially in light of the lack of evidence or findings of unfair trading on our part.\"</p><p>In its original submission to the digital platforms inquiry, Nine argued the substantial market power of the tech platforms had disrupted its traditional business model and that Facebook profited from its content without there being any material benefit to Nine.</p><p>\"The business model of Facebook as a closed ecosystem should be a concern to policymakers. Due to its commercial model, which heavily restricts the media's ability to monetise their content, no incentive currently exists for Nine to distribute our news content widely,\" Nine said.</p><p>Nine opposed Facebook's rules about how advertising content operated, saying it meant news pieces could sometimes be unfairly classified as sponsored content if they contained an advertisement.</p><p>In August Facebook inked 12-month deals with Nine, Seven, Network 10, Sky News, Junkee Media and Pedestrian.tv to create a series of original news-related programming for its Facebook Watch service, as well as uploading clips from their news and current affairs shows.</p><p>Mr Anderson said the deals were a positive sign that the tech giant was engaging more with the companies it had disrupted.</p><p>He said it was an indication that, with properly structured deals, media companies could work better with Facebook in future, in a way that was not such \"one-way traffic\".</p><p>\"It is positive that they are paying for content, in particular news content, but also the general entertainment content,\" Mr Anderson said.</p><p>\"It is a two-way street because we produce content that is really valuable to their platform and there's a two-way benefit out of that where we get to publicise our shows.\"</p><p>As well as rejecting the notion of a bargaining agreement with the traditional media companies, Facebook rejected some other recommendations in the ACCC's final digital platform inquiry report.</p><p>These included a requirement to give advanced warning of any plans to provide advanced warning of intentions to acquire local companies, and changes to the privacy act that it said worked against European GDPR laws.</p><p>The ACCC report stated there was a fundamental bargaining power imbalance between media businesses and Google and Facebook, which meant media companies accepted terms of service that were less favourable to them due to needing their distribution reach.</p><p>But Facebook said the competition watchdog had not referenced any examples of Facebook indulging in anti-competitive conduct, and instead used a limited number of examples of Google's actions before asserting that this also implicated Facebook.</p><p>\"Designing regulatory solutions that conflate Facebook and Google - two very different companies that compete with each other and publishers for advertising dollars - will not address the important policy considerations for the role of data and technology in Australia's economy,\" Facebook's local director of policy Mia Garlick <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-australia-policy/smart-regulation-must-promote-trust-innovation-and-choice-for-all-australians/2417839498543309/\">wrote in the blog post</url> on Monday.</p><p>Queensland University of Technology professor of communication and creative industries Terry Flew said the argument for a bargaining code from the ACCC was more persuasive in advertising technology services, in which he believed there was an imbalance in power.</p><p>But he said the most striking thing about Facebook's submission was its willingness to support many of the ACCC's recommendations.</p><p>\"Of the 23 recommendations, about half were largely supported. Facebook is keen to demonstrate a preparedness to work with legislators around this,\" he said.</p><p>\"It has an appetite for regulation up to a point. For example, it does not want to be the arbiter of community standards. It would much prefer legislation so they can demonstrate a preparedness to enact those rules.\"</p><p>Professor Flew said regulators globally were watching and waiting to see what the Australian government would do next.</p><p>\"There is an appetite globally for regulating big tech ... My reading is there is quite a bit of appetite within government to move forward on this and there will be a fair degree of support from the opposition.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1520181735</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2F-K4S1-JBJ7-N0KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1079\"/><timeReceived>06:06 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Bernie Sanders is still surging, now with a double-digit lead in a new national poll, and Joe Biden is still hoping to pull off a win. He's not surging.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Michael Bloomberg, meanwhile, still getting slammed from all sides. Democrats pounding the money he is making, while President Trump is just pounding.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome, everyone. I'm Neil Cavuto. Glad to have you. We're all over that, all over some new records at the corner of Wall and Broad in just a second.</p><p>But first with Peter Doocy if what happens in Vegas will stay in Vegas, and Jonathan Hunt with the president in Bakersfield, California, where Vegas is still very much on his mind as well.</p><p>We begin with Peter -- sir.</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Neil, Michael Bloomberg is not competing in Nevada, but he's going to be on the debate stage this evening. And there's a ton of buzz about it.</p><p>Look at this, front page of The Review-Journal, \"Debate Debut for Bloomberg,\" with a big photo. And while we don't know exactly how he's going to get along with the other candidates on stage, we do know a little bit about the kind of opposition research that his campaign is cooking up.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOSEPH BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Mike has what every public officials should have, passion matched with principle. Your legacy extends well beyond the five boroughs.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOOCY: Part of the point there is that Joe Biden obviously has a very long record, but so does Michael Bloomberg.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIDEN: Been a Republican his whole life. The fact of the matter is, he has -- he didn't endorse Barack or me when we ran.</p><p>This is a guy talking about -- he's using Barack's pictures, like they're good buddies. I'm going to talk about his record.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOOCY: But Joe Biden is not the man to beat, according to an internal Bloomberg campaign memo that we got our hands on. And it concludes this at the end.</p><p>It says: \"The bottom line is that if Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar remain in the race, despite having no path to appreciably collecting delegates on Super Tuesday and beyond, they will propel Sanders to a seemingly insurmountable delegate lead by siphoning votes away from Bloomberg with no upside for themselves.\"</p><p>And it's interesting because Amy Klobuchar's strong debate in New Hampshire is credited with helping her finish a surprising third place in the first- in-the-nation New Hampshire primary, so she might have some things to say tonight about Bloomberg's campaign gurus saying that she should drop out -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: It's amazing.</p><p>As you remind me, we're 3 percent into all the delegates that you need to win this thing, and they're already wrapping it up and concluding everything.</p><p>All right, thank you, my friend, Peter Doocy.</p><p>Now to Jonathan Hunt. He is in Bakersfield, California, where the issue for the president right now may be water, but he is not taking his eye off what's happening in Nevada -- Jonathan.</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: That's for sure. Neil.</p><p>The president is expected here in about 45 minutes. We are here in the heart of California farming country. And as you take a look at the audience behind me, it's a very enthusiastic reception that awaits the president when he gets here.</p><p>You might notice the desk on the podium there as well. That is because the president will be signing an Interior Department decision that is related to water rights. But the president began his day today, Neil, heading from Vegas, where he overnighted, to the Palm Springs area for fund-raising, millions of dollars, in fact, raised during a reception at the estate of Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.</p><p>So he was among the wealthy there certainly in the Palm Springs area. A lot of supporters as he drove from the Palm Springs Airport to the Rancho Mirage estate of Larry Ellison.</p><p>Also a couple of protesters on the hand. Unlikely to be an issue when he gets here, where Mr. Trump will be seeking the support and, of course, the votes in election 2020 of ordinary farmers. As part of that, as I just mentioned, he's expected to sign off on an Interior Department decision that rolls back endangered species protections that have essentially curbed water deliveries to Central Valley farmers.</p><p>So that's going to be a very popular move the president will make with the audience here. It will be very well-received. But as you were mentioning, Neil, as he makes this Western swing, the president very much is keeping his eyes on Nevada and that Democratic debate stage, which will be full of the candidates tonight.</p><p>Mr. Trump over the last few days has certainly seemed focused on the candidacy of former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg. And the president has been happy to echo some of Bloomberg's Democratic opponents concerns about the possibility or the accusation, at least, that Bloomberg is -- quote -- \"trying to buy the nomination\" away from the front-runner, Bernie Sanders.</p><p>Also, not unrelated to what is happening tonight in Nevada, the president will leave here, Bakersfield, California, and head to Phoenix, Arizona, where he will hold what will no doubt be another of those sold-out and raucous campaign rallies.</p><p>It is absolutely no coincidence, Neil, that that rally is scheduled to begin at exactly the same time the Democrats take the stage in Nevada. Mr. Trump knows better than anyone how to troll his opponents -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Or to steal some thunder.</p><p>All right, thank you, my friend, Jonathan Hunt, in the middle of all that.</p><p>So say it ain't so, Joe? There's a new report via CNBC that claims several Joe Biden fund-raisers are jumping ship and are now supporting Mike Bloomberg. All this as Biden is hoping to revive the campaign with tonight's debate in Nevada and obviously get things going again in South Carolina.</p><p>He is not on the ballot in either state, I might point out.</p><p>With me now is former Obama economic adviser, much more than that, Robert Wolf, GOP strategist Joseph Pinion, and The New York Post's Kelly Jane Torrance.</p><p>Robert, you're well-connected with a lot of these same folks. Is it your sense that financial types are backing away from Biden? Aren't they going to wait this out or what?</p><p>ROBERT WOLF, FORMER ADVISER TO PRESIDENT OBAMA: I think they're going to wait it out.</p><p>He was here next week -- last week. The events were sold out.</p><p>CAVUTO: He didn't get as much as he hoped, though, right?</p><p>WOLF: That -- I don't know. I mean, what I heard from the campaign is they had a great first week post-Iowa.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: I think you know everything.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WOLF: You have to pay me more.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WOLF: I think the best way to look at it is, unfortunately for us Democrats, there is no one coalescing around one moderate candidate.</p><p>They're all somewhere between 10 and 20 percent. And whereas Bernie and Elizabeth Warren that take up about 40 to 45 percent of the party, right now coalescing around Bernie, which is around 30-plus percent.</p><p>So I think we talked about the other day I certainly feel like the moderate side is a silent majority. But as long as we're doing what Obama said not to do, that good old circular firing squad we have going on right now...</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, it's alive and well.</p><p>WOLF: It's no question about it.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, when you look at it, Joe, I mean, how -- the president is planning just to sort of steal their thunder. Usually, he plans an event right up to that moment. No different this time.</p><p>But it does steal their thunder, and I think he's enjoying their disarray.</p><p>JOSEPH PINION, REPUBLICAN STRATEGIST: Yes, look, I think he likes to give the side-by-side comparison.</p><p>So you have President Trump over here with six million new jobs, with wages going up, and you have Democrats over here. Iowa, they can't even count the votes. Now it looks like they can't even pick a nominee.</p><p>So, again...</p><p>CAVUTO: But how is that even comparable? All right, so you have a problem in Iowa. It's not the same as the economy.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PINION: Well, I mean, again, I think that's the point, though.</p><p>We're over here running the country, and they're over here not even being able to take care of basic political business.</p><p>CAVUTO: What is their biggest worry right now? It always seems to me it could be Bloomberg. It was once Biden, because they really are pushing Bernie very hard.</p><p>PINION: Well, look, I think -- again, I think Republicans have to be careful what we wish for. Again, I think that when you look at somebody like Bernie, all the symptoms and signs are there for the same things that people said about President Trump, that he's only getting 30 percent of the vote, that there are more people voting for somebody...</p><p>CAVUTO: You know who the first person to remind me of that was you.</p><p>PINION: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: No, seriously, be careful jumping the gun on it.</p><p>So, I guess, Kelly Jane, what I'm looking at here is maybe a snapshot where it could be like a prize fight tonight. I don't -- sometimes they never live up to those expectations.</p><p>What do you think they're going to try to do to Bloomberg?</p><p>KELLY JANE TORRANCE, NEW YORK POST: I think it's very interesting that people have been talking for years about how there's this battle for the heart and soul of the Republican Party with Donald Trump and what happened.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: There's always a battle going on for the heart and soul of parties, though, right?</p><p>TORRANCE: Exactly.</p><p>So, right now, the two front-runners apparently are people who aren't even Democrats until very recently.</p><p>And I think that we're seeing a lot of what they're going to bring up about Mike Bloomberg with all of the different audio that's been leaking on stop and frisk, on women, on people in the workplace.</p><p>CAVUTO: Have any of those been reflected in these polls that show him rising? Or is lot of that polling done prior to the release of these tapes?</p><p>TORRANCE: I think most of it is done prior to the release.</p><p>I think also, though, I mean, stop and frisk, what he said on the tape was pretty awful. But people have known that he's been for that. And I think a lot of Democrats have already been worried about how he's going to respond to that.</p><p>He apologized for it when he got into the race. But, for many, it wasn't enough. And let's face it. Joe Biden really needs something tonight, but he has never performed that well in any of the debates. And, in fact, most people who have done well in the debates did so when they were targeting Biden.</p><p>I'm thinking of Kamala Harris, of course, on the busing thing.</p><p>CAVUTO: That worked out like a charm, right?</p><p>TORRANCE: Temporarily. I mean, Biden's still going. She's out.</p><p>So, I say don't count him out. But, at the same time, right now, Mayor Pete Buttigieg is the one, of course, who has the most delegates. But nobody seems to think he can keep taking it in.</p><p>But, again, don't count him out. Everybody was surprised by his strong showing in Iowa.</p><p>CAVUTO: No, you're absolutely right.</p><p>Now, with the focus right now on Bloomberg tonight, he might regret accepting the invitation. Right? Or does he -- because it's been so widely telegraphed that he's going to be a pinata, what?</p><p>WOLF: I mean, you and I spoke about it the other night. We thought that his best possibility was don't go to the debate.</p><p>But now I think we're at a point where he's had so many ads. You got to bring Oz behind -- in front of the curtain, all right?</p><p>CAVUTO: Right. Right.</p><p>WOLF: I mean, we used to say with President Obama, you know what, get in front of the rope line, not behind the rope line.</p><p>He has to start getting out and making sure people know what he stands for.</p><p>CAVUTO: And Bloomberg is better than people think.</p><p>I know he has this intellectual approach to everything and sort of non- emotional. But he got elected three times in this city.</p><p>WOLF: And it's not a debate. Right? I mean, it's question and answer.</p><p>PINION: Look, I mean, I think you look at somebody like Bloomberg, I mean, to me, I mean, there is a danger. I think somebody should still try to convince him not to go.</p><p>He's running the best funded art project in the history of American politics. And right now, he's basically the quarterback that held out of training camp, and he's showing up in the middle of the season, and everyone else is in midseason form.</p><p>So Amy Klobuchar is champing at the bit. You have individuals right now who are going to try to characterize him in ways that...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WOLF: I know a bunch of Democratic strategists that will hire you right now.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: He's been very prescient on a couple of key developments here very, very early on.</p><p>WOLF: Yes, very sharp.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, when you look at this and the media story, how is the media going to cover tonight?</p><p>They're going to be looking to see if Bloomberg stumbles badly, right?</p><p>TORRANCE: They are.</p><p>I mean, all eyes are on him. And I have to say, I'm interested to see which candidates really go after him. We know Elizabeth Warren already has on Twitter calling him an egotistical billionaire like Donald Trump, she said.</p><p>But how hard are they going to hit him?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: How is he going to respond to that? What did she again? Like...</p><p>TORRANCE: Yes.</p><p>And that's -- I think you have to worry about egging and being condescending. Secondly, how hard are they going to go after him, when they all want his money? Even Bernie Sanders didn't say that he wouldn't take that $2 billion that Bloomberg is promising to spend, no matter who wins.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes. We will see. We will see. They have to make nice for that.</p><p>All right. They can't go too far. We will watch it later on.</p><p>Meanwhile, just to let you know, again, for those of you just tuning in, we hit some records today at corner of Wall and Broad. I'm sure the Democrats will be mentioning this tonight, Nasdaq and the S&amp;P at new highs, the Dow getting closer and closer to one.</p><p>But are the candidates in tonight's debate really promising to deliver something very different, something that has nothing to do with those market numbers?</p><p>After this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, well, they hike, and the strong economy just takes a hike -- that is kind of the message behind the Trump campaign in The Las Vegas Review-Journal, slamming the Democratic rivals over their tax plans, which to a man or woman, mean at least trillions of dollars more in taxes over the next 10 years.</p><p>The only differentiator is how many trillions.</p><p>Vince Coglianese is with us, Susan Li. We got Scott Martin.</p><p>You know what's interesting, Scott, about the way the president's positioning it, whatever you think of me, maybe whatever you think of my tweeting or whatever, take a look around you. Take a look at this strong economy. And just go with that. What do you think?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT: I love it. And he's right.</p><p>And it kind of is one of those situations, Neil, where the numbers and the results are speaking for themselves, not these grandiose, hopeful plans of how things are going to work out so great for everybody, when we all know, I mean, in economics, there are winners and there are losers, not everybody wins, but people strive to win.</p><p>And that's really the key behind a lot of the policies that Trump has introduced. And I think you just look around the Democratic side of things. We're going to learn more tonight. I mean, Mike Bloomberg alone on Wall Street, a major beneficiary of Wall Street, he was, and now he's got all these ideas that seemingly are going to take down Wall Street and penalize Wall Street for being as successful as it has been over the years.</p><p>CAVUTO: Susan, the big drive for Democrats is, find us a winner. Find us someone who can beat Donald Trump. So they kind of put their passions aside in favor the candidate who can most and likely will embody that.</p><p>They're not quite sure about Bloomberg. How is that going down?</p><p>SUSAN LI, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, on Wall Street, people are a little bit surprised, because, as Joe Biden pointed out, Bloomberg has been a Republican most of his life, meaning that he's a proponent of capitalism, lower taxes, less regulation, the trickle-down wealth effect, and now he's talking about a transaction tax on Wall Street, expanding the Volker rule, meaning more oversight for the banks.</p><p>And this is counter to what he said 10 years ago, so they're hoping that maybe this is just before the primaries and he will move closer to the middle when the general election comes around, if he's still around.</p><p>CAVUTO: How do you think it's going to go for him, Vince, on that idea? I mean, Bloomberg is moderate in terms of some of the other candidates.</p><p>And I think his costs are a few trillion dollars over 10 years, with Wall Street transaction taxes and the like, higher taxes on the upper income, but they're all going to raise taxes. So how does Bloomberg try to differentiate himself? Or can he?</p><p>VINCE COGLIANESE, THE DAILY CALLER: Yes, I don't think he's going to satisfy the left-wing base at all with these policy positions.</p><p>Even announcing tax raises of any kind on Wall Street, it's going to fall on deaf ears, because he's a -- he's not a credible communicator on that subject. He is seen in the Democratic Party as a guy who got filthy rich off of the finance industry.</p><p>And the big problem for him is convincing Democrats that he in any way deserves to be a part of this race, when the DNC clearly rolled out the red carpet and the velvet rope line for a guy who didn't even participate in the two first contests in this Democratic primary.</p><p>That's what he needs to overcome. Saying anything about going after Wall Street, it's going to fall on deaf ears.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, the president is fine with continuing to quote the markets and what they're doing.</p><p>Scott, it's something that's very, very important to him. It's hard to gauge where these markets go the rest of the year and all of that, but normally, normally they're kind of indicative of what's happening in the economy.</p><p>All seems pretty stable right now, the coronavirus uncertainties notwithstanding. Will that continue to be the wind at his back?</p><p>MARTIN: I believe it will.</p><p>Now, you make a good point, Neil. Things seem eerily OK, don't they? And this is after a lot of things that this market and economy have had thrown at it. I mean, tariff wars alone, the Federal Reserve just about a year or so ago that was hiking rates, instead of cutting them.</p><p>But, yes, overall, I think the economy has the wind at its back. And I think one reason we're seeing these record highs day after day, and we're going to see him probably tomorrow, too, after tonight's debate, you're going to see the Democrats continue to fray, and that's why the markets like it, because it gives Trump a better chance in November to pull this out.</p><p>CAVUTO: Susan, when you talk to traders, what's their biggest worry like these days?</p><p>LI: These days.</p><p>CAVUTO: I'm sure it's not a focus on the campaign. I'm sure it's the virus, right?</p><p>LI: Yes.</p><p>Well, Goldman Sachs just came out with a note saying that the market isn't really accounting for how big of an impact coronavirus might have, especially when you have China talking about an economic crisis.</p><p>That's where they're equating the epidemic to at this point. There are some concerns that people are not really pricing that in properly, with these record markets still.</p><p>CAVUTO: When you talk about record markets, and you talk about Michael Bloomberg being front and center, he's Mr. Market, he's Mr. Wall Street.</p><p>And, of course, he made the terminals that became ubiquitous and made him a guy worth $60 billion-plus.</p><p>So, Vince, how does he handle that? Because he could end up sounding an awful lot like the president talking about Wall Street.</p><p>COGLIANESE: Well, of course.</p><p>And he is transparently an oligarch. The dictionary definition is a guy who uses his financial resources to control political conversations, and that's what he's doing around the country.</p><p>In fact, tonight's debate will be interesting, because this is a liability for him. This is an opportunity for him to actually have to answer questions, instead of controlling the airtime that he has by way of the many ads that he's purchased literally everywhere.</p><p>I feel like when I go to sleep at night, my dreams just start with a Mike Bloomberg ad. He's done everything.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COGLIANESE: Yes, it's unbelievable. I don't even know how he got to that. But that's what he's done.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MARTIN: Are you OK?</p><p>LI: Do you sleep well then?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>COGLIANESE: No, not at all.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, that's the difference between your dreams and mine. Mine involve a Grand Slam meal at Denny's, but whatever works, whatever works.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Guys, thank you all very, very much.</p><p>Meanwhile, all these remaining cruise passengers are now off the ship and, well, shipping out to their home countries. They have been cleared of the coronavirus, but my next guest and her husband, so far, they're not that lucky. And they're not that happy.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, now more than 2,000 are dead from this coronavirus, experts saying there could be undetected infections sort of morphing around the world.</p><p>Jonathan Serrie has a lot more on that -- Jonathan.</p><p>JONATHAN SERRIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Neil.</p><p>Today, Japanese health authorities began allowing passengers to disembark from the Diamond Princess, which had been under quarantine. However, Americans on board the cruise ship received letters from the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo informing them they will not be permitted to return to the U.S. for an additional 14 days after leaving the ship, which is now tied to more than 600 confirmed cases of coronavirus.</p><p>The letter explains the CDC has concluded that, despite efforts of quarantine, there was a high risk that passengers currently on board the Diamond Princess have been exposed to COVID-19.</p><p>An 83-year-old American woman who became ill after disembarking another cruise ship, the Westerdam, which finally docked at Cambodia, is in stable condition at a hospital in Malaysia. Her 85-year-old husband insisted on staying by her bedside. Malaysian authorities agreed to grant his request.</p><p>And Iranian media are reporting that COVID-19 has claimed the lives of two elderly citizens in that country. If confirmed, that would bring the death toll outside of China to five -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Jonathan, thank you very, very much.</p><p>My next guest was evacuated from that Diamond Princess cruise ship before she and her husband were put under quarantine in Nebraska, where he has actually tested positive for the virus.</p><p>Jeri Seratti joins us now on the phone, Jeri Seratti-Goldman, I should say, with that story.</p><p>Jeri, thank you for taking the time.</p><p>How are you holding up?</p><p>JERI SERATTI-GOLDMAN, QUARANTINED: I'm holding up really well so far.</p><p>CAVUTO: And how is your husband?</p><p>SERATTI-GOLDMAN: He -- we're so thrilled, because we got here Monday.</p><p>And he had a very high temperature getting off the plane and into the night, and then it broke and then it came back. And now last night he went through the night without a temperature, which is a huge blessing.</p><p>CAVUTO: Oh, that's great.</p><p>I'm curious. How are they handling you in Nebraska? Are you at a compound? What kind of a facility? Can you say?</p><p>SERATTI-GOLDMAN: Yes.</p><p>So we thought we were being taken to an Air Force base. That's what they told us.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right. Right.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SERATTI-GOLDMAN: We were on our way after we were picked up at the airport, that's Carl that you're seeing right now on the TV.</p><p>So, we were being taken away, and because, where we were, we thought we were on an Air Force base. We were not. And as we're driving, I said, this doesn't seem like an Air Force base. They go, oh, no, you're going to the Nebraska Medicine -- Medical Center.</p><p>CAVUTO: Huh.</p><p>SERATTI-GOLDMAN: And so they took Carl to the hospital portion of it.</p><p>And I'm in a -- I think there's only three in the country -- a specialty quarantine unit. And that's my room.</p><p>CAVUTO: How does it compare to the ship?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SERATTI-GOLDMAN: Not as luxurious. The luxury is not there, but I'm doing really well, really well.</p><p>CAVUTO: Are you ever able to visit your husband?</p><p>SERATTI-GOLDMAN: No. I cannot leave my room. I cannot leave my room.</p><p>And I still have tested negative and have no symptoms, so very blessed for that. And we were traveling with friends of ours from St. George, Utah. When she got -- she was the first to test positive. And the night before they called her, she had a temperature for a few hours.</p><p>And that was the only sign she has had. And then she's been testing negative since she got to the hospital that she's in, Fukushima, Japan.</p><p>So what we're understanding, after talking to doctors here, is that you're either one and done where it shows up and you have no symptoms, or, like Carl, who had underlining symptoms -- he has Guillain-Barre syndrome.</p><p>So his immune system was already compromised. And that's why he has had a temperature a couple times.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I hope he's going to be OK.</p><p>I mean, how are you holding up just with the meals and the difference on the ship? I mean, they're delivered to you. You're locked in that room. Doesn't sound like a whole lot of fun.</p><p>SERATTI-GOLDMAN: Yes.</p><p>Well, we're business owners. We actually own a radio station in our hometown of Santa Clarita, California.</p><p>CAVUTO: Oh, all right.</p><p>SERATTI-GOLDMAN: So we're still working away.</p><p>And I have a treadmill and workout equipment in my room, so I'm able to get up and kind of do my morning routine.</p><p>CAVUTO: I have a treadmill too. I just don't use it that much.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: But, Jeri, I wish you well.</p><p>SERATTI-GOLDMAN: Well, when you have nothing to do...</p><p>CAVUTO: No, I understand. Hang in there Jeri.</p><p>And my best to your husband. You're a trooper. You both are.</p><p>SERATTI-GOLDMAN: Thank you so much. OK.</p><p>CAVUTO: This is a book. You have a book in the making, young lady, so be well, Jeri Seratti-Goldman.</p><p>Can you imagine that?</p><p>Meanwhile, pardoned by the president and now thanking the president, and, all of a sudden, the press goes nuts.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, some exclusive new video just coming in of Roger Stone at Fort Lauderdale Airport. He's headed to Washington for that sentencing hearing tomorrow, this despite concerns the foreperson on that jury was biased against him -- after this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROD BLAGOJEVICH (D), FORMER ILLINOIS GOVERNOR: He's a Republican president. I was a Democratic governor. And doing this does nothing to help his politics.</p><p>President Trump is a man who is tough and outspoken. But he also has a kind heart. And this is an act of kindness. And I also believe it's the beginning of the process to actually turn an injustice into a justice.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAVUTO: Of course, that's former Governor Rod Blagojevich thanking President Trump for commuting his 14-year prison sentence. He had been in there eight years. So he missed eight years of seeing his daughters grow up.</p><p>So, given all of that, you would think just the reunion with his family would be enough for everyone to be happy. Not so.</p><p>The president is getting it from both Democrats and Republicans slamming some of his clemency and pardon decisions.</p><p>Let's go to \"Media Buzz\" host Howard Kurtz on this.</p><p>Howard, I think what stands out -- it's always good to have you.</p><p>HOWARD KURTZ, HOST, \"MEDIA BUZZ\": Thanks.</p><p>CAVUTO: Is that normally presidents of all party types do this more near the end of their term, in the case of Bill Clinton, a busy final few hours of his term.</p><p>But this president has been consistently doing these in spurts and in waves. I don't know what the issue is with that. He can do and pardon and commute to -- anyone who wants.</p><p>But it gets an unusual amount of press. What do you think of it?</p><p>KURTZ: Well, this is an action by the president that is causing him to be absolutely denounced by the media.</p><p>And I understand this part about Blago, because, as you say, even some conservatives and Republicans are upset about this.</p><p>Rod Blagojevich is the guy who not only sold Barack Obama's Senate seat, famously caught saying it was blanking golden.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>KURTZ: But he shook down a children's hospital for a $50,000 donation in exchange for millions in state funding, and never showed a smidgen of remorse.</p><p>But this has been portrayed by many in the media, Neil, as a dark, nefarious Trumpian assault on the criminal justice system, rather than controversial moves in the Constitution similar to those of other past presidents.</p><p>CAVUTO: And what's interesting about it, you can argue whether the term that he was given, up to 14 years, was justified.</p><p>KURTZ: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: But many have looked at that and said, all right, for the crimes, it doesn't fit, and it hearkens back to something the media seizes on, the time that the judge might want to slap Roger Stone, a person that got prosecutors looking at a higher number.</p><p>The president obviously looking for a lower number. What do you make of that?</p><p>KURTZ: Well, I make of that that, obviously, the president is not shy about intervening, whether it's Twitter or talking to reporters, about people who are sometimes friends of his or former associates like Roger Stone, who thinks have been treated unfairly.</p><p>The reason that the press is connecting these pardons and commutations, not just the Stone case, but saying that Trump is -- he now says he's the nation's chief law enforcement officer -- is because of The Washington Post story saying that Bill Barr's threatened or at least has told people he might resign as attorney general if the president doesn't stop the tweets.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>KURTZ: And the president is not stopping the tweets about the Stone case.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, so what happens if Barr were to resign? Then, all of a sudden, the narrative becomes there's a palace revolt, right?</p><p>KURTZ: Right, but probably the Justice Department would be without a head for the remaining time in this election year, and then some people will be nostalgic for Bill Barr.</p><p>Suddenly, all the people on the left who have been attacking Barr since the day he took office would be saying, oh, he was a man of great principle, he's our new hero, he's the new Mitt Romney and all that.</p><p>But you got to look back. I mean, Bill Clinton pardoned his half-brother. He pardoned Marc Rich, who was a fugitive who had fled the country. George H.W. Bush pardoned Caspar Weinberger in the Iran-Contra scandal.</p><p>And Barack Obama commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, who had endanger American lives...</p><p>CAVUTO: Sure.</p><p>KURTZ: ... by dumping a ton of classified military secrets out there.</p><p>So I wish that this president and the others had just gone through the normal Justice Department system, rather than, in this case, the president relying on friends and family and allies. But he does have the power to do that.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, the president is going, with this big fund-raiser with Larry Ellison, there are thousands of Oracle workers who were very annoyed about it.</p><p>I don't remember this kind of a big stink when other CEOs have given to Barack Obama or whatever. They can do what they want to do, but what do you make of the dust-up over that?</p><p>KURTZ: I think it's hypocritical, because, obviously, President Obama, other Democrats have held fund-raisers or used the homes of rich guys, CEOs, people who run companies.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>KURTZ: And if most of the employees were all with it, even those who might have been conservative Republican, you didn't have this big stink.</p><p>But somehow the employees of a big tech company like that feel like it's a personal affront that their CEO happens to support President Trump. And, of course, the press just loves to jump on that.</p><p>CAVUTO: They do, indeed.</p><p>All right, Howie, thank you very much. Good having you, my friend.</p><p>KURTZ: Thanks, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: That -- we told you about that Larry Ellison event.</p><p>By the way, Larry Ellison is even richer than Michael Bloomberg. He's worth about $69 billion, Michael Bloomberg about $60 billion.</p><p>But it's that kowtowing and that relationship that gets a lot of attention. Should it?</p><p>After this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, President Trump greeted by protesters in Rancho Mirage, California, today.</p><p>The president there for a fund-raiser with Oracle founder Larry Ellison. Some Oracle employees, in fact, thousands of them, not too happy about that visit.</p><p>Hillary Vaughn in Rancho Mirage with more -- Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Neil.</p><p>Well, Palm Springs is called the president's playground for its history of attracting high-profile politicians to high-dollar fund-raisers.</p><p>And, today, it was the scene for President Trump's latest campaign cash haul at Ellison's invite-only golf resort Porcupine Creek. This ritzy rendezvous in Rancho Mirage comes at an opportune moment for the Oracle founder, because his company is challenging Amazon in court over the bidding process for a $10 billion cloud computing contract with the Pentagon that they ended up losing.</p><p>So, today, Ellison got some valuable face time in with President Trump, along with donors, some who paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to golf with the president.</p><p>Tickets for two starting at $100,000 for a tee-off with Trump. Supporters who shelled out over a quarter-of-a-million dollars got to have some alone time with the president at a roundtable. Ellison has hosted other presidents at his exclusive resort here in Rancho Mirage.</p><p>But this was unique because it sparked a revolt at his own company; 5,000 Oracle employees signed a petition trying to stop this fund-raiser from happening, and several of them logged off and walked out of work today in protest -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Hillary, thank you very, very much.</p><p>Speaking about support that Hillary just raised, we're learning now from Politico that casino mogul Sheldon Adelson is throwing his financial weight and support behind the president's reelection campaign.</p><p>He's a multibillionaire, probably one of the Republican Party's most prolific givers. He's going to be holding a March 12 fund-raiser for the president at his Las Vegas home. It's apparently a very big home, so they can invite a lot of people.</p><p>Meanwhile, another royal pain for Harry and Meghan. Let's just say they have a brand new problem.</p><p>See what I did there? It's about the brand.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: OK, fine.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we're told that Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are announcing their royal duties will officially end come March 31.</p><p>Now, this amid reports Queen Elizabeth herself took those duties away by saying the Sussex royal title that goes with their names will no longer go with it.</p><p>I have no idea what that means. But I know one of my favorite guests on this subject does. She is an encyclopedia on all things royal.</p><p>Charlie Lankston, the DailyMail.com editor.</p><p>What does this mean, that they can't use the royal what?</p><p>CHARLIE LANKSTON, EDITOR, DAILY MAIL: Yes, so they have basically Brown branded themselves as Sussex Royal.</p><p>It is the name of their very popular Instagram account and it's also the name that they wanted to use for their business ventures. So we know that they trademarked Sussex Royal for everything, from bandanas to notebooks. It's also what they wanted to call their charity venture.</p><p>So, effectively, it was their business. It was going to be that brand. And the queen has now said, no, absolutely not. You will not be...</p><p>CAVUTO: So, she personally made that decision?</p><p>LANKSTON: She personally, yes -- well, she will have had advisement from people within Buckingham Palace.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>LANKSTON: But, yes, she is the one who has said....</p><p>CAVUTO: Boy, you don't mess with the queen, do you. Yes.</p><p>LANKSTON: Absolutely not. She's a very foreboding lady. You do not mess with her.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>Does any royalty attach itself to their names though? I mean, how big a deal is that? All right. We know your royalty, though, right?</p><p>LANKSTON: Right.</p><p>Well, if you think about it, William and Kate's Instagram account is Kensington Royal. So Harry and Meghan kind of followed that pattern, but no other royal has tried to create a personal brand for themselves. They haven't needed to.</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you need that name, that label to profit off?</p><p>LANKSTON: I don't think you need it.</p><p>But I think, for Harry and Meghan, it's a bit of a kick in the teeth, because they have invested a lot of time, a lot of money, tens of thousands of dollars in creating a very shiny new Web site, in trademarking Sussex Royal with all of these different products.</p><p>And they now effectively have to go back to square one as far as creating a personal brand for themselves, so that they can gain financial independence, which is what they were so keen to do when they split from the royal family.</p><p>CAVUTO: Are they going to be worth more money or make more money in this role than as full-time royals?</p><p>LANKSTON: Absolutely.</p><p>CAVUTO: Really?</p><p>LANKSTON: I mean, yes, we understand that they -- we're talking Obama levels of finance here. They could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, if they capitalize on everything.</p><p>CAVUTO: With what? Doing what?</p><p>LANKSTON: Book deals, private speaking engagements, which they have already done, potential production deals with companies like Netflix, with Apple TV.</p><p>CAVUTO: I see.</p><p>LANKSTON: And then they also have the opportunity to kind of release merchandise, like they're talking about.</p><p>I can't imagine how many people would actually buy a hoodie that says Sussex Royal or whatever it is that they end up putting on their merchandise in the future.</p><p>CAVUTO: But does their flame ever fizzle out a little bit?</p><p>If they're out of the public eye -- and I guess you were reminding me they will always be in the public eye -- but do they lose their allure the longer they're away from the throne?</p><p>LANKSTON: I think they're playing it very well, in that they're teasing the public.</p><p>Yes, they have retired from kind of public life, as it were. But we see glimpses of them every now and then. We had photos of Harry stopping by the grocery store to pick up his lunch today.</p><p>So, we get the...</p><p>CAVUTO: By the way, that was so staged. Stop. Just stop.</p><p>LANKSTON: Yes, I can't imagine -- yes, I can't imagine that he didn't think that there would be photographers.</p><p>But I think they...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right. Did he money with him to pay for it? Because I didn't...</p><p>LANKSTON: He had staff with him. So I think -- I mean, if it was me...</p><p>CAVUTO: Staff.</p><p>LANKSTON: ... in the grocery store, I would have said, the sandwich is free.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LANKSTON: You take it, Prince Harry. It's all on you. You aren't earning money anymore. So, here, have a sandwich.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, so they're going to do well.</p><p>Where are they going to settle? Canada? What is that?</p><p>LANKSTON: So, right now, they're in Vancouver on the very exclusive Vancouver Island.</p><p>They have been looking at properties there to buy, because they're currently renting. But they have also been looking at properties in Malibu and New York, our sources tell us.</p><p>CAVUTO: Oh, wow.</p><p>LANKSTON: Now, obviously, her family is in California.</p><p>I think, if she wanted to get back into that celebrity lifestyle, California would make sense. But who knows? Right now, they aren't making any promises. But they still have four more official royal engagements in the U.K.</p><p>They will not...</p><p>CAVUTO: So, they go back to...</p><p>LANKSTON: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Where do they stay?</p><p>LANKSTON: They will stay at Frogmore Cottage, their home that they still have.</p><p>CAVUTO: That is the one that looks like Hogwarts, right?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LANKSTON: Yes, exactly, the stunning property.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, they still have that.</p><p>LANKSTON: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: It is stunning. And they had the whole thing redecorated and done for them.</p><p>LANKSTON: They did, but they have had to pay that money back.</p><p>CAVUTO: I got you.</p><p>LANKSTON: So they have technically paid for these amazing refurbishments.</p><p>So they now get to put them to full use whenever they're in the U.K.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, how do Brits feel about all this? I mean, they're like, a finger to the homeland. Right?</p><p>LANKSTON: Absolutely. People are applauding the queen.</p><p>CAVUTO: Is that right?</p><p>LANKSTON: There were tweets the wazoo, people saying, well done, they should lose their royal titles. They're no longer members of the royal family.</p><p>CAVUTO: Wow.</p><p>LANKSTON: And a lot of people are actually delighting in poking a bit of fun at them and kind of saying, like, well, you wanted to put Sussex Royal on a pair of underpants. Sorry, you can't do that anymore.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, yes. Regular pants maybe.</p><p>LANKSTON: Regular pants, yes, down the side.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: So, the brothers, are they getting along? Or are they fighting?</p><p>LANKSTON: They're doing better than they were.</p><p>CAVUTO: OK.</p><p>LANKSTON: I don't think that their relationship has gone back to the closeness that it once was, but they are speaking. They are communicating.</p><p>And William is supporting Harry in this new lifestyle that he's trying to pursue.</p><p>CAVUTO: That sounds like they're not getting along.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LANKSTON: I mean, I don't think they're as close as they once were, which is a shame.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. That was very judiciously put.</p><p>Charlie, you are the best at this. Thank you very much for taking the time.</p><p>LANKSTON: Thank you for having me.</p><p>CAVUTO: A lot more on this and the ramifications of a bigger issue here at home when we come back.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, looking live in Vegas, baby.</p><p>The Democratic candidates will pitch their plans just a few days ahead of the Nevada caucuses, which wrap up on Saturday.</p><p>What's interesting here for Republicans who say Democrats are just wasting their time, they hope to succeed on issues like health care, which galvanize their takeover of the House in the midterms. They think it can repeat here.</p><p>Beverly Hallberg joins us, The Independent Women's forum, and Jason Nichols, the Democratic strategist.</p><p>Beverly, the one thing you hear is that health care worked for us. It wasn't a wedge issue. It became the issue. And so, this way, we don't have to spend a lot of time talking about the jobs gains and everything else going on in the Trump economy. They're noteworthy. They're hard to argue again. So we're going to focus on this stuff, and maybe do better.</p><p>What do you think?</p><p>BEVERLY HALLBERG, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM: Yes.</p><p>Well, I think health care is becoming that economic issue, because what voters really care about is for their costs to go down in health care. I thought it was very fascinating this week, when Bernie Sanders went around touting his Medicare for all plan, that even the Culinary Union said they weren't going to endorse him and even said, we like our health care, and we don't want you to take it away.</p><p>So I do expect, on the debate stage tonight, in addition to the billionaire Bloomberg bashing that is going to be an abundance, for them to talk about, some of the so-called moderates to talk about their alternative to Medicare for all. This is what Amy Klobuchar is talking about.</p><p>But, regardless, Republicans are going to have to start talking about their plans for health care moving forward.</p><p>CAVUTO: Another thing that's interesting, Jason, from the Democratic perspective -- you're the expert here -- that the idea that Michael Bloomberg has not to really pick apart the economy and the numbers and the jobs gains and the markets, but to talk about, with that success and the money you can raise from these who've done very well, to get to these other goals.</p><p>How is that going to go?</p><p>JASON NICHOLS, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Well, I think Bloomberg is going to struggle tonight.</p><p>He has a whole lot to answer for, as we know, with so many issues in terms of stop and frisk. And one of the things that he's got to argue on Super Tuesday coming up is to convince African-American voters that he's on their side.</p><p>And it's going to be very difficult, when you recently said that you supported redlining, which basically destroyed African-American wealth. And then you say, OK, well, I have got a plan for that.</p><p>I think that it's going to ring hollow for him. But I think health care is a winning issue for Democrats across the board. We know that the president's handling of health care, he's at about 30 -- in the 30 percentile area in terms of approval for the way he's handled health care.</p><p>We know he's supported federal lawsuits that basically will take away protections for preexisting conditions.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: No, you raise a good point about how this could all sort out.</p><p>But I wonder, Beverly, if there will be a limit to how aggressively they go after Bloomberg. After all, this is the same guy who has promised to write a check to help the nominee, to help the party. They don't want to go too far, right?</p><p>HALLBERG: He's bought a lot of influence over the years, not just with local communities across this country, but some of those individuals he's going to be debating.</p><p>What is fascinating is, his team has already come out and said that this isn't his forte. He's not great at public speaking. So they're already downplaying the expectations just a little bit. So, hopefully -- they're hoping, even if he doesn't have a super strong showing, it won't hurt him too badly in the polls.</p><p>But, from a messaging standpoint, I do think he needs to be on that more moderate level. But he is going to be attacked tonight, because he has been gaining in the polls.</p><p>CAVUTO: No, I think you're right. And keep the expectations low.</p><p>On that, Jason, I built a career on it. So maybe he should try.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: But I'm curious.</p><p>How do you think it ends up tonight? I mean, they're fighting with each other, screaming at each other. They just endured the Iowa craziness and all. How are Democrats feeling?</p><p>NICHOLS: I think people are feeling optimistic.</p><p>I think some people are a little worried that Bloomberg is going to buy this thing. But I think, Bernie...</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, if he did, would they support him? In the end, would they live with that if he were the nominee and support him?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>NICHOLS: I think that there would be an exodus of Bernie Sanders supporters, people who wanted to see Bernie Sanders, especially if he has the most delegates and the most votes at the end of the primary season.</p><p>CAVUTO: But most doesn't mean a majority. Right? You have to get that 1,991. If he doesn't have that, it's not a birthright. Right?</p><p>NICHOLS: It's not a birthright. But, still, in elections, the people who have the most votes should win.</p><p>And it seems like most of the party, I think, would support Bernie Sanders over somebody like Mike Bloomberg, who's really just pumping money into it.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we will see. It's still early in the going. That's a whole 'nother show, a whole 'nother discussion.</p><p>Guys, I want to thank you both very, very much.</p><p>So, the big debate tonight.</p><p>\"THE FIVE\" now.</p><p>THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.

David Cicilline \u2014 the future chair of the antitrust subcommittee \u2014 introduced the antitrust 'safe harbor' bill, putting the proposal front and center as tech leviathans now prepare to face what is sure to be a barrage of hearings about privacy, election interference, algorithmic changes, and more. The antitrust 'safe harbor' bill being discussed is a response to the exponentially rising power of big tech companies acting functionally as a monopoly on the flow of information. </p><p>As Facebook and Google have risen to power (they together have been referred to by many as a 'duopoly') have a firm grasp on 56.8% of the digital advertising market according to eMarketer. This meteoric rise has made it extremely hard for smaller outlets to remain viable or even gain a foothold in the modern market. Newspapers are running op-eds and media executives are lobbying their representatives as a new Congress takes shape. What they're fighting for is permission, currently restricted by federal antitrust rules, to team up to negotiate the terms by which their content is distributed by Google and Facebook, among other demands surrounding things like customer data. The safe harbor law would lift antitrust restrictions for news outlets for four years so that they could negotiate with Facebook and Google, which are implicitly but not directly named in the proposed legislation. The issue at hand here is that these antitrust restrictions were originally put in place to prevent monopolies, but as time and technology have moved on, the 'duopoly' of Facebook and Google has completely altered the nature of the market. This bill would allow multiple news companies, once forbidden from working together, to unite and negotiate collectively against tech giants. News Media Alliance board member and Independent Journal Review member Alex Skatell observed that 'The spirit of the law was to prevent the consolidation of influence over the information that reaches us. It's laughable it hasn't been updated to reflect where we are today.'On the other hand, while enmity between Republicans and the media is at an all-time high, conservatives have their own reasons for wanting to see big tech regulated. Their support for this bill is highly dubious, but the resentment against big tech acting as a monopoly is an increasingly bipartisan realityBoth liberals and conservatives are increasingly rallying to regulate big tech, but for radically different reasons. The New York Times[3] itself recently lamented the fact that 'The alliance between Democrats and Silicon Valley has buckled and bent this year,' though notably this wasn't because of its unethical data practices or censorship, but rather because it 'allowed hateful speech, Russian propaganda and conservative-leaning 'fake news' to flourish.' The piece confessed that it sees Big Tech as obligated to curate public forums for debate and opinion in favor of left-wing initiatives and viewpoints.MRC TechWatch noted[4] the irony that the same Times article that claimed Facebook surrendered to 'misplaced Republican criticism about bias' openly acknowledges this bias that they expect Facebook to serve explicitly left wing political initiatives.Both Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)[5] and Brad Parscale[6] of the Trump campaign have voiced support for prosecuting big tech based upon Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which designates social media platforms strictly platforms rather than publishers. This designation is important because it makes countries immune to legal prosecution for illegal activity that happens on their websites. The purpose of this was to ensure that they serve as a platform for public debate. If they don't behave as platforms for vigorous public debate, then they risk being stripped of this immunity.

This bill would allow multiple news companies, once forbidden from working together, to unite and negotiate collectively against tech giants. News Media Alliance board member and Independent Journal Review member Alex Skatell observed that 'The spirit of the law was to prevent the consolidation of influence over the information that reaches us. It's laughable it hasn't been updated to reflect where we are today.'On the other hand, while enmity between Republicans and the media is at an all-time high, conservatives have their own reasons for wanting to see big tech regulated. Their support for this bill is highly dubious, but the resentment against big tech acting as a monopoly is an increasingly bipartisan realityBoth liberals and conservatives are increasingly rallying to regulate big tech, but for radically different reasons. The New York Times[3] itself recently lamented the fact that 'The alliance between Democrats and Silicon Valley has buckled and bent this year,' though notably this wasn't because of its unethical data practices or censorship, but rather because it 'allowed hateful speech, Russian propaganda and conservative-leaning 'fake news' to flourish.' The piece confessed that it sees Big Tech as obligated to curate public forums for debate and opinion in favor of left-wing initiatives and viewpoints.MRC TechWatch noted[4] the irony that the same Times article that claimed Facebook surrendered to 'misplaced Republican criticism about bias' openly acknowledges this bias that they expect Facebook to serve explicitly left wing political initiatives.Both Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)[5] and Brad Parscale[6] of the Trump campaign have voiced support for prosecuting big tech based upon Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which designates social media platforms strictly platforms rather than publishers. This designation is important because it makes countries immune to legal prosecution for illegal activity that happens on their websites. The purpose of this was to ensure that they serve as a platform for public debate. If they don't behave as platforms for vigorous public debate, then they risk being stripped of this immunity.

The BBC and ITV have stepped up to the plate with a combination of crucial public health information and smart programming to engender moments of national unity during <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/11/end-lockdown-uk-next-phase/\">lockdown</url>. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Newspapers have continued to break important stories and set the agenda for public debate. At the same time, commercial media - both newspapers and broadcasters - <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/11/end-lockdown-uk-next-phase/\">have seen a dramatic drop in advertising revenue</url> while continuing to provide a service that the public wants.</p><p>Indeed, this is a time when the public's thirst for reliable news has never been greater. </p><p>Once again Britain is going through a period where literally \"careless talk costs lives\". In a digital age, gossip can be shared at damaging break-neck speed through <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/11/end-lockdown-uk-next-phase/\">misinformation campaigns on online platforms</url>. Trusted and established news brands in a public health crisis will always have more cut-through than tweets and Facebook posts.</p><p>Although the Government has avoided specific steps to protect the media industry for many years now, the time is now right for them to take a second look.</p><p>The health of our publishers is at risk due to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/11/end-lockdown-uk-next-phase/\">ongoing loss of advertising revenue</url>, not just because of the pandemic, but also to big tech, which is headquartered in the US, with little interest for what counts as the public good in the UK.</p><p>This shift in power is undermining the informal social contract that has existed between the free press and commerce in this country for centuries: you build an audience by writing what you want, and we will pay you to engage with your readers.</p><p>There are lessons for the UK from both France and Australia. Both are taking steps to require <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/11/end-lockdown-uk-next-phase/\">online platforms to compensate publishers</url> for the benefit the platforms receive from hosting publishers' content.</p><p>Closer to home, the UK's market regulator could have a genuine and real influence on how this power game plays out. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has already pointed out that the online advertising market is stacked in favour of the tech giants at the expense of British publishers.</p><p>It is baffling that as the 60pc market-share big tech duopoly of Google and Facebook continues to eat the lunch of traditional publishers, the only challenger the big two face is Amazon, a business that has never employed a journalist or broken a news story in its existence, and which has no real incentive to support the media community.</p><p>In a vision of an even more dystopian future, news broke last month that Microsoft is replacing real journalists with artificial intelligence software.</p><p>As businesses struggle to deal with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/06/11/end-lockdown-uk-next-phase/\">the impact of Covid-19</url> it is no surprise that marketing directors are favouring the sheer scale of Google and Facebook's remarkable reach. Big tech's analytical power generates precisely targeted adverts which give them a strong competitive advantage. Standing alone without support, a single publisher struggles to compete.</p><p>Next month the CMA is due to publish its digital advertising market study. It must not pull its punches. It should call out the dominance of big tech in advertising, especially where it is undermining the public's access to diverse and reliable content.</p><p>The regulator has already waived through mergers, like the tie-up between the Mirror and the Express, which in the past it would have blanched at. It should be doing more to encourage collaboration between advertisers and platforms which offer an alternative to the existing dominance of Facebook and Google.</p><p>UK and European companies need the chance to scale up as they fight to win advertiser spend away from big tech's duopoly. Paradoxically, bigger companies in the European marketplace would boost competition, and benefit British publishers.</p><p>But government intervention is not a panacea. Publishers should identify different ways of collaborating and be more creative than just seeking to consolidate ailing businesses. The launch of Britbox illustrates how the BBC and ITV can work together in both their own commercial and national interest.</p><p>It is a pity that Project Kangaroo, a previous attempt to launch a UK competitor to Netflix more than a decade ago, was blocked on competition grounds. That decision was short-sighted and is a timely reminder that regulators need to look through the windscreen as well as the rearview mirror when judging how markets, especially dynamic digital ones, should operate in a fair and transparent manner.</p><p>Doing nothing, or worse - misguided intervention-risks the loss of some of our most cherished publications and an impoverished, and less competitive, public sphere. We must not let that happen.</p><p>                     Ed Vaizey is the former Conservative minister for culture, communications and creative industries                   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-63567458</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:603V-GKG1-F021-627C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"797\"/><timeReceived>1:29 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 11, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Brotman in his latest book, Privacy's Perfect Storm: Digital Policy for Post-Pandemic Times, published this week.</p><p>Brotman, a Distinguished Fellow at The Media Institute, argues that three forces have converged to create a \"perfect storm\" affecting privacy at a critical moment in our nation's history: the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation that affects U.S. Big Tech companies; the California Consumer Privacy Act that took effect on Jan. 1, 2020; and the \"new normal\" emerging as part of the global COVID-19 pandemic and its aftermath.</p><p>In a series of wide-ranging essays, Brotman addresses digital privacy issues specific to the pandemic such as health information and COVID-19 location data tracking. He goes on to address a broader range of privacy topics including data portability, biometric data, hacking, innovation, antitrust, 5G, the \"digital privacy divide,\" user consent, and more, all with an eye toward post-pandemic times and lessons learned from the pandemic.</p><p>Brotman concludes that a comprehensive solution to privacy concerns is unlikely to be a single piece of federal legislation, but rather a holistic \"multi-stakeholder digital privacy policy toolkit that will be broader and more durable than any particular legislative or regulatory approach.\"</p><p>A leading global expert in this field, Brotman served as a 2019-20 Fellow in the Science and Technology Innovation Program at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, D.C., focusing on digital privacy policy issues. Privacy's Perfect Storm is the culmination of his efforts at the Wilson Center.</p><p>\"Stuart Brotman brings a constructive new perspective to the digital privacy dialogue,\" said Media Institute President Richard Kaplar. \"His insights on how the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to affect digital privacy in a post-pandemic world are especially prescient.\"</p><p>As a Distinguished Fellow at The Media Institute, Brotman coordinates the program activities of the Institute's Digital Media Center and serves on the Institute's First Amendment Advisory Council.</p><p>Privacy's Perfect Storm: Digital Policy for Post-Pandemic Times is published by Miniver Press and features a foreword by former FCC chairman Newton N.

Until then, Tucker Carlson, coming up live in D.C., next.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST: Konichiwa and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. The G20 comes to Japan this week. The President arriving with the rest of the world leaders. We will be interviewing him at the end of the week and we'll bring that to when we do.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, a remarkable media story we want to bring it tonight. There was joy in newsrooms across America last week when a 75-year-old writer for \"Elle\" magazine called E. Jean Carroll came forward to accuse the President of sexually assaulting her.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Carroll made serious claims but they were confusing. She says that sometime in 1995 or 1996 -- she doesn't remember the year exactly -- Donald Trump groped her in a New York City department store.</p><p>Somehow the two wound up together in a dressing room. Carroll decided to model lingerie for Trump, a full lace outfit, she says, and then the assault took place. That's her story.</p><p>Carroll says she was devastated by what happened, but she did not report it to law enforcement for some reason, nor did she write about it though she is a writer during Trump's presidential campaign or for the last two and a half years of his presidency.</p><p>Instead, she waited nearly a quarter century to include the story in a book that is literally entitled \"What Do We Need Men For?\" In that book by the way, Carroll also accuses CBS Head Les Moonves of sexual assault.</p><p>She writes that Moonves attacked her in an elevator in Los Angeles after she had finished interviewing him for a piece in \"Esquire\" magazine. And yet, amazingly, she never mentioned the attack in the story that she wrote about Moonves.</p><p>Both Trump and Les Moonves, by the way deny that any of this ever happened, and there's no corroborating evidence that it did.</p><p>And yet according to \"The Atlantic\" and \"Huff Po\" and Stephen Colbert and countless other arbiters of American news, Carroll's allegation against the President which is a felony is quote, \"credible,\" it's a credible accusation.</p><p>Harvard graduate, Lawrence O'Donnell was so impressed by it that he gave Carroll half his show.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>E. JEAN CARROLL, ALLEGEDLY ATTACKED BY DONALD TRUMP: I wish. I had said, \"I'll tell you my age if you show me your tax returns.\"</p><p>LAWRENCE O'DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: Yes, that would have been -- so would you consider bringing a rape charge against Donald Trump for this?</p><p>CARROLL: No.</p><p>O'DONNELL: Why not?</p><p>CARROLL: I would find it disrespectful to the women who are down on the border who have been raped around the clock down there without any protection.</p><p>ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: What do you want to say to Donald Trump?</p><p>CARROLL: That terrifies me that you said that. That is -- that --</p><p>CAMEROTA: At the thought of confronting him?</p><p>CARROLL: No.</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: This is me talking.</p><p>CHRIS CUOMO, CNN ANCHOR: Yes.</p><p>LEMON: I think this is a moment of reckoning for the #MeToo Movement that people need to -- you know -- we should take everyone seriously.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: I wish I'd asked for his tax returns. \"I won't bring criminal charges because it would disrespect women at the border who are getting raped 24/7,\" end quote. Come on. This is absurd. These aren't serious statements from a rape victim. They are wacky sound bites from someone trying to sell a book. Obviously.</p><p>Last night on CNN, even Anderson Cooper appeared to realize the media were being had in the story. As people tried to interview E. Jean Carroll, she suddenly launched into a bizarre digression in which she described rape as quote, \"sexy.\" Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARROLL: So this one incident, this one what? Three minutes in this little dressing room? I just say it's a fight that way, I'm not the victim. All right, I'm not the victim.</p><p>ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: You don't feel like a victim?</p><p>CARROLL: I was not thrown on the ground and ravished, which the word \"rape\" carry so many sexual connotations. This was not sexual. It just -- it hurt. It just was --</p><p>COOPER: I think most people think of rape as, I mean, it is a violent assault. It is not --</p><p>CARROLL: I think most people think of rape as being sexy.</p><p>COOPER: Let's take a short break --</p><p>CARROLL: Think of the fantasies.</p><p>COOPER: We are just going to take a quick break, if you can stick around, we'll talk more on the other side.</p><p>CARROLL: You're fascinating to talk to you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: We're going to take a quick break. Could you imagine if that was you? How is that for the weirdest exchange of the week? You could see Cooper desperately trying to dump out into a commercial break.</p><p>When your star witness starts rambling on about rape fantasies, it's time to shut the whole thing down before it undermines your case. And they're making a case.</p><p>Asking questions might reveal the truth and of course that is literally the last thing they want to happen, ever.</p><p>Chris Plante host \"The Chris Plante Show,\" it specializes in truth. We're always happy to have him on. He joins us tonight. Chris, what do you make of that exchange?</p><p>CHRIS PLANT, HOST, THE CHRIS PLANTE SHOW: Well, that was something wasn't it? Did they go to a three-minute break? Because I'm a little curious as to how that all turned out.</p><p>It's embarrassing. I mean, these people have no credibility. Honestly, Anderson Cooper, Don Lemon for God's sake. Don Lemon theorized that the Indian Airliner that disappeared over the Indian Ocean was sucked up by a black hole and he is still on the air.</p><p>Lawrence O'Donnell, I mean, you know, come on -- the woman -- the poor woman, the poor, poor woman. She is a 75-year-old woman. She obviously doesn't quite remember exactly what happened 24 or 25 years ago. She doesn't know exactly what year it was. She knows what department store it was.</p><p>I know it's a well-populated department store with a lot of security and a lot of cameras and it seems to me, if there is something happening in Bergdorf's is it probably unlikely, but okay, and as you said, she is selling a book.</p><p>She is out making the rounds of the shows after having kept this dark secret for 24 or 25 years. And now she talks about how rape is sexy and rape fantasies and then begins flirting with Anderson Cooper. I think that's going nowhere and it's just getting weirder all the time.</p><p>And honestly, look, I mean, Tucker, you know the standard in the media for Republicans is the accusation. You look at Brett Kavanaugh, you look at any Republican. The mere accusation is enough to hang you from the tallest tree.</p><p>But at the same time across the river from where I am now in Washington, in Virginia, there's a Lieutenant Governor, a Democrat, Justin Fairfax, who has twice recently been accused very incredibly by very credible women of raping them.</p><p>And the other day -- I wish I was making this up -- he said that his career has experienced a great boost from this, his political fortunes are now greater than ever, and he is thinking about running for Governor.</p><p>So when you're a Democrat, the media actually says \"Hey, two rape accusations, maybe you should be the next Governor,\" after the guy with the Klan outfit and the blackface.</p><p>But if you're Republican, a woman falls through the ceiling tiles after 25 years is selling a book, goes on MSNBC and CNN, flirts with the anchor says that rape is sexy talks, about rape fantasies and this is considered to be good enough for prime time, at least at CNN and MSNBC, which is why no one watches this, just by the way.</p><p>CARLSON: It's embarrassing and discredits all involved. Chris Plante, great to see you tonight. Thank you for that.</p><p>PLANTE: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: You remember it well, because it was less than a year ago that the press race to believe totally unsupported accusations against Brett Kavanaugh, some of them were flagrantly insane, simply because they didn't like him.</p><p>Now it looks like they're doing the same thing again. Heather Mac Donald is the author of \"The Diversity Delusion\" and she joins us tonight. Heather, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>HEATHER MAC DONALD, AUTHOR: Hey, Tucker. Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: I can't get past a simple fact, since rape is a real thing, it is an act of violence, and there's actually quite a bit of it in the United States. Some of this downplayed by the way as you well know. I can't get over the fact that people accuse rape 25 years or 20 years after the fact. If you were raped, which is a felony, don't you have an obligation to the rest of our society to put that person behind bars? To protect the rest of your neighbors, don't you?</p><p>MAC DONALD: Yes. Carroll's explanation for why she does not want to go forward with a police investigation is completely preposterous and just shows how deeply politicized this is.</p><p>She is somehow trying to bring in the Trump created crisis on the border. She says, well, so many women are getting raped at the border as a reason for the police not to look into a rape investigation.</p><p>We are living, Tucker, in a world of weaponized feminism. Obviously, sexual assault is real. But this case simply does not stand up to any kind of credible investigation.</p><p>I think reporters should be asking questions. This was a woman at 52, who by all her own account in a '95 \"Esquire\" article has plenty of experience with men, believe you me, and she agrees to go into a dressing room to try on a piece of see-through lingerie because by her explanation, she thinks she is going to persuade Trump to put it on over his pants and great coat.</p><p>This is preposterous. This is a woman who now says she wants to live in a world without men. Her book is going around asking women, why do we need men?</p><p>She got the inspiration because the women writing into her advice column blamed all of their problems on men. Imagine if a man blamed all of his problems on women, he would be viewed as a whiner and somebody not really in touch with his own situation.</p><p>CARLSON: Correctly.</p><p>MAC DONALD: But feminism now is being used as a way to take out politicians we don't like and to try to change the culture radically.</p><p>CARLSON: So why would the press go along with that? Why wouldn't someone during the course of an interview particularly if you gave over half your show as apparently an MSNBC anchor did to these allegations? Why wouldn't you press the person on the question of reporting the crime?</p><p>How could you have let 25 years go by knowing that this guy is capable of rape and she did, by the way alleged rape in her book, you can read the excerpt online, it's rape.</p><p>MAC DONALD: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: Why wouldn't someone press her on that?</p><p>MAC DONALD: We're all in -- the press is in resist mode. The press is also in belief survivor's mode. Again, the feminists have decreed, contrary to the traditions of Western jurisprudence that any female who alleges rape is entitled to unquestioning belief.</p><p>This is a complete reversal of the principles that have made Western civilization the beacon of success that it is, but the feminists tell us that those principles have to be junked in order to empower women and to destroy the male patriarchy.</p><p>So the press is on board with this. We saw this with the Kavanaugh hearings and the Christine Blasey Ford as you said, Tucker. This is sort of the fumes of Brett Kavanaugh hearings played out again by somebody who aspires by your own book to be the Emma Sulkowicz of her time.</p><p>She is jealous of the Columbia students who falsely accused another Columbia student of rape and then carried her mattress around with her. This Carroll believes this was one of the greatest arch exhibits of all time.</p><p>So you know, #MeToo want to be who is getting her place in the sun.</p><p>CARLSON: Heather Mac Donald, thank you for all the work you've done to try and save our civilization from collapse. Great to see you.</p><p>MAC DONALD: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: The press has gone to great lengths, as we said to describe Carroll's bizarre allegations as quote \"credible,\" but they've had almost no time at all to assess would appear to be actually credible claims about Ilhan Omar in what looks like immigration fraud. We'll have more in that story later in the hour.</p><p>New investigation has exposed Google's efforts to make sure the 2020 election goes the way it wants -- we know which way that is -- who naturally is doing its best to suppress and hide the story and lie about it. It's just ahead as we continue live tonight from Tokyo ahead of the President's visit to world leaders in Japan. After those meetings will see him here on this program. We'll be right back.</p><p>CARLSON: Welcome back to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT live from Tokyo, Japan ahead of the President's visit and our interview with the G20 Summit in Osaka.</p><p>Back in America, a tech story that might seem insignificant, but is not. In fact, it may determine what happens in the next presidential election, it very well may. A Google whistleblower has come forward to describe his company's plans to remake the American political landscape. Google, of course, is the most powerful company in the world.</p><p>So when an anonymous whistleblower comes forward, in this case, telling Project Veritas that Google is using internal algorithms to shape what Americans see online, and by extension, what they think, you better take it seriously.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fairness is a dog whistle, it does not mean what you think that it means and you have to apply doublethink in order to understand what they're really saying.</p><p>What they're really saying about fairness is that they have to manipulate their search results, so it gives them the political agenda that they want, and so they have to re-bias their algorithms so that they can -- they can get their agenda across.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: That's the definition of propaganda, again, being perpetuated by the single most powerful company in the history of the world.</p><p>This is not surprising to viewers of this show, James Damore was fired for Google for his political views, his totally conventional, moderate political views and then came on this show to describe the culture at Google. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAMES DAMORE, ENGINEER FIRED BY GOOGLE: There are definitely some political biases within Google that I was trying to shed light on in the document, and that they affect many parts of the business and for example, who they do business with, and what type of content they create, and I really think that those political biases need to be addressed.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: It's not just whistleblowers -- excuse me, hidden camera footage obtained by Project Veritas shows a conversation with a woman called Jen Gennai. Her Google title is Head of Responsible Innovations in the Global Affairs Department.</p><p>In that video, Gennai says that Google is working specifically on products to make certain that Donald Trump does not win another election. Quote, \"We're also training our algorithms like if 2016 happened again ... would the outcome be different? People were not putting that line in the sand ... that they were not saying that what's fair and what's equitable, so we're like, well, we're a big company, we're going to say it.\"</p><p>In other words, we're going to try and affect the outcome of the 2020 presidential campaign. Gennai goes on to blast Elizabeth Warren's proposal to break Google up into two companies. Why? Check out this reasoning, quote, \"All these smaller companies who don't have the same resources that we do will be charged with preventing the next Trump situation. It's like a small company cannot do that.\"</p><p>So using a company's dominance on the internet to sway the outcome of an election. That's their plan. There should be a term for what Gennai is describing. It turns out there is a term, it's a term you've heard constantly from talking heads on television for more than two years. It's called hacking an election. Google wants to hack our election. They're saying that out loud.</p><p>As we've been told over and over again by CNN and \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times\" and all the other propagandists. Hacking an election is very bad, at minimum it warrants a multiyear investigation by law enforcement agencies. And yet, it's happening now.</p><p>The Washington establishment has said they want to prevent election interference. But of course, that's a lie. They just want to make sure they control the elections. That's their only goal. That's what they're not attacking the real source of election interference, which is Silicon Valley.</p><p>GoogleFacebook and their ilk, they have far more political power than Russia ever has or ever will have. No serious person doubts that.</p><p>But the people in charge of our country don't care about any of that. Because when Google meddles in an election, Democrats benefit.</p><p>By the way, if you want to find that video, you can't access it on YouTube. Google took it down. That's not surprising. You can already be tossed off of YouTube and Facebook if you decide they're using speech they don't, like they'll accuse you of hate speech, whatever that means.</p><p>Now they can toss you off their sites just for putting up videos that make you look bad. They probably won't be banning any DNC videos anytime soon, you can be certain of that.</p><p>Meanwhile, this week, Ravelry, a knitting social networking website with eight million members banned all explicit support for Donald Trump and only for Donald Trump, and they got away with it. And because they have gotten away with it, other platforms almost certainly will do the same thing.</p><p>All of this is going on flagrantly in public, but most Republicans haven't even responded to it. They haven't reacted at all.</p><p>As soon as the 2016 election was over, the press and Big Tech openly began plotting on how to control the narrative in 2020, which is another way of saying control the election outcome in 2020, and using the scapegoat of fake news as an excuse to control the public discourse.</p><p>Republicans were in charge of Congress at the time, they did nothing. The White House commands a vast regulatory apparatus. They've sat motionless and done nothing. The only Republican is seems even interested at all in the subject and keeping Big Tech in check at all is new senator Josh Hawley, he just introduced a bill that would force tech companies to act as genuinely open platforms in order to receive valuable regulatory benefits. That's the deal. They're violating the deal, nobody else seems to care.</p><p>Passing Hawley's bill does not seem to be a conservative priority, though, no one in Congress is talking about it. That's a big mistake.</p><p>Successful political parties look out for their supporters and for the public at large and protect them from harm. Republicans, meanwhile, are sitting in a stupefied fog of libertarianism, doing nothing while their ideas are suppressed, and their supporters are silenced.</p><p>One day, they'll look up and find they have no supporters at all, who will be the blame for that? Only themselves.</p><p>Dr. Robert Epstein is not a Republican, but he is the preeminent researcher into the subject. He's a senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, and he is again, the world's great expert on the effect of the tech companies on political discourse. He joins us today. Dr. Epstein, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>ROBERT EPSTEIN, SENIOR RESEARCH PSYCHOLOGIST, AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY: Always a pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: Seeing this video tape, reading the quotes from this Google executive, does this confirm what you've said in the past? Are you surprised by this? What's your response?</p><p>EPSTEIN: I'm not surprised, in the least. It confirms in glowing terms, or in very ugly terms, if you want to look at it that way that Google not only has the power to shift opinions and votes on a massive scale, but they exercise this power and this is what I measure in my research.</p><p>So I can tell you fairly precisely how many votes they can shift, I can tell you fairly precisely how many votes they shifted in 2018.</p><p>CARLSON: So why is that not hacking an election?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well, it's not hacking an election right now because Google and similar companies like Facebook are completely unregulated in the United States, so they can do whatever they please.</p><p>And if they all work together in 2020 to support the same presidential candidate, which is very likely, and probably it'll be a candidate that I support, by the way, they can shift upwards of 15 million votes with no one knowing that they've been manipulated and without leaving a paper trail for authorities to trace.</p><p>CARLSON: So that's it. There's no election at that point. Our democracy is not real if that's allowed to happen, correct?</p><p>EPSTEIN: Well, democracy becomes an illusion. Now, there are actions one can take. I've set up so far, the only two big monitoring systems that anyone has built to actually look over people's shoulder as they're doing election related online activities, and to aggregate that information and see what they are being shown by these big companies.</p><p>Now in 2020, I'm actually trying right now to raise funds to build a large scale monitoring system to keep an eye on these companies and to catch them in the act, literally catch them, when they are manipulating votes and opinions. And in my opinion, that's the only way we can stop them. There are no laws in place that can stop them at the moment.</p><p>CARLSON: Calling attention to it might be the first step and you've done more than anyone who do that. Dr. Epstein, thank you very much.</p><p>EPSTEIN: My pleasure.</p><p>CARLSON: Dave Rubin hosts \"The Rubin Report\" on YouTube. The Google whistleblower says that his channel is one of the channels that Google's algorithms worked to suppress. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And right after that happened, a lot of the content creator started to get demonetized and their video started to get deranked. I'm talking about Dave Rubin.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Dave Rubin himself joins us tonight. What do you make of that, Dave, when you hear that?</p><p>DAVE RUBIN, HOST, THE RUBIN REPORT: Tucker, I guess you didn't know when you came to my house to do my show, to my little garage studio and you played with my dog and saw my backyard chickens, you didn't know what a crazed right-wing radical I was. So I'm glad that we've gotten that out there.</p><p>Look, of course, this is complete nonsense. I mean, we've discussed this many times. I am an old school liberal. So this is not like I'm some far lefty and I'm not some far righty. I'm a pretty moderate guy. I've tried to build some bridges here.</p><p>And even that now is becoming too extreme for what Google and YouTube are allowing to happen. One of the things that I've done that I'm most proud of actually is I've had conservatives on my show like you, like Dennis Prager, Ben Shapiro, et cetera and I've treated you guys with respect and decency. And that really is what the mainstream media and sort of \"The New York Times\" and CNN crew doesn't want people to see. They just want to create a character of all of you guys.</p><p>So that's sort of why they're coming after me, but I will say this, just moments before we started here, I just got notified that Susan Wojcicki, who is the CEO of YouTube, she actually followed me on Twitter.</p><p>So I've got over a million subscribers on there and I don't have as much of as an e-mail address of someone at YouTube. But maybe I am starting to make some headway now.</p><p>And you know, quickly, to your point on where sort of libertarians are at right now, I think there's an interesting moment here where generally small government people, and I think you're sort of in that group too, you know, our limits are being pushed on what small government actually means.</p><p>And for me, I would always prefer a private answer to this and competition. But maybe there has to be a sort of two-pronged approach where politicians are putting pressure and then public people are putting pressure, and we can maybe make these companies sort of be a little more transparent, be a little more open, which really is all anyone is asking for here.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I'd bring them to heal by force tomorrow. I wouldn't -- I have a libertarian solution, I think, but we're past that time. Would you allow a power company to say we're denying you electricity because you voted for someone we don't like. Of course, you wouldn't allow that.</p><p>RUBIN: Well, I think that's --</p><p>CARLSON: The utilities exist because the government allows them to exist.</p><p>RUBIN: I think that's a totally valid argument.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>RUBIN: Yes, I think that's a totally valid argument --</p><p>CARLSON: That's just my moral.</p><p>RUBIN: Yes, you know, as my friend Eric Weinstein says, it's like one day, are we going to get to the point where our Republicans are going to be allowed to have phones in their homes? I mean, that's sort of where we're heading with all of this.</p><p>CARLSON: No, exactly.</p><p>RUBIN: My preference would be that these companies through public pressure will move. But you might be right. And I actually, I think that's just an incredibly rich debate that we should be having more often.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, I never thought I'd say that, but they've pushed us all. Dave Rubin. Great to see you.</p><p>RUBIN: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So do you hate fun? Are you not bored enough at work? Do you have a strange desire to inflict suffering upon yourself, but you're somehow unable to fulfill it? Don't worry, we have an answer for you. Eighteen Hollywood actors have banded together to create a 10-act play in which they read all 448 pages of the Mueller report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Robert Mueller says the report speaks for itself. Tonight, that voice resonates through our cast of remarkable actors.</p><p>GROUP: Ten-Acts of Obstruction.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Some people came to a different conclusion, like Attorney General Bill Barr.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: The malignant pomposity of the modern left, totally lacking self- awareness. It's really -- it's beyond parody, the play if you can call it that was performed live in New York. But don't worry, in case you're needing help getting to sleep, you can watch the video of the entire hour long performance online. Of course, you're going to want to again and again.</p><p>Well, following President Trump's cancelled I.C.E. raids, the left is more brazen on immigration than ever before. They want open borders. They're saying that out loud for everyone, no matter what the consequences. That's next. Live from Tokyo. We'll be right back.</p><p>CARLSON: Welcome back to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT live this whole week from Japan ahead of the President's visit here. Right now though, back in the U.S., the President signaled that he might try to enforce the nation's immigration laws. In response, Democrats are outraged and basically have become straightforward about what they really want, open borders.</p><p>On \"Face the Nation,\" Senator Bernie Sanders signaled that all deportations are morally unacceptable even for those who've gone to court and been told to leave this country legally. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARGARET BRENNAN, CBS NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: There are I.C.E. raids set to start. Estimates of some 2,000 people or so who will be targeted. Is this appropriate?</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: No, it's not. It is absolutely not appropriate.</p><p>BRENNAN: But specifically on this point, the 2,000 that are supposed to be targeted haven't shown up for court dates. So essentially they're not following the asylum process, the legal standards when they're here. So should they be prosecuted? Should they be deported?</p><p>SANDERS: I don't like this deportation thing at all, and I think Trump uses this as a beginning to do worse things to come.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: What a buffoon he has become. What a buffoon. Not to be outdone, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who was even more blunt about it repeatedly and flagrantly breaking our laws, even after coming here illegally is not a reason to make someone leave, she said, watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): When I saw that the President was going to have these raids, I mean, it's so appalling, it's outside the circle of civilized human behavior to just be kicking down doors, splitting up families, and the rest of that; in addition to the injustices that are happening at the border. We have legislation to go forward to address those needs.</p><p>A violation of status is not a reason for deportation.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Google the phrase \"out of touch rich person\" and her picture emerges, and yet still, her position is not the most extreme in the Democratic Party right now. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, her faction, the House is demanding that Congress cut off funds to the Border Patrol.</p><p>In other words, open borders are no longer enough, soon it will be literal, open borders for real. What will happen to the country at that point?</p><p>Jason Johnson is the founder of J2 Strategies. He is also a former adviser to Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, and he joins us tonight. Jason, thanks very much for coming on.</p><p>JASON JOHNSON, FOUNDER, J2 STRATEGIES: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: So it's hard to know whether they mean this or not because if you are to take what the Democratic Party and not even the wacko left online, but elected Democratic office holders are saying on television, if you were to take it seriously, what would happen to America?</p><p>JOHNSON: It's out of control. It's crazy. You have the leader and make no mistake, Tucker, AOC is the leader of today's Democratic Party. As you know, coming out and labeling detention centers, quote, unquote, \"concentration camps.\" So we shouldn't be surprised when the Speaker of her party and the leading Democratic socialist candidate for President falls in line with AOC.</p><p>And I tell you, the more they fall in line with AOC, Tucker, the more out of touch they are with the American public. There's a recent Gallup poll that shows for the first time, immigration and illegal aliens were the highest mention when asked in an open-ended fashion to the American public, what's the biggest problem facing the United States? You know, the only thing to beat it out? Government? That was it.</p><p>CARLSON: So this is absolutely destroying America, and there's really kind of no question about it if you just look at the trajectory.</p><p>JOHNSON: Absolutely.</p><p>CARLSON: The Republicans are doing nothing about it, nothing. So why would any Republican member of the United States Senate for example, who isn't making this a top priority? Why would that person get votes from any conservative ever again?</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes, I can't imagine. Look, as you know, Tucker, the goalpost have been moved so much in this immigration debate. A decade ago, we were talking about whether or not to grant amnesty for those in the country illegally.</p><p>Now, we have, as you just pointed out Republicans in the Senate, who are advancing a bill, right, after the President requested help with this crisis that doesn't even provide a dime for border security.</p><p>And I tell you, we have a senator here in the State of Texas, who is up for reelection in 2020, and they need to pay attention, they need to get out of their D.C. bubble and realize, they're not only out of touch with conservatives, they're not only out of touch with moderate Republicans, they are out of touch with mainstream Americans when it comes to border security and immigration.</p><p>CARLSON: That's right. Because it's not a partisan question. It's do you care about America or not? Honestly, that's where we are. Jason, thank you very much. Great to see you tonight.</p><p>JOHNSON: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Wind energy is a key component of Green New Deal, but would wind power save the environment or devastate the environment? We hit the road to investigate that question. It's just ahead as we continue to broadcast from beautiful Tokyo, Japan. We'll be right back.</p><p>CARLSON: Thanks to relentless flogging by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Green New Deal -- whatever that is -- is rapidly becoming orthodoxy on the left. What would it mean to implement it? Well, even the most basic version of the Green New Deal would require shutting down most existing power sources in this country, and replacing them with so called renewables such as wind.</p><p>That sounds appealing, but what would actually happen to the environment, our economy and the people who live here if we tried to do that? Well, to find out, the show recently spoke to commercial fishermen. They described the harmful effect that green energy, wind energy has had on their livelihood and critically on the ocean itself. Watch this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CARLSON (voice over): Wes Townsend has been fishing off the coast of Delaware for more than four decades. Now, thanks to federal climate policy, this livelihood may become extinct. America's entire commercial fishing industry could go with it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WES TOWNSEND, COMMERCIAL FISHERMAN: This could be the end of our business. Some we've worked our whole lives for that all of a sudden now, our boats aren't going to be worth anything, our permits aren't going to be worth anything.</p><p>GEORGE TOPPING, COMMERCIAL FISHERMAN: It's going to destroy the ocean.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON (voice over): Wind farms have the potential to gravely harm the environment. Researchers in Britain found that the noise caused by building the wind farms limited the abilities of sea bass coordinate their movement with one another and made them vulnerable to predators.</p><p>Marine experts have blamed wind farms for whales found washed up on shore. They also pose serious safety hazards to mariners around the world.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MEGHAN LAPP, SEAFREEZE FISHERIES LIAISON: Navigation is going to become very unreliable. In most countries, they do not allow vessels inside wind farms or in the vicinity of wind farms for navigational reasons.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON (voice over): In the name of saving the Earth, big corporations are harming the environment. Many have sounded the alarm about this, but so far lobbying dollars from energy companies have prevailed.</p><p>Plants have now been approved to install massive new wind farms along the East Coast of the United States, one near Martha's Vineyard could be the largest in the world.</p><p>This offshore wind project will take up roughly 1,400 square miles that's larger than the state of Rhode Island.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LAPP: They're being cited on prime commercial fishing grounds without any regard for preexisting uses.</p><p>You will not be able to fish during construction and most commercial fishing vessels will not be able to fish after construction either.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON (voice over): Congressman Andy Harris represents Maryland's Eastern Shore in Congress. He has called for a Federal study investigating the effect of these wind farms.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. ANDY HARRIS (R-MD): Offshore wind makes no economic sense without Federal taxpayer subsidies. The bottom line is, it is one of the most expensive ways to generate electricity.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON (voice over): So the question is, if we're going to install wind farms that will destroy natural fisheries, crush a multibillion dollar industry and create eyesores on beaches up and down the coast, who benefits exactly?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARRIS: One of the other problems with these Federal tax subsidies is the owners of these wind farms all turned out to be global, international, you know, offshore foreign companies. The bottom line is, we're going to have American taxpayer dollars flowing to these foreign companies.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON (voice over): Fishermen on the East Coast of the United States have one final hope that President Trump will get involved.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOPPING: What happened to America first? I thought this President and everybody else said let's put -- let's protect Americans. That's what we are -- honest, hardworking Americans. Let's stop this. At least put a study to it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CARLSON: Whatever happened to America first? Good question. There's another side of the story. There always is another side to every store. We'd like to hear it. We welcome anyone representing commercial windfarms to come on the show anytime to explain why they're good for Americans, and by the way why they are good for the environment -- for the fish. Good question.</p><p>Well, CNN and MSNBC are utterly obsessed with these new and bizarre allegations against the President, why are they ignoring actual allegations -- apparently real ones -- against Congresswoman Ilhan Omar of Minneapolis. That's next.</p><p>Plus, the NBA has announced it is banning the word \"owners.\" We will explain their bizarre reasoning just ahead. Live from Tokyo, Japan. We'll be right back.</p><p>CARLSON: Welcome back from Tokyo. If you've been watching the news recently, you've noted that CNN, MSNBC, the network news, all spent the last week aggressively covering salacious, but apparently kind of demented allegations against the President.</p><p>They have done virtually nothing though on far more believable allegations against Congresswoman Ilan Omar of Minnesota. We are all the way off in Japan and even we were able to cover that.</p><p>Newly obtained documents have bolstered the theory that Omar's second marriage may have been fraudulent. Scott Johnson has been on the story from day one, doing the most important reporting on it. He is an attorney in Minnesota. He blogs at Power Line. And we're happy to have him join us tonight.</p><p>Scott, thanks a lot for coming on. So explain this to us and how -- you often mentioned that on any -- not on The \"New York Times\" site, but of Omar and her brother. What is his role in the story?</p><p>SCOTT JOHNSON, COLUMNIST, POWER LINE: Well, that's a difficult question. I wanted to take just a step back. The person we're talking about is named Ahmed Elmi and he may or may not be her brother.</p><p>But since Omar emerged as a public figure in August of 2016, I and then Priya Shyamsundar and now David Steinberg, have been following a trail of evidence suggesting that Omar entered into a sham marriage in 2009, with Ahmed Elmi, and as I say he may or may not be her brother.</p><p>Now, I asked her that in in 2016, when she won the DFL primary here to enter the state legislature and what I got back from her was a nonresponse accusation of bigotry.</p><p>Fast forward three years to last -- the last two weeks. Two weeks ago, the Minnesota State Campaign Finance Board, having investigated her 2016 campaign for over a year issued findings including coincidentally that she filed joint tax returns in 2014 and 2015 with Ahmed Elmi -- I'm sorry with her husband number one whom she never really married with the guy who was not her husband while she was married to Ahmed Elmi.</p><p>And I say, let that sink in. I have to concentrate when I'm telling you that. She filed a joint tax return in 2014 and 2015 with a guy she was not married to while she was married to another guy, the other guy being Ahmed Elmi, who may or may not be her brother.</p><p>Now what's happened most recently this past --</p><p>CARLSON: Wait. May I stop you right there.</p><p>JOHNSON: Sure. So who may or may not be her brother? Why has it taken us three years looking into this, we still don't know whether this guy is her brother? Has she never responded to that direct question before?</p><p>JOHNSON: Tucker, she has issued statements written for her by other people saying -- denying that he is her brother and saying that's disgusting. She has refused to sit for an interview. She has refused to produce any papers to anyone.</p><p>And most recently \"The Star Tribune\" this past Sunday, which did a serious story, not a perfect story, but a serious 3,000 words story into this whole chain of events leading to the Campaign Finance Board investigation and findings that are referred to, to which she refused to sit for an interview. She refused to produce documents. She refused to say word one except a statement issued by her congressional spokesman, accusing \"The Star Tribune\" of colluding with me and Power Line in anti-Muslim bigotry, which is farcical. They have treated her like a hometown hero until last Sunday.</p><p>CARLSON: People show up in this country as refugees and the first thing they learn -- the first thing -- is how to accuse the country that welcomed them in of racism. Who came up with the system?</p><p>Anyway, Scott Johnson, thank you so much.</p><p>JOHNSON: It's a new assimilation.</p><p>CARLSON: For all the work that you've done on this, and -- yes, the new assimilation. Exactly. It's unbelievable. Good to see Scott. Thank you.</p><p>Well, Adam Silver, who is the NBA Commissioner has just announced that from now on the league will no longer use the word \"owner\" to describe those who own NBA franchises. Those companies now can't be owned. They'll be run by Governors, since the concept of owning a team is supposedly disrespectful, because the league has so many black players. Does that make sense? It doesn't matter. Al Sharpton is happy with it. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AL SHARPTON, ACTIVIST: I think that it is understandable, given the history of the country, and many of the NBA players are descendants of people that were then slaves. When we hear the term \"owner,\" it's a much different connotation than other people because some of us have now done our ancestral research, and found that our great grandparents and grandparents did have owners.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: No word on how much money Sharpton is getting from the NBA, I am willing to bet money that's quite a bit. We don't know. Lawrence Jones though is the editor-in-chief of campusreform.com and he joins us tonight. Lawrence, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>LAWRENCE JONES, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Thanks, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: So NBA players, some of the richest people in America, now we're finding out are actually oppressed by the term \"owner.\" Do you think not using the term owner will make this a much better country?</p><p>JONES: No, it's not going to make this a better country. I think most people -- reasonable people -- will understand that people that put in the lead word, buy shares, and companies become the owner of these companies.</p><p>I mean, we're talent just like NBA players and we have ownership at Fox News. It's just part of what comes when you know, you work for another company. I would like to quote Tyler Perry, he says, \"Own your own business. Own your own way.\"</p><p>Many of these players have their own businesses that they call themselves the owners because they put all the money in and they should. But I think this goes to the other natural conversation, a lot of these players want black owners, and there should be, but you've got to put in the work here and I think there's a lot of rich black folks that are willing to buy these seats.</p><p>Hell, I want to be an owner of an NBA team one day, and I think that's where the conversation needs to go. Not this stupid conversation to suggest that just because you own a brand, which is what the NBA is saying. They own the copyright of the logos, the franchise, and they pay players to go out there because of their talent and ability. And these players exercise great judgment by hiring agents to negotiate hefty contracts as they should.</p><p>So this this is not a slave term. This is just a basic business term.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, of course, they own a company with employees. That's not the same as slavery in which people aren't paid in human beings are owned. And that's why it's immoral. It is the opposite, of course of slavery. They're being paid for their work.</p><p>JONES: That's exactly right.</p><p>CARLSON: So wouldn't the NBA owners be brave enough to stand up to this nonsense and say, you know, knock it off? This is a company, I own the company?</p><p>JONES: Well, because, again, this just shows you the amount of influence that players have on that. I mean, can you -- can you -- let's just go back historically. Can you imagine a slave having that ability to go tell the masses on the plantation that they couldn't do that? That's how ridiculous their analogy to slavery that it is.</p><p>These players, again, like I said, they have a lot of influence. They have million-dollar -- millions of dollar contract. And again, the argument is for black ownership, I'm all for it. But that's not the argument here. This is political correctness gone wild.</p><p>CARLSON: You know that's not the argument.</p><p>JONES: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: It's totally nuts. Lawrence, great to see you tonight. Thank you for that.</p><p>JONES: Thanks, brother.</p><p>CARLSON: That's it for us tonight from beautiful Tokyo in the Two Rooms Bar and Grill. We are traveling to Kyoto tomorrow so we will join you from there. We'll be back tomorrow at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink.</p><p>Happy Wednesday morning from Tokyo. Sean Hannity right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019062501cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WDY-PX81-DXH2-61YJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7435\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 25, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Google Internet China As part of its plans for GDPR, Google would offload to publishers the burden of getting user consent for the data collection that is at the core of how Google's ad-serving business operates.<br/> The company has irked publishers by saying that rather than being a \"processor\" of data as defined by GDPR, it wants to be a \"controller,\" giving it more ability to use information such as reader data for its own purposes.<br/> \"Your proposal severely falls short on many levels,\" publisher groups wrote to Google chief executive Sundar Pichai, adding that it \"would undermine the fundamental purposes of the GDPR and the efforts of publishers to comply with the letter and spirit of the law.\"<br/> Signing the five-page letter, which ends on several questions to Google, were Digital Content Next, European Publishers Council, News Media Alliance and News Media Association.<br/> They represent about 4,000 newspapers and media companies, primarily in Europe and North America, including Axel Springer, Telegraph Media Group, New York Times, Associated Press and Thomson Reuters.<br/> Google could not be immediately reached for comment.<br/> Publishers could in principle move to rival services if they do not like Google's terms. But Google's network is unrivaled in size and can often generate more revenue for publishers than competitors' offering.<br/> Publishers said that Google's requirement that publishers obtain consent on behalf of Google and its business partners in the ad-serving sector could enable the search giant to dictate what constitutes consent and which other ad services a publisher can use.<br/> They note that GDPR does permit tracking of users without their permission for certain reasons, including serving \"a legitimate interest\" such as combating account fraud or measuring marketing efforts. Yet Google is insisting on affirmative consent in all cases.<br/> GDPR violations can carry hefty fines, and publishers wrote that Google's terms could multiply their exposure to \"potentially ruinous\" judgements by leaving them liable for misuse by Google and its partners.<br/> Google said on its website Thursday that its uses of data continue to be controlled by contracts with publishers and account settings managed by them.<br/> The company already requires publishers to obtain certain consents from European users and that it is updating those requirements in line with the GDPR, Google said.<br/> Google said it is providing optional tools to help publishers meet the requirements.<br/> Jason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next, said the statements show that at a time of heightened awareness about online privacy, \"these big tech behemoths are focused on protecting their massive collection of personal data rather than aligning with the spirit of these new rules and raising the bar on consumer trust\".<br/> Smaller players in the digital advertising supply chain say they are concerned that Google could limit working with them if publishers have not obtained consent on their behalf.<br/> \"What's concerning is when they push publishers to interpret GDPR only the way Google interprets it,\" said Joshua Koran, managing director at technology firm Sizmek, which works closely with advertisers.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INFOTC-n10488040</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INFOTC2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S77-5MJ1-DYDW-71JH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">423499</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"655\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Infotechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 1, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002EUA</classCode><className>THOMSON REUTERS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000262S</classCode><className>ASSOCIATED PRESS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>TRI (TSX)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>TRI (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000028</classCode><className>MARKETING &amp;

And PR has always communicated that reality in an interesting and compelling way.

But doing so is made impossible by the antitrust laws,\" Pitofsky said.</p><p>Pitofsky said he is hopeful for \"reinvigorated antitrust enforcement\" but noted that this would \"require years of investigation and litigation.\"</p><p>\"In the interim, news publishers need a fighting chance. The Journalism Competition and Preservation Act is well-designed to help restore the proper balance between content generators and content distributors.\"</p><p>Gene Kimmelman of the consumer group Public Knowledge said the news sector's woes are deep but should be resolved through market forces.</p><p>\"We do not believe this problem will be solved by allowing more consolidation of power, whether among platforms or media,\" Kimmelman said.</p><p>\"And we believe exceptions to the antitrust laws should be a tool of last resort, if they are ever used.

We bring you the latest as the media continues to speculate without proof that President Trump canceled his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin not because of Russia's escalating aggression against the Ukraine, but because of the guilty pleas of Michael Cohen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This as fears rise of a Russian invasion into the Ukraine. Ukraine now banning Russian men age 16 to 60 from the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Steve Hilton fired up over that and the misleading reporting he says is coming from the beltway media.</p><p>Plus, watch out, Silicon Valley. We've got breaking news on brand-new calls out of Europe for a special counsel like Robert Mueller to get to the bottom of the problems at Facebook and other tech giants once and for all. They got new demands to break them up. We're on it.</p><p>To the Democrat battle plan to take down Trump. Did you know that Democrats have already lobby -- lobbed, rather, more than five dozen subpoenas at the president?</p><p>Tonight, Republican Congressman Darrell Issa joins me on that. And on James Comey's fight over his hearing before Congress. is Michael Cohen what his guilty is all about, is that the smoking gun against President Trump or not. Even a New York times op-ed and a CNN anchor says they don't see it just yet.</p><p>Bill McGurn of the Wall Street Journal joins us with his take and much more.</p><p>To tensions at the border. The beltway media criticized for downplaying the crisis. But we've got shocking new numbers about just how lethal those drugs are that are pouring over the border. You won't believe the stunning number.</p><p>And to even mayhem at the border. A 100-mile-an-hour car chases with illegals. Chinese illegals coming ashore in a boat on a California beach. We've got former top border patrol Thomas Homan ready to go on that.</p><p>Well, thank you so much for joining us. Thank you for watching. Money, politics, we've got the debate behind tomorrow's headlines. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. The Evening Edit starts right now.</p><p>Welcome to the show. You are watching the Fox Business Network.</p><p>The Dow closing up nearly 200 points. Its best week since the election. That's ahead of President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping meeting face-to-face possibly over a trade deal tomorrow at the G20 summit. The president signed a trade PAC today at the G20.</p><p>Lots of action at the G20. Let's go right to Blake Burman. He is there in Argentina with more. Blake?</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi, there, Liz. And the ebbs and flows with President Trump and China and his position as to whether or not both sides could potentially break this trade's stalemate continue today.</p><p>Do you remember yesterday, back at the White House before President Trump got on board Air Force One to come here to the G20 in Buenos Aires, he said he thinks that the United States and China are close on a trade deal, but that he might not necessarily want it because the current situation right now has billions of dollars flowing into the U.S. treasury due to tariffs.</p><p>However, once he got here in Argentina today, the president striking much different tone.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: We'll be meeting with China as you know, yes, we'll be meeting tomorrow. And we've already spoken. And we are working very hard. If we can make a deal, that will be good. I think they want to and I think we'd like to, and we'll see.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: The president's top trade rep, Bob Lighthizer saying today that he has no reason to believe why the dinner meeting between President Trump and President Xi tomorrow night won't be a success. Adding, he thinks at the end of it there will a, quote, \"positive feeling.\"</p><p>Still many questions surrounding that potential trade deal. But the president celebrating a victory on a much different one today.</p><p>The president beginning his day here in Buenos Aires by signing the USMCA. Standing alongside him Canada's Justin Trudeau and the outgoing Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. While the president was able to celebrate one of his signature achievements today, there is still much more room for him to go on this one. Back at home at least as Congress will still weigh in on it come 2019, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Great to see you, Blake. Good reporting there, sir.</p><p>Let's get to the next story. The media without proof saying President Trump avoided Russia's Putin because of the Michael Cohen guilty plea. The administration is again saying today. The real reason is Russian aggression against Ukraine.</p><p>Let's bring in Steve Hilton, host of FNC's The Next Revolution. Great to see you, Steve. Thanks for coming on. What's your take--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STEVE HILTON, FOX NEWS HOST: Hi, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: What's your take on this?</p><p>HILTON: Honestly, Liz, I think this is one of the most laughable examples of Trump derangement syndrome we've ever seen. They've literally gone within 24 hours from saying Trump must stand up to Putin over Ukraine, to then criticizing him for literally doing exactly that.</p><p>In a way I think this is helpful. Because it just completely exposes it. It clarifies for everyone that President Trump's critics genuinely don't have any intellectual basis for anything they're saying. They just hate Trump whatever he does at any moment in time has to be wrong.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Steve, reports do indicate that Russian tanks are just 11 miles on the Ukraine border. Russian naval aggression rising against Ukraine.</p><p>Steve, I like your reaction to the Russian captain what he was yelling when his vessel rammed on Sunday on a Ukrainian boat. Let's listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: So, Steve, clearly, the intent there we showed in subtitles what the captain was saying. The subtitles in English. Clearly, the intent was there to ram the Ukrainian boat. Isn't that reason enough to cancel the meeting with Putin?</p><p>HILTON: Definitely. I mean, that was really frightening to hear that, that roar moment there. Clearly, an aggressive posture. And I think the president was exactly right to cancel the meeting, by the way, as all President Trump's critics were asking that will be a proportionate measure.</p><p>But I think the long-term the real story here is standing up to President Putin's aggression generally, which of course the Obama administration totally failed to do. Did absolutely nothing when Putin walked into Crimea and then Ukraine and subsequently. Whereas, the Trump administration is being tough on Russia. We've already seen that with sanctions applied much more rigorously and extensively than anything we saw in the Obama administration.</p><p>And then also, the key one is energy. Because Putin's whole regime is dependent on energy. And what President Trump has done here to unleash American energy production is really the key to taking away Putin's power to just wander around the world doing whatever he wants his energy that his regime depends on.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, and Russia, to your point, Steve, could really stick it to Europe. And you know, just turning up the spigot at wheel into Europe of fuel there. And Steve, your take on Germany now silent on Russia sticking it to the Ukraine, because Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipe, the gas pipeline deal with Germany means Russia can circumvent the Ukraine. Go ahead, Steve.</p><p>HILTON: Yes, it's an outrageous situation. That pipeline is a total outrage. Remember, the chairman of the company that's putting that, that put that deal together is Gerhard Schroeder, the former German chancellor, Angela Merkel's predecessor is completely corrupt, is completely outrageous.</p><p>President Trump again was right to raise that. Do you remember that NATO summit when he really let the NATO secretary-general have it in relation to that pipeline, because that is a real security issue. The best thing that we can do is to take the country out of the orbit of Russian dependence on energy and actually have them buy American energy instead. That will be good all around.</p><p>MACDONALD: Steve, it seems like, you know, analysts, some analyst, top analysts are saying it might be better for the U.S. to stay silent and just quietly use power with regards to what Russia is doing with Ukraine.</p><p>Some are pointing what China does. China doesn't ram boats or buzz aircraft carriers in the South China -- in the South China Sea. Instead, it slowly turns reefs into islands and then fortifies them into airbases.</p><p>HILTON: Yes. But I think that, you know, we're not -- we're not authoritarian regimes, and so we do things differently. And the important point is to stand up to that kind of adventurism internationally. And again, this administration is doing that much more than we've seen before, especially in relation to China, where action is.</p><p>President Trump has overturn decades of basically sucking up to China and letting them get away with anything that they want. He's really standing up to them, and I think we need to see more about of that, both for China and for Russia because that's the language that they understand. The real pressure.</p><p>MACDONALD: You could see the tone is totally different at the G20, you know, the world leaders are really on their toes right now, Steve. Final word.</p><p>HILTON: Yes. Look, I think that there is a good instinct there to try and make a deal, but I think that what the president, our present needs to do is really keep up the pressure on China. He's got them in the right place, whether for the first time in many, many years. They're really worried about what America is going to do. I would say keep the pressure on because there's a lot more to do to make that trade relationship fare.</p><p>MACDONALD: Steve Hilton, great to see you, sir. Thanks so much for coming in. And you can catch Steve's show, the Next Revolution Sundays at 9 p.m. on the Fox -- on the Fox News Network.</p><p>With me now, let's bring in the political power panel. It's conservative commentator Kurt Schlichter and Democrat strategist Kristen Hawn. Great to see you both.</p><p>KRISTEN HAWN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Hi.</p><p>KURT SCHLICHTER, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: Great to be here.</p><p>MACDONALD: What's your -- first to you, Kurt, what's your take into the media beltway and their reporting, saying that because Michael Cohen reached out, reportedly to and allegedly to somebody in the Kremlin that that's why the president canceled his meeting with Vladimir Putin.</p><p>SCHLICHTER: Yes. I'll tell how this revelation is that Michael Cohen I had to go on Google to find the guy's address to send it to him because they were just like that. It's so ridiculous, you know.</p><p>I got to say, Liz, though, I'm really glad about these Russiaphobes come lately, because when I was literally in the Cold War in West Germany across from the Russians and they want to kill us. I remember all my liberal friends were telling me that, you know, you're crazy. You're not sure about your warmongering lunatics.</p><p>But now, now, we have realized that Russia is bad. And I'm really glad that they come to the party 35 years late.</p><p>MACDONALD: Kristen, what's your take?</p><p>HAWN: Well, I mean, I think that, you know, we're finally holding Russia the task. I think Steve was right. Putin response to strength and power. The President didn't show that before, but I think that we're making progress there. And back talking about, you know, the issue of energy dependence in Europe, depending on Russia for, you know, natural gas.</p><p>It's a really dangerous circumstance that is happening right now over in Western Europe, so. You know, I think that that we have to show power. We, through the Congress and through the president and we're doing that.</p><p>MACDONALD: And to Kristen's point about fuel, it is at the heart of this geopolitical fighting, right, Kurt? And you know, in fact, our oil patch has rescued us from a potential recession right after the 2008 a crisis. The oil patch is really firing on all cylinders, Kurt. The Permian basin they're giving away natural gas for free.</p><p>SCHLICHTER: You know, Liz, I'm so tired of the European elite refusing to do its share. Look, building this pipeline to bypass the Ukraine so they can import more Russian fossil fuels when we have them to sell is insane. It is a strategic disaster because now they're on Putin's leash. (Inaudible) belong to him, plus, they're shafting their ally.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAWN: Yes. I would -- I would point out--</p><p>SCHLICHTER: The people who guarded him for 30 years.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. Go--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HAWN: I would point out--</p><p>SCHLICHTER: Through the 70's.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, go ahead, Kristen.</p><p>HAWN: Yes. I would just point out that I was talking to few friends in the Senate earlier today and they pointed out to me that we have actually hit an all-time high of exports of crude oil to Western Europe. So, you know, this is something that they are paying attention over there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Go ahead, Kurt.</p><p>SCHLICHTER: We should sell it all to them. They should buy nothing from Russia. Every dollar they give to Putin is another dollar for armaments to go kill Ukrainians to threaten Polls, to threaten Estonians, Lithuanians and Latvians--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Syrians.</p><p>SCHLICHTER: -- our allies.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>SCHLICHTER: Exactly. That's not oil. That's blood.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, go ahead, take that point on, Kristen.</p><p>HAWN: Well, I would agree with that. I think this is a partisan issue at all. I think Russia is, you're exactly right, is threat to the rest of the world and not just to us, but to Western Europe, to Ukraine. And so, you know, I agree.</p><p>MACDONALD: And Kurt, Russia is in trouble. It's in recessionary mode, so as China. There's more saber rattling coming out of those countries when they're, you know, back down on the mat, right?</p><p>SCHLICHTER: Yes, but it's foolish saber rattling. Look, we don't want to be opposed to Russia in the way that we were during the entire Cold War. Again, I personally served in it. I remember it. And we don't want that. We were excited when the wall fell.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK.</p><p>SCHLICHTER: That there was hope that they could join the nations and become prosperous and become peaceful part of the community. That's really our goal. But if they're looking for a fight. Hey, here we are, Vladimir. Let's rock.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Thanks. You're going to be back later in the show, you guys. Great stuff there.</p><p>To new developments at the border. U.S. officials now say troops there will be cut to 4,000, eventually, from 5600.</p><p>Jeff Paul is on the ground in Tijuana with the latest. Jeff?</p><p>JEFF PAUL, FOX NEWS CHANNEL CORRESPONDENT: Elizabeth, we're here at the newest shelter to open up in Tijuana that's housing many of those migrants who have traveled from Central America. And as we get through the gate here you could see a big part of the reason why they have opened up this shelter now, is because of all the space here compared to the old shelter.</p><p>There's also much more covered space compared to the old shelter which is been a big issue with the heavy rains that have fallen over the last few days. It's created mud. And with so many people living in such a tight space health has become a concern as well.</p><p>We spoke to one of the migrants who has moved from the old shelter to the new one about that new facility, here's what he had to say. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: People asking, people crying. A little kid, woman, and like old people crying for when it's raining. Nothing to wear. No water. No bathrooms. Nothing like that, you know what I mean. That's why we called to a government agency who can help with this people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL: The local Tijuana government has also moved much of the resources that they provided to the migrants at the old shelter to the new shelter like food. We'll see how many migrants are enticed to move to the new location because of that, or how many decide just to give up on the dream of entering the United States and just decide to return home to Central America. Elizabeth?</p><p>MACDONALD: Great to see you, sir. Great reporting there, Jeff.</p><p>In other headlines, the FBI now investigating the hotel chain Marriott after it suffered the second worst cyber-attack in the last 10 years.

We're going to debate it. And G.M. Motors, General Motors, the workers there in Lordstown, Ohio publicly praying for each other after the car company announced 14,000 layoffs. More on that story coming up next. Stay there.</p><p>MACDONALD: Welcome back. The Trump administration now finishing plans to invite top executives from German carmakers, Volkswagen, BMW and Daimler to the White House next week. Big push by the president to get jobs here in the U.S.</p><p>This, as G.M. workers are seeing publicly praying after G.M. announced more than 14,000 layoffs at factories in the U.S. There's a big waterfall effect here.</p><p>Now, last night on this show, we had on the mayor of Lordstown, Ohio. He said every job loss at that G.M. factory there causes numerous other jobs to be lost at businesses elsewhere in the area that are depend on the factory.</p><p>One estimate says it's as high as seven jobs like at other places that could be lost.</p><p>Let's bring in expert analysis from one of the best Fox News contributors and writers all around, columnist with The Hill, Liz Peek. Great to see you, Liz.</p><p>LIZ PEEK, COLUMNIST, FISCAL TIMES: Thank you. Glad to be here.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's all the jobs.</p><p>PEEK: Yes, it is. And that's of course why Obama and everybody else wanted to save General Motors and save for during the financial crisis. It wasn't just those jobs that were apparel the entire industry and all their suppliers and the people living in those communities. Everybody was in jeopardy.</p><p>But, you know, the one good thing to think about, as compared to that era, right now, there are a million more jobs available than there are workers just to fill them. There is such an ebullient jobs market, even in manufacturing skills. There are lots of people out there--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: That's a great point.</p><p>PEEK: -- and there are a lot of manufacturing jobs. We've added 300,000 jobs over the last -- in manufacturing over the last two years. So, this is, I am really unhappy as President Trump is about what General Motors is doing, particularly because it was really their problem. I mean, they basically guessed wrong on the kinds of cars that Americans are going to want.</p><p>Everybody bought into the idea that our prices were never coming down again.</p><p>MACDONALD: Right.</p><p>PEEK: It just never happens. Oil price going down.</p><p>MACDONALD: Right.</p><p>PEEK: I mean, I can sign an affidavit, it would make any difference. But guess what.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. I know. You wonder why--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK: That's how it happens.</p><p>MACDONALD: You wonder why they can't fill factories that can be retooled when oil prices go up and down.</p><p>PEEK: Well, I think they're overstocked in general.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>PEEK: We just really are not seeing a big growing auto market. so.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. There is a flattening--</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK: That's exactly right.</p><p>MACDONALD: -- with the (Inaudible) in the U.S. sales. But you know what's really interesting is now we have Ohio Congressman Tim Ryan visibly upset. He is basically shooting an arrow across the bow, saying Washington doesn't care about middle America. He is saying venture capital the coastal elites only care about their neck of the woods, about California and New York.</p><p>But he is saying that Washington is continuing to ignore the Midwest. He doesn't say Trump is, he is saying D.C.</p><p>PEEK: Well, I think that's what elected President Trump.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>PEEK: Is that basically people were ignoring the rustbelt, it's called the rustbelt for a reason. It was in many years in decline. We lost millions of jobs and no one said a word.</p><p>MACDONALD: To China.</p><p>PEEK: Well, to China.</p><p>MACDONALD: And elsewhere.</p><p>PEEK: To Mexico, all over the place. And so, hostility towards these trade agreements, hostility towards other people taking our jobs is not new and it is not misbegotten. I mean, there is a reason why this is all happening.</p><p>Now, look, Trump has actually set the stage for revival in manufacturing in this country, and there are many reasons to think that we are competitive. We have low energy cost and energy through our lifetimes is not going to change. That's a big change. For example, our difference between us, and for example, Germany. Germany doesn't have because of their I think incredibly stupid energy policies.</p><p>But we have energy. We have the major consumer market is still in the world here. It's not China. We're still a bigger consumer market. We had English speaking labor. We had all kinds of advantages. So, the pessimism of the Obama years was, I think totally wrong. I think we can do this.</p><p>And by the way, some of these European automakers are talking about expanding here. And I think given proper incentives and so forth they will do that.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, the president is having the foreign carmakers here next week.</p><p>PEEK: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: To your point about President Obama, he said, how is President Trump going to do that.</p><p>PEEK: Magic wand.</p><p>MACDONALD: With magic wand.</p><p>PEEK: I know. It's such a snooty kind of comment, but he didn't know anything about private industry. He had never been involved in it. None of his advisers had ever been in manufacturing.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: He was talking about -- he was, President is talking about manufacturing think tanks and institutes, he does think it fix it, right.</p><p>PEEK: Yes. Right, which is a very different kind of situation. Look.</p><p>MACDONALD: It's like the teacher's faculty lounge answered, too.</p><p>PEEK: That's exactly right. If you lower taxes that were competitive, and we were not historically, we have the highest tax rate for our corporations of all the developed countries, and you basically get back some of this environmental regulation mainly. You know what, you can compete here. And I think that's the big take away.</p><p>MACDONALD: Liz Peek, we love having you on. And read Liz Peek's column, she's a terrific writer with great analysis.</p><p>PEEK: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Thank you, Liz Peek.</p><p>PEEK: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Have a good weekend.</p><p>PEEK: You, too.</p><p>MACDONALD: Now you won't believe the numbers we are seeing about the new reports of the massive amount of illegal drugs seized at the border this year and last year. The Fentanyl seize, wait for it, enough to kill 78 million people. Yes, 78 million people. We are going to discuss whether the beltway media downplaying the danger at our footstep -- at our doorstep is so bad for the country.</p><p>Former ICE acting director Tom Homan is here. He is s ready to go on that one. But first, a bombshell report. The Washington Post reporting that Facebook was using your data as a bargaining chip in exchange to get companies to buy advertising. We got the details coming up. Stay there.</p><p>ELIZABETH MACDONALD, THE EVENING EDIT HOST, FOX BUSINESS: Now to the bombshell report about Facebook. The \"Washington Post\" reporting that new Facebook internal e-mails had surfaced indicate that Facebook doled out (ph) access to your user data in exchange for advertising buys, using user data as a bargaining chip.</p><p>Companies cited include Lyft, Tinder, Amazon and Airbnb. This, as calls grow in Europe for a new Robert Mueller type special prosecutor to go after Facebook and other big tech companies. This is the former prime minister of Belgium. He's an E.U. official. He's saying, \"Facebook's monopoly control over millions of people's personal data and the flow of news and information online pose a clear and present threat to democracy.</p><p>He also says that Facebook's management has shown time and again it cannot be trusted to behave responsibly. This official also pointing out that Facebook has failed to still deliver a comprehensive internal audit about what exactly happened with the Cambridge Analytica scandal.</p><p>Remember, Cambridge Analytica was reading Facebook messages and compared the Facebook issues to the 2008 banking crisis. He's saying, \"Banks then, they didn't regulate themselves. Techs sure is not. We got to step in. Kurt Schlichter and Kristen Hawn are back. Kurt, wow! A Robert Mueller type special prosecutor to investigate Facebook and Silicon Valley? What do you think?</p><p>KURT SCHLICHTER, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: Well, since I don't think much of Robert Mueller, I don't think much of that idea, but I do think that the tech monopolies because that's what they are, aren't really capitalism in the way that we know it. What they are doing is they are not only playing with our data, they are trying to control the flow of information.</p><p>And the simple fact is, no capitalist ideology that I'm familiar with requires us to submit to a bunch of bay area liberals deciding what we can and can't say. Something's got to be done. They haven't done it. I'm willing to look at some options. And they brought it on themselves.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Kristen, for Facebook, you know, for all the data the scandals, right, are they sincerely sorry that they got caught?</p><p>KRISTEN HAWN, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: I think that's the situation we're looking at. I mean, this is a situation where -- and I agree with my counterpart on the right -- there something that has to be done. I'm not sure about a special prosecutor, but there's clearly a role for Congress to act in a bipartisan way to regulate because Facebook isn't self-regulating.</p><p>The issue though comes down, you know, the devil is always in the details. So, do you regulate Facebook as a financial institution? Do you regulate it as a news organization? There are a lot of questions that need to be answered, you know, and I think that they began to ask those questions when they brought Zuckerberg</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, they are exempt -- yes, they are exempt from lawsuits because they say they publish political discourse.</p><p>HAWN: Right.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, the issue too, Kurt, is that Facebook says it did not sell your data. It did sell -- it looks like it may have sold access to the data so it's playing fast and loose there. And the entire app industry is built on the backs of Facebook user data and Google data. And then we also had, you know, Sheryl Sandberg asking Facebook workers, Kurt, to do opposition research on George Soros after Soros said Facebook is a menace. I mean, how deeply involved was Sandberg?</p><p>SCHLICHTER: You know, probably pretty deeply. Look, I'm no fan of George Soros and Facebook can go and do whatever politicking it wants, but you know what, so can we. And the simple fact is, Facebook and Twitter and all the rest of these tech giants have taken an outside role in our politics. I would not be as concerned if they were not monopolies, but they transparently are. And we have to do something about it.</p><p>We have got to maintain a system where every American can participate in the debate. And from the bannings on Twitter and Facebook and everything, we see that a bunch of hipsters in San Jose, California are trying to decide what can and can't be said over the internet. And that's unacceptable, meaning we won't accept it.</p><p>MACDONALD: I'm sorry to jump in because we do have breaking news now, Kristen, and Google, there is new reports that again, Google, based on internal e-mails, Google workers again debated burying, pushing down conservative media in searches -- in the searches on the search engine, with the goal of impacting future election, Kristen, that's a bombshell.</p><p>HAWN: Yes, I mean, whether it's Russia, whether it's, you know, and this isn't in my mind a political issue. I mean, there are people on the left that are doing it. There are people on the right that are doing it. And there are certainly foreign governments that are trying to impact our elections.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, but time and again, Kristen, we do see conservative voices suppressed on Facebook and Google. That's a fact. I have seen it. I have seen the reports.</p><p>HAWN: Well, I mean, and at the end of the day, it's all across the board on the right and left, it is unacceptable. And, you know, it is very clear that they can't police themselves. We need to step in.</p><p>MACDONALD: Kurt and Kristen, you have been great. Thank you so much. And say hi to Bitey (ph) and Barky (ph), Kurt, you have a new dog, Barkey (ph).</p><p>SCHLICHTER: We do. He's horrendous. He's a terrible dog.</p><p>MACDONALD: Love it. More terrible the better. Coming up -- great to see you guys -- coming up next, the beltway media down playing the border crisis in the face of staggering new data about lethal drugs including fentanyl pouring in. Mayhem, like fatal car chases with illegals, and more. And we're going to talk to former ICE acting director Thomas Homan about that, next.</p><p>And later in the show, we are looking at the facts, just the facts and nothing but the facts, in the news about Michael Cohen and the Mueller probe with Bill McGurn of the \"Wall Street Journal.\" Stay there.</p><p>MACDONALD: The media continues to down play the criminal problems at the border. Look at this. New government data show that the amount of illegal fentanyl seized this year and last could kill about 78 million people. Yes, 78 million people. You just need 2 milligrams -- 2 milligrams of fentanyl to kill somebody.</p><p>There's even more mayhem at the border. Feds also just arresting 39 smugglers and another major $2.7 million drug bust involving crystal meth. And separately from that, three killed and seven hurt. Authorities have not said if they are illegals. Here's what happened.</p><p>A truck hit speeds of 100 miles-per-hour in a chase at the border with Border Patrol. It's believed that there was a smuggler, a human trafficking smuggler at the car. And there is this story. Another nine illegals came ashore at Laguna Beach California, a number of them from China. So, why are so many in the beltway media down playing the border chaos?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIPS)</p><p>JONATHAN LEMIRE, WHITE HOUSE REPORTER, ASSOCIATED PRESS: -- well he has steadily escalated the rhetoric on this. So whether or not he created the crisis, he certainly heightened it.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is not a caravan of stone cold criminals. These are families.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I as a national security official would want to focus on the actual threats and not these inventive threats of caravans that they are thousands miles away.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That's not who is in that caravan by in large, and we all know that. And as long as President Trump insists on perpetuating those myths, insists on doing that, we're not going to reach a political solution.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIPS)</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's take it up with former ICE acting director Thomas Homan. Great to see you, sir.</p><p>THOMAS HOMAN, FORMER ICE ACTING DIRECTOR: Good to see you.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK, it is almost like they are talking to each other, standing on the same corner and not out there trying to get to the story, into the bottom of it. First, the fentanyl, enough fentanyl to kill 78 million people seized at the border this year and last. Again, just 2 milligrams can kill you, way more potent than heroin. Are we in the media not giving this enough coverage?</p><p>HOMAN: Well, you know, I think there's a lot of coverage, but the left, the liberals, the progressive, they don't want to talk about it because look, the smuggling of fentanyl in which you are right, is very powerful but it is also very cheap, a lot cheaper than heroine and cocaine.</p><p>So, they don't want to talk about it because drug smuggling goes hand in hand with alien smuggling. They use similar pathways. They use -- the southern border is a way to get through. And so when you talk about illegal immigration, you can't leave out drug smuggling. They go hand in hand.</p><p>The same organization who smuggle aliens, many of them smuggle drugs. So it comes hand in hand. And they don't want to talk about it because that's border security or border control, which they don't want.</p><p>MACDONALD: So, you know, let's get to the car crashes happening along certain routes out of the border. What's the detail on that? I think you said in talking to us, that it only takes upwards of five minutes to get from the boarder to a major highway?</p><p>HOMAN: Yes, that crash happened in Boulevard, California. I was actually a Border Patrol agent in Boulevard, so I patrolled those roads for years. And when that accident occurred, that's really close to the border. Matter of fact, me and my partner seized 1,200 pounds of cocaine in that very similar area.</p><p>It takes between three and six minutes to get from that border to Interstate 8. And once they get to the interstate, of course they get lost in the interstate traffic. So luckily, way back then, we actually saw the vehicle before entering the interstate. But yes, within five minutes you can be from the Mexican border on a major interstate and get lost during an interstate traffic.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. So, what is your take on nationals from China -- Chinese nationals, illegals coming ashore at Laguna Beach?</p><p>HOAMAN: When I was director of ICE, we removed people to almost 140 different countries. The Border Patrol arrests people from over 100 countries every year. Chinese usually come through Canada, but you see more and more of the Chinese are coming through the southern border.</p><p>And since there's a lot of attention right now on the southern border with DOD down there along with extra Border Patrol assets, they are trying to find ways around it, which I said weeks ago was a great plan by the president because now he sent DOD down there, the cartels are going crazy because they can't move their product as freely as they could.</p><p>Because they move a group of aliens in one sector, keep the Border Patrol busy, and move narcotics and bad people through another sector. And the DOD down there is shutting that down pretty well so now they're going through a water way (ph).</p><p>MACDONALD: That's the breaking news. Tom Homan, we want to have you back on the show next week about how the Pentagon officials -- excuse me -- troops at the border are shutting down the drug cartels. Great stuff, Tom Homan, and thank you so much for your service to our country. Come back soon.</p><p>HOMAN: You got it.</p><p>MACDONALD: We want you next week, actually. Coming up, Democrats firing off subpoena cannon at Trump. But you know, more than five dozen subpoenas were aimed at Trump so far this year from the Democrats. But will all of this backfire? We're bringing on Republican Congressman Daryl Issa to take it on.</p><p>But first, more and more media host on the left and the right asking just where is that smoking gun against Trump in the Michael Cohen guilty plea? CNN asking that. The \"New York Times\" asking that. We're going to take it up with Bill McGurn of the \"Wall Street Journal,\" next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAKE TAPPER, CNN HOST: This is clearly not welcome news for the president. I don't want to pretend that it is. But once again, I look at these documents and I don't see any evidence of conspiracy between members of the Trump team and members of the Russian government to interfere in the election.</p><p>REP. JERRY NADLER (D), NEW YORK: The fact that it was negotiating with a foreign power or business deals while you are running for president --</p><p>TAPPER: Not illegal. You mean, like more just cloak (ph) really.</p><p>NADLER: Yes, yes, yes.</p><p>TAPPER: But still no conspiracy?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: No conspiracy. That's Jake Tapper of CNN saying that. Let's get right to Bill McGurn of the \"Wall Street Journal\" over the Robert Mueller probe. I mean, so the \"New York Times\" is also saying the same thing of what JAKE TAPPER SAID. Your take?</p><p>BILL MCGURN, CHIEF EDITORIAL WRITER, WALL STREET JOURNAL: My take is I never thought I would be saying to you I agree with Jake Tapper, but there's no evidence of what the charge was. And look, I think special counsel -- I think special counsel's corrupt, independent counsel's corrupt, absolutely, it is a bad idea. It is extra constitutional.</p><p>They are supposed to be even -- if you take it seriously, it is supposed to be investigating a crime. This one was set up as a counterintelligence effort to investigate what Russia did in the election and whether the Trump organization or Trump people were complicit in that, conspired to alter the election. No evidence of that, all these months into it.</p><p>It looks to me like what the special counsel is doing is trying to put together this narrative of here's these things Trump did and maybe didn't come clean about them later, but not illegal. But is that really what a special counsel -- should we have these extra constitutional people hovering around the edges with all this power and being in fact an opposition power? I don't think so.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, they are saying that, you know, Trump wasn't forthcoming about his business dealings with the tower in Moscow.</p><p>MCGURN: Yes. I'm not sure. First of all, he didn't have a business deal, right? It didn't go through.</p><p>MACDONALD: There was no guarantee.</p><p>MCGURN: It didn't go through, right? And second, I believe Donald Trump, Jr. in his testimony, talked about looking at investments from 2015 and 2016 as well. So there is really not a lot of new there.</p><p>MACDONALD: But we've been 19 months into this, and the D.C. media beltway is absolutely unhinged.</p><p>MCGURN: Of course. Right.</p><p>MACDONALD: And the poison coming out of it. Sorry, I watch it. It is poison. And they're not reporting -- you know, I talk to people, oh, Boeing had a problem with software in an airplane? Really? Facebook is having a problem? They are only watching MSNBC or CNN. It is unbelievable what's going on.</p><p>MCGURN: Right. No, it is, and it's just -- look, I think you can think that the special counsel's provisions is corrupting to politics without believing that the special counsel himself, Bob Mueller, is personally corrupt.</p><p>MACDONALD: Understood, yes.</p><p>MCGURN: It just leads to this because it doesn't seem to be in anyone's interest to say I've looked into this, and I haven't found what I was charged with finding.</p><p>MACDONALD: They are going to now try to link Roger Stone with WikiLeaks and then to Trump --</p><p>MCGURN: Yes. And all these -- as Michael Cohen, OK --</p><p>MACDONALD: And then Trump will be talking about Hillary's health.</p><p>MCGURN: Right. And we have learned Michael Cohen is not a very honest guy and he's got a lot of legal problems that again didn't really have anything to do with collaboration between the Trump administration and the government of Russia to effect the outcome of the elections, right?</p><p>MACDONALD: It's well -- will you come back on --</p><p>MCGURN: Yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: I mean, when do you think Mueller is going to come forward with --</p><p>MCGURN: I don't know. I mean, I have thought with the questions to the president that that's kind of what you do near the end, but there's no sign of the end and that's one of the problems.</p><p>MACDONALD: Bill McGurn, we need you on the story. Will you come back?</p><p>MCGURN: Yes, I will.</p><p>MACDONALD: Good to see you, sir.</p><p>MCGURN: Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: We're going to be right back. Stay right there. Darrell Issa next.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, it looks like the Democrat game plan moving forward is simply to try and bury the Trump White House in subpoenas. In fact, the Democrats have fired off 64 subpoenas since 2016 on a range of issues, from election meddling to conflicts of interests, to the border, to the census and more. With us now is Republican congressman, Darrell Issa, of California. Great to see you, sir.</p><p>REP. DARREL ISSA (R), CALIFORNIA: Great to be on Liz and it will be interesting to see if they can exceed in a month what any Republican ever did in a year in the way of subpoenas.</p><p>MACDONALD: That's a good point. I wanted to say first congratulations on your nomination to run the U.S. Trade and Development Agency. Good to see that sir.</p><p>ISSA: Well, I'd be glad to be getting back into working with business. I sort of missed it during my time in Congress.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK, so five dozen subpoenas, more than that filed against the White House. Your take on that?</p><p>ISSA: Well, I think they are playing into their own election narrative. In the election, they basically said Trump has done all these things wrong and we're going to prove it by getting the documents. I think what they're going to be surprised is after an extensive period of time, great cost to the government.</p><p>What they are going to come up with is similar to what you had in the last segment where Mueller is still almost two years into investigating and is still looking for the crime that was alleged.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. We also have breaking news story, judge may rule on Monday on whether James Comey can testify in public or behind closed doors. James Comey wants a public hearing. He says he is afraid of leaks. Your take on that.</p><p>ISSA: Well, there are plenty of ways to prevent leaks, but one of the ways to prevent leaks is for Comey not to be a leaker, which is, you know, he has selected been a leaker at a lot of times. The other thing is that he had an assurance by Chairman Goodlatte that the entire interview would be recorded and would be then made available so it wouldn't be about leaks.</p><p>It would be about having the off air hour per side type of deposition, that quite frankly, Comey has grown up on. Depositions are not done in five- minute sound bites the way public hearings are and Comey knows that.</p><p>MACDONALD: So there is nothing wrong with a behind-doors hearing, right? And then you can have the transcript released, right sir? Is that what you're saying?</p><p>ISSA: Exactly. And just because I have worked with him before, if we were in a public hearing and we asked questions about FISA, the first thing he would say is I'm sorry I can't answer in this venue. So, to a certain extent, he would like to be out in the open where the situations related to wrongdoing in a FISA warrant would by definition, be things he would no answer.</p><p>So, the other part of it is, that the closed door is where when he's asked a question, he says well it's classified, you say great, let's make sure we only have people with clearances in the room and now please answer. He would like to circumvent that and get out of town as the Republicans leave control of the House.</p><p>MACDONALD: What's the one thing that bothers you about James Comey in this entire affair?</p><p>ISSA: I guess what bothers me is that you want to have a higher opinion of the integrity of the office than a number of things that he has done, some of even before recently. You might remember when he claimed that he couldn't crack the Apple phone and he had to get Apple to give him a code- breaking software. Later proven not to be something he needed.</p><p>The fact that you see somebody who you relied on for the absolute most important law enforcement agency who obviously plays fast and loose with what he says and does. And that's a disappointment and it does make you worry about whether you can trust the new management of the FBI, the next management of the FBI. That is something the American people rely on.</p><p>MACDONALD: Congressman Darrell Issa, good to see you sir. Thank you so much for coming in.</p><p>ISSA: Thanks Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: And thank you for watching. Lou Dobbs is next right here on the Fox Business Network. Have a good weekend.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RSKRWD-2018113001cb233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RSKRWD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TVT-7YT1-DXH2-650T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437056</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7336\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Evening Edit (formerly Risk &amp;

Numerous studies have found the drug does not show any benefit against COVID-19 and the Food and Drug Administration has cautioned about its use because of reports linking it with heart problems and other injuries and disorders. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                      \"A physician must provide full disclosure of treatment options, side effects, obtain informed consent, and there cannot be false, misleading or deceptive advertising or statements made regarding any therapies, including a cure for COVID-19,\" says the medical board's statement. </p><p>                      The statement said if the board were to receive a complaint for false, misleading or deceptive advertising, it would be reviewed following its standard enforcement process. It did not say the complaint had to involve harm to a patient. </p><p>                      The statement represented an unusually quick response by a state medical board to a public event. Immanuel was not specifically mentioned, but the statement noted \"a widely published claim of a 'cure' for COVID-19\" in the past week. </p><p>                      In a video that went viral early last week, Immanuel called it \"fake science\" to say hydroxychloroquine doesn't work and said \"if they put everybody on hydroxychloroquine . it would stop covid in its tracks in 30 days.\" She reposted her video Tuesday on her Twitter page, writing that \"Big Tech is censoring Experts and suppressing the CURE. I will not be silenced.\" </p><p>                      She told the Chronicle on Thursday she has used the drug on more than 400 people, including the elderly, asthmatics and diabetics, and \"we have not lost a patient yet.\" </p><p>                      The video, taken at a press conference Immanuel led on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court, was shared on Twitter by President Donald Trump. The video was later removed for sharing false information by Twitter as well as Facebook and YouTube, where it was also posted. </p><p>                      The Texas Medical Board statement, noting the medical community is \"still learning, researching and gaining understanding of the virus,\" said that while drugs and therapies are being used to treat COVID-19, \"there is no definitive cure at this time.\" It said any treatment decision must be made \"with full, proper and accurate disclosure by a physician.\" </p><p>                      The Texas Medical Board licensed Immanuel in November 2019 for pediatrics and emergency medicine with an address associated with the Rehoboth Medical Center. She has no documented disciplinary actions or known complaints in Texas or Louisiana, where she was first licensed in 1998. </p><p>                      Immanuel was sued for medical malpractice in Louisiana in January in a case involving a woman who died in 2019 after being treated by Immanuel, according to court filings. </p><p>                      Immanuel and another doctor prescribed medication to a woman who complained of a broken needle in her arm after doing methamphetamine, but the family alleged she did not order a closer look at her area through an X-ray or other medical tests. The woman later developed a flesh-eating disease from the wound and died, according to documents provided by the family's lawyer. </p><p>                      Immanuel is not the only Houston doctor to use the drug. Dr. Robin Armstrong , medical director of a Texas City nursing home and a state GOP officer, provided the drug to 35 residents who had tested positive but not yet shown symptoms after an outbreak there. And the drug is part of a cocktail that Dr. Joseph Varon , chief of staff at United Memorial Medical Center, has touted as working \"like a charm\" there. </p><p>                      It is unclear if Armstrong and Varon are still providing the drug. </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:todd.ackerman@chron.com\">todd.ackerman@chron.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN80200776</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HH-PW01-DYRV-424J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"698\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

Virtually no one will go through life untouched by the disease, whether as a sufferer, a survivor or supporter. So every year, millions of us lace up running shoes, bake cakes and cultivate moustaches in memory of loved ones to raise the cash needed for cancer research.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But money is not the only critical ingredient in developing new cures. An important constraint on the pace of progress is the lack of large datasets that contain valuable information on how patients are responding to different types of treatment.</p><p>So it is hugely significant that Tessa Jowell has pledged to make a different sort of donation to cancer research. The former culture secretary has won <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/risk/lifetime-risk\">plaudits</url> for her bravery in speaking out about her experience of suffering from an aggressive brain tumour and her calls for greater collaboration in the fight against cancer. She has now announced she will become the first person to donate her health records to a new global cancer database being set up by an Australian philanthropist. Cancer researchers have hailed it a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/risk/lifetime-risk\">gamechanger</url> : it will enable them to look at what people responding well to particular cancer treatments have in common so as to refine and develop new treatments.</p><p>It might be difficult to recall at a time when concerns about data privacy have never been more heightened, but 10 years ago, big data was being talked about as the panacea to a range of social ills. Like nudge theory, its potential was unquestionably overhyped, but there is no doubt that in relation to healthcare, our personal data has not just life-changing but lifesaving potential. Observational data from the real world has paved the way for\u00a0huge medical breakthroughs over the years, including establishing the\u00a0links between thalidomide and birth defects and between smoking and cancer.</p><p>But the power of patient data remains cripplingly under-harnessed as a result of privacy concerns. Five years ago, NHS England announced it would be setting up a single, opt-out database - care.data - bringing together millions of patient records. The data would be made available in \"pseudonymised\" form (with personal information such as name and address removed) to medical researchers in the public and private sectors.</p><p>There are, however, privacy risks to such an undertaking that can't be eliminated. Even when data is pseudonymised, there's a small risk people can be identified if the information were matched with data from other datasets, for example those held by insurance companies. The public accounts committee said that last year's <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/risk/lifetime-risk\">NHS ransomware attack</url> was made possible by a lack of investment in cybersecurity - which doesn't inspire confidence.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/risk/lifetime-risk\">The NHS sent every household a leaflet</url> to explain the endeavour that \"raised more questions than it answered\", according to the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/risk/lifetime-risk\">independent health data guardian</url>. It certainly wasn't clear about what sort of safeguards might be adopted to ensure patient data would not get into the wrong hands.</p><p>So the resulting public outcry was perhaps inevitable and resulted in the whole thing being scrapped a couple of years ago. The tragic price? Potential delays to medical advances that could help us find new cures for diseases such as dementia and\u00a0cancer.</p><p>Today, we are awash with examples of how our personal data could potentially be put to malign use. Insurers would love to get their hands on our health data so they can charge us premiums based on how likely we are to become ill. A social media giant such as Facebook is able to use the massive amounts of data it holds on us, including our likes, our private messages and our reading habits, to try to predict how we will react to commercial and political advertising and push us targeted marketing accordingly - a capability its developers are continuously honing.</p><p>And companies can use data to evade regulation and help them to break the law. The New York Times last year revealed how <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/risk/lifetime-risk\">Uber had been using passenger data</url> to systematically deceive local law enforcement officials.</p><p>Too often, data experts throw up their hands at the way in which we apparently undervalue the privacy of our personal data. The saga over care.data shows us how far from the truth this is: people can get very animated about the privacy of our data when we don't trust the people charged with keeping it safe and the benefits are either poorly explained or feel obtuse or too far into the future.</p><p>But there is a tragic asymmetry in our response to care.data and to the big tech companies.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/risk/lifetime-risk\">Revelations</url> about the reams of personal data that Facebook and Google hold about us, including which events in your calendar you actually attended and which apps you use and when, haven't resulted in masses of people closing their accounts. We seem to be less anguished about under-regulated, global tech giants holding deeply personal information about us than an arm's-length NHS body.</p><p>That asymmetry isn't surprising - it's just yet another product of our irrationality. We trade away our data for short-term benefits such as the convenience of an app, but the risks make us more reluctant to hand it over in service of long-term collective benefits such as improved medical care and new cures for diseases.</p><p>If we are to beat diseases such as cancer and dementia, that irrationality is something we need to overcome. Tessa Jowell has taken the first step. Hopefully some of us will follow. Perhaps in 10 years' time, we'll see people running races and baking cakes asking not just for\u00a0cash sponsorship - but for friends and family to donate their health data.</p><p>\u00b7 Sonia Sodha is an Observer columnist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBSRVR-43320513</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBSRVR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S59-3FH1-F021-63WV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">143296</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"942\"/><timeReceived>6:06 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Guardian Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Observer(London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 22, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Digital scans will give better looks inside the human body.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And computer prescriptions will cut transcription errors and bad drug combos.</p><p>That leaves one unsolved problem: tying everything together.</p><p>\"The biggest issue in health care technology is connectivity,\" said Quovadx Chief Executive Harvey Wagner. His company, which sells integration services among other offerings, deals with the issue every day.</p><p>Few health care systems are designed to be compatible. That's no surprise, perhaps, since the U.S. health care industry itself is highly fragmented.</p><p>A single procedure can involve doctors, hospitals, insurers and the government -- all using different systems.</p><p>Lots of companies focus on niche areas of health care and small sets of customers. That's why your doctor's billing system won't always speak the same language as the one used by your insurer.</p><p>That creates overhead, says Sami Aita, CEO for medical software maker MedcomSoft. Care takes longer, and doctors often have to redo costly tests.</p><p>As the medical field puts more of its records on computers, it's critical to make sure data can flow smoothly, Aita says.</p><p>\"The exchange of clinical information between different system is going to be the key to (electronic records),\" he said.</p><p>But health care's scattered nature means there's no single body in charge of forging such standards.</p><p>\"Easier said than done,\" said Datamonitor researcher Jocelyn Young. \"A lot of work lies ahead.\"</p><p>Take the building block of medical data: the patient record.</p><p>Lost In Translation</p><p>Descriptions of basic medical procedures can vary from doctor to doctor. It gets more complex when adding hospitals and insurers to the mix.</p><p>Even when the terminology is the same, how do doctors translate those terms into data a machine can understand?</p><p>One proposed standard is Medcin, created in 1978 by Medicomp Systems. The proprietary standard includes a common set of terms to describe symptoms and treatments.</p><p>Medcin's database makes it easier to diagnose patients and document their treatment. With the right software, doctors can quickly match symptoms to other factors and treatments.</p><p>The cough of a 3-month-old baby, for instance, won't be treated the same as that of a 70-year-old smoker.</p><p>Backers of Medcin say the standard has become more useful as outside companies license it for their software.</p><p>Some hope Medcin becomes a free, open standard that software makers won't have to license.</p><p>Other Standards</p><p>If Medcin prevails, it'll have to work with a mix of other standards to reach its full promise.</p><p>In 2003, the Health and Human Services Department endorsed another standard called Snomed, or Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine.</p><p>Maintained by the College of American Pathologists, the system was already in use by the U.K. health system to track disease, clinical findings, therapies, procedures and outcomes.</p><p>The U.S. government licenses the standard to give health care open access to it.</p><p>The World Health Organization uses another standard called IDC, short for the International Classification of Diseases. (Medcin includes IDC info.)</p><p>The FDA wants to use another standard called MedDRA, or Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities.</p><p>The European Union and Japan already mandate its use.</p><p>An effort called Continuity of Care Record program hopes to bring many of these standards together.</p><p>It's sponsored by several groups, including the American Medical Association.</p><p>The idea is to create a health care-focused version of XML, the lingua franca of data exchange on the Web.</p><p>If it works, doctors will easily transfer patient info to other software, even Microsoft Word or Adobe Acrobat.</p><p>It's a grand idea. But there's little consensus on how to structure it.</p><p>The government, through Medicare, can throw some weight around, says Datamonitor's Young.</p><p>The private sector also will have to rally around these standards. Big tech firms like IBM, Oracle and Microsoft can play a role.</p><p>Ultimately, the strongest carrot will be the huge potential savings for the health care industry.</p><p>\"At the end of the day, what gets reimbursed is what drives the industry,\" said Datamonitor's Young.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-1229827</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2005</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4G00-WXD0-01J8-W3WC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"710\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Investor's Business Daily</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2005 Investor's Business Daily, Inc. \u00a0  www.investors.com</copyright><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"04\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>April 18, 2005 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>MEDCOMSOFT INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>\u00a0HEALTHVISION INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>MSF (TSX)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS541511 CUSTOM COMPUTER PROGRAMMING SERVICES\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>\u00a0NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>\u00a0SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>\u00a0NAICS541512 COMPUTER SYSTEMS DESIGN SERVICES\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>QVDX</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D3ST</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC HEALTH RECORDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001534</classCode><className>SCIENTIFIC SOFTWARE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DFF8</classCode><className>HEALTH CARE INDUSTRY TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000832</classCode><className>HEALTH CARE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097CI</classCode><className>HEALTH DEPARTMENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001103</classCode><className>MEDICAL RECORDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009EVP</classCode><className>MEDICAL SCIENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002001</classCode><className>MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002002</classCode><className>MEDICAL TREATMENTS &amp;

But last year, that growth came to a halt as its pipeline of new blockbusters shriveled up.</p><p>Late last month, Merck reported drug sales growth of 16% during the first quarter but flat profit in its core drug business.</p><p>The reason? Analysts say Merck is throwing money at scientists to boost their chances of finding new, big-selling drugs. It raised research and development spending for the quarter by 36% to $720 million.</p><p>\"Crisis Period'</p><p>Rising R&amp;D costs are a problem throughout the industry. A 2001 study by Tufts University found that it costs $802 million to develop one new prescription drug, up from $231 million a decade earlier.</p><p>But the number of new compounds winning regulatory approval is on the decline.</p><p>\"The pharmaceutical industry is approaching a period of real crisis,\" said Caroline Kovac, general manager of IBM Corp.'s Life Sciences unit. \"(There's) a productivity gap in the . . . business model.\"</p><p>IBM is one of several big tech firms touting software packages they say will speed up drug research.</p><p>One of IBM's software packages, DiscoveryLink, has already proved effective in shortening the process, Kovac says.</p><p>She claims it helped drug giant Aventis AG cut the time needed for early stage drug discovery to two months from the usual two to three years.</p><p>That's not just a sales pitch. Another fan of the product is Aventis Vice President Peter Loupos, who's in charge of finding ways to shorten the time it takes to discover a drug and get it approved by regulators for sale.</p><p>He says IBM's software has made it easier for scientists to dig through endless piles of data.</p><p>In November, an Aventis scientist discovered a new drug that might one day become a treatment for central nervous system, brain and spine diseases.</p><p>Loupos wouldn't discuss the new drug in detail. But he says without DiscoveryLink, the scientist might have overlooked the new compound entirely.</p><p>In the old days, scientists mixed compounds and chemicals in test tubes by hand. Back then, Aventis scientists produced 1,000 test results a year.</p><p>Today, much of the work is done by robots and computers, and Aventis generates some 40 million test results a year in its biological screenings of compounds.</p><p>\"As the ability to generate data gets better, the challenge of capturing the data, managing it, integrating it and providing it to scientists becomes more and more complex,\" Loupos said.</p><p>Making The Connection</p><p>There are two solutions to the data managment problem, each favored by different drug makers. One is to put all the data in an electronic warehouse as they become available, then sift through them for useful nuggets.</p><p>Aventis prefers a different option, what it calls the \"federated\" approach.</p><p>The company leaves all of its data in each of its four labs and uses the DiscoveryLink to connect them.</p><p>DiscoveryLink works like the Google search engine. The difference is, it doesn't just find documents with the exact words you type. It also logically sorts through all related research and data before presenting the most relevant ones.</p><p>Loupos' goal is to reduce the time it takes to take a drug from discovery to the Food and Drug Administration.</p><p>The process currently takes more than a decade. He wants to cut it to six to nine years. He's counting on DiscoveryLink to help him do it.</p><p>\"Now we can at least visualize the information (in a logical way),\" Loupos said. \"Before, this was never possible.\"</p><p>Paying Off</p><p>The DiscoveryLink system doesn't come cheap. Aventis spent $2 million on it, Loupos says. But, he adds, it's already begun to produce results.</p><p>\"We already see workflow efficiencies in research,\" he said. \"The (drug discovered in November) is now being studied for its chemical activities. Next year it goes into animal testing. If that drug ever comes to market and becomes a blockbuster, that's certainly the best metric (of success) I can think of.\"</p><p>Still, it's early in the program, and there's no proof any blockbusters will materialize.</p><p>Even if one doesn't, it's a safe bet that software designed to streamline the drug development process will only grow more popular.</p><p>Industrywide, sales of life sciences software grow at 18% a year in the U.S.. That's roughly double the growth rates for software products used in industries such as finance, banking, retail, distribution and manufacturing.</p><p>\"With the use of high throughput (drug) screening and the genomics revolution, labs are generating lots of data -- more than the scientist can understand and use,\" said analyst Michael Swenson of technology research group IDC. \"There's a greater reliance on computing.\"</p><p>IBM's life sciences unit is one of its fastest-growing segments of its overall business, Kovac says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-808529</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2003</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:48M2-8680-01J8-W4J4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"838\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Investor's Business Daily</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2003 Investor's Business Daily, Inc. \u00a0  www.investors.com</copyright><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"05\" year=\"2003\"><dateText>May 16, 2003 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>MERCK &amp;

The criticism has ramped up over the past year, especially after Democrats regained control of the U.S. House of Representatives. Many lawmakers worry the concentration of power in the hands of just a handful of large companies could damage the ecosystem of the economy. </p><p> 'The sheer size of these 'Big Tech' companies and their concentration of power influencing online traffic raises questions that should concern anyone who cares about market access and small business development,' Rep. Nydia Velazquez of New York said Thursday.  'There is growing anxiety, not only in the U.S. but around the world, that Big Tech poses a threat to innovation and competition,' she said. Velazquez made her remarks during a hearing Thursday by the House Small Business Committee to explore the influence of large tech companies. Velazquez, the panel's chairwoman, questioned the extent to which Big Tech is responsible for the 50% drop in the rate at which small businesses are started compared to 50 years ago. The hearing was part of a wider congressional and federal examination of Big Tech. Their almost exclusive ability to direct online traffic has raised major concerns about their influence on the survival and development of small businesses.  The House Antitrust Subcommittee, for its part, has held hearings and requested documents from the tech companies about potentially anti-competitive practices. The Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department also have opened inquiries into whether the big tech firms have violated antitrust law.  Earlier this week, House lawmakers called for two top antitrust regulators to take more action against large tech companies, accusing them of swallowing up competitors and consolidating power for years whilst avoiding serious scrutiny. At Thursday's hearing, Amazon and Google executives defended their companies, saying they play a pivotal role in helping small businesses to reach more consumers. 'By offering small businesses a low-cost way to reach customers worldwide, and through our investments to support these businesses, Amazon lowers barriers to entry for entrepreneurs,' said Dharmesh Mehta, the company's vice president of customer trust and partner support.  More than 50,000 small and medium sized businesses exceeded $500,000 in sales on Amazon in 2018, according to an Amazon  AMZN, -0.86%[1] report. Yet critics say Amazon sometimes modifies product-search results and even decides to sell or manufacture products itself, posing a substantial harm to small businesses. Lawmakers have called on the company to show more transparency and fairness in the way it interacts with businesses and customers. Like Amazon, Google  GOOG, 1.79%[2] also contends its online tools have helped small businesses to flourish. Erica Swanson, head of community engagement for its business-training Grow with Google initiative, defended Google's relationship with smaller firms. 'In 2018, Google's search and advertising tools helped provide $335 billion of economic activity nationwide' and 'more than 1.3 million businesses, website publishers, and nonprofits benefited' from the company's ad services, Swanson said. Those arguments did not appear to sway key lawmakers such as Velazquez. She said small businesses are at risk when they have to compete with large companies like Amazon and Walmart  WMT, -1.48%[3], which spend millions on advertising in order to appear on the first Google search page. This 'crowds the opportunity for small businesses to advertise online,' Velazquez said. 'Small businesses cannot survive on the internet if they cannot be found.'  Facebook  FB, 1.01%[4] and Apple  AAPL, 1.19%[5] were asked to testify but declined to do so.  'Their failure to appear not only impedes Congress' mission, but also speaks volumes about the companies' commitment to transparency and their very own customers,' Velazquez said.The post Medill News Service: Tech giants Google, Amazon and Facebook accused of posing threat to small business[6] appeared first on Financial Press - Breaking Stock Market News[7].

Social media offers the ability to communicate with the masses with a hitherto impossible specificity. This has thrown up hotly-contested issues, especially after Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One issue is the organised dissemination of misinformation, either as \"fake news\" or as paid political ads with false information. While there is consensus on the need for action against fake news, there is an interesting divergence on political ads. Facebook has carved out an exception for paid political ads from its fact-checking programme on the grounds that it is not the role of Facebook to adjudicate political speech in a democracy. On the other hand, Twitter has declared that it will stop all political advertising arguing that \"political message reach should be earned, not bought\". Twitter's stand may seem like it has the moral high ground but some concerns bear discussion.</p><p>The position of the two companies neatly sets up the policy framework and the choices therein: To carry political ads or not; to regulate political ads or not. Banning political ads will increase barriers to entry for smaller/newer entities, who require support to cross the initial threshold for visibility. Paid targeted advertising offers a cost-effective way to jump over this primary barrier and its banning will hurt new entrants. Well-funded and organised political entities will simply substitute paid advertising through employees and influencers to increase their reach.</p><p>Moreover, what is or isn't political is subjective. Consumer companies are increasingly making political pitches as a marketing tactic: A clothing company advertising that it pays fair wages; a company promising not to outsource jobs; big tech companies promising to invest in local housing; newspapers promising to report the truth. Are these ads political or apolitical? If we restrict \"political\" to only those ads aimed at public office, then how would we view the response of various companies to Donald Trump's immigration ban? A citizens' group mobilising for a candidate? How will we distinguish between candidates and proxies? Twitter may have decided that the conflict associated with political ads is not worth the trouble but the determination of what is political is itself conflicted.</p><p>If banning political ads is not possible, then some argue that political ads be fact-checked to ensure that voters are not fed targeted misinformation. This is reasonable. However, we may end up ceding democratic space to private companies. Political rhetoric often relies on exaggeration and spin. When spin and/or exaggeration shades into falsehood, it is personal and cannot be supplanted, wholesale, by private companies. In a polarised environment, private adjudication is likely to be arbitrary or seen to be so and it is certain every ruling will be challenged irrespective of merit. The logic of fact-checking if extended to other mass media will quickly get out of hand. Would a television or radio station carrying a live political speech be expected to stop transmission the moment a falsehood is uttered?</p><p>The real issue with online political ads is the ability to deliver (mis)information to targeted groups allowing the political entity to escape public scrutiny. A political party could conceivably target Dalits promising them social justice while simultaneously mobilising upper caste Hindus against reservations. If politics is ultimately about the collective and commons, then an argument against micro-targeting could be made. However, governance by definition encompasses multiple issues and it is difficult to argue that voters with different concerns be fed the same message. Perhaps a viable way forward could be transparency on all political ads along with associated targeting. This would expose hypocrisy and allow the Opposition to counter politically, as expected in a democracy. Other measures include clear labelling of political ads and spending caps to ensure that the smaller guys are not drowned by opposition content.</p><p>The rise of right-wing populism and the organised use of misinformation are political problems. A technological solution will necessarily be rule-based or algorithm-based and it is difficult to see how that could possibly address the essentially dynamic nature of politics. While some regulation is indeed desirable, it is important to ensure that we do not cede control over our democratic processes to private platforms.</p><p>Gupta is AICC joint secretary in charge of Congress' Student Wing.

She tweets @guptar</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The central problem at the heart of all electoral politics is the challenge of mass communication. Social media offers the ability to communicate with the masses with a hitherto impossible specificity. This has thrown up hotly-contested issues, especially after Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One issue is the organised dissemination of misinformation, either as \"fake news\" or as paid political ads with false information. While there is consensus on the need for action against fake news, there is an interesting divergence on political ads. Facebook has carved out an exception for paid political ads from its fact-checking programme on the grounds that it is not the role of Facebook to adjudicate political speech in a democracy. On the other hand, Twitter has declared that it will stop all political advertising arguing that \"political message reach should be earned, not bought\". Twitter's stand may seem like it has the moral high ground but some concerns bear discussion.</p><p>The position of the two companies neatly sets up the policy framework and the choices therein: To carry political ads or not; to regulate political ads or not. Banning political ads will increase barriers to entry for smaller/newer entities, who require support to cross the initial threshold for visibility. Paid targeted advertising offers a cost-effective way to jump over this primary barrier and its banning will hurt new entrants. Well-funded and organised political entities will simply substitute paid advertising through employees and influencers to increase their reach.</p><p>Moreover, what is or isn't political is subjective. Consumer companies are increasingly making political pitches as a marketing tactic: A clothing company advertising that it pays fair wages; a company promising not to outsource jobs; big tech companies promising to invest in local housing; newspapers promising to report the truth. Are these ads political or apolitical? If we restrict \"political\" to only those ads aimed at public office, then how would we view the response of various companies to Donald Trump's immigration ban? A citizens' group mobilising for a candidate? How will we distinguish between candidates and proxies? Twitter may have decided that the conflict associated with political ads is not worth the trouble but the determination of what is political is itself conflicted.</p><p>If banning political ads is not possible, then some argue that political ads be fact-checked to ensure that voters are not fed targeted misinformation. This is reasonable. However, we may end up ceding democratic space to private companies. Political rhetoric often relies on exaggeration and spin. When spin and/or exaggeration shades into falsehood, it is personal and cannot be supplanted, wholesale, by private companies. In a polarised environment, private adjudication is likely to be arbitrary or seen to be so and it is certain every ruling will be challenged irrespective of merit. The logic of fact-checking if extended to other mass media will quickly get out of hand. Would a television or radio station carrying a live political speech be expected to stop transmission the moment a falsehood is uttered?</p><p>The real issue with online political ads is the ability to deliver (mis)information to targeted groups allowing the political entity to escape public scrutiny. A political party could conceivably target Dalits promising them social justice while simultaneously mobilising upper caste Hindus against reservations. If politics is ultimately about the collective and commons, then an argument against micro-targeting could be made. However, governance by definition encompasses multiple issues and it is difficult to argue that voters with different concerns be fed the same message. Perhaps a viable way forward could be transparency on all political ads along with associated targeting. This would expose hypocrisy and allow the Opposition to counter politically, as expected in a democracy. Other measures include clear labelling of political ads and spending caps to ensure that the smaller guys are not drowned by opposition content.</p><p>The rise of right-wing populism and the organised use of misinformation are political problems. A technological solution will necessarily be rule-based or algorithm-based and it is difficult to see how that could possibly address the essentially dynamic nature of politics. While some regulation is indeed desirable, it is important to ensure that we do not cede control over our democratic processes to private platforms.</p><p>Gupta is AICC joint secretary in charge of Congress' Student Wing.
