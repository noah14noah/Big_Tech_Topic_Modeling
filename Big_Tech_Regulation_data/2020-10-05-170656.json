President Donald Trump has increasingly called out Google and other technology companies for suppressing conservative voices. In August, Trump said on Twitter that his administration is \"watching Google very closely.\"</p><p>The new probe follows existing investigations at the federal level by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, which are currently probing Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon for potential violations of antitrust law.</p><p>Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson said at a Washington press conference that the sheer number of attorneys general joining together sends a \"strong message to Google.\" A Google spokesperson didn't immediately respond to a request for comment by The Epoch Times on the new probe.</p><p>According to a press release, the investigation will focus on Google's \"dominance in the telecommunications and search engine industries\" as well as the \"potential harm\" the company may cause to consumers and the economy from any anti-competitive conduct. Google's parent company, Alphabet, has a market value of more than $820 billion and controls many facets of the internet. Google's dominance in online search and advertising enables it to target millions of consumers for their personal data.</p><p>Paxton said at a press conference that the states formally requested, on Sept. 9, documents from Google on its advertising business. Several of the attorneys general at the announcement in Washington described the investigation as \"preliminary\" but said they expected it would expand to cover other issues, including data privacy.</p><p>Alphabet said Sept. 6 that the Justice Department in late August requested information and documents related to prior antitrust probes of the company. The company added in a securities filing that it expects similar investigative demands from state attorneys general and that it is cooperating with regulators.</p><p>In a Sept. 9 statement, New York Attorney General Letitia James said Google's widening control could be a danger to consumers' rights.</p><p>\"Google's control over nearly every aspect of our lives has placed the company at the center of our digital economy,\" she wrote. \"But it doesn't take a search engine to understand that unchecked corporate power shouldn't eclipse consumers' rights.\"</p><p>'Significant Action'</p><p>Dr. Robert Epstein, a senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology, told The Epoch Times the new probe is \"quite important\" because the United States has done very little to keep companies like Google in check. Epstein has spent more than half a decade monitoring Google's influence.</p><p>\"A single lone state trying to fight Google is a great waste of time,\" Epstein said. \"When you have so many states fighting, that's a significant action. There are nearly 800 attorneys just in the attorney general's office in the state of Texas. We are talking about a lot of resources now being brought together going up against Google.\"</p><p>Epstein said he had been in regular touch with some of the attorneys general, in some cases going back several years.</p><p>\"The main thing they can do is to levy fines, and the problem is Google can just brush off fines,\" he said. \"Google has been subjected to more than $8 billion in fines by the EU in the last two years, approximately. But I don't think these fines will really have the impact that we need to have on Google.\"</p><p>According to Epstein, Google's power needs to be curtailed in three main areas: surveillance, censorship, and manipulation. Epstein said he has spoken to various attorneys general about these issues, but he wasn't sure if they had the authority. He said said Congress, the Justice Department, and the Federal Trade Commission could take much more concrete action.</p><p>Epstein said that even if Democrats swept the 2020 electionwhich he believed would end the federal investigations-the attorneys general probe would almost certainly persist. He said this was why the new probe is so important.</p><p>Epstein has discovered a dozen methods Google uses to manipulate public opinion or votes, including the search engine manipulation effect and search suggestion effect.</p><p>In 2016, Epstein conducted a secret monitoring project that showed that Google hid negative auto-complete search results for Hillary Clinton months before the presidential election. His peer-reviewed research found Google's algorithms can easily shift 20 percent or more votes among voters and up to 80 percent in some demographic groups.</p><p>Epstein, who considers himself a moderate who leans liberal, warned that if Congress becomes controlled by Democrats, \"Google's power in Washington will skyrocket.\"</p><p>\"This is exactly what happened in Obama's second term of office, where roughly 6 federal agencies were being run by former Google executives,\" Epstein said. \"Obama's chief technology officer was a former Google executive.\"</p><p>Reuters and The Associated Press contributed to this report.</p><p>A single lone state trying to fight Google is a great waste of time. When you have so many states fighting, that's a significant action.</p><p>Robert Epstein, senior research psychologist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2291989478</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">1576348ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X40-MHW1-DYR7-80CS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"935\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Epoch Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Epoch Times</publicationName><issueNumber>No. 530</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 10, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English UK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Google is expected to rake in more than $48 billion in U.S. digital ad revenue this year, far rivaling its peers, while capturing 75 percent of all spending on U.S. search ads, according to eMarketer.</p><p>\"They dominate the buyer side, the seller side, the auction side and the video side with YouTube,\" he said during a news conference alongside officials from 11 states and the District of Columbia.</p><p>Some of those attorneys general appeared to raise additional complaints about Google, ranging from the way the company processes and ranks search results to the extent to which it may not fully protect users' personal information. Their early rebukes raised the stakes for Google, threatening top-to-bottom scrutiny of its sprawling business beyond just ads. Paxton promised the probe would go wherever the facts lead.</p><p>\"There's nothing wrong with being a dominant player when it's done fairly,\" said Sean Reyes, the Republican attorney general of Utah. He said there is a \"presumption\" of innocence in such an investigation but still said there is a \"pervasiveness\" to complaints about Google's business practices.</p><p>Jeff Landry, a Republican from Louisiana, added: \"We're here because there's an absolutely existential threat to our virtual marketplace.\"</p><p>Google declined to comment, pointing to its previous statements saying it will work with state officials.</p><p>The probe marks the latest regulatory headache for Google and the rest of Silicon Valley, which have faced growing criticism - and widening state and federal scrutiny - into whether they've grown too big and powerful, undermining rivals and resulting in costlier or worse service for web users. The Post first reported the states' plans for a Google probe last week.</p><p>For Google, though, the states' investigation comes more than six years after federal watchdogs wrapped up an antitrust investigation into its search and advertising practices and opted against bringing major penalties against the company, including breaking it up. Regulators around the world, meanwhile, have been more skeptical of Google: The European Union has issued the company $9 billion in competition-related fines over the past three years.</p><p>The states' investigation is led by Texas' Paxton and seven other attorneys general, four Democrats and four Republicans in total. Every state except Alabama and California, the home of Silicon Valley, so far has signed onto the bipartisan effort, as have Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. A spokeswoman for California's attorney general did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Already, state officials have sent official legal demands for documents to the tech giant related to the investigation of online ads, Paxton told reporters.</p><p>Ashley Moody, the Republican attorney general of Florida, said the states' Google probe starts with the company's vast data stores. \"Google monitors our online behavior, and captures data on every one of us as we navigate the internet,\" she said. \"This investigation will initially focus on capture of that information and whether Google embedded itself on every level of the online market [for] ad sales to monopolize this industry.\"</p><p>Leslie Rutledge, a Republican attorney general from Arkansas, described Google as an \"online search engine juggernaut,\" raising her concern that searches for businesses, including doctors, are colored by the way the tech giant's algorithms and advertising systems work.</p><p>\"I want the best advice, from the best doctors - not the doctor, not the clinic who can spend the most on advertising,\" she said.</p><p>The states' investigation arrives as the Department of Justice and FTC also are scrutinizing Big Tech, and DOJ has taken early interest in Google. The agency issued its first legal demand for records at the end of August, according to a securities filing Google made Friday.</p><p>Another group of 11 state attorneys general - led by New York's Letitia James - has begun their own probe against Facebook, exploring whether it violates competition laws and mishandles consumers' personal information.</p><p>Some state leaders said they are working closely with their federal counterparts as these investigations unfold. But Karl Racine, the Democratic attorney general for D.C. and a participant in both the Facebook and Google probes, said he and his peers wouldn't hesitate to forge ahead if Washington once again opts against taking action against the tech giants.</p><p>\"The state attorneys general, they are an independent bunch, and they can be quite tenacious,\" he said . \"So I'm very confident that this bipartisan group is going to be led by the facts, and not be swayed by any conclusion, that may fall short, if you will, if it's inconsistent with our facts, on the [federal] side.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-319d3d603a8040e686569ce9369f71cb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X11-NF41-JB4M-V47F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"894\"/><timeReceived>6:08 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 9, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

They also sent a Framework for Consumer Privacy Regulation (attached below) that gives a roadmap for such regulation. ZDNet first reported this development.<br/><br/>This is important because: The US currently has state-by-state regulation of privacy, for example, with each state with a different privacy law. California is the only one with a Consumer Privacy Act, which will go into effect on January 1, 2020. At present, there's no federal (national/central) framework for data privacy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Who signed this letter? This letter was sent on behalf of Business Roundtable, a non-profit association that is made up of CEOs of some of the largest American companies across sectors. The signatories included: Jeff Bezos (Amazon), Michael Dell (Dell), Ginni Rometty (IBM Corporation), Ajay S. Banga (Mastercard), David Taylor (P&amp;G), Keith Block (Salesforce) and Doug McMillon (Walmart).</p><p>Wipro was the only Indian company to sign, with Abidali Neemuchwala, CEO of Wipro, also a signatory.</p><p>What does the letter call for?

Originally published at ValueWalk[1].66 Groups Urge House Antitrust Subcommittee to Subpoena Big Tech Diverse set of signatories represent civil society nonprofits, unions, and more   Q1 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[2]Activists Demand House Antitrust Subcommittee to Subpoena Big TechWashington, DC - Today, 66 groups, including Freedom From Facebook &amp;#38; Google, Athena, Demand Progress, and the American Economic Liberties Project, sent two letters to the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi copied, calling for the Subcommittee to 'compel the testimony of the chief executives and any other relevant leaders of Amazon, Apple[3], Facebook, and Google \u2014 and to subpoena any necessary documents that those entities might be withholding.' The letters seek to instill a sense of urgency within the Subcommittee. </p><p>With only six months left of the current legislative session, and after a year of work on their bipartisan investigation, the Subcommittee must act quickly to ensure that the investigation \u2014 and any subsequent reports \u2014 can be written with full consideration given to all relevant materials. The groups argue that Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple have significant power over the country's commerce, discourse, and communities\u2014power that is likely to increase over the course of the pandemic[4]. To allow these corporations to refuse to hand over critical documents or have their leaders ignore calls to answer questions from the nation's elected legislative body would be to cement the perception \u2014 and perhaps even the reality \u2014 that these corporations operate outside of the jurisdiction of Congress and regulators, and outside the rule of law.Statement Of Freedom From Facebook &amp;#38; Google's Co-Chairs'We applaud the Subcommittee for the measures they've taken to this point to uncover critical information about how these dominant platforms impact our economy and democracy,' said Sarah Miller and David Segal, Co-Chairs of Freedom From Facebook &amp;#38; Google. 'But as the investigations progress, the unwillingness of these corporations to be forthcoming, and misleading testimony by an Amazon employee before the Subcommittee, warrant a heightened degree of seriousness and speed. Congress needs to know how these corporations operate so that it can legislate, and that won't happen without timely action from the Subcommittee.' 'Jeff Bezos has already demonstrated his contempt for elected officials by dismissing their direct requests and sending his subordinates to mislead Congress on his behalf. As the richest man in the world, Bezos might think he is above any accountability. His arrogance is in a league of its own, but it's representative of an industry whose executives believe themselves to be above scrutiny from the American public. It's up to the House Judiciary Committee to prove them wrong. Rather than holding our breath and hoping that Bezos finally discovers his sense of public duty, the Committee should finish what they started and use their subpoena power to compel Bezos to testify,' said Maurice BP-Weeks, Co-Executive Director of the Action Center on Race and the Economy, an Athena member group. The letters can be read in full here[5] and here[6].Demand Progress is a national grassroots group with two million affiliated activists who fight for basic rights and freedoms needed for a modern democracy.

Q1 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[3] ValueWalk's Raul Panganiban interviews Jack Vogel, Phd, CIO/CFO at Alpha Architect. Q1 2020 hedge fund letters, conferences and more Interview with Jack Vogel ValueWalk's ValueTalks  Activists Demand House Antitrust Subcommittee to Subpoena Big TechWashington, DC - Today, 66 groups, including Freedom From Facebook &amp;#38; Google, Athena, Demand Progress, and the American Economic Liberties Project, sent two letters to the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi copied, calling for the Subcommittee to \"compel the testimony of the chief executives and any other relevant leaders of Amazon, Apple[4], Facebook, and Google \u2014 and to subpoena any necessary documents that those entities might be withholding.\" The letters seek to instill a sense of urgency within the Subcommittee. With only six months left of the current legislative session, and after a year of work on their bipartisan investigation, the Subcommittee must act quickly to ensure that the investigation \u2014 and any subsequent reports \u2014 can be written with full consideration given to all relevant materials. The groups argue that Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple have significant power over the country's commerce, discourse, and communities\u2014power that is likely to increase over the course of the pandemic[5]. To allow these corporations to refuse to hand over critical documents or have their leaders ignore calls to answer questions from the nation's elected legislative body would be to cement the perception \u2014 and perhaps even the reality \u2014 that these corporations operate outside of the jurisdiction of Congress and regulators, and outside the rule of law.Statement Of Freedom From Facebook &amp;#38; Google's Co-Chairs\"We applaud the Subcommittee for the measures they've taken to this point to uncover critical information about how these dominant platforms impact our economy and democracy,\" said Sarah Miller and David Segal, Co-Chairs of Freedom From Facebook &amp;#38; Google. \"But as the investigations progress, the unwillingness of these corporations to be forthcoming, and misleading testimony by an Amazon employee before the Subcommittee, warrant a heightened degree of seriousness and speed. Congress needs to know how these corporations operate so that it can legislate, and that won't happen without timely action from the Subcommittee.\" \"Jeff Bezos has already demonstrated his contempt for elected officials by dismissing their direct requests and sending his subordinates to mislead Congress on his behalf. As the richest man in the world, Bezos might think he is above any accountability. His arrogance is in a league of its own, but it's representative of an industry whose executives believe themselves to be above scrutiny from the American public. It's up to the House Judiciary Committee to prove them wrong. Rather than holding our breath and hoping that Bezos finally discovers his sense of public duty, the Committee should finish what they started and use their subpoena power to compel Bezos to testify,\" said Maurice BP-Weeks, Co-Executive Director of the Action Center on Race and the Economy, an Athena member group. The letters can be read in full here[6] and here[7].Demand Progress is a national grassroots group with two million affiliated activists who fight for basic rights and freedoms needed for a modern democracy.

The most commonly used method for sharing information with third parties is access to application programming interfaces (APIs).<br/>\"While it is true that open banking is still incipient and has different degrees of development in different countries in terms of regulation, adoption of standards and initiatives, it is also true that 64% of the managers interviewed in the ten countries already perceive that its competition in the coming years will be a combination of Big Tech, Fintech and Neobanks,\" the study details.<br/>Argentina is the second country \u2013 after Chile \u2013 with less interest in the eventual participation of technology giants as providers of financial services<br/>In the face of this new scenario, it is emphasized that the majority of managers believe that the promotion of a regulation of digital competition and the creation of collaborative ecosystems with new actors to develop new business models will be the reaction that prevailing in the banking industry.<br/>It also highlighted the role of specialized suppliers as the engine of these new ecosystems because of their ability to act as an intermediary between theto help and to implement new trends or to provide knowledge on the regulation of each geography.<br/>Less and less loyal customers<br/>Multi-carbonization is another trend that is growing at an accelerated pace, from which it follows that the current financial needs of consumers are not being met by a single entity and that, if so, this phenomenon could intensify in the next few years.<br/>Despite this, the Minsait Payments study said, the customer relationship is not perceived in the top 5 of the industry's challenges, which prioritizes issues such as digital transformation, bigtech competition, regulatory compliance or fraud and security. In this vein, the report warned that this circumstance could be occupied by the new players that will bring open banking.<br/>The payment initiation service is unknown in the banked population with online shopping experience. The level of ignorance in Argentina is 74.5% and exceeds 65% in eight of the ten countries analyzed. Payment initiation services are those that allow the consumer to pay for their purchases over the Internet without having to use any means of payment \u2013 such as a credit card \u2013 at the time of the transaction, since the payment of the product or service is made through d and an intermediary platform between the seller and the consumer. It is on this platform that the consumer has stored their bank details and therefore it is she who is in charge of managing the payment order with the merchant and with the bank.<br/>The perception of the security of the initiation of payments is low, in general, in contrast to the high perception of security that gives the customer the use of the card for their purchases, especially in Argentina and European countries, although in the country , six out of ten respondents would be willing to use these services once they are presented in their basic forms of operation.<br/>QR Payments (Photo: Pixabay)<br/>Among the possible innovations regarding payment authentication, it is the fingerprint that has the most advantage. More than 60% of the banking population is willing to use this medium, which is perceived to be safer, more modern, easier and faster than the current PIN, the report said. It also argued that the use of mobile devices as a means of payment has seen a sharp increase in new users, although it is still very low in physical stores.<br/>In Argentina QR code payments have been growing a lot, and regulation allows all wallets to be interconnected and all QR files can be scanned with any wallet.<br/>Meanwhile, the study highlighted the growth of the phenomenon of multi-bancarization. In that regard, he emphasized that the majority of the banking population already operates with two or more banks.<br/>\"The data gathered in this study see the creation of collaborative ecosystems between banking, Bigtech, Fintech and Neobanks that include specialized suppliers such as intermediaries to develop new business models and services that increase their competitiveness,\" he concluded.<br/>Online consumer trends in Latin America<br/>According to a Free Market report, 8 out of 10 Latin Americans bought online at least once in 2019. In addition, it is estimated that by 2023, e-commerce in Latin America will have growth rates close to 40%. And the \"marketplace\" platform is the protagonists, since 52% of the global sales of online commerce are made within them.<br/>In theBrazil is the country that has the lead in online shopping, while Mexico and Argentina share the podium and are among the countries with the highest growth in 2019.<br/>One of the main data reported by the platform has to do with the mobile trend and the relevance that smartphones are taking as a shopping channel through apps. Over the past year, more than 69% of purchases on Mercado Libre were made via mobile and the app had more than 44 million downloads regionally in its entirety.<br/>E-commerce as the main online search engine<br/>Currently, more than 75% of buyers in Latin America carry out the first search for products on e-commerce sites to find out, search for reviews and compare prices, highlights the study of the online platform.<br/>The growth of e-commerce is driven by several factors that drive online shopping. In this regard, convenience is one of the highlights: 41% of millennials, in developed countries, believe that purchases on marketplaces are more comfortable compared to physical stores, as it directly impacts on the optimization of the user's personal time.<br/>50% of users in the regions where Mercado Libre operates do not have a bank account, which excludes a large segment of consumers from online transactions<br/>On the other hand, in terms of barriers, one of the keys to unlocking the potential of e-commerce in the region is how users make their payments. The report of the online platform revealed that 50% of users in the regions where Mercado Libre operates do not have a bank account, which excludes a large segment of consumers from online transactions.<br/>For buyers, the benefits of online payments go beyond e-commerce operations or even access to credits for those who are \"out of the system,\" which also gives them the possibility of financing, which is a very ingrained habit in the region , since more than 55% of Latin American buyers who make credit card payments do so in installments.<br/>\"That is why it is important to provide financial solutions to achieve the democratization of trade and this is strongly associated with the efforts of Fintech operators. In this sense, on the one hand stands Mercado Pago, where buyers who use it to pay in The Free Market record edifold growth in the last year,\" the report said. And he added that on the other, users who have Mercado Credit, buy up to 4 times more than the average user of the platform.<br/>I kept reading:<br/>Mate Stanley: why its price is 300% higher than a traditional one<br/>The automotive sector and a brakeless drop: production down 20% in February and chained 18 negative months<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CENFEN-11131336</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CENFEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC4-TMH1-JBJN-M0RW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">443607</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1528\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CE Noticias Financieras All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CE Noticias Financieras English</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 5, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>economia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp;

credit cards in Argentina presented unique characteristics from a comparative perspective: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">six out of ten Argentines used the credit card very often</emphasis> (always or almost always) for purchases of high amounts (travel, cars, appliances) and, at the same time, the vast majority preferred to pay in interest-free installments, although this means having to do so in fewer installments.</p><p><br/>Although the credit card has an active role in the population, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">60.1% have never used their credit card to withdraw cash from the ATM and, of these, 44.3% are unaware of the existence of such a possibility, reflecting the highest level of ignorance among the sample of countries.</emphasis><br/>On the other hand, Argentina is the second country \u2013 after Chile \u2013 with the least interest in the eventual participation of the tech giants as providers of financial services, and only 17.5% say they are willing to share their banking information with bigtech in exchange for some benefit, while 29.5% do show interest in sharing personal social media information with your bank in exchange for better conditions.<br/>This is highlighted in the IX Payment Media Trends Report, which has just been presented by Minsait Payments.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Argentina has the largest increase in prepaid card holding from 23% to 28% tenure among the population.</emphasis> In addition, there is a sharp increase in the number of prepaid cards per capita in the interval of only one year: if in 2018 10.8% of those with this type of cards claimed to have more than one, in 2019 that proportion amounts to 22.3%.<br/>Globally, partnerships between the banking business and new technology players are the key to progress in means of payment to improve the competitiveness of the sector in the face of the challenges arising from the advent of Open Banking, the business model that facilitates the exchange of data between entities from recognizing customers as owners of their financial information.<br/>While it is true that open banking is still incipient and has different degrees of development in different countries in terms of regulations, adoption of standards and initiatives, it is also true that 64% of the managers interviewed in the ten countries already perceive that their competence in the coming years will be a combination of<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Big Tech, Fintech and Neobanks.</emphasis><br/>Faced with this new scenario, the study notes that most managers believe that promoting digital competition regulation and creating collaborative ecosystems with new players to develop new business models will be the reaction that prevailing in the banking industry.<br/>It also highlights the role of specialized suppliers as the engine of these new ecosystems for their ability to act as an intermediary element between business and technology, to accelerate the implementation of new trends

Frank[1] Surveillance! Cyberattacks! Spreading fake harmful online content! Oh My! A new study[2] reveals that overwhelmingly 82% of Americans think AI is going to be more harmful than helpful to humanity. Tech inventor and bazillionaire Elon Musk seems to agree. He has spoken many times about 'killer robots[3]' and how AI 'scares the hell out of' him. \ufeffSharyl Attkisson, 'Stuff that seems so funny in the movies sometimes comes to pass later. (It's) not just science fiction anymore.' Killer[4] - robots[5] - indeed[6]. \ufeff Even AI proponents have admitted there are definitely reasons for concerns[7] about AI's 'weaknesses and vulnerabilities that have become more pervasive with use.'In 2018, several high-profile controversies[8] involving AI served as a wake-up call for technologists, policymakers, and the public. The technology may have brought us welcome advancesin many fields, but it can also fail catastrophically when built shoddily or applied carelessly.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/machine-intelligence.jpgBut\">https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/machine-intelligence.jpgBut</url> none of this seems to deter AI proponents. The promotion of and passed legislation[9] for automated 'SMART' and 'Internet of Things[10]' (IoT) connected everything (including homes[11], businesses, cities[12], utility 'smart' meters[13], vehicles, and more), continues to be FORCED on Americans[14] and citizens around the world despite all the known problems. In regard to 'smart' meters, 48% of power and utility executives[15] seem to think cyberattacks are inevitable and want taxpayers to pay for fix this. And then there's job loss[16]. According to a recent 60 Minutes segment, 40% of Americans[17] are predicted to lose their jobs to AI.Kai-Fu Lee: AI will increasingly replace repetitive jobs. Not just for blue-collar work but a lot of white-collar work.Download Your First Issue Free! Do You Want to Learn How to Become Financially Independent, Make a Living Without a Traditional Job ...nally Live Free? Download Your Free Copy of Counter MarketsScott Pelley: What sort of jobs would be lost to AI? Kai-Fu Lee: Basically chauffeurs, truck drivers anyone who does driving for a living their jobs will be disrupted more in the 15 to 20 year time frame and many jobs that seem a little bit complex, chef, waiter, a lot of things will become automated we'll have automated stores, automated restaurants, and all together in 15 years, that's going to displace about 40 percent of the jobs in the world. Scott Pelley: Forty percent of the jobs in the world will be displaced by technology? Kai-Fu Lee: I would say displaceable. Scott Pelley: What does that do to the fabric of society? Kai-Fu Lee: Well, in some sense there is the human wisdom that always overcomes these technology revolutions. The invention of the steam engine, the sewing machine, electricity, have all displaced jobs. And we've gotten over it. The challenge of AI is this 40 percent, whether it is 15 or 25 years, is coming faster than the previous revolutions. Even though Mr. Lee is confident that 'human wisdom will overcome this technology revolution,' other tech moguls[18] are not. Many have been endorsing Universal Basic Income (UBI[19]) to offset the inevitable poverty caused job loss. Maybe it's because they don't want us to all starve to death[20]. Maybe it's because they're afraid we'll come after them[21]. Regardless, some of those who can afford to have been planning for 'Doomsday[22].' Proponents of AI and automated everything are unrelenting[23] and unapologetic[24]. Their mission[25] is more important than the human lives[26] that are being harmed[27] and lost. It's more important than how this is destroying the environment[28]. It seems we shouldn't only be worried[29] about killer robots. But who else will stand up against this[30] before few of us are well enough[31] to do so?

Respondents to a recent study\u00a0by Pew Research Center\u00a0seemed to think so, with 72 percent going as far as to say that they believe social media companies actively censor political views that clash with their own.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pew surveyed 4,594 U.S. adults between May 29 and June 11, and it found that 43 percent of them believe tech companies support liberal views over conservative views, while just 11 percent felt the opposite and 43 percent saw no bias.</p><p>This comes on the heels of Twitter\u2019s CEO Jack Dorsey \u201cbreaking bread\u201d with conservative leaders this week. The Washington Post reported that Twitter\u2019s chief \u201cconvened a rare private dinner with Republican leaders and conservative commentators in Washington\u201d last week to \u201cbuild \u2018trust\u2019 among conservatives who have long chastised the company \u2026 He defended Twitter against accusations that it targeted right-leaning users unfairly but still admitted that the company has room for improvement, according to the attendees.\u201d</p><p>Republicans and Republican-leaning independents were much more likely to accuse social networks of censoring political speech than Democrats were\u201485 percent believe it is likely that social media companies engage in this behavior, and 54 percent consider it very likely, while 64 percent believe tech companies more broadly support liberal views. Meanwhile, 53 percent of Democrats feel that tech companies support both sides equally.</p><p>Josh Nanberg, president of political and media consultancy Ampersand Strategies, wasn\u2019t surprised by Pew\u2019s findings, although he did say, \u201c85 percent is high, for sure.\u201d</p><p>Nanberg said of the distrust by conservatives, \u201cIt builds on a decades-long narrative that\u2019s been pushed first through conservative talk radio, and then Fox News. Social media becomes an echo chamber, where you get most of your news from people who believe what you believe. You\u2019re going to get that message reinforced a lot: If you see it everywhere you go, it must be true.\u201d</p><p>Eric Schiffer, chairman and CEO of digital marketing solutions provider DigitalMarketing.com and Reputation Management Consultants, added, \u201cConservatives see the decisions that are made publicly on silencing leading conservatives\u2019 voices or choices that are made that make them feel like they are not respected. Conservatives feel backstabbed. They look at big tech as devastatingly unfair.\u201d</p><p>To say that President Donald Trump uses social media\u2014particularly Twitter\u2014far more aggressively than his predecessors would be an obvious understatement, and that Twitter activity plays a role in firing up Republicans and Republican-leaning independents.</p><p>\u201cTrump has created a level of distrust for media in general and a groundswell of skepticism from the start,\u201d Schiffer said. \u201cThe areas of tech that contain media\u2014Facebook, Google\u2014already start out at a deficit.\u201d</p><p>Nanberg added, \u201cIt\u2019s not like [Trump] says something on Tuesday that garners a lot of attention: He says something at 10 a.m., noon, 2 p.m. and 4 p.m. on Tuesday that garners a lot of attention. He\u2019s like a tornado. I think the people who orchestrated the strategy have lost control of it. This is not an overnight sensation.\u201d</p><p>The differences were not as drastic when comparing gender instead of politics: 58 percent of respondents believe tech companies support the views of men and women equally, with 33 percent saying they are slanted toward males, with just 8 percent saying they support women over men.</p><p>In a more general look at the perception of major technology companies, Pew found that 74 percent of respondents believe their impact has been more good than bad, and 63 percent see that impact as a net positive.</p><p>However, just 3 percent believe those companies can be trusted to do the right thing \u201cjust about always\u201d and 25 percent \u201cmost of the time.\u201d Sixty-nine percent believe tech companies are no more or less ethical than their counterparts in other industries, while 22 percent felt that they are less ethical.</p><p>Is more government oversight the answer? A slight majority (51 percent) believes so, while 38 percent see the current level of regulation as appropriate and 9 percent said tech companies should be regulated less.</p><p>Democrats were more likely to call for heavier regulation than Republicans, at 57 percent and 44 percent, respectively.</p><p>Pew said 65 percent of respondents agreed with this statement about tech companies: \u201cThey often fail to anticipate how their products and services will impact society.\u201d Meanwhile, just 24 percent believe they do enough to ensure that the personal data of their users is protected.</p><p>How much should tech companies be worried about these trends, and can they reverse the flow? Schiffer said Pew\u2019s findings are \u201cnot a death rattle for the tech industry, but a call to arms that it has a mess on its hands in terms of trying to get back the fullest level of credibility and trust and drive more revenue.\u201d</p><p>He believes the fact that no meaningful alternatives to these platforms exist is helping keep them afloat despite the dissatisfaction from the right, saying, \u201cIf conservatives organize around a major player in tech because enough affliction has occurred, you are talking about a vulnerable entity. Some of the big tech entities would have a rathole on their hands. We\u2019d see a mass exodus.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-959999</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SNY-7FC1-DYRK-H4CX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"887\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>June 29, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

(AP) \u2014 The state of Mississippi is officially ending Prohibition, almost 90 years after alcohol was legalized in the United States. A new law allowing the possession of alcohol in every county in Mississippi was signed into law by Gov. </p><p>Tate Reeves on Tuesday. It will go into effect on Jan. 1, 2021.  Under current law, Mississippi is still considered a completely 'dry state.' However, local governments can hold elections where residents can decide if they want to allow liquor in their county or city or not. Most have voted in favor of it; there are only 29 out of 82 counties in Mississippi that are still dry.  The new bill does not legalize the sale of alcohol in every county. Residents would have had to vote to allow that.  Mississippi has had a long, complex relationship with alcohol throughout its history. Although there have been many fervent attempts to regulate its consumption and sale by state government, it is also a prominent cultural symbol, featured in many works by Mississippi's famous writers and musicians.  William Faulkner, for example, is known for his love of whiskey and his distaste for Prohibition. A bootlegger was an important character in his novel, 'Sanctuary.' Many blues songs written in Mississippi have featured alcohol, including John Lee Hooker's version of 'One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer\" and \"Sittin' here Drinkin'\" by Muddy Waters. Temperance efforts in Mississippi, mostly led by members of the Christian church, began in the early 1800s. Prohibition Convention Committee member Bishop C.B. Galloway referred to alcohol in 1878 in the Daily Clarion, now the Clarion-Ledger, as a 'public and dreaded evil' that caused good men to commit sins and embarrass themselves. In 1839, a law was passed that made it illegal to purchase less than a gallon of alcohol at once, which had a major impact on local taverns. Perpetrators were imprisoned from anywhere from one week to three months and had to pay a fine of between $200 to $500. (Ad) America's $51 trillion recovery will be of unheard magnitude. Only it's not from a single thing the government is doing. Or even from big corporations. Instead, it's due to one tiny pioneering American company. You won't believe what its made-in-America device does. It's poised to create more millionaires than pot stocks, cryptos and Big Tech \u2014 combined! The public reaction to that new law was vehement. Lawmaker Henry Foote was burned in effigy in Jackson for his work on the legislation, according to 'Prohibition in Mississippi,' a book by Rev. Thomas Jefferson Bailey, superintendent of the Anti-Saloon League of Mississippi in 1917. The law was repealed less than three years later.  Dozens of temperance laws were enacted in the Mississippi Legislature in the 1800s, including one in 1873 that mandated that if any state officeholders were 'found drunk, or in a state of intoxication from the use of intoxicating liquors,' they be charged with a high misdemeanor and removed from office.  Mississippi was the first state to pass some form of prohibition in 1908, about a decade before the 18th Amendment made Prohibition the law of the land in the U.S.Mississippi was the first state to ratify the 18th Amendment.  In 1933, when the 21st Amendment ended Prohibition, it was ratified by 36 states in 288 days. However, in Mississippi, the measure stalled for decades.  The subject of alcohol became a major controversial political issue in Mississippi, according to the late orator and former state Rep. Ed Perry of Oxford. 'The worst question you could be asked was how you felt about whiskey,' Perry said in a filmed speech.  A speech about the legalization of whiskey in the early 1950s by lawmaker and judge Soggy Sweat is now famous. When asked how he felt about whiskey, Sweat avoided answering the question by presenting two sides of the argument.  \"If when you say 'whiskey' you mean the devil's brew, the poison scourge, the bloody monster, that defiles innocence, dethrones reason, destroys the home, creates misery and poverty, yea, literally takes the bread from the mouths of little children ... then certainly I am against it,\" Sweat starts out.  Then, he changes course. 'But if when you say 'whiskey' you mean the oil of conversation, the philosophic wine, the ale that is consumed when good fellows get together, that puts a song in their hearts and laughter on their lips ... if you mean that drink, the sale of which pours into our treasuries untold millions of dollars. ... then certainly I am for it,' he says.  In 1966, Mississippi became the last state to repeal its statewide Prohibition law and pass the current law allowing counties to decide for themselves whether they wanted to legalize liquor sales.

No investor relations person wants to see \"hold\" and \"sell\" ratings issued for their stock. In reality, a \"buy\" rating really means \"hold.\" \"Hold\" ratings really mean \"sell\" and \"sell\" ratings mean get out while you still can. If Wall Street's top analysts are consistently giving \"hold\" and \"sell\" ratings to a stock, you know there's a serious problem. We've compiled a list of the companies that Wall Street's top equities research analysts are consistently giving \"hold\" and \"sell\" ratings too. If you own one of these stocks, consider getting out while there's still time. This slide show lists the 20 companies that have the lowest average analyst recommendations from Wall Street's equities research analysts over the last 12 months.View the \"20 Stocks to Sell Now\"[2].

Strengthened by the addition of Barry Devon as co-founder and head of customer acquisition, Akita set its sights on the emerging customer success industry. </p><p>To keep costs low while building Akita\u2019s new offering, Smith and Sandra Pender (his fianc\u00e9e and founding team member) spent the next 18 months living the life of \u201cdigital nomads\u201d. </p><p>While Devon remained in Dublin building Akita\u2019s local customer base, Smith and Pender worked remotely from Mexico, Hawaii, France, Cork and most recently, Tallinn in Estonia. </p><p>\u201cAkita\u2019s early mission \u2013 to help companies better understand their customers \u2013 has never wavered and lays the foundation for our innovative new offering,\u201d says Devon. \u201cThough it has taken a winding path, we\u2019re confident that Akita is poised to become a leader in the exploding customer success industry.\u201d </p><h>Amryt Pharma</h><p>Amryt Pharma is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and delivering innovative new treatments to help improve the lives of patients with rare and orphan diseases. Established last year, the Dublin-headquartered company has already acquired two companies, secured European approval for its lead product Episalvan for treating minor wounds, and listed on the Irish and British stock exchanges. </p><p>Focused on developing best-in-class orphan or rare disease treatments, Amryt is developing a new epidermolysis bullosa (EB) treatment, a rare and distressing genetic skin disorder affecting young children for which there is currently no treatment. Analysts\u2019 estimates suggest this could unlock a $1 billion market for Amryt. </p><p>Amryt\u2019s founder and chief executive Joe Wiley was a doctor before holding senior positions as medical director of Astellas and European head of Sofinnova Ventures. Wiley is an industry veteran,  having previously backed Opsona and Innocoll. </p><p>\u201cIreland is a great place to establish a new internationally focused business like Amryt. It has a well-educated and entrepreneurial workforce, a favourable funding environment, easy access to most countries and, post-Brexit, Malta and Ireland will be the EU\u2019s only English speaking countries,\u201d says Wiley. </p><p>Amryt\u2019s funding involved a reverse takeover of a quoted cash shell, as well as raising \u00a310 million. Some of this will fund phase III trials on Episalvan as a treatment for EB, which could allow Amryt to submit Episalvan for EU and US approval. </p><p>In the near-term, the company is building revenue by selling its Imlan skincare product. </p><h>Anchorlily</h><p>Anchorlily is a start-up that creates multi-sensory products for people with dementia. Its first product is a \u201clife blanket\u201d which provides comfort to users by capturing their important life memories in images. \u201cOur mission is to promote their well-being, maintain connections to their identity and provide opportunities for engagement within their world,\u201d founder Catherine Daly, an occupational therapist, says. </p><p>\u201cWe have encountered great support through the local enterprise offices, start-up networks and through Enterprise Ireland\u2019s New Frontiers programme. This mixture of funding and mentoring enabled us to launch our first product after we completed the programme in 2016.\u201d </p><p>Since then, Anchorlily has attracted private investment and is pursuing strategic partnerships in Britain for its next range of products. \u201cWe are basing ourselves at the Synergy centre in IT Tallaght, which provides an environment where we meet other entrepreneurs, mentors and have ready access to advice and support. We are also staying engaged with the range of state-funded enterprise supports that are available,\u201d Daly says. </p><p>Anchorlily plans to expand its operations, focusing on Ireland initially and then expanding outwards. Its plan is to launch a new product \u2013 a protective bed bumper \u2013 in the near future and it is looking for further funding to fund expansion. </p><p>\u201cThere are 46.8 million worldwide living with dementia and this is set to treble by 2050,\u201d says Daly. \u201cWe want to provide products that will help people live well with the condition and stay connected to their identity, family and friends.\u201d </p><h>AQMetrics</h><p>AQMetrics is a regulatory risk management and compliance software company that utilises the latest cloud computing and big data analytics technology to save clients both time and money in navigating their regulatory environment. </p><p>    The company was founded by Geraldine Gibson in 2012 with a team experienced in regulatory risk and compliance solutions. </p><p>    Before spearheading AQMetrics, Gibson worked for seven years as head of professional services at Norkom Technologies prior to its sale for \u20ac217 million to the defence and security giant, BAE systems. </p><p>    In February, the company concluded a funding round that raised $3.25 with backing from companies including Bluff Point Associates, a Connecticut-based private equity firm, Enterprise Ireland and Irish venture capital firm Frontline Ventures. </p><p>    \u201cThere is a very clear gap in the market for what we do,\u201d Gibson says. \u201cOur recent fundraising will allow us to scale and expand our team.\u201d </p><p>    AQMetrics has helped companies like InterTrust navigate cross-border compliance and meet regulatory reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions. </p><p>    The company recently opened a New York office, where it plans to expand and diversify its client base of alternative investment management and broker companies. \u201cRegulation can\u2019t be escaped. We are targeting a multibillion-dollar market,\u201d says Gibson. </p><h>Arralis</h><p>Tech start-up Arralis provides expertise in micro and millimetre-wave technology, partnering with other technology providers to build products which are used not only globally but also in space.  </p><p>The company was founded at the end of 2013, when there was a shift in focus from microwaves to very high-frequency millimetre waves. </p><p>\u201cCompanies had no choice but to move out of microwaves,\u201d says co-founder Barry Lunn. \u201cNo one was doing millimetre waves at scale, so we saw an opportunity there to be ready for that roll-out.\u201d </p><p>Lunn and co-founder Mike Gleaves worked together for ten years previously in another company before setting up Arralis. After working on the other company\u2019s products for a year, a seed round at the end of 2014 allowed them to focus on their own product. </p><p>The company is unusual in that its business is 100 per cent international.  </p><p>\u201cBecause of the nature of what we do, there\u2019s no market in Ireland,\u201d says Lunn. \u201cWe provide products for people working on drones or space stations or building wireless networks \u2013 that\u2019s not happening here.\u201d </p><p>With business in the US and Asia as well as in Europe, Lunn says they have \u201clots of air miles clocked up\u201d.  </p><p>Their first customer in Europe for their own product was the European Space Agency. \u201cThat was huge,\u201d says Lunn. \u201cThey\u2019re a great reference customer.\u201d </p><p>Enterprise Ireland was essential to bringing the ESA on board as a customer. \u201cThey guided us through the process and brought the right people to the table.\u201d </p><p>The company is actively involved in fundraising and Lunn says they are \u201cconstantly adding people\u201d. With the focus at the moment on the US and Asia, \u201cthe ambition is to grow something big\u201d.  </p><h>BetterExaminations.ie</h><p>BetterExaminations.ie is the initiative of third-year Trinity College Dublin students James Eggers and Daniel Hobbs. Their site offers quick and easy access for secondary school students to Junior Certificate and Leaving Certificate exam papers.  </p><p>\u201cWhen I was in school, I found the existing system for accessing exam papers really hard to use\u201d says Eggers. \u201cUsing it every day, it becomes fairly tiresome, so I decided to create a better version.\u201d  </p><p>The resulting site proved extremely popular among his classmates, saving them time and streamlining their study, he says. </p><p>Going on to study computer science at Trinity, he met BESS student Hobbs, and the two joined forces in September 2015 to create the business. \u201cHe takes care of the business side and I do the nerdy stuff,\u201d laughs Eggers.  </p><p>The pair began to sell to schools, including the Institute of Education, St Michael\u2019s and Blackrock College, and the profits began rolling in. \u201cWord of mouth has been really important in increasing exposure,\u201d says Eggers. \u201cThe site now has over 65,000 users and we have developed two apps \u2013 one for iPhones and one for Android.\u201d </p><p>This year Eggers\u2019 and Hobbs\u2019 company is taking part in LaunchBox 2016, Trinity\u2019s three-month accelerator programme for start-ups. Their next step is to introduce BetterExaminations for universities, which will make it easier for universities to upload papers and for students to search and download papers. They also plan to launch the BetterExaminations Teacher Awards, which will recognise teachers around Ireland for contribution to student life both inside and outside the classroom.  </p><p>\u201cBalancing the website with a full-time degree can be hard,\u201d admits Eggers. \u201cWe mostly work on it in the evenings, but the aim is to work on it full time once we graduate.\u201d  </p><h>BEUTiFi</h><p>If you\u2019re trying to find a restaurant, you turn to JustEat or Yelp. If you\u2019re looking for a hotel or hostel,  there\u2019s Booking.com \u2013 but if you\u2019re trying to find a hair or beauty salon, where do you turn? BEUTiFi.com was created to fill this gap, making it simpler and more convenient to discover salons and book appointments. </p><p>The site is essentially a subscription-based online platform connecting salons and professionals with consumers. Founder Richard Spence explains how the site provides a service to businesses and clients alike.  </p><p>\u201cSalons receive new clients which they go on to retain; and we improve their efficiency by helping them use some of the 35 per cent empty capacity they currently have, increasing their revenues and improving their online presence. We offer consumers informed choice, peer reviews, the best prices and offers all in one place, the ability to book online in real time 24/7 and rewards for making bookings. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s crazy to think that in this day and age, less than 30 per cent of salons have an online presence,\u201d Spence says. \u201cWe are moving a traditionally very offline industry online.\u201d </p><p>BEUTiFi.com went live in Ireland in summer 2015 and has received funding from NDRC and Enterprise Ireland. It was runner-up in the Bolton Trust Innovation Awards and recently won a place on Google\u2019s Adopt a Start-up programme. </p><p>The site now has over 1,700 salon customers, including 1,000 customers in Britain through the purchase of a competitor called SalonAddict. </p><p>\u201cWe have our sights set on building a \u20ac100 million plus business by becoming a leading global online marketing platform for the hair and beauty sectors and the \u2018go to\u2019 discovery and booking portal for consumers,\u201d says Spence. </p><h>Boost Bites</h><p>Healthy snack company Boost Bites produces a range of energy-boosting raw snacks. Gluten free, dairy free and vegan, they tick all the \u201cclean eating\u201d boxes. </p><p>Boost Bites founder Cliona Hegarty previously worked as a teacher for over six years, before finding herself in the food industry. She is passionate about healthy food and helping people achieve a balanced lifestyle.  </p><p>With support in the form of mentoring and funding from Dublin BIC, Enterprise Ireland and Dublin City Local Enterprise Office, Boost Bites has gone from strength to strength. \u201cI have a bit more breathing space now, and I\u2019m able to share responsibilities,\u201d Hegarty says. \u201cMy team has grown to four people and I feel very proud of what we have achieved so far. </p><p>\u201cStart-ups are like a rollercoaster ride: you climb to the top of multiple challenges on a daily basis,  which can seem somewhat overwhelming, but the freefalls down with every small success is what keeps you energised \u2013 that and my many packets of Boost Bites! The thrill of seeing my products on shelves will never get old.\u201d </p><p>The plan for 2016 is to scale the business. Boost Bites\u2019s products have recently secured a listing abroad, so export arrangements are in the works. Hegarty says she is lucky to be riding the wave of the health and wellness sector. </p><p>\u201cPeople are prioritising their health and demanding genuinely healthy products, however, they don\u2019t want to compromise on the taste,\u201d she says. \u201cMy mission from day one was to disrupt the snacking industry with genuinely healthy and truly tasty wholefood snacks and so far so good.\u201d </p><h>BuilderEngine</h><p>BuilderEngine is a cloud website builder for creating smarter websites. It offers accessible tools which make creating websites easier, regardless of the creator\u2019s skill level or experience. The platform currently has over 130,000 users, with more than 90,000 joining in the last six months. </p><p>The team consists of five people, led by founder Keith Killilea. He previously worked in games development, and his background in the website development industry stretches back to 1997.  </p><p>\u201cA few years ago, I decided to take a break from the industry and looked in detail at the web engines,\u201d says Killilea.  </p><p>\u201cI was shocked at the state of all of them, and the gap for a fully developed web engine for both new users and professionals was clear to me. </p><p>\u201cSetting up in Ireland is a straightforward process, and while there can be improvements with less red tape, it is on the right path.  </p><p>\u201cWe have self-funded the start-up with side projects and early investors, and now we are looking to secure a seed round to allow the business to expand faster. </p><p>\u201cThe future of BuilderEngine is to become the leading platform globally in the cloud for SME websites, including start-ups which want to prototype complicated sites within minutes,\u201d he says.  </p><p>\u201cWe want to power the future generation of websites across the world by giving non-designers and professionals the right tools to create complicated websites with ease, offering them features which match the professionals\u2019.\u201d  </p><h>Buymie</h><p>Buymie is an on-demand grocery delivery service. It allows users to order grocery and household items from their favourite local stores via an app, and organises for them to be delivered in as little as one hour by a personal picker.  </p><p>The start-up, which was founded in 2015 by Devan Hughes and Artavazd Sokhikyan and launched in Dublin in February of this year, has generated over 4,000 downloads in the first six months.  </p><p>\u201cStarting Buymie has been a rollercoaster from the get go,\u201d says Hughes. \u201cOur mission is to transform the way people view grocery shopping and allow customers to get whatever they need whenever they need it. </p><p>\u201cWe have a great team with a really diverse background, from data science in academia, to software development and cloud computing for Fortune 500 companies. There is a thriving start-up community in Ireland and it\u2019s also incredibly cheap to get up and running as there are so many programmes that provide support and subsidised services for anything from advertising to server costs.\u201d </p><p>Raising funding, however, has been a challenge for the start-up. \u201cWe still have a very small pool of investors, but it is growing,\u201d says Hughes. \u201cAfter raising initial funding from friends and family, we were nominated as a high-potential start-up with Enterprise Ireland, which gave us access to additional pre-seed funding and introductions to angel investors. We\u2019re right in the middle of a new large funding round to help us expand our operation in Ireland and enter the British market.\u201d </p><h>Carefolk</h><p>Carefolk.com is a Cork-based e-health start-up founded in 2016 by developers and entrepreneurs Owen O\u2019Doherty and Shane McCarthy. O\u2019Doherty\u2019s mother suffered from Parkinson\u2019s Disease and, surprised at how poor technical solutions were for the caring families and homecare companies, he built out the first version of Carefolk. This won the UCC Entrepreneur of the Year 2015, and Microsoft Gold Medal for .Net project of year.  </p><p>\u201cWhether you are looking after a child with autism or a partner or parent with dementia, providing ongoing care is not easy,\u201d says O\u2019Doherty. \u201cThe average length of care is seven years, the practicalities are endless and it can become quite isolating. To make matters more difficult, most are \u2018accidental carers\u2019 and have received no training. At Carefolk, we provide the tools and supports to make the lives of those who provide care better.\u201d </p><p>Carefolk is developing two complementary web and mobile products. Carefolk Family allows for the easy co-ordination of care between family members, as well as homecare professionals. Carefolk Pro is a full management suite for care professionals and homecare companies, which reduces their cost base through the automation of business processes. </p><p>Although it is early days, Carefolk has global ambitions. \u201cWe will continue to innovate, build out our smart creative team and develop a global user base and brand based on products that help and inspire people,\u201d says O\u2019Doherty. \u201cWe are working towards building an IoT [internet of things] integrated care system.\u201d </p><h>ChangeX</h><p>ChangeX is a non-profit online platform which supports local community initiatives, providing funding and information to help social entrepreneurs realise their ideas. The platform connects like-minded people and allows them to organise activities and build teams of volunteers. Some of the movements featured on the site include CoderDojo, Fighting Words and FoodCloud. </p><p>Since the site was launched in 2014, it has had little trouble attracting investors, despite being a not-for-profit organisation, raising over \u20ac400,000 during its first year. Early investors included Ben &amp; Jerry co-founder Jerry Greenfield, Storyful founder Mark Little and businessman Dermot Desmond.  </p><p>Change X has run various campaigns to encourage individuals to engage in their communities and put their ideas into action, like last year\u2019s ChangeX100. \u201cPeople are looking for more purpose and meaningful work, but it can be difficult to find the right opportunities,\u201d says founder and chief executive Paul O\u2019Hara. \u201cThat\u2019s where ChangeX comes in \u2013 we can do a much better job at it, but we have a start. </p><p>\u201cWe want to connect the world\u2019s best social innovations with growing numbers of people in local communities who want to make things better,\u201d he says.  </p><p>\u201cOur next step is to continue growing in Ireland, experiment with international expansion \u2013 starting in the twin cities of Minneapolis and St Paul in the US from September \u2013 and to solidify our business model for sustainable growth. </p><p>\u201cThe ChangeX model can work anywhere, and our ambition is to be the number one international platform for social change. Our philosophy is: make it easy for people to do the right thing, and many will.\u201d </p><h>Code Institute</h><p>Code Institute delivers full stack web development courses, both in class and mentored online, where students learn the skills required to kick-start a career in web and application development from accredited industry-validated coding courses that are reviewed by big tech companies including PayPal, Accenture and Morgan McKinley.  </p><p>With a rapidly growing ICT skills gap and current academic methods, such as four-year computer science degrees failing to fill the talent pipeline with \u2018plug-and-play\u2019 industry ready developers, Code Institute developed an intensive coding bootcamp.  </p><p>It produces industry-ready coders in as little as 12 weeks that employers can easily identify.  </p><p>Code Institute secured \u20ac500,000 syndicated investment from Kernel Capital and Enterprise Ireland, which is enabling it to expand its reach in existing European markets and to create a suite of future courses and develop its current syllabus. </p><p>\u201cThe start-up world is incredibly fast-paced, but Ireland is a supportive incubator for all things tech. In one year, Code Institute has grown in staff, moved premises and expanded into new territories abroad,\u201d says Rory Toal, digital marketing executive at Code Institute.  </p><p>It currently partners with Learning People in Britain, and hopes to expand to four more territories by the end of 2016. </p><h>Child Paths</h><p>Dublin-based start-up Child Paths has developed an app which allows parents an insight into what their children do during their days in childcare facilities. </p><p>\u201cI came up with the idea back in 2012 when my daughter had just moved from one childcare facility to another one,\u201d says founder Ciaran Flynn. \u201cAt that point, I didn\u2019t know much about childcare; like many parents, I thought it was just like a babysitting service, but I did some research and found out that that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\u201d  </p><p>Flynn developed the idea over two years, launching Child Paths in September 2014.  </p><p>\u201cThe first year was about validating the idea, then we took on our business development manager Robbie Carey and started focusing more on product development and customer service,\u201d he says. </p><p>He explains how the app works. \u201cChildcare facilities currently capture everything with pen and paper, but our software allows them to do that quicker and more efficiently and communicate this with parents.\u201d </p><p>Child Paths is active in different facilities from Galway to Kerry, and has had interest from the US in the product. \u201cResearchers liked our product because the focus was on the child\u2019s development,\u201d says Flynn. </p><p>\u201cIn the future, we\u2019re looking at bringing this software to primary schools,\u201d says Flynn. \u201cIt will work along the same lines, trying to highlight and showcase what children do in school for parents so they can support their child\u2019s development at home.\u201d </p><h>CleverBooks</h><p>Albert Einstein once said: \u201cIf you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales.\u201d CleverBooks is built on this philosophy, producing sets of personalised educative stories where every child is the main character of the story. </p><p>Founder Darya Yegorina is a firm believer in the power of fairy tales. The idea for CleverBooks came from the stories her husband used to tell to their child, which she adapted to facilitate eating habits and make sure she was brushing her teeth daily.  </p><p>\u201cFairy tales, in general, help kids to understand the world and adapt,\u201d she says. \u201cSo why not use the fairy tales where the kids are the main characters? This helps them to get more involved in the story, realise their own behaviour in some way and also see the positive outcome of doing things differently.\u201d </p><p>In each personalised story, the child plays a positive character.  </p><p>\u201cHe or she is trying to understand things, makes mistakes, but understands and realises, apologises when he or she feels guilty and always becomes smarter and learns from his mistakes,\u201d says Yegorina.  </p><p>The creative team has developed different stories which cover topics to help parents, including the importance of brushing teeth, helping parents, eating vegetables, keeping bedrooms clean and in order, being honest, sharing with friends, and the dangers of eating too many sweets. </p><p>The self-funded company currently produces books for retail, as well as a self-service option for book-creating online. The start-up was one of 15 Irish companies shortlisted in Virgin Media\u2019s Voom pitch-a-thon in London this year. </p><h>Cogni</h><p>Dublin-based start-up Cogni acts as a smartphone banking service for businesses. \u201cThere has been a fundamental shift in the small and micro-business world,\u201d says founder Archie Ravishankar. \u201cThey no longer operate the way they operated 20 years ago because advances in technology and easier access to global markets mean that small businesses now trade without borders.\u201d </p><p>Ravishankar, an Australian native, chose to establish the fintech company in Ireland in order to access the single European market. Across the EU, the freelance economy is the fastest growing group in the market: it has seen growth of over 45 per cent in the past ten years and now employs more than nine million people. Companies dealing with this economy have to manage vendors, suppliers, contractors and employees in multiple locations which generates large volumes of complex data. </p><p>\u201cTraditional banks have failed to provide significant business value beyond their basic one-size-fits-all banking solution for these businesses,\u201d says Ravishankar.  </p><p>\u201cCogni is addressing this underserved, dynamic market by providing business banking that is faster, cheaper and more relevant to their individual business needs.\u201d </p><p>The start-up allows companies to create a British and Sepa bank account in less than 15 minutes for any business in Europe, offering a single account that manages multiple currencies with an integrated payment solution to help businesses reduce cross-border currency complexities.  </p><p>\u201cBanking should not just be a utility, it should be something which helps and supports a business,\u201d says Ravishankar. \u201cIt should give insight and understanding, support growth and be delivered through on-demand mediums which people use today for all their other activities.\u201d </p><h>Cohort</h><p>Dublin-based start-up Cohort is a service which allows users and companies to leverage their networks better. Serial entrepreneur Eamon Leonard plans to launch the start-up, which is his fifth business, this month. Leonard previously co-founded Orchestra, a start-up which was sold to Engine Yard in a multimillion-euro deal in 2011. He has assembled eight angel investors to back his new business.  </p><p>The rest of Cohort\u2019s small team is made up of Eoin Hurrell, who joined the company as data lead from Aon; Brendan Hastings, who previously worked with Paddy Power, who is the start-up\u2019s design lead; and developer Alex Kirwan.  </p><p>Cohort works by building on the networks people already have in order to connect them to the people they need. </p><p>\u201cWe look at, for example, how people know each other on Twitter, who they have in common, friends of friends, what skills they have based on their profile, what they talk about and who they talk about it to,\u201d says Leonard.  </p><p>\u201cWe have the guts of ten or 20 years of people putting up information about themselves online,\u201d Leonard says. \u201cYou have relationships fragmented across social networks, email, phone lists, laptops, other places. There isn\u2019t a single place where your relationships are quantified and you can understand the potential that sits in there. I see this as a massive missed opportunity.\u201d </p><h>Cortechs</h><p>After graduating from UCC with a BSc in neuroscience and a PhD in neuropathology, \u00c1ine Behan went on to research and lecture at the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland. With ten years\u2019 postdoctoral experience in preclinical research, she felt that there were many areas of science and technology that had not yet made a commercial leap, with brainwave sensing technology being one of them.  </p><p>Behan\u2019s expertise lies in the effects of stresses \u2013 such as drugs \u2013 on mental health and neurodegenerative disease.  </p><p>She founded Cortechs, a company that uses neuroscience, brainwave technology and gaming to improve attention deficit behaviours in children and adults. </p><p>It currently offers a mobile game for iOS and Android called Zip and the Misty Mountain, which aims to improve focus in six to 12-year-olds. </p><p>Cortechs uses Neurofeedback, which retrains the way brainwaves respond and can improve focus. In the Zip game, the more focused a child is, the more rewards they get within the game. Parents receive digestible and actionable feedback from the game on what their child has learned and improvements in their attention behaviour. </p><p>Early investors in Cortechs include Enterprise Ireland and the NDRC Catalyst programme. It has also received EU funding from the European Commission. The company expects to expand in the EU and into the US and Middle East.  </p><h>Couture Intel</h><p>Adare native and founder of Couture Intel, Maria Phillips moved to Australia after working in the banking sector in Dublin for over ten years. Finding herself in a lucrative job with the Queensland government which gave her 60 holiday days a year, Phillips began to travel extensively throughout Asia. </p><p>\u201cI went everywhere: China, Hong Kong, Japan, you name it,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cAnd as I was travelling, I was shopping. With my new job, I was able to buy more luxury items, but I still wanted the best price, so I kept a spreadsheet as I went with price comparisons. </p><p>\u201cA lot of my friends in Australia were doing the same thing and they asked me to help them get better deals. So they\u2019d tell me the products they wanted and I\u2019d do them up a spreadsheet.\u201d  </p><p>Returning to Ireland in 2015, Phillips discussed making her Excel-based project a viable business, with her friend and web developer/engineer Niall Collins. He saw the potential in the idea, and together the two founded Couture Intel. </p><p>\u201cWe were lucky in that we didn\u2019t need to look for funding to set up the company \u2013 it was all about the idea,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cWe took part in Bank of Ireland\u2019s Startlab incubator project in January in Galway which was great because it introduced us to more established companies who were able to give us really valuable feedback.\u201d  </p><p>Couture Intel is currently reaching out to retailers and anticipates bringing their first customer on board within the next two months. And the future? \u201cWe\u2019re looking at some London and Dublin incubators at the moment,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cBut we plan to focus on a small number of customers initially to build a solid relationship. Meeting with potential customers to talk through what we\u2019re doing is more powerful than bombarding them with emails and advertising.\u201d </p><h>Deposify</h><p>Deposify is a fintech start-up offering escrow services for rental deposits. The company provides banking, payments and dispute resolution services for landlords, tenants and letting agents in order to make the renting relationship run more smoothly. </p><p>Founded in 2014 by Jon Bayle, a former corporate solicitor, Deposify recently launched its rental deposits product in Dublin and is busy expanding in the US, where it has operations in Boston. </p><p>\u201cPeople put deposits on stuff every day, from real estate to retail \u2013 and that\u2019s where the problems start,\u201d says Bayle. \u201cWe want to take escrow from legal services and make it an everyday thing for deposits. Deposify lets our users manage and control how and when deposits are paid by delivering an escrow service mobile first \u2013 making it available out of traditional banking hours.\u201d </p><p>Deposify has partnered with Bank of Ireland for its banking solution and recently closed a \u20ac1.1 million funding round, with Delta Partners, Escher Group plc, Enterprise Ireland and private investors participating. </p><p>Deposify\u2019s experience as a start-up in the fintech sector has been challenging. \u201cThe technology and regulatory hurdles are rightly very high \u2013 you\u2019re dealing with people\u2019s money after all. This requires a significant investment in time and money, even before you launch,\u201d says Bayle. </p><p>Deposify currently has a team of 13 working across a variety of roles, from technology to sales and marketing. </p><p>\u201cStart-ups are a team sport \u2013 having great talent is key. I\u2019m not from a technology background, and so when Tony Kelly, former chief executive of a global gaming company, came on board, his expertise and experience in dealing with large online communities and technical teams was invaluable for us.\u201d </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUBUPO-484310</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUBUPO2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KNX-7CX1-F0B4-8418-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315448</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5275\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Post Publications Ltd.

You didn\u2019t hear it much in everyday language, and it certainly wasn\u2019t associated with trust-busting. In the digital world of today, it\u2019s come to mean the measurable tidbits and inputs that add up to make every program and app \u2014 and thus much of the world\u2019s economy \u2014 function. And the fact that it isn\u2019t anywhere to be found in antitrust rules is a big problem.   To have data is to have power, and collecting it is the lifeblood of four of the most valuable companies in America: Facebook Inc., Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Apple Inc. Together, they are worth more than $5 trillion by market cap. That\u2019s like adding up the market values of Walmart Inc., Johnson &amp; Johnson, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Procter &amp; Gamble Co., Pfizer Inc., Coca-Cola Co., Exxon Mobil Corp., Nike Inc., McDonald\u2019s Corp. and Walt Disney Co. \u2014 and then multiplying that sum by two. Calling it \u201cBig Tech\u201d doesn\u2019t even do it justice.   These leaders of social-media, online-search, e-commerce and smartphones are so embedded in consumers\u2019 lives that it\u2019s nearly impossible to avoid interacting with them on a given day and handing over reams of data, all for free, in the process: Checking emails, \u201cliking\u201d a post about Taylor Swift, clicking on an enchiladas recipe, joining a group for novice knitters, searching for bug spray and new eyeglass frames, looking up the UPS store\u2019s hours and directions to it, downloading a fitness app and geo-tagging a selfie at the beach \u2014 innocuous activities that are meticulously tracked to build a profile of who you are and predict how you\u2019ll spend your money.   That power hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by regulators, Congress and other critics, many of whom wonder whether the companies\u2019 dominance is a sign that current antitrust laws have come up short in regulating this relatively new industry. The answer is, they have \u2014 and that\u2019s not all that surprising considering current laws were written with largely traditional businesses in mind, in which a tangible product or a service is built using suppliers and then sold to an end user. How Big Tech makes money can feel a bit more nebulous to an outsider, as well as who exactly is hurt by some of the industry\u2019s practices. Their customers are advertisers and other large and small businesses. The product is, well, you.   Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai of Alphabet Inc., Google\u2019s parent company, appeared last Wednesday over video chat before a Congressional committee that\u2019s investigating whether the industry has a monopoly problem. The Federal Trade Commission is also examining whether past acquisitions by these companies were anticompetitive. The industry doesn\u2019t see it that way; when the members of Congress pointed to known instances of data misuse or overreach, the CEOs often chalked it up to one-offs or minor mishaps, rather than patterns of harmful business practice aimed at squelching competition. Where critics see an anticompetitive move, Big Tech sees a noble effort to improve service for consumers.   It\u2019s time that antitrust laws were updated so that regulators can better chaperone the industry \u2014 and its treasure trove of data \u2014 for it is both an immense intellectual and economic national asset and an opaque force with the power to capitalize on unknowing consumers and suppress rival businesses. Even with the best of intentions to create beneficial services that keep the world connected and informed, the result of Big Tech having such unchecked power over reams of valuable information has been to leave consumers and third-party partners comparatively powerless.   Amassing so much data isn\u2019t inherently anticompetitive \u2014 nor does it directly hit people\u2019s wallets \u2014 but regulators need to look at how it\u2019s collected and used and take action when competition is harmed in the process. Amazon makes for the simplest example of how it can become problematic: The company has been accused of using the highly detailed information it gathers from sellers on its marketplace to inform what products to make for its own private label, AmazonBasics, and to undercut the competition. That\u2019s a major conflict of interest and an unfair advantage over third-party sellers, but there\u2019s nothing those sellers can really do about it \u2014 Amazon is practically the only game in town. (Would any reasonable person consider Etsy Inc. or even EBay Inc. to be substitutes?) Bezos said using seller data to aid Amazon\u2019s own brand would be a company violation, but he didn\u2019t deny that it happens and said he\u2019s looking into the issue.   This type of accusation against Amazon is the clearest example of monopoly power. Others aren't so clear-cut. My colleague Tae Kim summarizes more of the complaints about the companies here and explains why issues around Google are particularly thorny. This is precisely where the U.S. antitrust framework gets tripped up by the digital-data industry. Take the U.S. guidelines on mergers, which state:   A merger enhances market power if it is likely to encourage one or more firms to raise price, reduce output, diminish innovation, or otherwise harm customers as a result of diminished competitive constraints or incentives.   Rising prices are the most obvious way mergers can be harmful. But small acquisitions by Big Tech tend to fall into that all-encompassing \u201cotherwise harm\u201d category described above. Facebook\u2019s 2012 takeover of Instagram was harmful because it left social-media users with few alternatives, forcing them in effect to accept the company\u2019s terms and further widening its lead over newcomer apps. Even if regulators couldn\u2019t have predicted this at the time, it\u2019s indisputable now that Facebook dominates social media and that spinning off Instagram would restore competition. (It would probably  be good for shareholders, too, as Tae Kim has argued.)   The FTC says that antitrust laws were intentionally written in general terms, allowing them to be broadly applied and interpreted in changing times on a case-by-case basis. But it may be that they are overly broad to the point of being antiquated, or at least not specific enough to effectively govern Big Tech. For example, the idea of \u201cprices\u201d should also include the price social-media users pay \u2014 the level of data they must fork over and the loss of control they have over that data. Another steep price that can be paid in the digital era is a privacy breach. Facebook\u2019s controversies involving its data aren\u2019t merely public-relations matters \u2014 they stem from competitive dominance and insufficient regulatory oversight.   Antitrust enforcement also comes down to how regulators define markets. \u201cIn the absence of price competition, market definition can be difficult,\u201d Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division, said in a November speech regarding the data industry. \u201cAntitrust enforcers may need to play an even greater role in zero-price markets,\u201d he said. Rather than a zero-price market, Google and Facebook would argue that they compete healthily in the $333 billion global digital-advertising space, with Amazon nipping at their heels in the U.S. and Apple\u2019s devices serving as conduits. But the ad market provides an incomplete picture, and that framing implies these companies are merely a powerful foursome. Defining the market more narrowly \u2014 and more accurately \u2014 shows how each one has instead become a monopoly of sorts, having carved out its own silo with few, if any, true competitors.   Advertisers may regularly adjust how much money to allocate to each site, but they generally need to be present on all of them. Facebook provides the ability to target ultra-specific subsets of people. Google isn\u2019t just a search engine, it\u2019s the primary verb people use for search, and it further feeds that dominance by scraping useful information from other pages, making its products priority destinations. For sellers of goods, Amazon\u2019s marketplace offers the best reach. App developers don\u2019t have much choice than to agree to the Apple app store\u2019s onerous terms and fees. Consumers don\u2019t pick and choose between these products and services either \u2014 they must use them all or accept life under a rock.    Regulators would also be more effective if antitrust laws specified how data can be used and with what limitations, as well as requirements for safeguarding it. That would prevent Amazon from having such porous walls between its marketplace and internal brand. It could put an end to Google\u2019s practice of paying to keep its search engine dominant and being able to direct so much traffic toward its own sites.    Data should no longer be thought of as just an input for effective advertising, but rather the focal point of the question of whether Big Tech has too much power. If the answer is yes, and the remedy is creating an environment that would allow more Instagrams and Googles to flourish, wouldn\u2019t everyone benefit?

Commodity prices, from iron ore to wool, are rising, interest rates are steady and Donald Trump looks to have a tax deal to tweet about. Our sharemarket is resting after cracking the 6000 level, yet it could do better. To find your vehicles of choice, we offer the thoughts of The Weekend Australian 's contributors for the year ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BATTERY BOYOS Lithium, cobalt, nickel, graphite 1. Orocobre (ORE) Orocobre is building an Argentine-based industrial chemicals company through its portfolio of lithium, potash and boron assets. In partnership with Toyota Tsusho Corp (TTC) and JEMSE, it is operating a brine-based lithium operation to produce lithium carbonate for sale to industrial, technical and battery markets. It plans to double lithium carbonate capacity at Olaroz to 35,000 tonnes a year and to build a 10,000-tonne lithium hydroxide plant in Japan. Liked by Patersons. Rated a buy by Citi.</p><p>2. Altura Mining (AJM) A small explorer cum developer, it has run up strongly on its big hard-rock lithium project at Pilgangoora in WA, 120km south of Port Hedland, in addition to its diversified iron ore and coal assets in Australia and Indonesia. Already mining ahead of commissioning a production plant, Altura shares have doubled in a year. As Richard Hemming of Under the Radar Report queries, \"Who knows how far it can go?\"</p><p>3. Kidman Resources (KDR) Recent announcements about its half-owned Earl Grey lithium prospect near Southern Cross in WA suggest high-grade intercepts for a mineral upgrade. The company says there is funding flexibility on the back of resource upgrades. Another very positive announcement and it should continue to attract buyers. Liked by Marcus Today, Patersons and StockAnalysis.</p><p>4. Syrah Resources (SYR) Near completion of a big graphite mine at Balama in Mozambique. Institutional investors have loaded up on new shares in a recent $74 million capital raising. Some will go to the existing graphite mine and some to develop a battery anode plant at Louisiana in in the US.</p><p>5. Ardea Resources (ARL) A nickel cobalt play that has enjoyed a big run - up and down - on its cobalt potential, based on drilling at the Kalgoorlie Nickel Project Cobalt Zone in WA. It also holds an interest in the Lewis Ponds zinc-gold deposit in NSW, and the Mount Zephyr gold and nickel sulphide project in WA. It may have more to go, according to Patersons.</p><p>6. Redflow (RFX) Battery maker Redflow has developed a small-scale zinc-bromide flow battery that stores 10KW hours of power. After a false start with a manufacturing facility in Mexico, the company is gearing up to build its batteries in Thailand from early next year. Redflow will need more capital in 2018 to support expansion plans, but its ability to meet underlying demand for its domestic and industrial power storage product is the project's limiting factor.

Expansion of the company's new lithium mine, 120km from Port Hedland, could make it the biggest in the world, to pip the Chinese-owned mine at Greenbushes in the southwest of WA . Liked by StockAnalysis, Under the Radar Report, and is UBS's favourite in the lithium arena.</p><p>GOLD 8. Artemis Resources (ARV) A Pilbara explorer gripped by gold fever, Artemis has soared then stalled on disappointing drilling results. It has a joint venture with Toronto-listed Novo Resources at Purdy's Reward 100km south of Karratha, which has some big-name backers. Fellow-seekers of the Witwatersrand-style conglomerate gold, with nuggets like watermelon seeds, include Venturex (VXR), De Grey Mining (DEG), DGO Gold (DGO), Segue (SEG), Marinda Metals (MZN) and Kalamazoo (KZR). After some spectacular four and five-fold leaps in price, most are back in the trenches after drilling disappointments. A punter's paradise.</p><p>9. Breaker Resources (BRB) Has a greenfields discovery at Lake Roe, 100km east of Kalgoorlie in WA. Its price has doubled in the past six months, ahead of drilling results expected in March. One to watch if the drilling results prove up, according to Patersons.</p><p>10. Gold Road Resources (GOR) Aims to commission its 50 per cent-owned Gruyere goldmine east of Laverton in WA early in 2019, targeting output of about 270,000 ounces a year. The long-life operation will support the company's active exploration program, where recent success indicates that the company is well advanced towards establishing a multi-mine province on its Yamarna Greenstone Belt. Liked by StockAnalysis.</p><p>11. Capricorn Metals (CMM) The company has established a viable gold reserve at Karlawinda, southeast of Newman in WA's Pilbara. A feasibility study supports development. The company has raised more funds for an exploration program aimed at expanding mine life beyond nine years. This project is shaping up to be the next significant gold- mine in WA after Gold Road's Gruyere. Liked by StockAnalysis</p><p>12. Regis Resources (RRL) A mid-cap goldminer from WA with a strong production and dividend history. Regis's Duketon project has compelling economics - even at current gold prices - and the company is well positioned to generate positive operating cash flow. Management suggests gold production in FY18 of 335,000-365,000 ounces, with all-in costs of $940-$1010 an ounce. While much hangs on future gold prices, its focus on growth plus dividends is liked by Lincoln Indicators and Wise-owl.</p><p>BASE METALS 13. Metals X (MLX) Runs a high-margin tin mining operation in Tasmania while expanding reserves and lowering costs at the Nifty copper and gold mine in northern WA. The company has about $100m of net cash and plans a $288m spend in 2018 to build a plant that will treat tin tailings. StockAnalysis says Metals X has exploration potential around the Nifty mine and exposure to nickel and cobalt at the remoteWingellina project.</p><p>14. OZ Minerals (OZL) Arguably Australia's pre-eminent copper miner, it is expanding with the underground Carrapateena project, 160km north of Port Augusta. It holds promise for a long life of low-cost copper production. Liked by StockAnalysis.</p><p>COAL Tough love 15. Universal Coal (UNV) A rare gem in the unpopular coal sector, Universal is humming along nicely with its two part-owned mines in South Africa: Kangala and the New Clydesdale Colliery. Universal shares spurted after the company announced an inaugural dividend of 1c a share, with expectations the board could stretch to a 2c payout if current trends continue. But they have since retraced some of their gains. Liked by New Criterion.</p><p>OIL AND GAS Sagging in surplus 16. Woodside Petroleum (WPL) Woodside is widely thought to be ex-growth and it has struggled to replace reserves and replenish resources in recent years. Yet Woodside has made intelligent moves to shore up future output and its LNG plants can generate more revenue without more reserves being on the books. The preoccupation with reserves has obscured Woodside's high-quality infrastructure and value is now on offer. Liked by InvestSMART.</p><p>17. AWE (AWE) Subject to takeover bids for its potential to benefit from higher east coast gas prices, among other reasons. Contracts for the supply of gas from the Otway and Bass Basin projects roll out into 2019, when prices of more than $6 per gigajoule might be expected. AWE's 50 per cent-owned, massive Waitsia gas project north of Perth will be a producer for decades to come for AWE and partner Beach Energy. The price has ticked up but is still cheap, in the eyes of StockAnalysis, saying suitor Minerals Resources could sell non-Perth Basin assets and retain Waitsia for free!</p><p>18. Sacgasco (SGC) A Perth-based energy company in a consortium drilling and testing for natural gas in California's northern Sacramento Basin that has already found gas at the Dempsey prospect. Additional targets are being prepared for drilling and testing in 2018. The prize could be large in a market that is likely to find itself short of gas in a couple of years as large LNG export projects are commissioned in the US. Liked by StockAnalysis.</p><p>19. 3D Oil (TDO) Holds 100 per cent of the T-49-P permit in the southern Otway Basin, where seismic data indicates prospects with potential for several trillion cubic feet of prospective sales gas.

FAR (FAR) A 15 per cent partner in the $10 billion SNE oilfield off Senegal, where Woodside has bought a 35 per cent interest. BP is reportedly interested, too. FAR also has an 80 per cent interest in adjacent permits to the south, off the coast of Gambia, where a target for 825 million barrels of oil has been identified. FAR plans to drill this Samo prospect in 2018 after farming out to a fund. Liked by StockAnalysis.</p><p>TECH TIDDLERS Share the gear 21. Collaborate Corp (CL8) Runs the online platforms for car and caravan sharing DriveMyCar, MyCaravan and Mobilise, the latter set up for building equipment and perhaps later the office furniture and space market. Since listing in January 2015, it has traded between 1c and 4c. Wise-owl suggests the DriveMyCar unit is tracking towards a cash-flow break-even and values it at 6c.</p><p>22. Cape Range (CAG) Focused on accounting and business intelligence services, the formerly Malaysian-based Biztrak business is profitable and cash-flow positive, while user numbers on the platform have grown steadily since inception. Cape Range listed in December 2017 and its tightly held share register and undemanding valuation are attractive qualities, in the eyes of Wise-owl.</p><p>23. CCP Technologies (CT1) The \"Internet of Things\" tech minnow plays in the asset monitoring sector using wireless sensor technology. It has zeroed in on the unmet demand for reliable real-time monitoring of commercial refrigeration facilities. At the moment, a cafe owner may not know that their fridges and freezers have been subject to an overnight power outage and this poses a public health hazard. At the end of the September quarter, CCP had 1000 monitoring points in service, including contracts with Las Vegas casinos and restaurants. Management cites a pipeline of 50,000 sensors, based on existing client orders. With a $6m market cap, CCP is a speccie techie punt liked by New Criterion.</p><p>TECH TYROS Electronic athletes 24. Xero (XRO) An online accounting software that gives small businesses and their accountants everything they need to run their operations, from keeping track of all the numbers to preparing reports. Has moved its share base to the ASX from New Zealand. Rated a buy by Citi.</p><p>25. IDP Education (IEL) A provider of international student placement services and English language testing services. Lincoln Indicators suggests it would suit an investor looking for a quality education-based business in a sector which, though large, has its corporate challenges. It also owns and operates English language schools in Southeast Asia and organises educational events and conferences globally. It listed on the ASX in 2015 and is 50 per cent-owned by 38 Australian universities.</p><p>26. Amaysim (AYS) A reseller on the Optus network and Australia's fourth-largest mobile carrier, amaysim has more than 1 million subscribers and with high fixed costs and high incremental margins, the economics get better as it grows. EBITDA margins have doubled over the past few years and use of a common platform to sell electricity and broadband should generate higher profits. As a reseller, amaysim benefits from Optus's capex without incurring the cost and the model is highly cash generative. The price-earnings ratio makes it look dear but the cash flow shows amaysim is still cheap. Liked by InvestSMART.</p><p>27. WiseTech Global (WTC) WiseTech's software is used by 19 of the 20 largest global logistics service providers in more than 125 countries. It's been on a buying spree recently that has added to its client base and in December was added to the S&amp;P/ASX 200 index. Lincoln Indicators suggest it's a long-term growth story, especially with founder Richard White still at the helm.</p><p>28. TPG Telecom (TPM) Everyone knows the NBN will lower broadband margins and that consensus has savaged the share price. InvestSMART agrees broadband margins will fall but says there are lots of levers TPG can pull to offset those falls. \"As the industry's lowest cost producer we expect volume gains and the corporate business continues to grow both customers and margins. We also think the entry into mobile can be done cheaper and more effectively than what many expect because of TPG's existing infrastructure and the lack of legacy assets to maintain.\" TPG could seriously disrupt the mobile market - high margin incumbents beware, according to InvestSMART.</p><p>29. Appen (APX) Appen is a language technology data and services provider (for speech recognition and content relevance in search engines) to government and corporate enterprises. It earns 95 per cent of its revenue from the US, after buying US rival Leapforce. In short, it helps machines learn to read, write, listen and speak in 150 different languages. Appen employs more than 300 people in six countries. The company has grown earnings well since listing in 2015. Liked by Lincoln Indicators.</p><p>30. Next DC (NXT) One of UBS's perennial favourites looks likely to have another strong year in 2018.

Next DC will also open three new data centres in each of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane in 2018.</p><p>31. MNF Group (MNF) An online voice communications business that is growing organically and through acquisitions. It has a deal to supply voice services to the Victorian government, and in 2017 reached agreement to buy voice conferencing and collaboration business Conference Call International. Other names include Symbio, CallStream, GoTalk and Connexus. The share price has risen four-fold in three years, and keeps moving. Liked by Lincoln Indicators and Under The Radar Report.</p><p>32.

With 4.2 million active accounts, Trade Me is as well known in NZ. Despite high market penetration, premium ad evenue grew at least 25 per cent in the company's three online classifieds divisions in 2017. The share price is down because of Facebook's new Marketplace venture and Amazon's launch in Australia, so Trade Me looks excellent value to InvestSMART.</p><p>BIOTECHS Bugs a go-go 33. Anatara Lifesciences (ANR) Anatara is developing a natural remedy for scour - diarrhoea in piglets - now treated with antibiotics that are being banned throughout the food chain. Anatara's product Detach is being evaluated by the local veterinary drug gatekeepers. But a big advantage is that the drug was sold in the 1980s under a previous owner. In August, global animal health giant Zoetis said it would exercise an option to develop Detach. Commercial terms are yet to be negotiated, but New Criterion thinks this is likely to lead to fat milestone and royalty cheques for Anatara.</p><p>34. Phosphagenics (POH) The biotech play lost its way after its CEO was jailed in 2014 for her part in a $6m fraud against the company. But New Criterion says there are two key reasons to buy now. First, its targeted penetrating matrix (TPM) technology has gained the support of a Japanese partner to develop a transdermal oxymorphone patch. TPM is all about more effective drug delivery through the skin. Second, Phosphagenics could have a potentially lucrative payday in court. The Singapore International Arbitration Centre has just finished hearing a damages action bought by the company against pharma giant Mylan, in relation to a previous licensing deal over the world's most widely used injectable antibiotic. Phosphagenics has claimed $380m. An ambit claim, perhaps, but even an award of a fraction of this amount would dwarf the company's market cap of about $23m.</p><p>POTS OF POTENTIAL Intriguing plays, specialty finance and moving in on the banks 35. Money3 (MNY) With plans to move beyond unsecured payday lending, Money3 sees its future as a financier of used motor vehicles for those with a tarnished credit record, and in other secured areas no longer sought by the big financiers. Its shares have eased back from highs of a year ago despite strong net profit through its national network of 66 branches, online Cash Train business and a broker network. Patersons has it as a buy, with a price target of $2.15 in 12 months.</p><p>36. Axsesstoday (AXL) A provider of equipment funding for small to medium-sized enterprises in hospitality, transport and other sectors. After a good 2017 financial year, it could move into new sectors and regions, according to Patersons, which rates it a buy with a price target of $2.37.</p><p>37. Credit Corp (CCP) The company's core operation lies in debt purchase and debt collection, with 65 per cent share of the Australian market. It recently acquired Cashfirst from Thorn Group. Led by long-serving CEO Thomas Beregi, future growth will look to come from the US, where the offshore expansion has taken time but appears to be bearing fruit. Liked by Lincoln Indicators.</p><p>38. Eclipx Group (ECX) A fleet management and leasing operator that also deals in equipment finance and corporate customer loans. The company remains well placed to deliver growth organically and through acquisitions over coming periods. The acquisition of Grays Online, announced in May 2017, should help earnings this year. Liked by Lincoln Indicators.</p><p>39. Platinum Asset Management (PTM) In the past year, the company has been a little underweight in the US, and remains so compared to others. Wise-owl regards it as well-diversified and attractive when valuations across the US are sitting on multi-decade highs.</p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE Building, building 40. CIMIC (CIM) With all the talk about more infrastructure, the big builders could do well, at home and abroad. A joint venture in which CIMIC subsidiary Leighton Asia holds a 70 per cent stake has secured a $390m contract for construction work at Hong Kong international airport. It's also just won a $2.5bn contract to build Melbourne's West Gate Tunnel. Liked by Patersons. Not cheap, says Padley Today, but one to watch if the market moves lower.</p><p>41.

Abundant Produce (ABT) A plant science company with two strings to its bow: developing better vegetable seeds for food, such as cucumber, tomato and eggplant, and selling to multinational seed distributors. It is making inroads on the international market for natural cosmetics and nutraceuticals. The company has established sales channels into China and recently announced its Tomato Infusion Daily Face Cream has been added to Alibaba's T-Mall Global \"Must Buy\" product list.</p><p>43. Beston Global Food (BFC) A diversified food stock in South Australia that sells Edwards Crossing and Mable-branded dairy products locally through IGA and Foodland outlets, and exports milk powder, cheese and bottled water to China, Vietnam and Singapore.

A2Milk (A2M) The star in the milk market, based on its protein-strong milk that goes well in China and the US. A new chief executive is now at the wheel. Has a high PE of around 50, which might make further price growth hard to achieve. Liked by Bell Potter and Morningstar.</p><p>45. Bega Cheese (BGA) An attractive future yet looking a little expensive. Bought Mondelez in Australia, and is completing the integration including rebranding to Bega Vegemite and Bega Peanut Butter. It appears set to be a conglomerate with a wider business than just cheese and milk. Liked by Patersons.</p><p>46. Rural Funds Group (RFF) Pays a still-attractive yield despite a share price doubling in two years.

Medical Developments International (MVP) An Australia-based healthcare company, with three segments to its business: pharmaceuticals (selling Penthrox), medical devices (particularly the Space Chamber and Breathy-Alert Peak-Flow meter) and veterinary products. The company operates in Australia, New Zealand and overseas. Liked by InvestSMART. Had a big run from $5 a share to close to $7.</p><p>48. Virtus Health (VRT) The market leader in IVF has excellent returns on capital, throws off plenty of cash and its international operations are ticking along nicely. What's more, increasing rates of infertility due to women having children later in life all but guarantees that demand for IVF will grow over the long term. With a price-earnings ratio of 12 and dividend yield of 5 per cent, Virtus in the eyes of InvestSMART offers plenty of value.</p><p>HEALTHCARE Regulated growth 49. Lifehealthcare Group (LHC) Imports, develops and distributes high-end surgical and other medical devices. The stock appears under-priced, perhaps in reflection to potential changes in the federal government's prostheses list, yet management has reiterated its full-year guidance of high single to low double-digit growth in revenue.</p><p>50. Integral Diagnostics (IDX) Once trading at a discount to its peers, shares in this radiology and imaging company have shot up due to a hostile cash and scrip takeover bid from junior healthcare imaging rival Capitol Health (CAJ). Earlier, a new CEO and CFO had been bringing costs under control, while the balance sheet remained strong.</p><p>51. SomnoMed (SOM) Somnomed offers an oral appliance to help those suffering from mild to moderate obstructive sleep apnea. It's a large market with much unmet demand - a 10th centre in the US opened recently under the Renew Sleep Solutions brand. UBS thinks there's a growth market ahead.</p><p>INDUSTRIALS Large and lovable 52. Brambles (BXB) Brambles is trading below Morningstar's $12 fair valuation, as investors appear to overlook the growth potential in its pallets business. In the next four years, Brambles will spend $1.5bn on new pallet offerings (nestable pallets, wheeled units, cardboard layer pallets). Morningstar sees potential expansion into adjacent supply chains, such as home and hardware and pharmaceuticals, market segments that could double CHEP's addressable market.</p><p>53. BHP (BHP) Has rebounded strongly on rising iron ore prices, yet could do more and perhaps have an on-market share buyback. Citi has it as a buy and a price target of $31.50.</p><p>54. Adelaide Brighton (ABC) One for an exposure to strong infrastructure and residential markets. The company is the largest lime producer and second-largest cement supplier in Australia. A recent agreement with Lendlease to supply construction material to the $985m Northern Connector Project in South Australia should bolster the company's ability to maintain a stable dividend yield. Liked by Lincoln Indicators.</p><p>55. Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL) Its share price is about 50 per cent below its peak, for an undemanding valuation given the company's balance sheet strength, recent operational improvements and somewhat defensive business model. A mix of capital management initiatives and a rebalancing of the product portfolio has the potential to drive earnings growth, in Wise-owl's eyes.</p><p>56. Brickworks (BKW) Despite the name and a stunning building boom, this is not a business at peaky earnings or frothy valuations. The market has difficulty valuing this conglomerate and often just resorts to comparing multiples with peers. Yet Brickworks is nothing like its peers. The property division and investment holdings are the most valuable bits of the business and, while we expect building products earnings to fall over time, there is still value on offer for the conservative investor. Liked by InvestSMART.</p><p>57. Goodman Group (GMG) As the owner and developer of warehousing and warehouse facilities, Goodman stands to benefit from the rise of global demand for industrial property. Operations in 16 countries contribute more than half its earnings. Such a foothold allows it to take experience from one market and apply it to another. Accumulate says Morningstar, as it has the most favourable growth outlook given the importance of large-scale, modern warehouses in distribution chains. Rated a buy by Citi.</p><p>58. AGL Energy (AGL) AGL stands to win on rising wholesale electricity prices, regardless of whether it closes the coal-fired Liddell Power Station in the Hunter Valley. A hot, dry summer could spike up wholesale electricity prices on a system stretched to capacity - painful for east coast consumers but good for shareholders who already enjoy tasty dividend yields of 4.6 per cent.

Monash Absolute Investment Fund An absolute return fund with a small-cap bias that has returned 11.4 per cent a year over the past five years.

UBS Australian Small Companies This fund invests for growth in emerging Australian companies typically between $250m and $4bn in market cap. Targeted sectors include digital disruption, aged care and retirement, renewables and resources. Has earned a tad over 15 per cent a year over the past five years.

Advance Growth Multi-Blend Fund A multi manager, diversified fund. About 85 per cent of assets are placed in equities, listed property and commodities, both domestic and international, with the balance mainly in bonds and cash. One for those comfortable with a high level of risk. The fund delivered a 16.4 per cent gain in the year to October, for a three-year return of 7.9 per cent and a five-year return of 9.7 per cent. The minimum investment is $5000.</p><p>66. UBS Halo Australian Share Fund An active and concentrated portfolio, with a leaning to companies with good cash flows, be it in insurance, gaming, energy and technology industries. Key holdings include IAG, Tabcorp, Link Administration and Caltex. The fund has returned more than 10 per cent a year over five years.</p><p>67. Lazard Select Australian Equity Fund Active managers have found it challenging to outperform the broader market in the past year, yet the Lazard Select Australian Equity Fund - a concentrated portfolio of large-cap equities compiled on a value theme - can boast close to 10 per cent a year over three years and a tad over 14 per cent a year over five years. Highly recommended by Zenith and Lonsec. Minimum investment $20,000.</p><p>FIXED INCOME 68. UBS Diversified Fixed Income Fund A mix of global and Australian fixed-income investments, actively managed to deliver income and capital stability. One to consider for portfolio diversity.

Munro Global Growth Fund An absolute return fund in international equities, with a leaning to the big tech stocks that have risen strongly over the past 12 months. It has a strict stop-loss discipline. InvestSense says that if you want to invest in the technologies of tomorrow, such as self-driving cars, robotics and artificial intelligence, but are worried about buying at the top, then Munro can provide that exposure with some degree of downside protection. The minimum first investment is $25,000.</p><p>71. Australian REITs Zurich Investments Australian Property Securities Fund After a \"year of the unexpected\" for active managers of property securities, those with better bottom-up stock selection coupled with more flexible investment mandates have enjoyed solid returns. This one has posted a shade over 14 per cent in the past year and close to 14.5 per cent annually over five years, to earn a highly recommended rating from Zenith and Lonsec.</p><p>72. Vanguard Global Quantitative Equity Fund A \"quant\"-style fund that aims to outperform the MSCI World ex-Australia index by 1 per cent (with net dividends reinvested). Has a risk profile similar to that of the index. Given the hot US market, it has done nearly 26 per cent in 12 months. The minimum investment is $500,000.</p><p>PROPERTY 73. AMP Capital Wholesale Australian Property Fund A vehicle for retail investors and SMSFs to invest in commercial property, ranging from Australian office, retail and industrial properties. It aims to provide stable returns made up primarily of income with some long-term capital growth. One-year returns are 8 per cent and three-year returns are just over 10 per cent a year. The minimum investment is $10,000 and the fund is recommended by Zenith and Lonsec.</p><p>INCOME AND GROWTH 74. MLC Inflation Plus Actively managed to deliver above-inflation returns, where clients can dial in their preferred risk setting. For example, the moderate portfolio aims to deliver a return of 5 per cent a year above inflation (before fees) over five years, regardless of what global markets are doing. Highly recommended by Zenith and Lonsec.</p><p>INFRASTRUCTURE 75. AMP Capital Core Infrastructure Fund This fund offers a path to a portfolio of unlisted and listed infrastructure assets, among them Melbourne Airport and Britain's Angel Trains. Since inception, it has delivered more than 21/2 times the return of Australian equities with only 40 per cent of the volatility.</p><p>76. Maple-Brown Abbott Global Listed Infrastructure Fund A comprehensive investment process and a stringent definition of infrastructure results in a high conviction portfolio that highlights the core characteristics of listed infrastructure. It has returned 13.6 per cent in the past year and close to 13 per cent a year over three years, to earn Zenith's highly recommended rating.</p><p>77. Redpoint Global Infrastructure Fund The fund uses a quantitative approach and typically invests in 100-140 listed infrastructure equities across the globe, which is more than most other funds in this asset class. This approach gives Redpoint a broader universe to search and helps to reduce risk by increasing asset, sector and geographic diversification. The fund has delivered 13.61 per cent a year after fees since inception in April 2012 and is recommended by Lonsec.</p><p>EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS Global diversity 78. Vanguard Australian Property Securities Index ETF (VAP) Owning multiple residential properties doesn't really count as portfolio diversification. The Vanguard Australian Property Security Index ETF might be the answer, as it covers listed Australian real estate investment trusts (A-REITS), with holdings in retail, office, industrial, tourism and multi-sector ventures. It's up 12.8 per cent a year over the past three years. Highly recommended by Lonsec.</p><p>79. Montgomery Global Equities ETF (MOGL) A new ETF version of Montgomery's existing global equities managed fund. Apart from investing on a global palette, it aims to provide a minimum annual yield of 4.5 per cent a year with distributions paid twice a year. Like all ETFs, it stands on a sector's performance.</p><p>80. iShares Edge Smart Beta ETF (WDMF) Smart beta is a hot sector - this one is up more than 25 per cent in 12 months, which would impress active fund managers.

UBS IQ MSCI World Ex Australia Ethical ETF (UBW) Offers exposure to as many as 1570 securities on 22 world equities markets, excluding Australia. Besides holdings in the big tech stocks - Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft - it excludes tobacco companies and producers of \"controversial weapons\".

This Vanguard ETF offers access to high-yield shares, without sacrificing diversification, offering exposure to 50ASX-listed securities expected to deliver higher after-tax yields than the market average. It has an annual management fee of 0.25 per cent a year, and has delivered a return of more than 6 per cent over the past three years.</p><p>85. iShares Global Asia 50 ETF (IAA) Top performer by Morningstar records was iShares Asian fund, which gained close to 34 per cent in the year, to lift the three-year return to 17.5 per cent a year. The fund seeks to track the investment results of an index, the S&amp;P Asia 50, based on the performance of the 50 largest companies listed in China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.</p><p>86. BetaShares WisdomTree Japan ETF After three lost decades, it might be time to tilt to Japan in international investments, as incomes rise and corporate governance changes lead to better dividend payouts. InvestSense suggests the choice is between the currency-hedged Betashares WisdomTree (HJPN) - up almost 24 per cent in a year - or the unhedged iShares MSCI Japan ETF (IJP), up more than 20 per cent.</p><p>DIY INCOME 87. Investment-grade corporate bonds Investment-grade corporate bonds are low-risk, defensive investments, which return up to 5 per cent a year. A major benefit of corporate bonds is that the face value of the bond is returned to investors at maturity. Perfect if you think the global market is due for a correction, says Elizabeth Moran of FIIG Securities.</p><p>88. Residential mortgage-backed securities Why buy a single, lumpy investment property that will need maintenance and a tenant delivering unknown returns when you can invest in residential mortgage-backed securities? These bonds pay a floating rate of return and regularly pay back principal and interest, reducing risk as the securities age. FIIG Securities suggest you target the tranches typically rated in the \"A\" range with expected yields of 4.5-5 per cent a year.</p><p>89. JCPenney USD high yield bond For investors willing to take on a bit more risk and looking for income, the US high yield market is worth investigating. One liked by FIIG Securities is US retailer JCPenney (NYSE: JCP). It has a senior secured fixed-rate bond maturing in 2023 with a yield to maturity of 6.32 per cent a year. The bond is rated by S&amp;P as BB-, indicating it is seen as higher risk. US retailers have been under pressure, and the bond sold off recently and is now trading below $US100 face value, which FIIG thinks presents value.</p><p>SUPERANNUATION 90. Sunsuper Balanced Hard to go past Sunsuper, which in the past year has picked up four titles as the best, from three ratings agencies - Chant West, Super Review and SuperRatings - and Money Magazine. Sunsuper's balanced fund has delivered close to 11 per cent a year for the past five years.</p><p>91. Bendigo SmartStart Super The cheapest in the market, anyone can join and it has returned more than 9.3 per cent a year over the past five years. Has a MySuper option with default life cover and the ability to tailor cover to suit individuals. Looks appealing for young people starting out, business owners and those nearing retirement. Online applications. Rated five star by Canstar over the past four years.</p><p>INVESTING TOOLS Online share trading 92. Margin Loans Leveraged Direct Investment Loan A lower interest rate margin loan for investors who prefer to manage their own facility. Has an online application form, online tools and integration with the low-fee online broker of choice. Rated five stars by Canstar.</p><p>93. CMC Classic Account Competitively priced, with low brokerage fees of just $11 or 0.10 per cent on your first 10 trades within a month. They also offer access to a large number of charting options, market research and education materials to support investors at every level. Liked by Canstar.</p><p>SENIOR SPECIALS Cash the house, grab the cards and hit the boats 94. Reverse mortgages \u00e2\u20ac\u0192Canstar suggests you look at Heartland Seniors Finance. Under its Equity Protection Option, you may choose to protect a percentage of the eventual net sale proceeds of your home (10 per cent, 20 per cent or 50 per cent). When your loan is repaid, you or your estate is guaranteed to receive any chosen Equity Protection percentage.</p><p>95. Travel credit cards \u00e2\u20ac\u0192Bankwest's Zero Platinum card has no annual fee, no currency conversion fees, and complementary travel insurance. ANZ's Rewards Travel Adventures card has a $225 annual fee, then tosses in a return domestic Virgin flight each year, two single-entry Virgin Australia lounge passes a year, no overseas transaction fees on purchases and up to 1.5 rewards points per $1 spent.</p><p>96. Term deposits \u00e2\u20ac\u0192ME is paying 2.75 per cent a year on 12-month term deposits (interest paid at maturity) for amounts up to $1,000,000. Interest can also be paid monthly at a slightly lower rate. Terms of up to five years are available.</p><p>97. Insurance cover while you are away \u00e2\u20ac\u0192Canstar suggests World2Cover's Top Cover, \"which offers comprehensive levels of cover at a competitive price\". Top Cover customers also have access to unlimited medical cover (without any excess) and children under the age of 25 are fully covered when travelling with a guardian.</p><p>98. Car insurance \u00e2\u20ac\u0192 Budget Direct's Gold Comprehensive cover stands out in Canstar's eyes as good value, with a well-rounded suite of features, plus a 15 per cent premium discount for online policy applications, multi-policy discounts and optional roadside assistance.</p><p>99. Insurance while you're still working \u00e2\u20ac\u0192Canstar suggests NobleOak's Direct Life and Direct Income Protection cover for competitive prices and similar to insurance typically only accessible via an adviser. For direct income protection, consumers can cover an annual income of up to $400,000 (which could be taken as a $25,000 monthly benefit), and instead of a typical two-year benefit period one can opt to have this paid until 65 while they are unable to work due to illness or injury.</p><p>100. International trading \u00e2\u20ac\u0192Want to go global share trading? Interactive Brokers Australia allows access to 100 exchanges worldwide, with brokerage as low as $US 1 a trade in the US market, as well as offering features such as in-depth reporting and charting options. (Note, the minimum opening balance is $US10,000 and there is a monthly activity fee of up to $US20.)</p><p>101. Online retailing Kogan.com (KGN) The online retailer is up threefold in six months, a beneficiary of lower prices in telecoms and tie-ins to insurance and soon budget healthcare through Medibank. Media reports suggest the principals have sold down their stakes slightly to a large overseas organisation. Can it keep going, asks Under the Radar Report? \"We're not sure, but you won't be bored,\" is the reply.The Weekend Australian accepts no responsibility for these product offerings. The author owns BHP and Brambles shares. Some of the firms featured have or seek corporate work with several of the stocks mentioned.

But the unhappy star of the hearings was Uber[2], which was heavily criticized for having paid out a large bonus under cloudy circumstances. Sen. </p><p>Blumenthal and others on the Hill[3] treated the payment as more ransom than bounty and pilloried Uber for not disclosing what they called a breach. Even Uber, under new management, was critical of its performance[4]. As the only cyberlaw podcast with a Davos correspondent, we ask Alan Cohn to give highlights of the event from a cybersecurity point of view. I bring the color commentary and snark. With Microsoft Ireland case[5] heading to argument, the Justice Department and Big Tech are hoping to head the Court off with a legislative solution[6]. Jamil Jaffer[7] explains what the CLOUD Act will do. I point out who's missing from the Grand Coalition and question whether Big Privacy has the clout to stop the act. Fancy Bear hackers seeking high-tech weapons data from US defense contractors[8] get lucky - up to 40% of their phishing links strike paydirt. Michael Mutek explains what this likely means for the Defense Department - more regulation, probably. Whether more regs and more compliance will produce more security is the question no one can answer. A cyberdiplomacy office[9] is back from the dead, sort of: Secretary Tillerson now says he'll create a bureau for cyberspace headed by an Assistant Secretary. And, as Jamil explains, the fight switches to which undersecretary will oversee the office. Nick Weaver[10] and Jamil comment on the news that Justice has pulled in an impressive haul of cyber-fraudsters[11], bookended by doubts whether any hackers[12] can ever be extradited from places like the UK and Ireland. Because, face it, how many can't claim to be on the spectrum? I close with a tribute to John Perry Barlow[13], who died last week. If you wanted to know how many women would fall for a combination Grateful Dead lyricist, technologist, and cowboy, John could tell you. Exactly. As always The Cyberlaw Podcast is open to feedback.

President Trump signed an executive order yesterday imposing new sanctions on Iran as retaliation for Iran's downing last week of a U.S. military drone, and says the \"hard- hitting\" sanctions will financially punish Iran's Supreme Leader. U.S. delivery company FedEx has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government, arguing that it should not be required to enforce federal government export bans.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[05:31:58] CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN ANCHOR: Billions in emergency funding on the line.

No soap, soiled clothes, poor hygiene. And now, emergency funding to fix those problems at the border could be in jeopardy.</p><p>House Democrats emerging from a tense late-night meeting with Speaker Pelosi agreeing to review specific changes to a $4.6 billion proposal.

NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): Families belong together in America. Everyone has rights. Immigrants have rights. And we just have to beat that drum across the next couple of weeks. And as we do so, we must also pass legislation that meets the humanitarian needs at the border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIGGS: And urgently because the clock is ticking on several fronts. A vote on the Democratic proposal remains set for today. Lawmakers leave Washington for a weeklong recess on Thursday, and the president pushed back his time line but still says the deportations will move ahead in just 12 days.</p><p>The chair of the House Democratic Caucus recently outlined leadership's border strategy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): We should provide the humanitarian assistance necessary to change the conditions along the border, particularly as it relates to immigrant children.

SAAGAR ENJETI, CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, HILL.TV: Sure. Well, Nancy Pelosi actually said you must have congressional approval. So you disagree with her on that?</p><p>TRUMP: I disagree.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROMANS: Members of Congress have debated this question of the president's authority, especially in the wake of the attack the president called off last week. He ordered that strike in retaliation for Iran downing an unmanned American spy plane.</p><p>Senate Democrats weighing whether to block the annual defense policy bill. The idea would be to force a vote on an amendment requiring congressional approval for any war with Iran.</p><p>BRIGGS: Meantime, the president targeted Iran's supreme leader with new sanctions Monday. He warned that U.S. restraint is limited.</p><p>Overnight, the Iranian Foreign Ministry slapped back, saying the new sanctions mean the White House is, quote, \"closing the channel of diplomacy forever.\"</p><p>CNN's Frederik Pleitgen is standing by live in Iran with the latest. Fred, they seem -- these sanctions largely symbolic on the surface. What's the reaction there?</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think the Iranians, Dave, are also saying that these sanctions are just symbolic. But at the same time, symbolic obviously means something here as well and they're saying that they believe that this is something that crushes any sort of chances of diplomacy between Iran and the United States.</p><p>It was quite interesting because the president, Hassan Rouhani -- he came out in a speech -- in a press conference earlier today and absolutely lashed out at the United States and the White House, specifically, saying that -- he said, and this is a quote -- that \"The White House is suffering from mental disability and no sane person would do what the United States is doing.\"</p><p>Essentially, what the Iranians are saying is they are saying that because of the White House, on the one hand, is saying that it wants Iran to go back to the negotiating table. But at the same time, the sanctioning senior figures -- but not just the supreme leader, but also saying they're going to sanction the foreign minister as well. That means that the U.S. is lying about any intention to want to go back to talks with the Iranians.</p><p>The Iranians for their part, of course, are saying that it's precisely these sanctions that are preventing them from going back to the negotiating table. They say only if the sanctions are dropped will they return to the negotiating table.</p><p>It's also quite interesting. A senior adviser to Hassan Rouhani coming out earlier today and saying the foreign minister being sanctioned by the United States means that he's slowly turning into a Nelson Mandela for Iran, Dave.</p><p>BRIGGS: How about that for a comparison? Fred Pleitgen live for us in Tehran this morning. Thank you, sir.</p><p>Let's discuss all this with \"Washington Post\" congressional reporter Karoun Demirjian. She's a CNN political analyst. Good to see you.</p><p>ROMANS: Good morning.</p><p>KAROUN DEMIRJIAN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER, THE WASHINGTON POST: Good morning.</p><p>BRIGGS: So, these sanctions -- will they have any impact, and what is the Trump administration's central goal in Iran? Is it repackaging the JCPOA in some sort of USMCA type of manner?</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: If it is, it's also stiffening it incredibly because I think that with the -- the administration had the opportunity last year to strengthen and stiffen the JCPOA and they threw that out the window. Now, whether that was a branding issue because it was too closely tied to Obama -- you could make that argument -- given that they're saying we're open to talks.</p><p>[05:40:02] I think, though, given the fact that there were frustrations existing around that JCPOA in the first place, whatever they're going to settle on -- and I'm talking about the Trump administration's position here -- is going to have to be a lot more stringent and a lot more punishing on Iran because they've set this standard for themselves of never being able to get a nuclear weapon.</p><p>The yield to control the indefinite future, that's a very hard thing to do in a world in which there is nuclear power going around and other states have ambitions, too, that Iran considers regional enemies. And so, it's just -- it's a much more difficult equation for the Trump administration to get everything that they want with that much more -- much more punishing approach because they say the Obama --</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: -- administration was too light-handed.</p><p>ROMANS: Karoun, we're hearing this morning some pretty incredible details about this meeting that went on for several hours last night among Democrats. And one source telling us that Nancy Pelosi is having the hardest -- doing the hardest work of her speakership right now, trying to sort of wrangle the left wing of her party who are very, very angry about funding at the border.</p><p>Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said this. \"We need to stop funding the detention of children under any and all circumstances. I will not fund another dime to allow ICE to continue its manipulative tactics.\"</p><p>There are a lot of others who have said similar things. You heard Congressman Hakeem Jeffries just a few minutes ago.</p><p>Where are the Democrats right now on this and could it end up being something like basically, a government shutdown for border funding?</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: If they can't figure this out quickly then yes, because we're looking at just a few days left in the week right now. And if we believe what the secretary of Health and Human Services said, this is dire. And the end of the week is the end of the month and Congress goes on vacation for a week after that, so the clock is ticking.</p><p>It seems like everybody in the Democratic Party ultimately wants to do a similar thing, which is improve the situation for the children at the border. Improve the situation at any sort of facility they might find themselves in. But there's this concern that OK, if we keep throwing money at the problem and we don't put any conditions on it to force the government to spend that money in the way that we want them to.</p><p>And I think that these latest reports about lack of soap, lack of toothbrushes, lack of basic facilities for these children really, really struck a nerve that has broken the patience of a lot of people to say OK, we'll put the check -- we'll sign the check right now and assume that we can fix the problems later.</p><p>They're saying no, you want to do everything at once. Otherwise, we have no guarantee that we're not just kind of endorsing this $4.5 billion. And so, that's the situation you've got right now.</p><p>Is it something that you could resolve? Seemingly so if you could put stringent enough conditions on how that money is spent. But this is the debate that they have to resolve today, basically, if they want to be able to get this to happen, especially because it's not the endgame. Whatever happens in the House has to be reconciled with the Senate and that could, itself, be a fairly --</p><p>ROMANS: Right.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: -- thorny process because there's --</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: -- Republicans that have to be convinced in the Senate and the bipartisan game again.</p><p>BRIGGS: And expect this issue to play out on a larger scale Wednesday and Thursday when the Democratic debates begin.</p><p>ROMANS: Yes.</p><p>BRIGGS: You've got 20 --</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: For sure.</p><p>BRIGGS: -- Democrats taking the stage.</p><p>And the president has attempted to suggest that look, the Democrats don't want to do anything on our southern border.</p><p>Will one of those candidates emerge from the pack with a central plan to address our southern border and immigration overall?</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: I mean, it's going to be very interesting to see who is able to do that in a comprehensive fashion. And thus far, most of the pitches that have been made are about health care, which affects --</p><p>BRIGGS: Yes.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: -- pretty much everybody. Students loans, which affects a lot of people.</p><p>The immigration issue at the border -- you have to -- there's a lot of people in the country that might not be watching even though it's a huge story that we're all talking about right now. And to make a case that appeals to just the greater human sensibility on this issue and also gets really serious about financial matters and takes the issue of immigration seriously, I don't think --</p><p>You've got diversity views in the Democratic Party. Some people want to have a more open border policy. We've heard proposals like that being made. A lot of the candidates are saying well, no, you can't do that completely. You have to regulate the border in some way.</p><p>ROMANS: Right.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: There's proposals about what -- how many visas and for long do you give to undocumented immigrants who are already in the country.</p><p>All of these things are going to be competing. There really isn't a firm middle ground in the Democratic Party right now, except for they want to do something that is not just focused on border security -- that is a little bit more generous to the plight of these migrants. What that is though, and how much they can make that appeal to everybody across the board is the challenge, generally speaking, for the Democrats right now.</p><p>ROMANS: Sure.</p><p>BRIGGS: Indeed.</p><p>ROMANS: All right. Karoun Demirjian, nice to see you.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: Nice to see you, too.</p><p>ROMANS: Thanks for stopping by.</p><p>BRIGGS: Thank you.</p><p>ROMANS: All right, 44 minutes past the hour.</p><p>Bill Gates calling on the United States government to step up its regulation of big tech.

I'm sure they'll -- and there should be, at some point, federal regulation that relates to that.</p><p>The fact that now this is the way people consume media has really brought it into a realm that we need to shape it so that the benefits outweigh the negatives.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[05:45:10] ROMANS: Gates' remarks coming on the same day Senators Mark Warner of Virginia, and Josh Hawley of Missouri introduced a bill that could force companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook to reveal how much money they make off of your data.</p><p>BRIGGS: All right.

Smith said millions will need to learn new skills to get jobs, or even to hang on to their old one, as the digitisation of economies races ahead.    Microsoft recently announced massive plan to deliver skills and training to 25 million people globally this year, offering training, skills, certifications and help finding jobs with the help of Microsoft-owned LinkedIn.    Smith, however, conceded that many jobs in many countries would be beyond the reach of digital retraining.    \u201cIt\u2019s true that the nature of work varies widely around the world. Not all jobs can be digitised, particularly in the developing world.    \u201cWe live in a world of internet inequality \u2013 if we don\u2019t do something about it we are going to exacerbate all the other inequalities that we all worry about. This is a task beyond any one company or any one government but if we can reach 25 million people we will feel like we are doing our part.\u201d    Microsoft will spend $20m on this programme, which will strike many as fairly small given this is a company whose value has increased by $500bn in the past year.    If big US tech looked powerful before Covid-19, it looks imperious now. Just five companies make up 20% of the value of the S&amp;P 500 index. Does he understand why many feel big tech is too powerful and needs reining in?    \u201cTech is a powerful tool but it can also be a formidable weapon in the wrong hands,\u201d he says. \u201cSo this is a critical time for technology, it has more responsibility than ever.\u201d    \u201cI think people have more questions than ever and that\u2019s not a bad thing. To ensure that technology is a force for good, governments need to move more quickly to develop technology-focused laws. While tech companies need to exert some self-restraint.\u201d    Getting global agreement on how to regulate and tax technology has proved notoriously difficult and many countries are nervous as the increasing digitisation of their economies makes it harder to generate the tax revenue they will need to pay for the trillions of dollars of damage Covid-19 has done.    Advances in technology will also lead to an increase in automation and AI which may only hasten mass unemployment. What responsibility does Mr Smith feel that tech companies have to pay for the changes to employment that they are ushering in?    \u201cI think the good news is that governments have all the tools they need to make sure that tech companies remain responsive and responsible under the rule of law,\u201d he says.    \u201cFundamentally the responsibility of companies and countries is to make sure that people have the skills to ensure they reap the benefits rather than suffer from the consequences of the changes unleashed.    \u201cI think we all need to recognise that tech cannot solve everything, but nothing can be solved without us.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42634001869</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CY-RJ21-JCSC-J4H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"542\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Hallmark News</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 19, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Nigeria</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Africa</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Western Africa</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

In the cafeterias and shuttle vans of Technotopia, workers on the margins of the tech boom are organizing\u2014and the labor momentum is going viral. Five hundred workers just voted to unionize[2] at Facebook's cafeteria contractor, Flagship, which represents some 10 percent of the total food-service workforce in Silicon Valley. The victory builds on other recent union wins at Intel and Google for cafeteria and custodial staff\u2014vibrant organizing campaigns, led by UNITE HERE and the Teamsters, that combined with grassroots community outreach to establish solid union contracts in the bottom tiers of the freewheeling tech sector. Activists are demanding fair hours and wages, as well as secure benefits, union rights, and other basic entitlements for the front-line workers of the world's leading tech brands. Beyond workplace campaigns, UNITE HERE's organizing with subcontracted cafeteria staff might uplift labor standards for food-service workers across the region, while galvanizing a community that includes women of color, immigrant workers, and budding community activists. Alongside these union eateries are the newly unionized shuttle-bus drivers, who are pushing back against an increasingly deregulated driver-for-hire workforce. Facebook's shuttle-bus drivers recently negotiated a contract raising hourly wages by about 50 percent to $27.50, plus health benefits and five weeks of paid vacation. Cafeteria workers embody the extreme inequalities of Big Tech's economic dominion. Dining-hall servers generally earn less than $700 a week, and sink about two-thirds of each paycheck into monthly rent (median rent in Silicon Valley costs nearly $1,800). Whether they're at Intel's pasta bar or the local drive-through, food-service jobs mire workers in poverty and perpetuate racial segregation through poverty pay, erratic schedules, and unsafe working conditions.Silicon Valley Degrading labor conditions have eroded the area's community fabric[3] over the years, according to an analysis[4] by Silicon Valley Rising, and median family incomes sank by about 20 percent from 2000 to 2010. In contrast to the exploding salaries of tech professionals, one in three contract workers faces long-term underemployment and unaffordable housing costs, according to the organization's community-labor coalition[5]. Meanwhile, their children attend underfunded schools, and homeless encampments have mushroomed alongside gleaming high-rises. Gentrification is shattering working-class ethnic neighborhoods as professionals move in, yet overall job growth has largely stalled since the end of the first dot-com bubble. And as urban infrastructure erodes, CEOs are driven to work by commuter-shuttle drivers who can barely afford the bus fare to work. Dan Gretz, a security officer, reflected[6] on how the volatile economy was making his neighborhood unlivable. He was earning $24 an hour, and then:A new security firm took over my building and dropped my pay to $14 overnight. I cut back on expenses as much as I could, but it wasn't enough. I had to refinance my car twice. I added debt to credit cards. I just finished going through bankruptcy, and my fianc\u00e9 and I can't afford to live together anymore.Silicon Valley's wealth gap[7] might seem insurmountable, but labor groups are pushing tech giants to take the lead and raise the bar for their struggling contract workers. Samuel Rasheed II, a cook at Facebook, says the union victory affirms to him 'that I have the support of my other coworkers and we can continue to work here and build a foundation for future employees and for our children.' By organizing, he adds, 'we showed that we can be one and we have more power as one instead of individually.' And while the federal government rolls back labor regulations[8] and social spending, it will take all the mass mobilization they can muster. Despite the Bay Area's cultural liberalism, racial and gender stratification shape the region's income inequality. Blacks and Latinos make up the majority of low-wage earners in the tech sector, and, although Silicon Valley's blue-collar workers are more diverse in race and gender than the white-male technorati, their communities suffer doubly from inequality as they face both unlivable wages and racial barriers. That's why groups like Silicon Valley Rising increasingly tie labor struggles to structural discrimination in their cross-cutting demands for affordable housing, immigrants' rights, and closing the wealth gap.Whether they're at Intel's pasta bar or the local drive-thru, food service jobs mire workers in poverty and perpetuate racial segregation through poverty pay, erratic schedules and unsafe working conditions.A combination of political pressure and labor mobilization have also promoted some key progressive legislative reforms. San Jose's Opportunity to Work initiative[9], for example, establishes standards for stable hours and sustainable schedules that encourage local firms to hire full-time as opposed to part-time workers. Meanwhile, city minimum-wage initiatives[10] in San Jose, Cupertino, and other tech-boom towns have put workers on track to reach a $15 hourly wage years ahead of the state's 2022 phase-in deadline. While Facebook's bosses envision the future in terms of technological advancement, Rasheed sees personal fulfillment: He hopes his union job will anchor his family here, so that his children have the opportunity to grow up surrounded by good schools and burgeoning tech-career opportunities.We all want to continue to be able to live here. Once I heard my coworkers' stories and how they wanted to provide for their families and not have to struggle as much as they doand not have to worry about paying for healthcare, or paying for transportationit gave me a sense that when I joined that I wasn't alone. If we're all in it together, and we all set a certain standard of what we want as one, then it's going to be a lot easier for those coming behind us, it'll be a lot easier for us, and it'll be a lot easier for people in other places.Big Tech's rank and file are launching a platform of their own: a bridge of solidarity over the Valley's steep social divides.

But that doesn't mean there aren't things to worry about.</p><p>As our economy reopens, money will naturally rotate into the cyclical stocks, Cramer said, and that will stop the tech rally in its tracks. The government could also interfere with the rally through increased regulation, tighter restrictions on China or with higher capital gains taxes, the kind Joe Biden has proposed.

Foreign aircraft would not be included under the new standards.</p><p> Earlier in his career, Crowley met similar airplane noise problems from constituents living near LaGuardia Airport by having noise abatement materials in schools near airports.</p><p> LIU: \u2018REGULATING MARIJUANA GOOD FOR NYC': Responding to reports that legislation would soon be introduced in the state legislature seeking to legalize recreational marijuana, City Comptroller John Liu issued the following statement:</p><p> \"This much is clear: New York City's misguided war on marijuana has failed. It is costly and counterproductive, and its uneven enforcement has ruined too many lives-especially in minority communities. State Senator Liz Krueger's (D\u2013Manhattan) bill to regulate marijuana is exactly the type of sound policy our state and city need. It would offer relief to patients suffering from myriad medical conditions, prevent thousands of young people from being needlessly dragged through the criminal justice system, and boost our bottom line. We estimate that regulating and taxing marijuana could raise more than $400 million annually in the city, which could be used to cut CUNY tuition in half. Let's send kids to college instead of to jail.\"</p><p> Previously, Liu proposed a similar regulation last August.</p><p> Liu has also proposed making New York City a global leader in medical marijuana research, since more than 100,000 New York City residents would benefit from the drug's medicinal use, according to analysis by the comptroller's office.</p><p> LIU'S \u2018STATE OF CITY' WARNS OF TOP 10 FISCAL CHALLENGES FACING NYC: City Comptroller John C. Liu on December 17 outlined the top 10 fiscal challenges facing New York City in a new report aimed at informing the citywide discussion of strategies and solutions. His remarks were delivered as part of a State of the City address capping his four years as city comptroller.</p><p> \"It has been an honor to serve as New York City comptroller. I'm proud of our record in saving billions for city taxpayers, creating thousands of jobs by accelerating capital projects, and making our city's finances the most transparent in the nation,\" Liu said. \"As it happened, I took office in January, 2010, deep into the city's recession. And while the recovery since then has been significant, not everyone has benefited. It's imperative that the city economy works for everyone. Growth that is unequal, jobs that don't pay a living wage, and gaps in educational achievement and infrastructure investment will only perpetuate an unequal playing field.\"</p><p> During his tenure, Liu implemented costsaving measures by conducting stringent audits, refinancing city bonds at lower interest rates, and inspecting contracts for waste \u2013 in particular, big tech contracts like the criminally fraudulent CityTime. The result: A cumulative $5 billion in savings.</p><p> Pension investments were also up, from just under $100 billion when he took office to nearly $150 billion today. The strong gains will help reduce the city's pension contributions in the coming years by billions of dollars.</p><p> The report released today, Top 10 Fiscal Challenges Facing New York City, examines the most significant revenue and expenditure implications for the city's budget going forward. The challenges identified are:</p><p> \u2022 Financing education adequately. While not all problems facing city schools can be solved through greater financial investment, the fact remains that city spending falls short of levels recommended by the courts in the successful Campaign for Fiscal Equity case and is well below per-pupil spending in suburban districts.</p><p> \u2022 Settling municipal contracts. All of the city's approximately 300,000 employees are currently working without contracts.</p><p> \u2022 Adapting to climate change. Key action items added since Superstorm Sandy remain unfunded.</p><p> \u2022 Improving mass transit. MTA ridership is at record levels, with some elements of the system operating above capacity.</p><p> \u2022 Financing affordable housing. New Yorkers are paying an increasing share of their income on housing, and homelessness is growing.</p><p> \u2022 Mitigating income inequality. The city's personal income tax revenues are becoming dangerously dependent on relatively few wealthy taxpayers, creating fiscal risks if income distribution continues to be concentrated among the top one percent.</p><p> \u2022 Increasing college graduation. Four out of five New York City public school students fail to get a college degree of any kind. Better-educated residents would increase their earning power and reduce expenditures on social services.</p><p> \u2022 Managing debt service. The city's current debt per capita is approximately $9,378, or nearly twice the average of 10 large cities across the country.</p><p> \u2022 Dealing with federal austerity. The federal government's contribution to the New York City budget declined from a 19.3 percent share in Fiscal 1978 to 9.2 percent by Fiscal 2008. The squeeze on the city's budget can be expected to intensify in coming years.</p><p> \u2022 Changing corporate incentives. Some businesses and developers receive billions in tax benefits in exchange for job commitments that never materialize.</p><p> For the full text of Liu's speech, visit comptroller. nyc.gov/office-of-the-comptroller/stateof the-city/.</p><p> ADDABBO EDUCATION ISSUES IN SPOTLIGHT IN 2014: State Senator Joseph P. Addabbo Jr. (D-Queens), a long-time member of the senate Education Committee, noted on December 17, that a variety of important issues deeply affecting New York's school children, families, teachers, school administrators and the state's entire educational system are expected to take center stage during the upcoming 2014 legislative session.</p><p> \"During the first three months of the session, we will be developing and negotiating the new state Budget for 2014-2015, and a big part of every state spending plan is centered within our efforts to provide necessary and equitable funding for schools in New York City and across the state,\" Addabbo said. \"But on top of the education policy and funding issues that are part of the state Budget, the senate, Assembly and Governor will also be looking at a number of complex initiatives impacting how our children learn, how our teachers teach, how our overall education system is judged, and who we hold accountable for the ultimate operations and performance of New York City schools.\"</p><p> Among these issues, the senator said, are the implementation of the Common Core federal learning standards, the effectiveness of teacher evaluation procedures and policies, and discussions about the fate of mayoral control of New York City schools, which expires in 2015.</p><p> Addabbo noted that he has been hearing frequently from many constituents, parents and educators regarding the controversial Common Core learning standards that were devised by the federal government and are being pursued with the goal of better preparing school children for a college education and future careers. The new learning standards are now being applied for English and Math and are expected to be integrated into other courses of study in the coming years.</p><p> \"No one can argue against the ideal of better preparing our kids for good jobs through a higher education, which is increasingly necessary for adult success in this global economy,\" said Addabbo. \"However, imposing federal standards in a \u2018one-size-fits-all' manner doesn't take into account significant differences in local schools, their student populations, their staff, their funding levels and many other variables. Many of my constituents have questions about the implementation of the standards, their cost, their effectiveness, associated student data collection proposals, and how they will affect the quality of education our children are receiving.\"</p><p> The senator said he is going to continue to discuss Common Core and possible reforms of the standards in his district with concerned parents, teachers, principals and other education stakeholders.</p><p> Addabbo said the issue of teacher and principal evaluations will also continue to be reviewed and debated by state legislators in the coming year. \"In 2012, New York state passed a law to implement a statewide system of teacher and principal evaluations, as well as a measure to provide parental access to certain evaluation information,\" Addabbo said. \"We need to examine how this is working, and most of all, determine whether it is helping or hindering the performance of our educators and children. While I support the basic concept underlying these laws, I have also expressed my concern that some aspects of teacher and principal evaluations can be very subjective and that the personal family lives of many students \u2013 including those living in poverty or whose first language is not English \u2013 can certainly have a tremendous impact on their success in the classroom. We need to continue these discussions.\"</p><p> With the law establishing mayoral control of New York City schools expiring in 2015, Addabbo said that discussions whether to abolish, continue or reform the current system governing local schools are also likely to have a place during the 2014 session. \"I would like to see some reforms to provide school principals with more authority and flexibility and offer parents more meaningful input into the education of their children,\" Addabbo said. \"With all of the other significant changes taking place in our educational system, it makes sense to start thinking now about what we want our New York City school governance structure to look like in 2015.\"</p><p> Addabbo, who currently serves as a member of the senate Education Committee and senate Select Committee on Libraries, said he will continue to make educational issues a top priority when the new legislative session begins on January 8 with the Governor's State of the State Address. \"I look forward to being back in our state Capitol to work on education policy and other important issues and urge my constituents to contact me at any time with their concerns,\" Addabbo said. \"Hearing from the people I represent is both a pleasure and a necessity in being able to speak on their behalf in Albany.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Crowley, joined by Congressmembers Grace Meng (D\u2013Flushing) and Gregory Meeks (D\u2013St. Albans) introduced the Silent Skies Act of 2013, which would provide that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) must issue regulations by the end of 2015 calling for commercial aircraft to comply with Stage 4 aircraft noise certification standards that would begin lowering noise levels.

Now, though, California practitioners are seeing a general stabilization and several bright spots, even with volume continuing to fall in purely domestic deals. Acquisitions originating abroad are rising fast as industries develop and mature around the world, but particularly in China; tech MA is continuing strong; and clients are more interested than ever in legal advice about the strategic aspects of deals, rather than just the technical. California Lawyer checked in for an update on the field with Joseph M. Doloboff of Blank Rome; Jaclyn Liu of Morrison Foerster; E. Thom (Todd) Rumberger of Foley Lardner; and Thomas M. Shoesmith of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman. The roundtable was moderated by California Lawyer and reported by Donna Blum of Barkley Court Reporters.</p><p><br/><br/>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<br/><br/>MODERATOR: There's been a pretty significant drop in MA this year, even though there were signs in 2011 and 2012 that the volume would be higher, and that seems to be among the most significant continuing issues. What are the biggest new developments in your practice in the last year or so?<br/><br/>JACLYN LIU: You're right; MA volume was down in the U.S. about 4 percent in 2012 as compared to 2011. Everyone is predicting an uncertain U.S. MA market with shrinkage in 2013 at the same levels as 2012. And a number of bankers are saying, from their firsthand experience, that the dip is expected to be more significant. There is, however, an uptick in outbound MA activities from China during the first half of 2013, which has continued for a couple of years. In the past, a majority of my MA work involved domestic or European companies. However, all but one MA matter that I worked on during the past year involved an Asian or European party either as the seller or the acquirer. And, previously, inbound MA involved mostly foreign companies acquiring divisions of U.S. public companies or private U.S. companies; more recently foreign companies are buying U.S. public companies outright, which adds complexity and deal challenges.<br/><br/>MODERATOR: What kinds of companies? What kinds of industries?<br/><br/>LIU: Across the board; I helped a French co-op acquire apple orchard productions in the U.S., SoftBank in its acquisition of Sprint, and a Chinese medical device company in its acquisition of a division of a U.S. public company. But my MA work is predominantly in the technology space.<br/><br/>MODERATOR: Todd [Rumberger], what big trends are you seeing in your practice in Silicon Valley?<br/><br/>TODD RUMBERGER: The trend personally for me was a very active MA plate last year, leading down to the wire and into the holidays, in large part people trying to beat the 12/31 deadline, the fiscal cliff. It was everybody's expectation that, because of the general acceptance that taxes would be going up, sellers were going to get a lot better net result if the deal closed by year-end. This work included both typical Silicon Valley MA involving big tech acquisitions of early-stage and venture-backed companies, but also a number of deals in the private equity arena, which has its own style for the way the deals are structured and negotiated, not dissimilar to the more pragmatic way venture financings on the West Coast are negotiated, with some well known deal points up for grabs and many others simply not pushed too hard; deal certainty and getting to the closing are paramount once the decision is made to buy (or sell).<br/><br/>MODERATOR: So you're not seeing a drop except to the extent people are sort of catching their breath?<br/><br/>RUMBERGER: Yes, though it seems like some deals which were jumping on my radar early this year have been stalled, not dead, but not making nearly the progress deals were making last year at this time; I don't think many people expected a slow-down in the first half of the year, but we experienced one.<br/><br/>LIU: Yes, money is still relatively cheap.<br/><br/>JOSEPH DOLOBOFF: I've seen three major trends. First, some large, public high-tech companies that did a lot of acquisitions and are now in the integration stage. Where I've seen the largest drop-off is in the number of leveraged recapitalizationsmdash;taking advantage of a good debt marketmdash;where private-equity firms came in, took majority ownership of a company, and allowed founders who had grown the company to take a bunch of chips off the table yet retain a significant minority ownership interest. Those deals have fallen off quite a bit now that we've got the increase in capital gains tax rates; that 5 percent made a big difference.<br/><br/>The third trend that I see, and maybe because I'm focused on the tax side, is more companies with large net operating losses that are looking at acquisitions of companies that are heavy taxpayers, which they can acquire at a higher price because they have the advantage of the operating loss tax shelter. The public company deals, which for me are mostly on the high-tech side, I expect to pick back up at the end of the summer.<br/><br/>THOMAS SHOESMITH: Our overall MA activity is probably down by more or less the same percentages that Jackie [Liu] was mentioning. But, by sector, it's actually pretty strong and in many cases up, which is also consistent with her experience. Our Silicon Valley office, which is heavily concentrated on technology companies, is very active in MA right now. There are market fundamentals at work, of course, as well as industry trends. Many large tech companies, for example, particularly in life sciences, have become expert at outsourcing innovation and then buying the winners. The oil and gas and energy sectors are also very strong. And then of course China has been an area where we've seen a lot of changes and a lot of activity. The switch from outbound investment from the U.S., to inbound investment from China, has been dramatic. We all thought it was going to happenmdash;<br/><br/>LIU: A long time ago.<br/><br/>SHOESMITH: That's right. It's been \"about to happen\" for at least five years, but now it's happening. That's exciting and different. Investment from the U.S. into China also is changing. Ten years ago it was primarily aimed at manufacturing for export. Now the attraction is the huge market in China and more broadly in Asia.<br/><br/>LIU: And that trend changes the due diligence requirements of an acquirer. It's much easier to conduct physical due diligence on a factory than if the value driver for the acquisition is the Chinese target's distribution or marketing channels. The old adage was: Retain the target's general manager, who will know the ins and outs of the business, and you are golden. But not anymore. As the value drivers for inbound MA move beyond brick and mortar to leverage Chinese manufacturing efficiencies, the due diligence process for such deals will become more \"U.S. style.\"<br/><br/>A certain amount of patience on the part of foreign acquirers is needed as many Chinese targets are not prepared for such intense legal and financial scrutiny of their businesses.<br/><br/>SHOESMITH: The big change that's happened in my practice is that U.S. clients looking at China don't just see a lot of people who work cheap; they're now seeing a tremendous market. For example, China is now the biggest market in the world for smart phones.<br/><br/>MODERATOR: But another key change you're seeing this year is more investment from China.<br/><br/>SHOESMITH: That's true. And inbound investment from China has been driven by the big players. The wave of smaller buyers is just starting. The last time we had a wave of inbound foreign investment like this was the Japanese in the 1980s and '90s. Of course, there, you were dealing with large corporations but not state-owned enterprises, and that makes Chinese investment more policy-driven than was the case with the Japanese. And the Chinese are buying strategic properties as well as less glamorous but often highly productive businesses likemdash;<br/><br/>RUMBERGER: Chicken producers.<br/><br/>SHOESMITH: That's rightmdash;chicken, pork.<br/><br/>LIU: Beyond state-owned enterprises (SOEs), a few factors that have fueled outbound MA activities from China are the volumes of Chinese companies on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the PRC domestic exchanges, the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. Listing there has provided private Chinese companies, not just the SOEs, with the capital necessary to invest and acquire abroad. Also, in connection with the listing process, those Chinese companies would set up a Caymans or BVI holding company with some capital residing offshore. This is significant because in my prior experience Chinese acquirers rarely were the successful bidders in a bidding war for a U.S. target. Part of the problem was the lack of sophistication in deal-making but a large part was the inaccessibility of the money. If the money was located in the PRC, savvy sellers would immediately know the process would take no less than four to six months, and that was often a deal-breaker.<br/><br/>DOLOBOFF: I think globalization comes in all shapes and sizes. In deals I do for domestic high-tech companies, they may be buying another domestic company, but the chances are nearly 99 percent that the target has operations in other countries. So almost every deal has some global aspects to it, and you have to bring in advisers from outside of the U.S. with skills in other jurisdictions to get almost any deal done.<br/><br/>SHOESMITH: I agree. Twenty years ago, when I said \"I'm an international lawyer,\" most people said, \"What's that?\" Now, if I said the same thing, they'd say, \"So am I.\" China is still a special case, though. I think it is by far the most surprising place for Westerners to do businessmdash;and I've done transactions in Korea, Japan, the Middle East, Latin America and a number of other countries. I always say China confronts Westerners with two levels of surprises. Of course you expect to be surprised in a deal, but in China it's in a way and for a reason that is surprising. The intricacy of the web of inter-relationships in China that affects every deal is pervasive and mostly opaque to an outsider, even to a Westerner who has lived there for many years. And, if the counter-party doesn't have a Western-trained person, then one side is negotiating holistically and the other linearly.<br/><br/>DOLOBOFF: Even setting negotiations aside, due diligence can be frustrating. I was quite surprised at how difficult it is to obtain from a China-based company certain information that we take for granted in domestic deals.<br/><br/>SHOESMITH: In part this is a function of business cultures. It isn't necessarily advantageous to be transparent in China. And you're right, it makes diligence really hard. I think transparency is an attribute of large, diversified and mostly impersonal economies, which China has not been until recently. A hundred years ago in this country, for example, all the great capitalists knew each other. You could put them all in one room. In fact, J. P. Morgan often did. They exchanged information among themselves, but transparency to the world at large was essentially unknown. China is developing very, very fast and I think we'll see more transparency as it does. A world-class economy can't exist for long without it.<br/><br/>LIU: From my experience, most Chinese companies don't start a business with an exit strategy in mind. Most Chinese entrepreneurs are focused on maintaining a nice, stable business that they can hand off to their family. Such a mindset impacts how the business is structured and the attention to legal formalities. Of course, business dynamics are changing in China now.<br/><br/>SHOESMITH: One of the interesting things about China is that it's passing from one system to another, so you see this sort of mixing of the waters. Chinese companies are becoming more international, and the number of internationally educated entrepreneurs and managers is increasing dramatically. I imagine it won't be long before Chinese clients use lawyers throughout the course of a deal mdash;and less often bring me a signed purchase agreement and ask me to take a look at it.<br/><br/>MODERATOR: That's what's called a done deal. Moving to increasing regulation in both the U.S. and China, are tax concerns causing competitive problems? Is the American regulatory picture at this point an impediment compared to what you're facing in other countries, or is that challenge overblown?<br/><br/>DOLOBOFF: The provision of our tax code that taxes companies on profits they earn overseas when they don't even bring the money back to the U.S. paves a difficult road for U.S. companies when they're making acquisitions abroad. Also, tax law changes that would encourage companies to bring cash back to the U.S. where it could be deployed to help build more jobs just can't be a bad thing.<br/><br/>I have a question for the Chinese experts. You mentioned Japan and the purchase of real estate that we saw by the Japanese in the late '70s or early '80s. Those purchases led to a tax code provision for foreign investment in real property that generally imposed a 10 percent withholding tax on sales by foreigners of U.S. real estate. Do you anticipate that, if we see a flood of Chinese investment into the U.S., there will be some comparable fear regarding high tech or some other market, and there will be a similar tax code reaction?<br/><br/>SHOESMITH: Yes.<br/><br/>LIU: I'm sure that would be the case.<br/><br/>SHOESMITH: It's partly a political question and partly a cultural question. We're always afraid somebody is taking us over. We're more than twice as large as the next largest economy in the worldmdash;which is Chinamdash;and we're still worried about someone taking us over. Particularly with regard to information technology, infrastructure, and the like.<br/><br/>RUMBERGER: Regarding the U.S. regulatory landscape, potential Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations always seem to be an area of concern. Not too long ago, I was representing a private-equity buyer who was acquiring a small, publicly traded software company with most of its sales in Latin America; a year or two earlier, the target company had entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Justice Department, and it had a number of penalty payments due for an FCPA violation; after reviewing the decree and conducting further due diligence, our buyer ultimately decided the risks were too great.<br/><br/>Going back to an observation I made earlier, I would say, even where there may not be a formal overseas subsidiary or foreign operations/sales for a target company, that target company may be usingmdash;or have usedmdash;an offshore engineering team for some aspect of software development. So foreign legal questions lurk in the background in a lot of tech deals, even early-stage, and particularly those that are software-based, sometimes only concerning whether the target's IP was properly documented and assigned. And that can often be a question of foreign, not just U.S. law.<br/><br/>LIU: In the age of globalization, we need to be mindful of many laws in other jurisdictions, including the U.K.'s anti-bribery legislation [The Bribery Act of 2010]. If you think the FCPA is difficult, the anti-bribery legislation is even more challenging because certain provisions are completely untested and businesses have no idea how to implement certain provisions which negatively impacts acquirers' ability to do due diligence compliance properly.<br/><br/>MODERATOR: Let's shift away from the global picture. What are the very early-stage concerns that we hear much less about? Where are things headed in terms of deal structures or the kinds of companies that are coming up?<br/><br/>RUMBERGER: I started seeing early-stage exits really pick up back in 2009, when a lot of the big tech companies had a mountain of cash on their balance sheets, which they were under some pressure to deploy or dividend back, and I don't think it has slowed down since. Most startups and even venture-backed companies in Silicon Valley are aware that if they do have an exit, it's likely to be by an acquisition, not sale into the public markets. Many founders, particularly in 2009 and '10, liked the idea of getting any exit, any return on their efforts, often only in the single-digit millions (well, at least where they had not taken in much outside investment). They had the security of going into a large enterprise, getting a steady paycheck, healthcare, oh, and a few million bucks in the bank, during a time when the future was far from certain and no one knew whether the double dip was coming or not.<br/><br/>As for acquisition structure, I would say at less than a $10 million purchase price the big tech acquirers are biased toward structuring it as an asset deal, and in excess of $10 million valuation, they're more willing to structure it as a stock deal (or merger) because of the tax savings involved (and the net result paid to the seller in not having the double layer of tax). I've had a counterintuitive result happen in some very small asset deals where my client, the seller, was a C corp. We were actually trying to push more of the agreed purchase price allocation to the non-compete covenants imposed upon the individual founders by the acquirer because that was going to a single layer of tax versus the actually acquired C corp. assets, which would impose a double layer of tax.<br/><br/>DOLOBOFF: Welcome to the world of LLCs.<br/><br/>RUMBERGER: Yes, LLCs are becoming more predominant for startup technology companies. And, when I sit down with an entrepreneur to go through the pluses and minuses of a C corp. versus LLC, it can be a complicated conversation because if there is an exit, and it's a singlemdash;versus a double, triple, or homerunmdash;it may very well be an asset sale, and the founders would prefer to be in a \"pass-through\" vehicle like an LLC. So I always want to lay it out and have them make the decision. I would say one in five startups I bring on as new clients might set up initially as an LLC because they can relatively easily convert to a C corp. later.<br/><br/>DOLOBOFF: And foreign companies that come to the U.S. often want to form a U.S. corporation, because the last thing they want to do is to file a U.S. tax return solely because they have a U.S. branch. An LLC will pay the same amount of U.S. tax, but the foreign parent will have to file a tax return in the U.S., which most foreign companies would rather avoid.<br/><br/>RUMBERGER: Sometimes the U.S. market is only that, another market to exploit for the non-U.S. company; if, however, they take in U.S. venture capital, it's likely they will need to relocate headquarters here (or \"flip\" the ownership from the foreign company into the U.S. company, which becomes the parent entity). It's the reverse of what many U.S. corporate lawyers are used to; namely, instead of running the deal, coordinating and overseeing local counsel in various overseas jurisdictions where subsidiaries or otherwise material operations are taking place, here the seller's parent company remains non-U.S., and we are just another \"local\" counsel.<br/><br/>MODERATOR: From the lawyer's perspective, as opposed to the business perspective, in your experience of working in MA, what's changing now? Can you characterize how the practice itself is changing?<br/><br/>SHOESMITH: My experience is that large corporations are handling much of their MA in-house, although they will still go outside for specialized expertise. But there is still a strategic overlay that experienced lawyers can add to a transaction. In due diligence, for example, it is sometimes relatively simple: collect the documents, see what they say, and you're done. But in China, due diligence requires second-order inferencesmdash;making judgments based on facts, not just discovering facts. And that requires a level of experience, not just expertise but experience. So for an outside lawyer the trend I see is towards a more strategic role and not just that of a technician.<br/><br/>RUMBERGER: I recently closed a deal for a primarily foreign-based company buying a Silicon Valley-based software company, and they were looking for our expertise and understanding of the U.S. market and MA deal term norms, even though they have a significant, experienced, and smart in-house legal team worldwide, including in the U.S. They wanted somebody who understood U.S. (and even California) tech market deal terms to minimize time otherwise spent negotiating for, say, uncapped indemnification or joint and several selling shareholder liability, which may have been the norm in their home jurisdiction, but which would be seen as completely unreasonable by most sellers and their counsel in the U.S. So, I think inbound acquisition work could turn out to be a growing area for CaliforniaMA lawyers, a welcome exception to the growing trend of larger acquirers bringing more deal volume in-house.<br/><br/>A lot of companies outside the U.S. are continuing to get more acquisitive and are acquiring California-born and -based technology and talent as customers in all markets, globally, demand the same cutting-edge technology. These companies want to integrate California DNA into their products and even organizations.<br/><br/>LIU: Echoing Todd [Rumberger], I started 15 years ago, and one of my first deals was helping a PRC company list on the NASDAQ. So I thought this is great because then I could use my Chinese language skills and cultural background concurrently with my U.S. legal education. Unfortunately, the boom of PRC companies listing in the U.S. has tapered off significantly and with the various high-profile accounting scandals involving listed PRC companies, I am not sure we will see a new wave of Chinese companies listing in the U.S.. So I'm very happy 15 years later to see an increasing trend of more outbound MA from China.<br/><br/>DOLOBOFF: I've seen things develop more along the lines outlined by Tom [Shoesmith]. The public company clients that I advise tend to use me repeatedly as special tax counsel. So I get to know the company and to know more or less their strategic goals. Their in-house tax staffs are very sophisticated, and their in-house legal staffs are. So what they do is balance me with other experts and obtain from us exactly what they wantmdash;no more, no less.<br/><br/>SHOESMITH: I find in international transactions, although I do the technical stuff, the place where I really add value is as an adviser. I think the legal profession is going in that direction, and I think that's a good thing.<br/><br/>RUMBERGER: And, if you do a good job, for a reasonable price (i.e., you're a good value), they're generally going to stick with you. You build a relationship with the founder, CEO, management, even the board. The relationships in the inbound transactions I've worked on have been similar to the relationships I've had with the earlier stage companiesmdash;rather than just marking up the purchase agreement and emailing it back and forth with opposing counsel, foreign buyer clients are looking more for strategy and business feedback on deal points. That's more rewardingmdash;and more similar to my early-stage and venture-backed company practice. So back to my theme: The inbound stuff can be great work. n<br/><br/>Originally published in California Lawyer, August 2013.<br/><br/>The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

Employees are officially integrated into the new RTP campus, and execs say they're taking advantage of the brand awareness they've built this holiday season.</p><p>Lenovo execs say to expect more community involvement and more \"winning\" in 2015.</p><p>In the meantime, at Big Blue, a battle is brewing.</p><p>IBM CEO Ginni Rometty addressed investors directly in October after disappointing earnings - and offered no apologies for recent offloads, including that of the server business.</p><p>\"We need to deploy that capital to other things,\" she said.</p><p>Instead of focusing on hardware, IBM, which once had 10,000 employees in RTP, is focusing on other areas, such as Big Data, cloud and mobile computing.</p><p>\"Our company is fundamentally better positioned than it was a few years ago,\" Rometty said. \"But we have more to do and we have to do it faster.\"</p><p>A power move for Raleigh and N.C. State University</p><p>President Barack Obama was in Raleigh in January, announcing a $140 million consortium that would be based in North Carolina, specifically at N.C. State University.</p><p>Truly an international effort, the Department of Energy-funded consortium, dubbed the Next Generation Power Electronics Innovation Institute, spans the globe from Germany to California to Taipei, with two big common denominators: The drive to create more efficient power devices and a Raleigh home base. Statements to the press said at the time that 1,000 new jobs would come out of the center with 18 corporate partners, including Cree, ABB and GridBridge.</p><p>While an interim director for the center, Dennis Kekas, has been selected, it's been slow going.</p><p>\"Although we're moving forward and the progress hasn't stopped, I can say that I think initially we had hoped to be moving at a very quick pace,\" says Chad Eckhardt, CEO of GridBridge, via recent conversation.</p><p>He - and the rest of the partners - hope things move quicker in 2015.</p><p>HCL to bring 1,237 new jobs to Cary</p><p>It started with a leaked document from the town of Cary in July: A company (no one would confirm which), was considering bringing 1,237 jobs to Cary and hunting incentives. The rumor mill churned.</p><p>In September came the big reveal: Indian IT services company HCL Technologies, which already had more than 800 employees in the Triangle, was the mystery company. The firm was approved for up to $19.6 million in state incentives to bring in those jobs in the next five years, which execs said will have an annual average wage of $51,653.</p><p>HCL announced it was expanding into a second building.</p><p>Months later, progress is already being made.</p><p>HCL has already hired more than 100 of those positions, according to Rajiv Sodhi, senior corporate vice president and chief productivity and competitiveness officer. And hiring will continue in 2015 as employees continue to move into the new building.</p><p>Sodhi says the idea is to take it floor by floor. So far, employees have moved into the first floor.</p><p>\"This is a long-term investment,\" he says.</p><p>Execs say the Cary campus is HCL's big play in the United States. Depending on what happens here, the company could then expand to other regions of the country.</p><p>Triangle fiber wars</p><p>February brought a big tease to the Triangle, as Google announced it had selected the Raleigh, Durham area as a possible expansion site for its buzzed-about Google Fiber service.</p><p>The high-speed service would allow users to access the Web at speeds of up to 100 times faster than basic broadband.</p><p>And, like dominos, other fiber players soon gnawed their way to the headlines.</p><p>Shortly after the Google announcement, Shelby-based RST Fiber and AT&amp;T both announced plans to bring high-speed fiber to the Triangle. And, this fall, Frontier Communications became the first to offer the service to residential customers in parts of Durham. While RST Fiber packed up its equipment and headed to Charlotte, with its CEO unsure of when, specifically, RST will be back, AT&amp;T announced in December that its fiber service was live in parts of the Triangle, including Raleigh and Cary.</p><p>That happened through a partnership with a university-driven initiative, North Carolina Next Generation Network, though further expansions are anticipated. No timeframe was given for further roll-outs.</p><p>RST applied for additional permits in Wake Forest in November, signaling that they, too, may make a solid commitment in 2015.</p><p>Google has said its Triangle plan would involve the cities of Carrboro, Cary, Chapel Hill, Durham, Garner, Morrisville and Raleigh. Execs also said an announcement will happen before the end of the year.</p><p>In December, the company said an announcement would happen in January.</p><p>Triangle tech companies entice suitors for big exits</p><p>In November, Durham-based app marketer Appia became the latest Triangle exit story, as Mandalay Digital purchased the firm for $100 million in stock, options and debt.</p><p>\"A huge part of why Mandalay wants to acquire Appia is for the team,\" said Jud Bowman, CEO of Appia.</p><p>Mandalay, which is changing its name to Digital Turbine, presents a people-friendly exit, says Bowman.</p><p>And it was just one of the Triangle's big tech exit stories.</p><p>California tech giant Informatica purchased Cary-based data-as-a-service firm StrikeIron for $54.6 million in June.</p><p>StrikeIron provides the kind of technology that allows pizza delivery firms to remember your address when you place an online order, and Time Warner Cable to send you a message when a technician is en route. Over the past couple years, it's been licensing its own platform - not just providing technology services, all enticing factors to big tech companies.</p><p>And, in Durham, cloud service firm Digitalsmiths snagged acquisition headlines in January when it was snatched up by TiVo for $135 million. TiVo officials said at the time that it meant a \"significant expansion in market opportunity,\" and that Digitalsmiths would retain independence in Durham.</p><p>According to Digitalsmiths' co-founder Ben Weinberger, TiVo kept its word.</p><p>\"TiVo is very supportive of the Digitalsmiths mission and vision,\" he said earlier this year.</p><p>With an estimated 1,000 startups in the Triangle, there are good odds for another blockbuster deal in 2015.</p><p>Did you find this article useful?

Chicago-based interiors firm Partners by Design conjured up the hangout spot to be energy-efficient and built quickly on a budget. Pingpong matches and billiard games are not uncommon; a 20-foot reclaimed wood bar works for casual meetings or lunchtime conversation. Leather couches, flannel armchairs and antler chandeliers give the place a cozy cabin vibe, and the company's \"No Excuses\" mantra hangs in prominent black letters on the wall to remind employees of their commitment to clients.</p><p>VIVID SEATS 111 N. Canal St., Suite 800 Square feet: 31,000 Employees: 350</p><p>The folks at Vivid Seats understand what it means to have a good time-after all, its website is one of the fastest-growing places to buy concert, sports and theater tickets. Its West Loop office reflects this philosophy. Designed by Hoffman Estates-based Leopardo Construction, the office is anything but stagnant, with its regulation basketball court, cafe and sports bar stocked with local beers, treadmill desks, and foosball and pingpong tables. Collaborative and individual workspaces play on the company's love for entertainment as well, with carpeting that looks like a football field and rooms named after Chicago's favorite teams. Some of the furniture is recycled from old stadiums.</p><p>GOGO 111 N. Canal St. Square feet: 258,000 Employees: 754</p><p>The building formerly known as the River Center was renamed when in-flight Internet company Gogo completed its move in June. Now the Gogo Building houses the company's 250,000 square feet and all of its A380-sized ideas. A walk through Gogo's workplace reveals a mock airplane cabin, hallways named after local runways and vacation-worthy relaxation lounges. The roof deck offers tables, chairs and plenty of green space for games of cornhole. Gogo commissioned Chicago-based architecture and engineering firm Nelson to bring the brand to life through the office's interior. The project was one of Chicago's largest office moves this past year, with Gogo's new digs requiring the relocation of over 460 employees.</p><p>TYSON FOODS 400 S. Jefferson St. Square feet: Approximately 230,000 Employees: 530</p><p>The old and the new collide at the Tyson Foods office (the Hillshire Brands headquarters before the 2014 Tyson-Hillshire merger). Windows added during the renovation have upped the amount of natural light and enable the lighting system to kick into special \"daylight harvesting mode\" to save energy. Housed in a 1944 building that has been made over to 21st-century standards, the Tyson office feels like an afternoon on the farm. The original Hillshire Farm gate hangs prominently on one wall, picnic tables line a collaborative \"town hall\" space and an outdoor grill and hawthorn trees on a rooftop deck create a relaxing respite in the middle of the South Loop.</p><p>STERLING BAY 1040 W. Randolph St. Square feet: 24,875 Employees: 75</p><p>As one of the most influential developers behind the Fulton Market boom, Sterling Bay knew it had to design its own HQ to rival others in the neighborhood. The real estate developer's in-house design team collaborated with Earles Architect Associates to create a serene, spa-like environment, with warm wood tables, accents repurposed from old water towers and splashes of color in green and orange BOS furnishings. As for special touches, there are plenty: Chicago artist Hebru Brantley turned a garage door into a canvas; hemp lines one hallway; and antique tools and other found objects unearthed from Chicago job sites decorate a steel-plated wall. Bonus features include a gym, sky-lit break room and multipurpose open spaces for pingpong tournaments, yoga sessions and more.</p><p>SANDBOX INDUSTRIES 1000 W. Fulton Market, Suite 213 Square feet: Approximately 17,000 Employees: 75</p><p>The first tenant in 1KFulton could not get away with understated digs-after all, the Google megaplex has been heralded as the city's next big tech destination. Working with Chicago-based Horn Design and Skender Construction, the venture-capital firm imagined a space that's creative and raw-much like the startups it invests in-but that can transition easily depending on the needs of employees. A \"collaboration\" room can serve as both an informal studio classroom and a proper roundtable setting for an investor meeting. There are plenty of special design touches, too: Electronic shades provide privacy for top-secret sessions, idea walls allow for spontaneous note-taking and bold pops of tangerine and lime signal a company that is willing to think beyond the pale.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIBUS-4081008</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIBUS2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H6M-XKN1-DYFH-V0X7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8099</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"810\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Crain Communication All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crain's Chicago Business <br/>Print Version</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"23760\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 38</volume><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"10\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>October 19, 2015</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00025MP</classCode><className>TYSON FOODS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002FM6</classCode><className>HILLSHIRE BRANDS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>TSN (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DIEX</classCode><className>TABLE TENNIS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097YJ</classCode><className>EMPLOYEE RELOCATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008X6L</classCode><className>RELOCATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DKTL</classCode><className>ARCHITECTURE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000622</classCode><className>ENGINEERING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009SE3</classCode><className>STADIUMS &amp;

While there have been many pitches, they have tried to revolve around one or more of these.   And of course, there is the big D. Digital transformation has been a clear favorite, notwithstanding how it is interpreted by different vendors, influencers and users. </p><p>  As we are ready to enter 2017, it is pertinent to spare a thought or two to take a stock of what technologies are knocking at the doors and if SMAC still matter.   Let me try to examine the second one first. While not much really has happened in terms of social as a focus area within enterprise, it has become the most important focus for marketing and hence, MarTech. While mobility and analytics continue to add value to them and to the business, cloud is today the basic building block of today's enterprise. No major business worth its name today can do business without directly and/or indirectly using cloud.   So, SMAC is not just all pervasive, it is also the basic enterprise IT framework.   But as always, in a competitive business, the differentiation always comes from tapping new technologies and using them to your business advantage.   So, what are the new ones that are making an impact?   Blockchain is one, for sure. With regulators embracing it, financial services companies have no option but to get going. New FinTech models are emerging based on it. Interestingly, it is now promising to disrupt non-financial businesses as well. It remains one of my favorite tech to follow this year.   Then there is IoT-the technology that promoted WEF to coin a new phrase, fourth industrial revolution, is not a new concept per se and is already under implementation by many. Interestingly, manufacturing or industrial companies, usually laggards in new tech adoption, are leading it. However, this operational technology still remains a little too operational. Enterprise IT integration is not yet mainstream. And we may observe that in 2017.   Finally, there are various manifestations of Artificial Intelligence. A recent study says that it is still mostly narrow in its scope. That is, it is being used for specific problems. Bots are one that most of us have first-hand experience of. They are already part of customer service in most large consumer service businesses and are entering other enterprise applications. Natural language processing and machine learning are at the core of much of today's AI and they will surely become mainstream in enterprises even as big tech companies may look at crossing the next frontier in capability.   While I think these three will remain technologies to watch out for, security will continue to remain one of the most important aspects. In fact, some of these, like AI and analytics, will find applications in cyber security.   Our CIOs in a Twitter poll chose AI/machine learning as the most important technology that will impact enterprises in the next few months. Closely following was IoT.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CIOLDR-n9664971</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CIOLDR2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MDC-Y2N1-DYDW-716J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">410720</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"511\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 FFC Information Solution All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Cio &amp; Leader</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"12\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>December 16, 2016</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000439</classCode><className>CUSTOMER SERVICE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000116</classCode><className>ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DFM1</classCode><className>OPERATIONAL TECHNOLOGY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GX142</classCode><className>NEW DELHI, INDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Well one of the main 'themes' of 2017 was the ongoing battle between 'big tech' and 'big content' around the globe, set in the context of possible reforms to copyright law. </p><p>In Europe, the US and Australia 'safe harbour' was being re-examined, with the film studios and recorded music sector finally making some headway against the likes of YouTube and now Facebook in shrinking the 'value gap' that has propelled the technology sector to host some of the biggest businesses in the World. And finally the record labels and the platforms were doing deals[1]! But it wasn't just technology vs content: two major platforms, Spotify and Deezer, urged European legislators to ensure that the globally dominant giant US technology companies (primarily Apple, Amazon and Google) don't abuse their position as gatekeepers to digital consumers, not least as all three tech giants make and operate devices, control transaction platforms and own content services. Spotify and Deezer are big in their sector, but dwarfed by the likes of Google. And if Rupert Murdoch has seen the writing on the wall, shouldn't we all? Does Disney's $52.4 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox give the combined content and broadcasting behemoth a chance of competing with Netflix or Amazon Prime? It no doubt explains why\u00a0Spotify and China's internet giant Tencent exchanged equity stakes of just under 10 per cent of each other, and why Tencent now has a $2 billion stake in Snapchat. The content industries might be worried about the US tech giants, but the US tech giants will be looking East, at the astonishing growth of the likes of Baidu, JD.com and Albibaba.\u00a0 <url normalizedValue=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9RkqxILz3bw/WkTYBkYHZaI/AAAAAAAAOYc/3fnK-VUiPtcVpp2AMrNfNp-RzCv1DcoxACLcBGAs/s1600/Machina-1.jpg\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9RkqxILz3bw/WkTYBkYHZaI/AAAAAAAAOYc/3fnK-VUiPtcVpp2AMrNfNp-RzCv1DcoxACLcBGAs/s1600/Machina-1.jpg</url> Elsewhere, the Court of Justice of the European Union has defined, re-defined and refined its own and (perhaps) our understanding of what the right of 'communication to the public' under Article 3(1) of the InfoSoc Directive\u00a0actually is. The topic had already been subject to nearly 20 references to the CJEU for preliminary rulings, and yes, there would be more from the court in 2017 as the decisions in Filmspeler, C-527/15, and Ziggo,\u00a0C-601/15 (The Pirate Bay) loomed!\u00a0And what of copyright itself? In an ever changing world, courts around the globe continue to revise our understanding on the subsistence of copyright, sometimes moving on from the classic definition (where copyright subsists in \"original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works\") to approaches such as the CJEU's 2009 concept of protecting works which are the \"author's own intellectual creation'\" in its decision in Infopaq. But this approach and indeed traditional approaches\u00a0presume that a particular person is the author of a work - and it a world of selfie taking monkeys, animal rights and very smart robots ....... do we even know what a 'person' is any more - a conundrum confusingly explored and partially explained in Ex-Machina (pictured).       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C3tz3eRvwrE/WkTYrmmz9ZI/AAAAAAAAOYk/AO8XC4ijxykodbT-aP9d493l-X_BATmQQCLcBGAs/s1600/My-Other-Bag-02.png\">https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-C3tz3eRvwrE/WkTYrmmz9ZI/AAAAAAAAOYk/AO8XC4ijxykodbT-aP9d493l-X_BATmQQCLcBGAs/s1600/My-Other-Bag-02.png</url> January and our first update of 2017 was news from India that three Indian music copyright collection societies were restrained by the Delhi High Court from granting any licences until April. Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva made an interim order against the Indian Performing Right Society (IPRS), the Phonographic Performance Ltd (PPL) and Novex Communications Pvt Ltd preventing them from contravening section 33 of India's\u00a0Copyright Act, which provides that only registered societies can grant licences in respect of copyrighted work(s). In the USA, one of the major musical works collection societies (and there are now four!) BMI filed an action in Federal Rate Court to set interim fees for radio stations represented by the radio industry's trade body the RMLC, while BMI and the RMLC negotiate the terms of a new five-year deal. Again in the US, the Second Circuit affirmed the January 2016 order of Judge Furman of the Southern District of New York (SDNY), which had found that the use of the Louis Vuitton logo and the representation of the Louis Vuitton bags on fabric totes (pictured)\u00a0with one side representing a somewhat cartoonish rendition of a famous luxury bag, while the other side read 'My Other Bag is' with\u00a0the Louis Vuitton 'LV' logo replaced by the initials 'MOB' (and retailing for $35 to $55)\u00a0w[2]as fair use[3]. And\u00a0AG Szpunar issued his opinion in The Pirate Bay case[4], advising the CJEU to answer the question posed by the Dutch Supreme Court of whether the Pirate Bay undertakes the act of communication to the public in the affirmative saying \"the fact that the operator of a website makes it possible, by indexing them and providing a search engine, to find files containing works protected by copyright which are offered for sharing on a peer-to-peer network, constitutes a communication to the public within the meaning of Article\u00a03(1) of [the InfoSoc Directive], if that operator is aware of the fact that a work is made available on the network without the consent of the copyright holders and does not take action in order to make access to that work impossible\".\u00a0       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LmKsNPORtNA/Uh8Cbl0DdbI/AAAAAAAAGCc/mpmhOBkP660xgFo-MuhtmjUclDPhNLD0wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Sirius-XM-Radio.jpgFebruary\">https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LmKsNPORtNA/Uh8Cbl0DdbI/AAAAAAAAGCc/mpmhOBkP660xgFo-MuhtmjUclDPhNLD0wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Sirius-XM-Radio.jpgFebruary</url> began with Tibbie McIntyre posing the question \"Should Press Publishers be Given an Exclusive Neighbouring Right?\"[5] in the context of Article 11 of the Proposed EU Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market. In Spain, a press publisher right was introduced which automatically made Google pay, without the press publishers having to pursue payment under an exclusive right. Google's response was simply to close down Google News in Spain. Further consequences were felt, with online Spanish news sites garnering less traffic. Tibbie opined that the cogent opinion released by CIPIL stated that 'If the real problems facing press publishers relate to licensing and enforcement, the best answer is surely to focus on licensing and enforcement rather than to create new rights' and that 'Multiple rights are associated with clogging and opportunistic behaviour' wisely noting that \"Realising policy objectives is a complex and difficult goal, with almost endless variables to consider\", with drafting of new laws posing a particularly challenging task[6]. The debate being played out across the globe presents many challenges, and it will be interesting to review further developments with this proposed right in future. The Turtles ongoing tri-state litigation against SiriusXM over the satellite radio broadcaster's refusal to pay to broadcast pre-1972 sound recordings reached the the Florida Supreme Court, who looked again at\u00a0Judge Darrin Gayle's decision which found in favour of SiriusXM and agreed that \"There is no specific Florida legislation covering sound recording property rights, nor is there a bevy of case law interpreting common law copyright related to the arts\" and \"If this Court adopts Flo ...die's position, it would be creating a new property right in Florida as opposed to interpreting the law\" adding that it's the job of the Florida state legislature to address the issue, and that a decision to plug the gap would bring up a host of other issues such as resolving who sets and administers licensing rates, who owns sound recordings for dead artists and what exceptions there might be to a public performance right. A host of impressive signatories (including the Centre d'Etudes Internationales de la Propri\u00e9t\u00e9 Intellectuelle (CEIPI), University of Strasbourg, CREATe at the University of Glasgow and the Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition) penned an open letter[7]\u00a0with the heading\u00a0\"EU Copyright Reform Proposals Unfit for the Digital Age\". And singer, songwriter and producer T Bone Burnett delivered a telling contribution[8] to the US Copyright Office's review of Digital Millennium Act 'safe harbor' provisions in the USA, saying in a video that whilst the law that was supposed to \"balance the internet's openness with creators' ability to earn a living wage from their work ..... [T]hose safe harbours have failed\".       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FJo45iXL0js/Wjv4K_c9euI/AAAAAAAAOW0/LWZbmj8ZnJsEllCqGwXgpifSO5Cwh-2FQCLcBGAs/s1600/The%2BReds%2527%2BScott%2BAllison%2Band%2BPhil%2BMcLuckie%2Bcelebrate%2BAllison%2527s%2Bgoal%2B%2528Ben%2BChallis%2529.JPG\">https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FJo45iXL0js/Wjv4K_c9euI/AAAAAAAAOW0/LWZbmj8ZnJsEllCqGwXgpifSO5Cwh-2FQCLcBGAs/s1600/The%2BReds%2527%2BScott%2BAllison%2Band%2BPhil%2BMcLuckie%2Bcelebrate%2BAllison%2527s%2Bgoal%2B%2528Ben%2BChallis%2529.JPG</url> On March 8th, a French art history student was\u00a0escorted out of the Louvre Museum in Paris[9]. His crime? He was taking pictures of the Valentin de Boulogne exhibition, a painter who has been dead for almost 400 years. Contrast that with the approach of the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art which recently made the images of it's artworks in the public domain freely available through a new open access policy, without restrictions. But French law does provide for the Louvre's actions:\u00a0last December last, France's highest administrative court, the Conseil d'\u00c9tat, confirmed that a public entity can forbid a private entity to take pictures of works inside a public museum. But, asked\u00a0Marie-Andree Weiss, is it right? In the UK in\u00a0FAPL v BT [2017][10]\u00a0Mr Justice Arnold concluded that the High Court has the jurisdiction to make an order against an access provider that would require the ISP to block access not to a website but rather streaming servers giving unauthorised access to copyright content - 'live' blocking. One of the more incredible allegations about Prenda Law, the copyright-trolling operation that sued people for downloading movies online, was that the lawyers behind Prenda and its associated companies might have created and uploaded some of the porn, simply as a way of catching more offenders.\u00a0ArtsTechnica told us[11]\u00a0in March that this may well be true, and despite repeated denials by the Preda lawyers. The report said that John Steele [a Prenda lawyer] pled guilty in Minnesota to federal charges of \"conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud\" and to money laundering. And guess what? In 2011 \"Team Prenda had in fact become porn producers (they continued to have other \"real\" clients at that time as well\" and \"On at least three separate occasions in Chicago, Miami, and Las Vegas, Steele and [Paul] Hansmeier... contracted with adult film actresses and produced multiple short pornographic films\".\u00a0In an interesting decision, the\u00a0Court of Appeal in London[12]\u00a0upheld a custodial sentence imposed on Wayne Evans by HHJ Trevor Jones at the Crown Court in Liverpool for two offences of distributing an article infringing copyright contrary to section 107(1)(e) of the Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 and also to a further offence of possessing an article for use in fraud contrary to section 6(1) of the Fraud Act 2006. A twelve month custodial sentence was thought right, despite Evans having no previous convictions, pleading guilty at the first opportunity and making very little (if any) financial gain from distributing thousands of copyrighted music tracks through his deejayportal.com webite: But there was undoubtedly a real loss to the owners of the relevant copyrights and related performers - and that weighed against him as did the need for a deterrent. Can cheerleader uniforms be protected by copyright in the US even on utilitarian clothing? Well the US Supreme Court said YES - when a\u00a0feature incorporated into the design of a useful article it can be eligible\u00a0for copyright protection but only if the feature (1) can be perceived as\u00a0a two or three dimensional work of art separate from the useful article,and (2) would qualify as a protectable pictorial, graphic, or sculptural\u00a0work, either on its own or fixed in some other tangible medium\u00a0of expression if it were imagined separately from the useful article into which it is incorporated (Star Athletica LLC v Varsity Brands, Inc[13].) And finally, back to France where the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Paris found that Jeff Koons had\u00a0infringed the copyright of French photographer Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Bauret[14]\u00a0after reproducing (without authorisation) one of Bauret's photographs to create his Naked sculpture - and that a defence of parody would fail, one of the first cases to look at the CJEU's decision in\u00a0Deckmyn v Vandersteen,\u00a0where the CJEU explained that a parody must 'evoke an existing work while being noticeably different from it, and, secondly, to constitute an expression of humour or mockery\".\u00a0       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VUv74zF-8H8/Wj03sg-CgUI/AAAAAAAAOXE/nVbI58W0DaM51tg3r_eN99snYCQlfcFRACLcBGAs/s1600/princewarhol.jpgIn\">https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VUv74zF-8H8/Wj03sg-CgUI/AAAAAAAAOXE/nVbI58W0DaM51tg3r_eN99snYCQlfcFRACLcBGAs/s1600/princewarhol.jpgIn</url> April, a\u00a0group of bipartisan legislators in the US\u00a0reintroduced a bill[15]\u00a0which is designed to put AM/FM radio into the same shoes as satellite radio and webcasters such as Pandora and iHeartRadio. AM/FM radio stations pay nothing to perform music yet webcasters are required to pay a statutory royalties for playing music on their online radio platforms. A joint statement from the bipartisan group stated that \"Our current music licensing laws are antiquated and unfair, which is why we need a system that ensures all radio services play by the same rules and all artists are fairly compensated\". It's the Fair Play Fair Pay Act. The Italian web-blocking system was held to just fine by Italy's administrative court which ruled that the powers granted to Italy's communications regulator AGCOM to issue\u00a0web-block injunctions[16]\u00a0are not in conflict with either the EU's E-Commerce Directive or Italian copyright law, or the Italian constitution.\u00a0And in Ireland, the Commercial Court ordered nine internet service providers to block access to three websites which were alleged to have facilitated the illegal streaming of copyrighted TV shows and movies. The claimant film studios said the three sites were facilitating piracy on an \"industrial scale\". Mr Justice Brian Cregan granted the order being sought by the six TV and film studios against the ISPs which included Sky Ireland, Vodafone Ireland and Digiweb. The\u00a0CJEU's decision in the important\u00a0Mc Fadden\u00a0case that the provider of a password-free, free WiFi can be requested to have his internet connection secured by means of a password was applied with news that\u00a0he Higher Regional Court of D\u00fcsseldorf had requested that the operator of an open WiFi (and a TOR exit node) take action against repeated copyright infringements by users of his IP-addresses. And the Court of Justice of the European Union issued its long-awaited decision in\u00a0Filmspeler,\u00a0C-527/15, ruling that the sale of a multimedia player was a 'communication to the public', with\u00a0Eleonora explaining[17]\u00a0that the CJEU had substantially followed the opinion of Advocate General Manuel Campos S\u00e1nchez-Bordona, who proposed a broad(er) interpretation of the right of communication to the public and, with it, a broader reading of what amounts to an 'indispensable intervention': the CJEU noted that the aim of the [Infosoc) Directive is to establish a high level of protection for authors and so the concept of 'communication to the public' must be interpreted broadly. In addition, the Court had already held that the availability, on a website, of clickable links to protected works published without any access restrictions offers users of the first website direct access to those work, and that was extended in this case to the sale of the multimedia player. And finally,\u00a0The Andy Warhol Foundation\u00a0filed a pre-emptive suit[18]\u00a0against photographer Lynn Goldsmith asking the Southern District of New York Court (SDNY) to declare that the Andy Warhol Prince Series did not infringe on Defendant's copyright, that the portraits in the series are transformative works protected by fair use, and that Defendant's claim is barred by the equitable doctrine of laches.\u00a0       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DueSqmjmiVQ/Wj08cHspCjI/AAAAAAAAOXU/X2ZCKpHsLaklYf1WCITNLcAYp8DSDr8ywCLcBGAs/s1600/cheese.jpg\">https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DueSqmjmiVQ/Wj08cHspCjI/AAAAAAAAOXU/X2ZCKpHsLaklYf1WCITNLcAYp8DSDr8ywCLcBGAs/s1600/cheese.jpg</url> In May we said farewell to our excellent blogging interns, Tibbie McIntyre and Davis Liao, who added so much to the 1709 Blog. Thank you David and Tibbie. You were both exceptional. And we welcomed Matthew Lingard and Lolita Huber-Froment to carry on where Tibbie and David left off, not least with our regular CopyKat updates. In Australia, in the midst of a big review of copyright, examining the impact of extending a 'fair dealing' doctrine to a wider 'fair use' approach[19]\u00a0came news that a collection society was channelling fees intended for authors into their 'fair-use opposition fund'. The Copyright Agency had set aside a A$15 million fund specifically to oppose the implementation of a fair-use system. Astonishingly, the fund came from payments made to the Australian Copyright Agency for the use of orphan works! Staying 'down under', the Eminem song 'Lose Yourself' was at the centre of a trial in the Wellington High Court: a campaign advert during New Zealand's general election by the ruling party was alleged to have infringed the copyright in 'Lose Yourself' - but the song used was a 'sound alike'\u00a0entitled 'Eminem-esque'.\u00a0Did it matter?\u00a0The answer was no - the copyright in the song had been infringed and damages of NZ$600,000 were awarded[20]. Prenda Law attorney John Steele was disbarred by the Illinois Supreme Court. And Lolita asked the question 'is the taste of a Dutch cheese protected by copyright?' Surely not ..... well maybe .... as a case about cheese seemed to have slipped through the net and said the taste of the cheese (or specifically 'Heks'nkaas', a Dutch cheese[21]) could be a protected creation under author rights, but more importantly asked the CJEU (a) whether EU Law allows copyright protection of taste? and (b) if so, what requirements must be met in order to determine subsistence of copyright protection?       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qWCQXK4fTzQ/Wj1CYTLB2RI/AAAAAAAAOXk/DD1MfA5D6v0ChxvXdFKMTSYiRrZZ5iQSwCLcBGAs/s1600/Jimi%2BHendrix%2Bby%2BGered%2BMankowitz%2B%25281%2529.jpgAt\">https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qWCQXK4fTzQ/Wj1CYTLB2RI/AAAAAAAAOXk/DD1MfA5D6v0ChxvXdFKMTSYiRrZZ5iQSwCLcBGAs/s1600/Jimi%2BHendrix%2Bby%2BGered%2BMankowitz%2B%25281%2529.jpgAt</url> the beginning of June,\u00a0the Bundesgerichtshof (BGH, the German Federal Court of Justice) referred not one but two important\u00a0copyright cases to the Court of Justice of the European Union[22]\u00a0for guidance on (a) the extent EU copyright allows sampling and (b) what role fundamental rights play in the copyright sphere. More specifically, what is the relationship between copyright protection, freedom of the press, and freedom of information?\u00a0The first reference had been made in the context the longstanding and complex\u00a0Metall auf Metall\u00a0litigation concerning the unauthorised sampling by music producer Moses Pelham of a 2-second rhythmic sequence from Kraftwerk's 1977 song 'Metall auf Metall'.\u00a0The second reference was made in the context of litigation between the German Government and German newspaper WAZ over the unauthorised publication by the latter of the so called 'Afghanistan Papers' (confidential military reports). And there was more on sampling with\u00a0Drake, his record label and music publishers\u00a0winning a difficult lawsuit[23]\u00a0that had claimed his song 'Pound Cake/Paris Morton Music 2' which featured on the 2013 album 'Nothing Was the Same' sampled a 1982 spoken-word recording titled the 'Jimmy Smith Rap.' It was a sample,\u00a0but Judge William Pauley noted that whilst in many cases of parody the average observer would need to identify the target of derision, it's not a universal prerequisite for a finding of transformative use, commenting that Drake used Smith's work as 'raw material' for his new work. The judge also commented that the use of 'Jimmy Smith Rap' was transformative regardless of whether the average listener would identify the source and comprehend Drake's purpose. In a decision applauded by photographers around the world, and reversing the Paris Tribunal de Grande Instance (TGI)\u00a0first instance decision[24], the Paris Court of Appeal decided that the iconic photograph of Jimi Hendrix by Gered Mankowitz was original and that, by using the altered copyright-protected work to commercially promote their products online and in two brick-and-mortar shops, the defendant electronic cigarettes sales company had infringed copyright. The Court of Appeal confirmed that the person claiming copyright protection bears the burden of proof. Here Mr Mankowitz had organised the 1967 shoot, had directed the rock star in terms of position and angle, had chosen the use of a specific camera and lens to create a wide-angle effect without distortion, and had chosen the lightning, background, framing and angle of capture - so yes,\u00a0a copyrighted image[25]\u00a0embodying the expression of the photographer's own personality. It was a busy month in France as France's\u00a0Cour de Cassation ruled in favour of the 'freedom of expression' of Director\u00a0Dmitry Chernyakov in respect of \"Le Dialogue des Carm\u00e9lites\" staged for the Munich Opera in 2010 trumped moral rights - here his use did not\u00a0violate the moral rights of composer and librettist Francis Poulenc. July, and the French courts blazed with more copyright news with another case about the importance of originality in French copyright, this time deciding that a retail stores' layouts was original enough to be protected by copyright.\u00a0The court of first instance, the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Lille, had already ruled in favour of the plaintiffs, an Italian cosmetics store, who had claimed that its stores' layout was original and protected by the French droit d'auteur.The Douai Court of Appeals also ruled in favour of the Italian company against the defendants, a French cosmetics and accessory company, and\u00a0recognised that French copyright protects interior design such as 'the rhythm of colour and the layout of a store chain' and explained that '[w]hen this protection is contested in defence, the originality of a work must be explained by the person who claims to be the author, that is the only person able to identify the elements expressing his personality. [and that] the exploitation of a work by a moral entity under its name shall presume that this moral entity [owns the copyright].'\u00a0When a group of museums and researchers in the Netherlands unveiled a portrait entitled\u00a0The Next Rembrandt,\u00a0it was something of a tease to the art world. It wasn't a long lost painting - but a new artwork generated by a computer that had analysed thousands of works by the 17th-century Dutch artist Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn. We've\u00a0had monkeys taking photos[26]\u00a0- now\u00a0theconversation.com[27]\u00a0asked\u00a0\"Should robot artists be given copyright protection?[28]\".       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-00NBEMD86mQ/UgTLcY6bzhI/AAAAAAAAF7E/IOYKKQOZADU4yklOVaf6GTg2F7d37ojDACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/pp.jpg\">https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-00NBEMD86mQ/UgTLcY6bzhI/AAAAAAAAF7E/IOYKKQOZADU4yklOVaf6GTg2F7d37ojDACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/pp.jpg</url> Still in July and speaking of that monkey, freelance photographer David Slater, who facilitated the now infamous 'monkey selfie' taken by black macaque Naruto said he was in a dire financial situation as the appellate proceedings regarding the selfie continued in the United States courts. More photography: snapper Donald Graham, who had filed a copyright infringement suit against the notorious 'appropriation artist' Richard Prince in 2016 claiming that Prince's use (without permission) of Graham's Rastafarian Smoking a Joint photograph to create an Untitled (Portrait) featured in Prince's New Portraits exhibition was copyright infringement, had some good news. Prince, who of course has that controversial but\u00a0helpful judgment in[29]\u00a0Cariou v Prince[30]\u00a0behind his art, claimed his appropriation was fair use. U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein from the Southern District of New York allowed the case to go forward and denied Prince's motion to dismiss the case.\u00a0And the CJEU issued its much-awaited judgment in\u00a0Stichting Brein v Ziggo BV and XS4All Internet BV,[31]\u00a0C-610/15[32]\u00a0(The Pirate Bay\u00a0case) and the Court developed further its construction of the right of communication to the public within Article 3(1) of the\u00a0InfoSoc Directive, and clarified under what conditions the operators of an unlicensed online file-sharing platform\u00a0would be liable for copyright infringement[33].      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-V-j6hju9c3k/WkIj4VQwpWI/AAAAAAAAOX4/6byVqCFqtegF5p9LNSFmtDRk7Sh7eNzpACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/LibertyForeverStamp.jpg\">https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-V-j6hju9c3k/WkIj4VQwpWI/AAAAAAAAOX4/6byVqCFqtegF5p9LNSFmtDRk7Sh7eNzpACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/LibertyForeverStamp.jpg</url> August began with Marie-Andree asking \"Is Reconstructing a Work to Preserve It Copyright Infringement?\"\u00a0in an update which looked at the law suit[34]\u00a0that followed the reconstruction of artist Cady Noland's \"Log Cabin\" sculpture, a life size artwork created in the nineties. Art collector Wilhelm Schurmann bought the work and loaned it to a museum which exhibited it outside for ten years. Over time the work deteriorated, and in 2010 an art conservator recommended the work should be reconstructed it entirely with new materials and new logs. The complaint alleges that Cady Noland was not informed of this decision, but instead learned in 2014 that the work had deteriorated, had been reconstructed, and the decayed material thrown away - and she said her moral rights were violated. Noland also disowned the 'new' work. Is there a claim? A federal judge ordered the dispute over the \"Lady Liberty\" stamp[35]\u00a0to go to trial. The United States Postal Service mistakenly produced a 2010\u00a0stamp that was based on a replica of the Statue of Liberty created by artist Robert S Davidson rather than the original. And a New York judge dismissed a lawsuit brought the estate of promoter Sid Bernstein, who staged the Beatles' legendary 1965 show at Shea Stadium. The Estate had argued that band's Apple Corps had infringed on the copyright of Sid Bernstein Presents by including footage from the concert in Ron Howard's documentary film Eight Days a Week - the Touring Years which was released in September 2016 - but the Judge noted that contract signed in 1965 'reserves no rights whatsoever for Bernstein in any filming or recording of the concert. And finally in August, the case between\u00a0Solid Oak Sketches against Take-2 Software, the maker of the NBA 2K video game which claims that the latter's reproduction of several tattoos worn by famous basketball players was copyright infringement rumbled on. The defendants argued fair use, the use was\u00a0de minimis -\u00a0and that the law suit would \"seek to hinder the ability to depict people as they appear in real life'.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yy7WjAIbgas/U-drBr9CZjI/AAAAAAAAIM0/i8su0r8MSJIGy8gZ1326RX-lP-A2aFN1wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/monkeyselfiedslater.jpgWhat\">https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yy7WjAIbgas/U-drBr9CZjI/AAAAAAAAIM0/i8su0r8MSJIGy8gZ1326RX-lP-A2aFN1wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/monkeyselfiedslater.jpgWhat</url> news in September? Well carrying on from August, Solid Oak's lawsuit was back in the news\u00a0as ArtsTechnica[36]\u00a0took a detailed look at the issues. Elsewhere\u00a0The creator of Pepe the Frog\u00a0stepped up his fight[37]\u00a0against far-right activists who had appropriated the cartoon character as a meme. Matt Furie vowed to \"aggressively enforce his intellectual property\" after the character he created for a comic strip was plastered across social media and even merchandise, particularly by fans of US President Donald Trump as he fought his election campaign. George Chin reported that\u00a0\"We Shall Overcome\" - labelled by the US Library of Congress as 'the most powerful song of the 20th century' - was not original. A federal judge\u00a0struck down the copyright[38]\u00a0for part of the civil rights anthem saying that the song's adaptation from an older work, including changing 'will' to 'shall', was not original enough to qualify for protection with Judge Cote saying\u00a0'This single word substitution is quintessentially trivial and does not raise a question of fact requiring a trial to assess whether it is more than trivial The words 'will' and 'shall' are both common words. Neither is unusual'\u00a0adding \"The fact that a trivial change to the lyrics became a part of a popular version of a song does not render that change nontrivial and automatically qualify the popular version for copyright protection\". Professor\u00a0Lionel Bently[39]\u00a0(University of Cambridge) and Associate Professor\u00a0Valeria Falce[40]\u00a0(Universit\u00e0 Europea di Roma)\u00a0were in Rome[41]\u00a0to discuss the proposed\u00a0Directive on copyright in the Digital Single Market[42],\u00a0concluding[43]\u00a0\"Ultimately, while the Commission appears to pursue a clear objective (reviewing the set of responsibilities) through a bold framework, because the proposed Directive lies within a network of pre-established instruments Article 13 is likely to become a legislative bull in a fragile legal china-shop. It will at the very least introduce 'large amounts' of uncertainty, or, worse, obscure the obligations of the subjects involved.'\u00a0And finally - was it really the\u00a0end of the 'monkey selfie' case?[44]\u00a0It seemed so! The People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals announced it had settled the federal lawsuit that sought to establish the right for animals to own property. In a joint statement PETA and photographer David Slater said: \"PETA and David Slater agree that this case raises important, cutting-edge issues about expanding legal rights for non-human animals, a goal that they both support, and they will continue their respective work to achieve this goal. As we learn more about Naruto, his community of macaques, and all other animals, we must recognize appropriate fundamental legal rights for them as our fellow global occupants and members of their own nations who want only to live their lives and be with their families. To further these goals, David Slater will donate 25% of future gross revenue from the\u00a0Monkey Selfie\u00a0photographs to charitable organizations dedicated to protecting and improving the welfare and habitat of Naruto and crested black macaques in Indonesia.\"\u00a0This may be the end of this case, but is it the end of the story? If the monkey cannot be the author, but does that mean that Mr Slater owns the copyright in the picture taken by the monkey? And if he doesn't -\u00a0who does?[45]       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qnsd5xNgU1A/Wd364S3gqHI/AAAAAAAAOJ0/cJRVOfu964QmucQkyrwwzVhkPUrwoCSjACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/alibaba.pngOctober\">https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qnsd5xNgU1A/Wd364S3gqHI/AAAAAAAAOJ0/cJRVOfu964QmucQkyrwwzVhkPUrwoCSjACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/alibaba.pngOctober</url> - already! The Bundesgerichtshof had been considering a case that dated all the way back to 2009 and finally decided that Google had not infringed the US adult website Perfect 10 by linking to illegally uploaded thumbnail with its image-search engine. Perfect 10 maintained that it was owed damages for copyright infringement. The Bundesgerichtshof disagreed. Under German and EU law, Google's tool was not infringing copyright by reproducing the thumbnails of Perfect 10's models.\u00a0Alibaba.com, the massive Chinese e-commerce company was been hit with a US\u00a0class action lawsuit[46]\u00a0claiming that its network of e-commerce websites is home to rampant copyright infringement of visual artwork.The lawsuit has been brought at the instigation of professional Indiana artist Michel Keck who was seeking to certify a class of copyright holders who have seen their work copied and sold on Alibaba's network of websites without their permission. And it seemed web blocking was now on the cards for copyright owners in the US after Magistrate Judge John Anderson in the District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia recommended a ruling in favour of the American Chemical Society in their action against Sci-Hub (sometimes dubbed the 'Pirate Bay of science') whom the ACS accused of copyright infringement for making available online copies of the former's academic papers without licence. In the UK the copyright (or perceived lack thereof) in TV formats was revisited in\u00a0Banner\u00a0Universal Motion Pictures Ltd v Endemol Shine Group Ltd[47]\u00a0[2017] EWHC 2600 (Ch). Here the court held that a TV format can be potentially protected by copyright, although in the specific case the action failed: but copyright protection will not subsist unless \"as a minimum (i) there are a number of clearly identified features which, taken together, distinguish the show in question from others of a similar type; and (ii) that those distinguishing features are connected with each other in a coherent framework which can be repeatedly applied so as to enable the show to be reproduced in recognisable form.'        \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5dvvXLcWF88/WkPw90UI18I/AAAAAAAAOYM/pjYJGthu6coF0sOuHbAOjcRAQjh-oH3egCLcBGAs/s1600/VCA.png\">https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5dvvXLcWF88/WkPw90UI18I/AAAAAAAAOYM/pjYJGthu6coF0sOuHbAOjcRAQjh-oH3egCLcBGAs/s1600/VCA.png</url> Remember - November! First off, would the Review Board of the U.S. Copyright Office agree with a new request from T.W.N. Industries to reconsider the denial to register two of its patterns. The answer was 'no'. Even though the Board recognised that TWN's \"Gold Wood\" had been independently created, it was not creative enough to be protected by copyright, as 'it consists of simple, minor variations on common shapes arranged in an obvious and uniform manner.' The Board explained further that Gold Wood 'is made up of only a very few elements (monochromatic lines in a few shades of gold' arranged in an unoriginal manner (densely and with only minor and repeating variations throughout the pattern).' As explained in \u00a7 313.4(J) of the\u00a0Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices[48], 'a work consisting of a simple combination of a few familiar symbols or designs with minor linear or spatial variations, either in two-dimensional or three-dimensional\u00a0form, cannot be registered.' Next up, and in\u00a0the space of under a week, there were two big decisions in the USA looking at web blocking - with differing results. First off, a federal judge in California issued a preliminary injunction preventing Canada's Supreme Court from forcing Google to de-list websites for\u00a0Datalink\u00a0on its American search engine. The\u00a0Canadian Supreme Court (Google Inc v Equustek Solutions Inc[49], 2017 SCC 34) had ordered Google to de-list the tech company's website(s) worldwide. Indeed the music industry trade body Music Canada welcomed the judgement saying it was 'a crucial development given that the internet has largely dissolved boundaries between countries and allowed virtual wrongdoers to move from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in search of the weakest enforcement setting'. The US court disagreed - That ruling won't apply here! And Judge Leonie Brinkema\u00a0confirmed the October ruling[50]\u00a0of Magistrate Judge Anderson who had recommended a ruling in favour of the American Chemical Society. The court issued the injunction that meant US based registrars can't offer their services, and server farms can't host Sci-Hub. The order goes further, ordering\u00a0'any person including any Internet search engines, web hosting and Internet service providers, domain name registrars, and domain name registries, cease facilitating access to any or all domain names and websites through which Defendant Sci-Hub engages in unlawful access to, use, reproduction and distribution of the ACS [trade] marks or ACS's copyrighted works'.\u00a0The 1709 Blog posed the French focussed question \"Does a decree aiming at protecting the health of our auditory systems by making it mandatory to lower the sound level of music a violation of the moral rights of the author of the music?\".\u00a0An editorial published in the daily newspaper\u00a0Lib\u00e9ration, titled\u00a0Faites du bruit pour sauver la musique[51],\u00a0Make noise to save music, and signed by several personalities and musicians, including former Minister of Culture Jack Lang, claimed that a French decree aimed at preventing risks associated with noise\u00a0distorts musical works and violates freedom of creation.\u00a0ResearchGate was said to moved at least 1.7 million articles to make them less easily available after legal action by\u00a0a group of five publishers including Elsevier, Wiley and Brill, who\u00a0issued a wave of take-down notices.[52]\u00a0Since then, 93 per cent of the CRS publishers' papers had been made less accessible and instead of being instantly downloadable, users had to request a copy from the author. And finally (and importantly) the CJEU delivered its judgment in\u00a0VCAST, C-265/16[53]: Does EU law prohibit\u00a0a commercial undertaking from providing - without the authorisation of the relevant copyright owner - private individuals with\u00a0cloud computing\u00a0services for the remote video recording of private copies of works protected by copyright, by means of that commercial undertaking's active involvement in the recording? The CJEU held\u00a0\"To the extent that the service offered by VCAST consists in the making available of protected works, it falls within communication to the public. In that regard, the Court recalls that, according to the directive, any communication to the public, including the making available of a protected work or subject-matter, requires the rightholder's consent, given that the right of communication of works to the public should be understood, in a broad sense, as covering any transmission or retransmission of a work to the public by wire or wireless means, including broadcasting.\"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_XevuYBB9_w/Wjub96w7gjI/AAAAAAAAOVo/XWJQ0ToulMU5jEprRmIpN3R2ZLGe1fgXwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/google.jpgAnd\">https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_XevuYBB9_w/Wjub96w7gjI/AAAAAAAAOVo/XWJQ0ToulMU5jEprRmIpN3R2ZLGe1fgXwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/google.jpgAnd</url> we are here. The final month of the year! At the beginning of December the EFF published a critique of the USA's\u00a0CASE Act of 2017, explaining that CASE would have several unwanted consequences, and the most negative of these was (is) the fact that the Copyright Office will become a Copyright Court as the\u00a0Act would set up a 'Copyright Claims Board' within the Copyright Office, staffed by three judges empowered to hear copyright complaints from all over the country.\u00a0The major national sports leagues in Europe, including the English Premier League and Germany's Bundesliga, won a reprieve from the EU who agreed to exclude them from the scope of a copyright reform that would help make content more easily available online in the EU.\u00a0The World Intellectual Property Organisation said it was going to take a long hard look at the of limitations and exceptions to copyright, and provide draft action plans, one each for libraries, archives, museums, educational research institutions, and persons with other disabilities than sight impairment. As we said in our opening, a theme that has been bubbling around for a few years (and not unrelated to a famous monkey's claim for a copyright) was explored in Eleonora's\u00a0examination of artificial intelligence - and copyright[54]: As AI machines become increasingly autonomous, can they be regarded as 'authors' in a copyright sense and, if so, can the works they create be eligible for copyright protection? If the answer was again in the affirmative, who would own the copyright in such works? In China, Lego A/S, Europe's biggest toymaker, said it won its first copyright court case after the China Shantou Intermediate People's Cour ruled that products under the name Bela, sold by two Chinese companies, infringed upon Lego's copyrights. And another recurring theme in 2017, the battle between the tech giants and the content sector bubbled over again when Google and members of Australia's technology sector urged the government to reconsider excluding them from changes to safe harbour rules, while the content sector has applauded the decision to not extend the copyright provisions to digital businesses. In\u00a0Canada, the House of Commons triggered a parliamentary review of Canada's Copyright Act, first passed in 1921.\u00a0TorrentFreak\u00a0[55]commented\u00a0that the music industry was quick to weigh in, congratulating government ministers and making it known that the so-called 'Value Gap' and how the tech giants seem to be good at everything except removing infringing material, and why likes of Google don't seem keen to pay for what drives the likes of YouTube should be high on the agenda. And\u00a0the battle between the tech behemoths, and giants of the content industries, was in full spate in the US where the likes\u00a0Google and Facebook are\u00a0now facing off against Hollywood studios[56]\u00a0and major record labels over how to update the North American Free Trade Agreement to protect copyright in the digital age.\u00a0Silicon Valley is pushing for exceptions to copyright rules for online platforms and Internet service providers it says are needed to keep content flowing on the web. Meanwhile, the U.S. government seems to be taking positions more favoured by companies such as Walt Disney and Time Warner who are lobbying for stronger protections for copyright owners. The new (US led) proposals for NAFTA would\u00a0limit allowances for online use of copyrighted material, a position seemingly less supportive of online platforms than existing US law, in particular a watering down of\u00a0fair-use exceptions and a re-evaluation of 'safe harbor'. And finally, would the mess surrounding pre-1972 sound recordings in the US be sorted? Maybe!\u00a0A group of 41 recording artists[57]\u00a0urged the US Congress to sort out the mess with the new \"Compensating Legacy Artists for their Songs, Service ...portant Contributions to Society Act\" - or (wait for it, and a a drum roll please) the CLASSICS Act.\u00a0      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2yA9wPj01NU/WkYJ7hLX1fI/AAAAAAAAOY0/v6Lps3RApeUGcSt3sRcF5GVbtBAOtG8tgCLcBGAs/s1600/japaneserobot.jpgOur\">https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2yA9wPj01NU/WkYJ7hLX1fI/AAAAAAAAOY0/v6Lps3RApeUGcSt3sRcF5GVbtBAOtG8tgCLcBGAs/s1600/japaneserobot.jpgOur</url> last thoughts: what of the andriod, more intelligent than a human, stronger and faster than a human being who looks like a human but ia built in a factory. Lets say one called Miim, some 100 years from now and having lived with and outlived her creators, aspires to be the best self taught artist ever? Miim visits Mars and paints the most stunning Marscape every seen. A real masterpiece. If Miim dreams of electric sheep - surely she is the author of this stunning work? AI and copyright - no need to short circuit this debate - it's the wild wild Westworld out there. And more here[58]\u00a0and here[59]\u00a0and here[60] and here[61].\u00a0Sadly we have lost some important creative talent this year. In music, Tom Petty, Chris Cornell, Joni Sledge, Fats Domino, Glen Campbell, Gord Downie, Chuck Berry,\u00a0Al Jarreau, Johnny Hallyday, Gregg Allman, composer\u00a0Vladimir Shainsky,\u00a0and trance DJ and producer Robert Miles were just some of those who passed. Film, TV and theatre lost a wealth of talent including the actors Sir John Hurt, Erin Moran, Frank Vincent, Sir Roger Moore, Danielle Darrieux, Robert Hardy, Kritika Chaudhary, Rosemary Leach, Aracy Cardoso, Reema Lagoo, Hiromi Tsuru\u00a0and Partha Mukhopadhyay, comedian and actor Jerry Lewis, along with the film directors Jonathan Demme and George A. Romero. And we said farewell to Paddington Bear author Michael Bond, sitcom writing icon Alan Simpson, Japanese playwright Akira Hayasakathe, children's author and artist\u00a0Dick Bruna,\u00a0Inspector Morse creator Colin Dexter, and the\u00a0cartoonist Leo Baxendale.\u00a0So all we can do is wish you a happy and healthy 2017 and that you all 'live long and prosper'. .       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dgeOR8BT0Cs/Vnfzp_R3rUI/AAAAAAAAMH0/_FmWQESB58sGyh9vggin-Si8eOmNIp77QCPcB/s1600/Kataward.jpgYou\">https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dgeOR8BT0Cs/Vnfzp_R3rUI/AAAAAAAAMH0/_FmWQESB58sGyh9vggin-Si8eOmNIp77QCPcB/s1600/Kataward.jpgYou</url> can catch up with Eleonora's excellent and well deserved\u00a02017 Copyright Awards[62] on the IPKat here[63]\u00a0- and some of those are mentioned above (thank goodness!!).\u00a0 As ever - readers will have their own views on what should (or perhaps should not) be included in the copyright year.

Trump's 2016 presidential campaign had harvested personal information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Aleksandr Kogan, an academic who used a personality quiz to harvest Facebook data for Cambridge Analytica: We were doing the project, collecting the data, and the idea was that there was basically a model where we could pass people's Facebook data -- their pages, ''likes'' -- through and generate predictions about their personalities and their politics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  But along the way we discovered that a lot of this data was not really useful as far as predictive accuracy. Even after delivering the data, we spent a lot of time trying to figure out if there is a way to make it better. We came to the conclusion that the answer is no.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  In March 2018, The Times approaches Facebook after reviewing a copy of the data gathered by Cambridge Analytica and documents that showed the social network had sought to ensure the information was erased by Mr. Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie, one of the firm's co-founders. Facebook had until that point declined to acknowledge that Cambridge Analytica had collected the data.</p><p>  The Times and The Guardian ran the story on Saturday. But my phone started to blow up Friday night. And the reason was that on Friday morning, Facebook took away my account. I just got logged out.</p><p>  I asked my wife, ''Can you, like, find me?'' And she could not find me on Facebook. I was wiped off the planet. We had no idea why.</p><p>  Then Friday evening, Facebook put out a press release saying it had banned Kogan, Cambridge Analytica and Wylie. They said we'd lied and engaged in fraud. So this was Facebook trying to pre-empt the articles The New York Times and The Guardian were about to run. And that opened up the floodgates.</p><p>  At the time, Mr. Kogan believes that the revelations will not make a ripple.</p><p>  I thought this was going to come and go: Who's going to really care? I completely made a mistake. Within a day, I was under siege. I was getting hundreds of emails from pretty much every media outlet in the world.</p><p>  An old girlfriend of mine recently told me that when this all went down, her friends were coming to her and asking if she realized her ex-boyfriend had taken down the free world.</p><p>  Tech giants had been running rampant for a decade, two decades, and now folks for the first time really cared. And that's what I think is the incredible, powerful legacy of Cambridge Analytica. It couldn't do anything useful with the data it collected. But because of the Trump connection, it did capture people's imagination.</p><p>  As told to MATTHEW ROSENBERG</p><p>Congress grills Mark Zuckerberg</p><p>  April 10, 2018</p><p>Facebook's chief executive testifies before the Senate Commerce and Judiciary Committees about revelations that Cambridge Analytica had improperly used personal data from users' profiles. It foreshadows other questioning of tech executives.</p><p>  Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, chairman of the Commerce Committee: He came in the day before the hearing. Of course he was very professional, had his team with him and talked a lot about, ''We get it. We know we screwed up here and we want to fix it, and we're going to be a more responsible actor in the space.''</p><p>  It was just, sort of, to set the stage for what he said the next day.</p><p>  He's not a real small-talk kind of guy. We joked a little bit because he was wearing a suit and tie. I don't think I'd ever seen him in a suit and tie before, so we made some observations about that. He kind of smiled and laughed and said it wasn't the first time he'd worn a suit and tie, or something to that effect. It was like, ''So, where's the hoodie?''</p><p>  At the public hearing on April 10, Mr. Zuckerberg says Facebook takes responsibility for its mistakes and will fix its problems.</p><p>  We're not exactly sure what he meant by all that, because this is still an evolving story and there's still a lot of hands to play here. But I think he -- at least in that meeting and at the subsequent hearing -- was, I thought, very direct, very transparent, and genuinely sorrowful about what had happened and wanted to make it right.</p><p>  On April 11, Mr. Zuckerberg testifies in front of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.</p><p>  Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee: We do what we normally do doing these investigations. You send a letter, you ask specific questions, you set a deadline. And like some groups try to do, they send in staff or attorneys. And in this case, they send in staff or attorneys who said, ''Oh, I don't know. I wasn't there then. Oh, I can't answer that. Yeah, I wasn't there then.''</p><p>  They didn't answer any of them. Because they couldn't, they said. Because they weren't there when X happened or Y happened. Well, that just made the case that we better know who was there. And who was in charge. And that'd be Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>  After the first break, I went back with him, and we were talking, and he was astonished at some of the comments and opening statements by the Democrats.</p><p>  Just, ''Are they always that way?'' Kind of partisan. I said, ''Yeah.'' It was one of those epiphany moments, I think, for him about where this could all head.</p><p>  As told to DAVID McCABE</p><p>  Europe shields personal data</p><p>  May 25, 2018</p><p>  The European Union enacts the General Data Protection Regulation, which provides sweeping new rights to keep companies from collecting and sharing personal data without an individual's consent.</p><p>  Helen Dixon, Ireland's data commissioner: We'd had a European-wide data protection law since 1995, but that was before the internet took off, pre the smartphone and pre many of the major apps and platforms that were to come in the 10 to 20 years that followed.</p><p>  It didn't address social media and platforms. It was a law that required upgrading so that it could better regulate Big Tech.</p><p>  Vera Jourova, European commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality, and a politician from the Czech Republic: My impression as somebody who lived half of their life in a totalitarian regime was that, in digital, the rights of the individual, and their ability to have under control their privacy, is very limited. I felt like people moved their lives to the digital sphere, but they didn't bring their rights with them.</p><p>  With G.D.P.R., I knew we're doing something really big and something revolutionary. There must be respect of every individual that he or she must have the possibility to be the master of his or her privacy.</p><p>  Ms. Dixon: In March 2018, when the Cambridge Analytica story broke, it really opened up the minds of the public, politicians and others to the clear dangers of the misuse of personal data. That was a real turning point.</p><p>  Ms. Jourova: G.D.P.R. is an exercise of rebalancing power. I see it not only in terms of data protection, but also when we speak about the harmful content of the digital industry -- distributing terrorist content or child pornography or hate speech or disinformation that has the potential to distract societies and do public harm.</p><p>  Ms. Dixon: We said you had to really roll back here and start looking at the user at the center of this and what their rights are. It was being taken seriously from the perspective of defending against enforcement action and avoiding fines, as opposed to going back to first principles of protecting user privacy.</p><p>  Ms. Jourova: We are working intensively on exporting G.D.P.R. We have a deal with Japan now. We are advanced in negotiations with Korea. I was in Latin America some months ago. In Argentina and Chile, they are taking G.D.P.R. as a reference point. I am in intensive talks with some United States partners.</p><p>  As told to ADAM SATARIANO</p><p>Google employees walk out</p><p>  Nov. 1, 2018</p><p>  About 20,000 Google workers stage protests over how the company has given multimillion-dollar payouts to a former top executive, Andy Rubin, and other senior employees accused of sexual harassment.</p><p>  Claire Stapleton, a marketing manager at YouTube and protest organizer: The curious effect of the Andy Rubin story was that people started sharing stories of their own disillusionment or difficult experiences that they had had at Google. It was a huge conversation at Google that erupted.</p><p>  I was closely following how the management responded to it, and I don't think that they met the sort of primal scream from the employee base with the accountability and urgency that we were asking for. So, I figured, you know what? Let's just make our voices a little bit louder, and even if we get 200 people to walk out, that would still make a statement.</p><p>  That Friday night in the office, I sent an email to a group of moms at the company who had been sharing stories, with a link to a Google group for people who wanted to protest. When I woke up on Saturday morning, a couple hundred people had joined.</p><p>  The idea of the walkout goes global.</p><p>  Each office had their own rally, their own sort of way of going about it. In Singapore, they met in the cafe; in New York, we met in a nearby park. Mountain View, Calif., the site of Google's headquarters, was obviously the biggest one, and that was on campus. It happened at 11 a.m. local time, no matter what city or office you were in.</p><p>  We were waiting in the park there. The park filled up. We had bullhorns, but they were so insufficient to project to the amount of people who came. People were shouting, ''Time's up.'' People had signs.</p><p>  It didn't necessarily feel like we were burning the place down from the inside. It felt like we were helping the company evolve.</p><p>  As told to KATE CONGER</p><p>  Meng Wanzhou is detained</p><p>  Dec. 1, 2018</p><p>  Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei and the daughter of its founder, is arrested in Vancouver, British Columbia, while in transit at the airport. Her arrest by the Canadian authorities at the behest of the United States kicks off a tech Cold War with China. Few principals are willing to discuss so sensitive a topic on the record, but the event can be reconstructed from court documents from Canadian immigration officials and law enforcement.</p><p>  11:10 a.m.: During the disembarkation process border services officer Katragadda intercepted a female Hong Kong passenger Meng, Wanzhou.</p><p>  He had concerns in regards to her admissibility to Canada. He conducted follow-up questions with her just outside the entry of the jetway.</p><p>  (Sworn declaration of Officer Scott Kirkland, Canada Border Services Agency.)</p><p>  1 p.m.: The subject was seeking entry to transit onward to Mexico City. The subject repeatedly asked why she had been selected for secondary inspection, and on this occasion, she had posed the same question to myself.</p><p>  I asked Ms. Meng what she did for work. The subject stated that she was the chief financial officer (C.F.O.) of Huawei Technologies. The subject stated her father was the founder and current C.E.O. of the company. The subject went on to state that the company sold products in several countries around the world.</p><p>  I asked the subject if her company sold products in the United States. The subject stated, ''No we do not.''</p><p>  (Sworn declaration of Sanjit Dhillon, acting superintendent, Canada Border Services Agency.)</p><p>  1:15 p.m.: Ms. Meng tells me she was stopped by U.S. immigration officials in New York four years ago. According to Ms. Meng the immigration officials told her she might have an issue with her visa. The officials took her to an interview room, and looked at her electronics.</p><p>  (Sworn declaration of Officer Kirkland.)</p><p>  2:04 p.m.: I have Ms. Meng provide me with the phone numbers for her cellphones.</p><p>  She provides the PIN number for both phones as well.</p><p>  (Sworn declaration of Officer Kirkland.)</p><p>  2:12 p.m.: Talking to Meng in CBSA secondary room.</p><p>  (Handwritten notes of Constable Dawn But, Royal Canadian Mounted Police.)</p><p>  2:14 p.m.: So because in the United States, uh, you have committed fraud, uh, we're arresting you and then you will be sent back to the United States. Right, you.</p><p>  (Constable But, in a transcript of an interview with Ms. Meng.)</p><p>  2:21 p.m.: ''You're saying, because of my company, you're arresting me,'' Meng Wanzhou said.</p><p>  (Constable But, in a transcript of an interview with Ms. Meng)</p><p>  3:04 p.m.: Cst. Dhaliwal seized (1) Huawei cellphone, (1) iPhone, (1) iPad/white rose gold, (1) pink MacBook, (1) Cruzer Glide 3.0 256 GB.</p><p>  (Handwritten notes of Constable Gurvinder Dhaliwal, Royal Canadian Mounted Police.)</p><p>  3:27 p.m.: Talked to company lawyer. Will find her a lawyer.</p><p>  (Handwritten notes of Constable But.)</p><p>  Compiled by KATE CONGER</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS (PHOTOGRAPH BY DARRYL DYCK/THE CANADIAN PRESS, VIA ASSOCIATED PRESS)               </p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NYT-751120191222</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NYT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XT5-JK11-DXY4-X257-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2120\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The New York Times Company</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times</publicationName><edition>Late Edition - Final</edition><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/13/business/22techdecade2018.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/13/business/22techdecade2018.html</url><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 22, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

He is therefore forecasting a measurable GDP improvement for 2018, with 2.7 percent growth and most economic sectors producing a healthy showing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> He predicts that housing starts and home pricing will tick upward, and the vital price of crude oil will actually decline to around $50-plus per barrel on the world markets. Traditional retail will continue to evolve, along with the associated retail real estate interests, but old economic sectors such as the coal industry will ebb as the dynamics of new industries, such as natural gas, flex their energetic muscles.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"Of course, a war in Korea could end all bets on forecasting the economy,\" said Faucher.</p><p> The Congressional effort toward changes in the federal taxation system according to Faucher, will also help to provide a bump upward with commerce. However, he warns that the current effort is not genuine tax reform, because it will undoubtedly increase the national debt, thereby producing only a short-term stimulus.</p><p> Faucher also remarked that the Federal Reserve appears to be following a cautious, but genuine pro-growth agenda in the manner of the past decade. The year ahead for legislators will probably witness spirited debate about the financial implications of massive baby boomer retirements, how to pay for promised benefits, and the amount of financial support to deliver in the years ahead.</p><p> Included in this Congressional discussion will be societal questions about what American society will tolerate with the number of uninsured for health care, including within retirement.</p><p> \"No real efforts have been made to cope with rising health care costs,\" said Faucher. \"Washington has conducted absolutely no conversations about this issue because we do not yet have the political will to talk about this very difficult situation.\"</p><p> Faucher added that there are no factual indications off-shored manufacturing jobs will return in large numbers, as promised by <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>The true focus within manufacturing has become the use of machines to replace unskilled human workers, thereby making workforce development the key for employment within technology-based manufacturing.</p><p> \"Labor reductions from robotics will become increasingly common in the days ahead, and total manufacturing employment may actually drop,\" said Faucher. \"The big question is how to help those left behind by all of these market changes.\"</p><p> Tax reform bump</p><p> Washington's efforts at tax reform will undoubtedly fuel some growth for Pennsylvania's $531 billion GDP, predicted Gene Barr, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Chamber of Commerce.</p><p> However, Barr warned that to a large degree anticipatory returns already have been taken out of the reform's final effects, and he questions if the national economy will receive the mass economic bump forecasted by Washington. In addition, the resultant increase in the national debt will inevitably serve as an economic brake, with any positive GDP growth actually dependent upon how each state has made itself competitive for business.</p><p> Barr also reported that the economic agony of the Great Recession is finally fading into the rear-view mirror of business.</p><p> \"Overall, our chamber members are commenting that their businesses are doing quite well,\" said Barr. \"They are optimistic despite the apparent inability of our lawmakers to get out of the way.\"</p><p> Concerns for 2018 voiced by chamber members, according to Barr, include the negative effects of <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>demeanor, changing American demographics and a frustrating inability to fill skilled jobs. Federal immigration policies should include attention to workforce needs, with the reality that there is no evidence Trump can be successful at bringing back offshored low-skill manufacturing jobs.</p><p> \"Automation use is sure to expand during 2018, and workforce preparation must focus on higher end jobs that require education and specific skills,\" said Barr. \"This is a vital part of the economic development picture.\"</p><p> He warned that a high school diploma is now insufficient preparation for most jobs, although a two-year tech degree or certificate of competency increasingly opens many skilled-employment doors. As all of these scenarios play out during 2018, unknowns that could cause mass disruption are plentiful, such as a war in Korea, tax reform side-effects and terrorist or cyber-attacks.</p><p> \"We're also concerned about the divisiveness around the country,\" said Barr. \"I personally believe divisiveness is more widespread than any time since the Civil War era.\"</p><p> Technological disruptions</p><p> The non-profit trade association CompTIA has reported that tech employment within the United States now exceeds 6.7 million people. Tech firms are producing more than seven percent of the national GDP, and generating 11 percent of the total national payroll within the private sector.</p><p> Within this surging economic engine expectations are strong for increased disruption in large markets such as government, health care and financial services, according to Kris Jones, founder and CEO of LSEO. Old entrenched ways will increasingly be replaced by new technologies such as voice recognition and artificial intelligence as big tech companies continue to enter new industries with more resources than these industries want to address.</p><p> \"Get ready for more and more conversational devices that trigger action, such as email by voice,\" said Jones.</p><p> He further forecasts that 2018 will include an increased integration of digital commerce. The survivors of this disruption must operate brick and mortar plus a digital presence as they cash in on sales technology with efficiency and integration.</p><p> \"Voice technology that allows facial recognition for security will also begin to make digital passwords obsolete,\" said Jones.</p><p> On-demand video services such as Netflix will continue to prosper during 2018, with more original content available to viewers than ever before. This, according to Jones, will be matched to rising usage of cryptocurrency such as bitcoin, as business units such as financial services and health care become ripe for inclusion with these digital technologies.</p><p> \"Resistance to these and other forms of digital disruption is ebbing because of recognition that the resultant efficiency and convenience are good for business,\" said an enthusiastic Jones.</p><p> Strategic policies?</p><p> Any economic forecasts about 2018 must include information that examines trends within the nation's bustling health care system. During 2017, according to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid services, domestic health care spending exceeded $3.3 trillion, accounting for 17.9 percent of the nation's GDP.</p><p> Justin Matus, Ph.D., associate professor and director of MBA program for the Sidhu School of Business and Leadership at Wilkes University, also serves on the board of directors for Wilkes-Barre General Hospital. He accused Washington of only being concerned with movement of insurance dollars, while no strategic attempt has been made to actually tackle health care policy and system-wise rising costs.</p><p> Dr. Matus further declared that the percentage of domestic GDP spending for health care is out of control, while all talk about healthy competition within providers is a falsehood. Only pseudo competition exists, because system size rules as limited number of massive health care systems do battle over a limited number of patients.</p><p> Merger, consolidations and vertical integration will therefore continue to be paramount within complex health care business strategies as provider systems strive to do business under one roof. Dr. Matus therefore forecasts that the drive toward increased system size, with decreasing competition, will dominate during 2018.</p><p> According to Dr. Matus, an interesting systemic change may be occurring in Denmark as front-line caregivers unionize. This is being done to counteract the loss of power being experienced by general practitioners, and Dr. Matus believes a similar movement could take root here during 2018.</p><p> \"Value-based medicine is the thrust in America as the big health care systems seek more bang for their buck,\" said Dr. Matus. \"This is decreasing the power of the front-line physicians, but based on what I have seen overseas the care givers are reacting to regain some of that control.\"</p><p> Dr. Matus also forecasted that health care will see an increased use of artificial intelligence for diagnosis. In many cases digital technology can interpret tools such as diagnostic scans better than a human, making this change predictable within the nation's care system.</p><p> \"On a negative note, I also believe there no basis for optimism that the general public is going to take wellness seriously,\" said Dr. Matus. \"Only reduced demands for health care will reduce the amount we as a society are spending.\"</p><p> Taxation smiles</p><p> On the Pennsylvania manufacturing front, industry is generating more than $2.1 trillion in total GDP. This scenario is sure to evolve as infrastructure renewal, regulatory rollbacks and tax reform provide fertile ground for manufacturers, according to David Taylor, president and CEO of Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association.</p><p> Washington's tax changes, according to Taylor, have a reasonable chance of bringing home $2 trillion to the United States that has been stranded overseas due to lower corporate tax rates abroad.</p><p> \"I'm quite sure tax reform will not be just a financial iceberg for the wealthy,\" said Taylor. \"Corporations are being put into better investment situations, and this will eventually benefit everyone.\"</p><p> On a specific note, manufacturing's use of robots is sure to increase, according to Taylor. These technologies are proving to be transformational in industries such as logistics, and are expanding daily into the manufacturing sector as technologies such as programmable controllers advance.</p><p> \"Efficiency and productivity, plus safety, are the goals within manufacturing, but the new technologies definitely are causing thousands of lost jobs with new jobs also being created,\" said Taylor. \"This can be hard for people, but history clearly shows ongoing change with employment is normal. Political infighting about this is not good, because we must find new ways to use our workforce skills, intellects and talents.\"</p><p> Demographic changes</p><p> According to the National Center for Education Statistics, during the academic year 2014 to 2015, total revenues at degree-granting postsecondary institutions within the nation totaled $567 billion in current dollars. This unfolded within a labor-intensive economic sector dealing with rising operating costs, such as health care insurance, and demographics challenges including a 10-percent drop in the number of 18-year-old potential students.</p><p> \"We knew this big demographic challenge was coming,\" said Thomas Botzman, Ph.D., president of Misericordia University. \"An 18-year-old can only attend one school at a time.\"</p><p> To counteract this and other difficult economic challenges facing the nation's colleges, schools must learn to better market themselves, according to Dr. Botzman.</p><p> The national tax reform is also creating an environment that may be damaging to collegiate budgets and associated enrollments, despite the factual evidence that most four-year degrees have not lost their value.</p><p> \"Four-year graduates are now earning $500,000 to $1 million dollars more over a lifetime as opposed to no college,\" said Dr. Botzman. \"That's a pretty good investment.\"</p><p> He added that enhanced abilities to read and think critically will continue to be vital as the American economy evolves in the 21st Century.

California lawmakers passed some groundbreaking legislation regarding consumer privacy and the Internet of Things ('IoT'). Several other states also began to address some important data privacy concerns. Additionally, lobbying for a federal privacy law increased. Below are some key privacy developments from 2018.California LegislationCalifornia is by far the leading state in consumer privacy. </p><p>Most notably, the state passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) this past June. This law addresses the longstanding issue of unprotected consumer data, which has become increasingly worse as the digital world expands. Without regulation, big tech companies have the power to collect and disseminate private consumer information for essentially any purpose. The new law aims to solve this issue by giving individual consumers more rights and power over their personal information. This includes the right to obtain information about what data is collected, reasons behind the data collection, and how organizations use and disseminate the data. Additional entitlements include data breach notification, access to view and delete data, and the option to opt out from sale and dissemination of personal data. The CCPA will become effective in 2020. While the attorney general will have the power to enforce the law, consumers can file a civil lawsuit if their data is compromised during a breach due to an organization's insufficient security. However, the act has already faced challenges for its unclear language and exemptions. There will likely be some amendments to the law in 2019. It will be interesting to see if any amendments limit consumer control, which would stray away from the intent of the law. California also was the first state to pass a law that addressed IoT, which will be effective January 1, 2020. Among other things, this law requires that all manufacturers selling connected devices in California install reasonable security features on these devices that are 'appropriate to the nature and function of the device; appropriate to the information it may collect, contain, or transmit; and designed to protect the device and any information contained therein from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.' Only the state will be able to enforce this law.Other Noteworthy State LegislationAfter California passed their consumer privacy law, other states began discussing or drafting similar laws. In 2019, watch if any states pass their own consumer privacy law, whether these laws provide more protections to consumers or to tech companies, and if the language is clearer than the California law. A digital data breach can greatly compromise private consumer information. Notably, in 2018 South Dakota and Alabama passed data breach notification statutes. They were the only two states that did not have some type of law in place mandating that organizations notify consumers after a breach compromises their personal data. Many other states amended their statutes on this topic. Key changes included clarifying when notification is warranted, what qualifies as a breach, covered entities, and what type of consumer data requires notification. Another important data privacy development occurred in Ohio, which was the first state to pass a cyber security safe harbor law. After a breach occurs, an organization will have a defense against liability if it had a sufficient cyber security framework in place at the time of the breach. This provides an incentive for organizations doing business in Ohio to revamp their security programs and provide more consumer protections.Federal Privacy DevelopmentsWhile things were not as progressive on the federal side, there was some lobbying by big tech companies for a federal privacy law. This was surely influenced by California's law and the fear that other states would follow suit. They want a federal law that preempts all state laws and grants more power to tech companies instead of consumers. Most importantly, these organizations want to retain discretion over how they use and disseminate consumer data. Using this data for advertising or sale makes up a significant percentage of their profits. Establishing a federal privacy law will likely be an uphill battle, as consumers and privacy advocates want a federal law that resembles California's strict framework. While lobbying will undoubtedly continue in 2019, passage of a comprehensive federal privacy law may still be years away. The push for a federal program regulating IoT had less traction in 2018. There is no federal law that directly applies to issues associated with the IoT. While federal lawmakers have introduced several bills on this topic, to date none have been passed into law.ConclusionThe states undoubtedly took some big steps in data privacy legislation this year. In 2019, more states will likely follow suit and begin to address the many facets of this topic. Additionally, with the passage of the GDPR and other privacy laws throughout the world, it is clear that privacy is also becoming a very important global issue. As the states continue to tighten and reform their data privacy laws and other countries continue to explore privacy issues more closely, federal lawmakers will continue to feel pressured on all fronts to create a comprehensive data privacy law. While a federal law probably will not be on the books in 2019, it will likely be created in the near future. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP1054111548194751199251762900127</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V83-Y7N1-JCMN-Y12M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"930\"/><timeReceived>10:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 22, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Indeed safe harbour was the focus of endless debate, and the reforms in Europe[2] were perhaps the most talked about and the most fiercely debated, but moves to prod copyright into the digital age were also taking place in Japan, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand to name but a few, and China went one step further, bringing in three 'internet courts' fit for intellectual property law in the digital age with the availability of blockchain technologyto protect rights[3]. It is easy to underestimate the lobbying power (and financial resources) of the big tech companies, but as the year went on the content side began to adapt their arguments and win over politicians, consumers and regulators - but it's all far far from over and we expect 2019 to be just as exciting. </p><p>In other news, and as the UK argued and fretted and pondered what 'Brexit' really meant, the USA updated its approach to music licensing and music copyrights, the \"Blurred Lines\" case provided endless comment about what is and isn't copying when it comes to inspiration for compositions, in a case muddied by claims that what was really being copied was the vibe in the 2013 pop song which was just too similar to an earlier Marvin Gaye classic, and Led Zeppelin faced a claim that their \"Stairway To Heaven\" was a rip off of an earlier song, or maybe an earlier sound recording. Cheese hit the news, transformative art was all the rage (or prompting rage), that monkey selfie case finally reached the end of the line, Canadian musician and now photographer Bryan Adams pointed out some of the realities[4] of what lobbying in the 'name of' creators, authors and artists actually means (and often it is certainly not for the benefit[5] those very creators), and a case that the recorded music sector seemingly 'lost' ended up looking like a big win! <url normalizedValue=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SPEf1Nzdb_o/VTjG3ypGQ2I/AAAAAAAAJ7Y/AQt6LN_sunMOebH9j0KmiTajhFOG2GJkwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/the%2Bxx.jpg\">https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-SPEf1Nzdb_o/VTjG3ypGQ2I/AAAAAAAAJ7Y/AQt6LN_sunMOebH9j0KmiTajhFOG2GJkwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/the%2Bxx.jpg</url> In January, two US Congressmen launched a proposed new statute that had the support of both music copyright owners and music users, in an effort to overhaul of the mechanical royalties system in the US. Doug Collins and Hakeem Jeffries said that their Music Modernization Act would \"bring music licensing its first meaningful update in almost 20 years\". The Bill was to be an overhaul of the compulsory licence system that governs mechanical licences in the US, with Collins and Jeffries saying: \"Under the Music Modernization Act, the digital services would fund a Mechanical Licensing Collective, and, in turn, be granted blanket mechanical licenses for interactive streaming or digital downloads of musical works\". It was going to be an Act that grew and developed as the year went on. We welcomed our two new and marvellous 1709 interns, Kelsey Farish and Mateusz Rachubka, both of whom had an exceptional year with us, as their respective careers went from strength to strength. The French Conseil d'Etat ordered the State topay French Internet Access Provider Bouygues Telecom[6]the sum of \u20ac26,100 as compensation for costs it had met under so-called 2009 graduated response system overseen by HADOPI, under which a series of warnings are issued by HADOPI to infringers using peer-to-peer networks to unlawfully share protected content. Upon the \"third strike\", sanctions may be taken. The law mandated that ISPs would collect certain identifying data on their subscribers and turn over same to the public authority (which then issued the warnings) and that the ISPs could then seek reimbursement for the specific costs incurred in carrying out such tasks. Back in the USA, the music industry (mostly) supported two more new pieces of legislation, the CLASSICS Act, which was aimed at rectifying the much discussed pre-1972 quirk in American copyright law that excludes earlier sound recordings, and the AMP Act, which would introduce a new right for record producers and sound engineers, and reform to the way satellite radio royalties are calculated, and provide a general performing right for sound recording copyright to rectify another odd position in US copyrights law. In Singapore, Fox and the Premier League joined telcos Singtel and StarHub in a private case against two Android set-top box sellers for allegedly 'wilfully infringing' copyright. The actions against Singapore distributor Synnex Trading and retailer An-Nahl was brought under Section 136 (3A) of the Copyright Act. And finally in January, the owners of 'Grumpy Cat' successfully took action against the unlicensed use of Grumpy Cat's image on iced coffee products branded as 'Grumppucions' for 'blatantly infringing' their copyrights and trademarks by selling other types of coffee and T-shirts with the cat's image. Following the long-lasting dispute against Grenade Beverage, the California federal court awarded the cat's owner the sum of $710,001 for the copyright and trade mark infringement. In a brief comment, the attorney representing Grumpy Cat Limited stated that 'Grumpy Cat feels vindicated and feels the jury reached a just verdict'.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FHiLRACVgQ4/W3QwNIy3bGI/AAAAAAAAOyI/-8SVP6R8ECcOEKFsJC3nABAgfvkyfPMFwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/15000-we-shall-overcome-badge-1.jpgFebruary\">https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FHiLRACVgQ4/W3QwNIy3bGI/AAAAAAAAOyI/-8SVP6R8ECcOEKFsJC3nABAgfvkyfPMFwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/15000-we-shall-overcome-badge-1.jpgFebruary</url> opened with a very important decision fromthe 4th Circuit Court of Appealswhich reversed a $25 million verdict[7]against the US Internet Service Provider Cox Communications in what might have been seen as a defeat for record label BMG, which had sought to hold Cox liable for copyright infringement for its subscribers who were sharing pirated files online. But a detailed look at the judgment saw many argue that the decision was actually a win in the battle against piracy. The 4th Circuit took a long hard look at how and why Cox would be protected by US \"safe harbor\" provisions and the Court ruled against Cox on a key point: The DMCA provides a degree of protection to ISPS and other platforms that respond expeditiously to takedown requests. But one of the requirements is that the ISP and other intermediaries to have \"adopted and reasonably implemented a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of subscribers who are repeat infringers.\" The appellate court said that as it stood, Cox wasn't entitled to rely on safe harbor because it did very little (if anything) even when told about repeat offenders, re-affirming the jury decision that sided with BMG and awarded $25 million against Cox when they found the broadband carrier liable for piracy by its subscribers, even if over turning that decision. February was also the month when the anthem of the US Civil Rights Movement 'We Shall Overcome' was freed into the public domain in a victory for theWe Shall Overcome Foundation, an organisation that wanted to make a documentary about the song. The change was sparked by a decision bya federal judge in New York who ruled that the key verse in the song was not protected under copyright for lack of originality. With a February trial date set, copyright owner Ludlow Music opted to enter into a settlement,releasing the copyright[8]in both the melody and lyrics.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jgaTwUgHP28/VaYf7QqbODI/AAAAAAAAKto/9LFJMdpbMHA_7qY-FA-kjp2xn9n7gxXlQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/robin-thicke-blurred-lines.jpgIn\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-jgaTwUgHP28/VaYf7QqbODI/AAAAAAAAKto/9LFJMdpbMHA_7qY-FA-kjp2xn9n7gxXlQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/robin-thicke-blurred-lines.jpgIn</url> March,new research showed[9]that music and football right holders had brought the most cases to London's High Court in the preceding year. The rise in the number of claims was the result of rightholders fighting illegal streaming on the internet. The most frequent Claimant was PPL (Phonographic Performance Limited (the recorded music CMO) which had brought 88 cases to the High Court. The second most active claimant was Football Association bringing 36 cases. Among the top 10 claimants filing the copyright cases are also Sky and BT with 12 and 11 cases respectively. Elsewhere,the depiction of two dolphins crossing underwater was found to be an \"idea that is first found in nature,\" and so could not be the subject of copyright protection according to a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit inFolkens v Wyland[10]. That claim was brought byPeter A. Folkens, a successful wildlife artist, but the courts failed to find protection for his illustration of two dolphins crossing each other underwater, with the appellate court upholding thetrial judge's decision that a later adaptation did not infringe as the illustration was of a pose in a natural position and thus incapable of protection under copyright law, with the Ninth Circuit explaining that despite the similar positioning of the dolphins, a pose is not ordinarily copyrightable unless combined with something else. In particular, 'a collection of unprotectable elements - pose, attitude, gesture, muscle structure, facial expression, coat, and texture - may earn 'thin copyright' protection that extends to situations where many parts of the work are present in another work.' In a very big case that had divided the music industry, music experts, musicologists and indeed legal commentators, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the 2015 jury verdict which found that Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams' 2013 hit 'Blurred Lines' had infringed on the copyright in Marvin Gaye's 1977 song 'Got To Give It Up'. The decision had attracted widespreadcriticism and comment[11], not least as many commentators felt that the jury made their decision by comparing the 'sound' or vibe of the songs, rather than the actual song itself. The appellate panel's decision was a split decision, 2-1, with a scathing dissent from US Circuit Judge Jacqueline Nguyen who was openly critical of the majority, and said that the Marvin Gaye Estate had been able to 'accomplish what no one has before by acquiring copyright to a musical style.'The decision[12]meant that Thicke and Williams remained liable for $5.3m in damages and ongoing royalties to the Marvin Gaye Estate from future revenues earned from 'Blurred Lines'. Many (if not everyone) expected a further appeal, either to an 'en banc' hearing of the appellate court, or to the US Supreme Court ...... but would Thicke and Williams want to go that far? Fair dealing for educational purposes became a political hot potato in Japan after the Japanese Society for Rights of Authors, Composers and Publishers (JASRAC) said it would take legal action to force educational institutions pay for copyright uses, with JASRAC saying that 'when teachers play a song on the piano in front of their students without permission, they are committing a copyright violation.' And finally in March and still on fair dealing, in Australia, some50 years after the passage of the Copyright Act 1968, the Government said it was now seeking commentary from the public in respect of how Australian copyright lawcould be modernised[13]and updated. In a consultation paper the Government highlighted three areas of the Copyright Act which might benefit from modernisation: flexible exceptions, contracting out of exceptions, and access to orphan works.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TgJWsH0lkHM/WsYokwOe3rI/AAAAAAAAOsk/Nr8tUdT9uTgShny9cZDSlqWf2FZzG3oxQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Hlengiwe%2BMhlaba.jpgIn\">https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TgJWsH0lkHM/WsYokwOe3rI/AAAAAAAAOsk/Nr8tUdT9uTgShny9cZDSlqWf2FZzG3oxQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Hlengiwe%2BMhlaba.jpgIn</url> April , theAustralian Government asked for feedback on how effective itspirate site-blockingmechanisms were, introduced in the Copyright Amendment (Online infringement) Act in 2015. Rightholders responded, and said they wanted more -with a number saying[14]that they would now like to expand the law that would require online service platforms to block the websites with infringing content. Foxtel also observed a need to improve actions against infringing live streams, basing its observations on the framework of injunctions obtained in the UK last year by the Premier League and UEFA, which enable to block websites with pirated live sports streams. In their view similar framework should be available in the Courts of Australia.In the US, Artur Sargsyan, owner of the Sharebeast.com, Newjams.net and Albumjams.com, was sentenced for criminal copyright infringement for private financial gain. His website has contained an enormous file-sharing infrastructure consisting of around 1 billion copies of copyrighted musical works that were available for download. At the same time the websites contained pop-up advertisements, which allowed Sargsyan to make a significant profit from the number of visitors downloading works from his websites. US District Judge Timothy C Batten sentenced Mr Sargsyan to five years imprisonment, followed by three years of supervised release and he was required to pay restitution in the amount of $458,200 and forfeit $184,769. In South Africa,an almighty row was brewing. At the heart of the complaint was the actions of SAMRO, the Southern African Music Rights Organisation established by the South African Copyright Act, with the South African Minister of Arts and Culture Nathi Mthethwa noting \"with grave concern\" what is 'alleged to be thebiggest music rights scam[15]in South African history\" involving the legendary and multi-platinum selling gospel artist Hlengiwe Mhlaba and the alleged theft (over a period of years) of royalties amounting to millions of rand. In Italy, the District Court of Milan (Tribunale di Milano) addressed an interesting question inBoeri v Agnoletto,decision No 1568/2018[16], and that was this: to what extent can an architectural project be modified without the express consent of the architect without such modifications being an infringement of their moral right of integrity? The legislative wording in sections 20(1) and 20(2) of the Italian Copyright Act could be interpreted in (at least) two ways, whilst providing that \"irrespective of economic rights and even after their transfer, the author of a work has the right to object to any deformation, mutilation or any other modifications, as well as any other act to the detriment of the work, that may be prejudicial to their honour or reputation\" but that'in works of architecture the author cannot object to any modifications that were necessary in the course of their realization. Similarly, they shall not object to any further modifications that were necessary to be made on a work that has been already realized.' Here the architect claimed that both modifications made to his social housing project 'Casa Bosco' and the transformation of the project into a for-profit enterprise had infringed his moral right - but he failed on both counts. And finally,Does the inclusion of a work which is freely accessible to all internet users on a third-party website with the consent of the copyright holder \u2014 on a person's own publicly accessible website constitute an act of communication to the public within Article 3(1) of theInfoSoc Directiveif the work is first copied onto a server and is uploaded from there to that person's own website?This is the question that the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) had been asked to address in LandNordrhein-Westfalen v Renckhoff, C-161/17. AndAdvocate General (AG) Campos Snchez-Bordona delivered his Opinion and answered in the negative. But what would the CJEU think? All would be revealed in August.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yy7WjAIbgas/U-drBr9CZjI/AAAAAAAAIM0/i8su0r8MSJIGy8gZ1326RX-lP-A2aFN1wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/monkeyselfiedslater.jpgMay:\">https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yy7WjAIbgas/U-drBr9CZjI/AAAAAAAAIM0/i8su0r8MSJIGy8gZ1326RX-lP-A2aFN1wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/monkeyselfiedslater.jpgMay:</url> As April ended with World IP Day and World Books and Copyright Days, May began with May the Fourth, which is of course Star Wars Day, and news that the most famous litigating ape in the world had finally had his day. Who is this simian star? None other than Naruto, the Black Macaque monkey at the heart of theinfamous 'monkey selfie' case. Despite the case itself having been settled, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the monkey, which was named as the plaintiff, lacked the statutory standing to bring an action for copyright action under the US Copyright Act. Neither was it possible for animal rights organisation PETA to validly assert 'next friend' status that would allow it to represent the monkey 'both (1) because PETA has failed to allege any facts to establish the required significant relationship between a next friend and a real party in interest and (2) because an animal cannot be represented, under our laws, by a next friend\". Why is China now so interested in copyright? Well, the National Copyright Administration of China revealed that China's internet copyright industry grew by over 27% in 2017 and has reached a value of over 636 billion yuan (US$100 billion). The biggest contributors were and are online news portals and online games which accounted for 73% of the total market value. Online news and information market grew by 40%, and online gaming increased by 32% and had reached 235.5 billion yuan. Live streaming and short videos have seen the most rapid growth, achieving a number of 422 million live streaming users. And the controversy surrounding the Copyright Society of Nigeria (COSON) reached epic proportions, as power struggles between the organisation and the Nigerian Copyright Commission (NCC) rumbled on. Following a General Meeting of COSON in December 2017, a petition was sent to the Governing Board requesting an investigation into certain decisions made at the meeting. The Commission then issued directives to COSON Management, saying that the those decisions should not be implemented. COSON Management failed to comply, and subsequently had its license revoked.Speaking toThe Nation[17]on the subject, Nigerian artist Paul Play Dairo said \"as a concerned Nigerian musician, I believe that I have the right to protect my intellectual property, I have the right to choose the collecting society that I want to join.'In reply, COSON has called directly upon Nigeria's President, Muhammadu Buhari, to immediately relieve Afam Ezekude of his position as the Director General of the NCC.      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5x1xhuQy6T0/TqE22zDaKdI/AAAAAAAAAd4/r_HXa-TJ0XQ-CcMYXAr8Q_Y0oqriaSmkQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/eu.jpg\">https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5x1xhuQy6T0/TqE22zDaKdI/AAAAAAAAAd4/r_HXa-TJ0XQ-CcMYXAr8Q_Y0oqriaSmkQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/eu.jpg</url> It might be June, but everyone had been busy trying to understand how the implementation of GDPR would role out (seemingly to prevent anyone in the EU from obtaining access to free and very useful US content it seems - ah regulators - they never learn). The Coreper (Council's permanent representatives' committee) agreed its position on a draft Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market (the DSM Directive). As we had been told, the main objective of the Directive is to modernise the copyright framework and adapt it to the digital age - but after many battles a compromise text was proposed, but one that would create a new right for press publishers for the online protection of their press publications, which addressed the value gap between rightsholders and online platforms, encouraged collaboration between online content sharing services and rightsholders and looked to create exceptions to copyright on text and data mining. So would the compromise quieten the critics? NO! No-one seemed to be happy, and unsurprisinglyup popped MEP Julia Reda[18](Pirate Party, Germany), who noted that the reform might require paying money (the now infamous Article 11 \"link tax\") by 'merely linking to a news site' and that concerns were \"being woefully ignored'. Reda went further and pointed out at the provision which will 'make platforms directly liable for copyright infringement unless they can show they've done everything in their power to stop this by, for example, deploying upload filters\" (the even more infamous Article 13) would \"be particularly harmful to small and mid-size companies making it nearly impossible for many of them to function in the EU.\" The 'Save your internet' campaign said it believed that adoption of Article 13 would 'impose widespread censorship' and Centrum Cyfrowe added that the 'ongoing reform could be a chance to make life easier, work more productive and fun - well - more fun! Instead, the reform misses the right perspective on the future'. Interestingly and also in June, the Commercial Court in Vienna (Handelsgericht) ruled that YouTube was not a neutral host and that it must prevent third parties from uploading infringing content. The preliminary decision of the Court related to a suit filed in 2014 by Austrian commercial TV channel Puls4 against YouTube, after Puls4 content was uploaded to the platform. YouTube argued that it provided a technical service and therefore fell under the scope of the 'Safe Harbour' exemption under the EU's E-Commerce Act, butthe Handelsgericht disagreed[19] saying that YouTube's active role in 'sorting, filtering and linking' content on its platform, 'in particular by creating tables of contents according to predefined categories' helped determine the surfing behaviour of its users. So not neutral at all. Speaking to German newspaper Der Standard, Puls4's CEO Markus Breitenecker explained that if YouTube 'leaves its neutral intermediary position and assumes an active role, which could provide it with a knowledge of or control over certain data, it cannot rely on the liability privilege in this respect. And that is exactly what has happened in this case.'Bethesda Softworks announced it was suing Warner Bros. and Fallout Shelterco-developer Behaviour Interactive over the recently releasedWestworld. Bethesda Softworks alleges that not only is the mobile game based on the HBO TV series it wasa 'blatant rip-off' ofFallout Shelter, but that it alsouses the same code as Fallout Shelter.Thelawsuit[20], filed on 21 June in Maryland District Court, is a civil action for breach of contract, copyright infringement, unfair competition, and misappropriation of trade secrets. Finally and its back to those EU reforms and as the lobbying intensified,actual creators of musicfrom across Europe called on MEPs to protect Europe's status as a global hub for culture saying that the tech giants must pay fairly for content hosted on their platforms.Robert Ashcroft, Chief Executive of PRS for Music, said: 'After three years of debate, one of the most controversial pieces of legislation ever to come before the European Parliament is about to go to the vote. This is about copyright and specifically about the rights of creators versus those of the Internet giants; it is about the way the Internet functions as a fair and efficient marketplace. It is a debate we must win if we want to secure our creative community into the next decade.'It was for the MEPs to address the balance:'Creators and news publishers must adapt to the world of the internet as it works today'rapporteur Axel Vossn MEP said in a European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs news release.'The Committee position aims to ensure that widely recognised and observed copyright principles apply to the online world, too.'       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-U47m5wEZEgg/V7biGnCFmHI/AAAAAAAAM9A/BikxzjGBhEk0e_FLiXbPWCVat4FvsC-KACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/cox_logo.pngAnd\">https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-U47m5wEZEgg/V7biGnCFmHI/AAAAAAAAM9A/BikxzjGBhEk0e_FLiXbPWCVat4FvsC-KACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/cox_logo.pngAnd</url> who was winning the battle for Copyright Directive reform? Well as July began, next blood went to the techies!MEPs in Strasbourg failed (by a small majority) to move the legislative process forwards, stalling the next step which was for the European Union Council, Commission and Parliament to negotiate a final text for passage into law. The vote was close, with 278 in favour, 318 against and 31 abstentions, but rejected the earlier Legal Committee decision to approve the draft law, which would now be sent back to the Parliament for further discussion. So more lobbying, more big names and more fun asinternet giants such as Google and Facebook, and free speech advocates and some consumer groups, with the backing of celebrities such as Stephen Fry and Tim Berners-Lee, took on the big content companies (and the small ones too!) who rolled out Sir Paul McCartney and James Blunt in a star studded carousel.But at that stage the cultural and creative sectors, and rights owners were a little disappointed and Anders Lassen, president of the European Grouping of Societies of Authors and Composers (who backed the rule changes) said the vote was a 'missed opportunity'.Whilst most eyes were focused on that vote, the Regional Court of Hamburg ruled in favour of German Collecting Society GEMA against the UseNeXT platform. According to GEMA, UseNeXT (together with its owner Aviteo) was liable for the infringements users who shared unlicensed music and movie content through the Usenet platform. The Court was of the opinion that under German law internet platforms may be liable where their business model promotes the uploading and distribution of infringing copyrighted material. The Court also considered that Aviteo would be liable for the infringement in this case on the basis that it provides tools allow users to find illegal music and movie files. Although at that stage the decision was not binding and was subject to appeal, Dr Tobias Holzm\u00fcller of GEMA said that the case was a great success for the songwriters and publishers and created 'an important precedent for claims for damages in the field of internet piracy' and that online platforms 'cannot hide behind legal principles.' But next up in Germany ...... the German Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) ruled in a case involving an illegal download of a game 'Dead Zombie' and decided that under the new German Telemedia Act, internet providers are not liable for copyright infringement via file sharing conducted by third parties on their network. Clarity and German precision -errrrrrm - NO![21]Over in the USA, the three major recorded music companies launched a new legal action against US internet service provider Cox Communications for copyright infringement. The move followed that earlier 2014 action from BMG, and again would ficus on what was said to be Cox's poor and ineffective approach to dealing with customers who used Cox's services to infringe their copyrights. Cox, the privately owned subsidiary of Cox Enterprises, is a major player in the US and provides digital cable television, and telecommunications services with more than 4 million subscribers and reliance on the 'safe harbor' defence in US law was critical.Elsewhere in July, the Ninth Circuit appeals court in the USdeclined to overturn[22]its controversial split decision in'Blurred Lines'with a motion for the case to be re-heard 'en banc' rejected by the court. We now had to wait and see if Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke would choose to take the controversy on to the US Supreme Court.Also over the pond, that'stamp' case[23]was decided - really on the basis of a monumental cock up by the United States Postal Service who for three years until2014 used an image of the Statue of Liberty for itsForeverStamp series that was not actually of the famous statue that towers over New York Harbor designed by French sculptor Frdric Auguste Bartholdi in 1886, but was actually Robert S. Davidson's replica Statue of Liberty. Davidson sued for, and won nearly $3.5 (2.6) million in royalties, plus interest. The USPS was made aware of the goof in 2013, but went on to print another 1.13 billion stamps with the replica's image (!!!). All in all, the Postal Service made some $70 million in revenue from sales of this Lady Liberty stamp - so actually the damages look rather reasonable in context!The summer was by now in full swing in the Northern hemisphere, but it was not that long ago back in February where the case concerning the NFL player Tom Brady saw the US Federal Court in New York rule that it is possible to infringe copyright by a simple act of embedding a tweet on a website. Judge Katherine Forrest said that her decision was 'high impact' - but the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals seemed to disagree and denied an immediate appeal in the case. In South Africa, a new hybrid' exception to copyright based on fair use was on the table - one which contained \"both a set of modern specific exceptions for various purposes', as well as an open general exception 'that can be used to assess any use not specifically authorized'. The new Bill aimed for the exceptions to be open to all works, uses and users. The provision was also said to be helpful for users by the addition of clarifications which reflected global trends in interpretation. Many scholars in South Africa gave their support, saying the proposal fitted well with the current digital environment and that the new provisions should become a model which would be adopted by other countries wishing to modernise their copyright laws. And finally, and staying on the same continent, Kenya joined the growing list of African nations where music collection societies have come under the spotlight - for all the wrong reason. The Kenyan High Court ordered the Music Copyright Society of Kenya (MCSK) to account for the money it has collected as royalties and licence fees since January 1st 2017 The order came on the back of evidence that payments from the MSK to songwritershad been decreasing for several years. The Kenya Copyright Board (KECOBO), the government organisation tasked with enforcing copyright in Kenya, had established a minimum standard of 70% of revenue to be given back to artists. However, MCSK's disbursement rates to musicianshad fallen to 58.9% of collected revenue[24]. Although MCSK was once Kenya's largest royalty-collecting body, KECOBO revoked its licence in February 2017 when MCSK failed to provide audited financial statements. The move came amidst allegations from local artistes over embezzlement of their royalties by MSCK. Justices RN Sitati, DS Majanja and TW Cherere gave the MSCKthirty days to comply[25]with the court's order. The power struggles between the Copyright Society of Nigeria (COSON) and the Nigerian Copyright Commission continued.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LYvA0oxPCrc/W3Q7RXTM8gI/AAAAAAAAOys/tBR8hEcxCtkGJBG7I4mIMef76Lxlpc-9wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/the-shape-of-water-poster-copy.jpgOn\">https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LYvA0oxPCrc/W3Q7RXTM8gI/AAAAAAAAOys/tBR8hEcxCtkGJBG7I4mIMef76Lxlpc-9wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/the-shape-of-water-poster-copy.jpgOn</url> to August! In what was its firstcopyright judgment of 2018 and the last before the summer break, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled, contrary to the Opinion of AG Sanchz-Bordona, that the unauthorized re-posting of a copyright work would be an act of communication to the public within Article 3(1) of theInfoSoc Directive.Renckhoff, C-161/17[26]concerned copyright litigation that a photographer brought in Germany against a school over the use, by one of the pupils, of copyright-protected material without authorisation. The case made its way up the German Federal Court of Justice, which decided to stay the proceedings and refer this question to the CJEU:Does the inclusion of a work \u2014 which is freely accessible to all internet users on a third-party website with the consent of the copyright holder \u2014 on a person's own publicly accessible website constitute a making available of that work to the public within the meaning of Article 3(1) of [Directive 2001/29] if the work is first copied onto a server and is uploaded from there to that person's own website?The court found that the reposting of protected content freely available on a third-party website is a new act of communication to the public and no analogy with linking to lawful and freely accessible content in aSvensson sense could be drawn. Why? well holding otherwise would mean that a copyright owner would lose any control over their work once this has been made available online the first time. This would basically amount to an undue exhaustion of the right of communication to the public, contrary to Article 3(3) of theInfoSoc Directive, and would also be in breach of the principle that economic rights are preventive in nature The fact that a work has been initially published online and made available with no restrictions would be irrelevant: holding otherwise would be akin to imposing formalities to the enjoyment and exercise of copyright, and so this would go against the prohibition in Article 5(2) of theBerne Convention.Ludlow Music picked upa legal costs bill of $352,000 after conceding earlier in the year that theWe Shall Overcomewas now 'public domain' in America. Judge Denise Cote has said that Ludlow should cover the opposing side's legal fees - despite the fact that Ludlow's defence wasn't 'objectively unreasonable'. And there was more from the USA: The Music Modernization Act, which was accelerating rapidly into law having quickly passed through both Houses unanimously in April, and then through the Senate Judiciary Committee, looked to be in some trouble after an objection by collection society SESAC and the Harry Fox Agency over how the planned new music licensing organisation would work. SESAC owners Blackstone persuaded Senator Rafael E. 'Ted' Cruz (R-Texas) to halt the bill's progress in the full Senate, and things looked tricky untila compromise[27]clarified that the new organization would only administer one particular kind of license - the blanket license - and Harry Fox and other organisations would still be able to control individually negotiated licenses. AUS court ruled that the plot of Oscar-winning fantasy filmThe Shape of Water was not copied from a 1969 play.Judge Percy Anderson dismissed the legal action that claimed Guillermo del Toro's film copied the story ofLet Me Hear You Whisperby Paul Zindel.The late playwright's son had sued del Toro, the Fox Searchlight studio and others (Zindel v. Fox Searchlight Pictures, Inc. et al, case number 2:18-cv-01435)claiming the two works were \"in many ways identical\". In his ruling the judge said they only shared \"a basic premise\".Del Toro's film, which won four Academy Awards including best picture, told the story of a mute cleaner who falls in love with an amphibious creature.David Zindel's suit claimed the filmbore a number of similarities[28]to his father's play, in which a cleaning lady goes to work in a laboratory where experiments are carried out on dolphins.Judge Anderson accepted that the plots were similar but ruled that the central concept was \"too general to be protected\". Eleonora posted a very interesting blog on another theme that has been picked up on a number of times on the 1709 Blog - the creation of 'works' by AI - artificial intelligence. Ifandroids dream of electric sheep - can they paint an original piciure of a lamb? Or compose original music? As an author? Referring back to the Naruto 'Monkey Selfie' case, Eleonora focussed on workEdmond de Belamywhich was created by an algorithm. Does that mean that Edmond de Belamy cannot be protected by copyright? It's all hereCan a Work of Art Created by AI be Protected by Copyright?[29]And finally,the International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) argued that South Africa's attempts to reform its 1978 copyright legislation could 'place South Africa out of compliance with the AGOA eligibility criteria regarding intellectual property' (and therefor lose trade benefits).Speaking before the US Trade Representative panel, IIPA explained that many provisions of the new Bill lacked clarity, created unnecessary burdens on rights holders, and/or fell short of needed reforms. \"Unfortunately, South Africa's proposed copyright amendments are inconsistent with a healthy, sustainable and fair digital marketplace for creators, both domestic and foreign, and run afoul of the AGOA eligibility criteria to provide adequate and effective protection and enforcement of intellectual property.'TechDirt took aim at IIPA, arguing instead that 'those drafting the text seem to have listened to the calls for intelligent fair use rights fit for the digital world. TechDirt had predicted that the fair use proposal will come under heavy attack from big industry players and their lobbyists - including the IIPA.\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tlYz1R5wIDE/XB0j9OgNwAI/AAAAAAAAO-o/8N-cP3SkiUsJLk7VPBlg7knotxyTCUdvACLcBGAs/s1600/Frigidaire%2BLogo%2B06.27.18.pngA\">https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-tlYz1R5wIDE/XB0j9OgNwAI/AAAAAAAAO-o/8N-cP3SkiUsJLk7VPBlg7knotxyTCUdvACLcBGAs/s1600/Frigidaire%2BLogo%2B06.27.18.pngA</url> chilly start to September for Electrolux with the the Review Board of the United States Copyright Office affirming their denial of registration of the'Frigidaire Stylized Logo'.The Frigidaire logo consists of the word Frigidaire in blue capital letters. Only the 'A' differs from the usual way to write the letter A, as it is drawn as a triangle filled with a smaller red triangle. But the FRIGID\u0394IRE logo is not original enough to be protected by copyright (and fails as a trade word mark too as it has become a generic word simply meaning refrigerator to the US public). Electrolux will have to rely on logo marks going forwards asThe Board found that the stylized 'A' is a mere 'trivial variation on a letter' and is thus not copyrightable, as it does not 'possess more than a de minimis quantum of creativity', quotingFeist. AndMEPs voted topass amended versions[30]of Articles 11 and 13 of theEuropean Copyright Directive in the European Parliament. The final vote was 438 in favour and 226 against. The Directive would now (finally!) go to trilogue with the European Union Council, Commission and Parliament to negotiate a final text for passage into law but the Directive will still faces a final vote - but remember, even after that it will need to be implemented by individual EU member states, who could very well vary significantly in how they choose to interpret the Directive's text. However, Robert Ashcroft, Chief Executive of PRS for Music, said: \"The European Parliament today took a bold step forward to ensure a functioning and sustainable digital single market for creative content. \" Julia Reda of the Pirate Party described the outcome of the vote as 'catastrophic.' Attempts to update copyright law in the United States inched ever closer on the news that the all singing all dancing and now expanded Music Modernization Act(in effect three bills in one) went to Congress. and the Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell brought it to a vote on 18 September, where it passed unanimously.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m3vt5s1STAk/XCCHm5uEe2I/AAAAAAAAO_A/WCJwEezwCn00h9VcwjRqlM1FWJ8AGJDUwCLcBGAs/s1600/Senza%2Btitolo.png\">https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-m3vt5s1STAk/XCCHm5uEe2I/AAAAAAAAO_A/WCJwEezwCn00h9VcwjRqlM1FWJ8AGJDUwCLcBGAs/s1600/Senza%2Btitolo.png</url> We began October with the news thatSouth African photographer Graeme Williams was considering legal action after he discovered that a 'whited-out' version of one of his famous photographs had been exhibited during the Johannesburg Art Fair by the Goodman Gallery. The picture was based on the iconic shot of a group of children taunting white policemen a few weeks after the release from prison of Nelson Mandela, kicking up their legs in a playful adaptation of the toyi-toyi, the South African liberation movement march. And where did this new image come from? Well from Hank Willis Thomas, an appropriation artist who uses images from advertising campaigns or civil rights protests which are then 'transformed - in this case the original 1991 colour picture was transformed into a black and white version - without asking for permission.Thomasdefendedhis actions,saying thephotographertook the picturewithout any authorisation from the people depicted,and that the newartwork will challenge the strict defines of copyright law. Remembering the ongoing debate sparked byCariou v Prince[31],was this latest instance of transformation enough to constitute 'fair use' or 'fair dealing, or was this plagiarism? In the US of A, Marie told us that the Second Circuit had reached a decision in another case about photography, and this one concerning American Football,Spinelli v. National Football League[32], a 2013 complaint by seven sports photographers against Associated Press (AP) and the National Football League (NFL) which claimed that AP had granted the NFL a royalty-free license of their images without their permission. In a 2012 agreement the snappers had granted AP a 'perpetual, irrevocable transferable worldwide right and license to reproduce, edit, translate the caption of, prepare derivative works of, publicly perform, publicly display, load into computer memory, cache, store and otherwise use' their works along with the right to \"transfer or sublicense these rights to other entities\" and earned royalties for the use of their photos - but did the grant of rights far enough extend to allow AP to grant royalty-free licenses to the NFL? The Second Circuit found the contract was 'ambiguous' and recognised that it could be interpreted as limiting the ways AP could sublicense the Plaintiffs' photographs to third parties. The court remanded the case to the lower court. InCanada, another call for reform, and this from rock star (turned photographer !) Bryan Adams who wanted to change just ONE word in the Canadian Copyright Act so authors can reclaim their copyrights after 25 years, even when they have been assigned away to third parties, with Adams arguing that many artists sign away their copyright as young entrants to an industry which can and will exploit them, and they are not in a position to push back against the record companies and music publishers who provide them with their first contracts. So the change in Canada? A new right of reversion[33]25 years after assignment - rather than 25 years after the death of the author. One word! In the UK Ben reported that the UK's Department for Business, Energy ...dustrial Strategy had published it's long awaited paper which offered guidance on what might happen with copyright if (when) the UK leaves the European Union with a 'no deal' Brexit outcome (an increasingly likely scenario). The CopyKat told usthat the American Chemical Society and Elsevier were again suing the academic 'networking site' ResearchGate in an another attempt to block the website from posting copyrighted research papers. President Donald Trump signed theMusic Modernization Actinto US law and the President welcomed various artists to the White House for a signing ceremony, including Kid Rock, Kanye West, Beach Boys singer Mike Love and country singer Craig Morgan. On this Blog,Akshat Agrawal asked[34]wouldthe same outcome possible in India, arguing infavour of a retrospective application of the 2012 amendment to s39 of the Indian Copyright Act, and asked would this development bedesirable in other jurisdictions, in particular with regard to the Indian context? In a case referred from the German Federal Court (BGH), AG Szpunaradvised the CJEU to rule that copyright cannot subsist in military report[35] in an important fundamental rights case (the 'Afghanistan Papers' case,Funke Medien NRW GmbH v Federal Republic of Germany, C-469/17) which asked whether copyright protection can be trumped by the need to safeguard freedom of the press and freedom of information, and whether fundamental rights may be directly invoked to prevent enforcement of copyright.Back to transformative art, with Marie posting an excellent piece titled \"Is Richard Prince in a Jam?[36]\" with an update on the two cases (currently) faced by the appropriation artist, Eric McNatt v. Richard Prince et al.,(1:16-cv-08896) andGraham v. Princeet al., (1:15-cv-10160) and Prince's ongoing justification for his 'art'.The CJEU backed the opinion ofAdvocate General Maciej Szpunar in a German case that pitted a defendant (Michael Strotzer) who claimed he could not be liable for online infringement because he and his parents used the same internet connection, and the need to balance the (here) conflicting rights of a right to family life against the right of a copyright owner to protect their rights. The conclusion? The court have upheld the AG's opinion that \"The right to respect for family life, recognised in Article seven of the Charter Of Fundamental Rights of the EU, cannot be interpreted in such a way as to deprive right holders of any real possibility of protecting their right to IP\". And finally, planned copyright law reforms inSouth Africa[37], the USA, Japan[38] andEurope[39]all faced criticism with headlines that included\"Shambolic Copyright Amendment Bill will favour Google and its ilk\" and \"What's Next For Europe's Internet Censorship Plan?\"and with the American Law Institute's 'Restatement of Copyright Law' facing a claim that theauthors were \"notoriously anti-creator copyleft irritators\".       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lsoHT_JgaCA/XCCNCvHP7BI/AAAAAAAAO_M/em2HYEomdnk-FgSKOhygt_TUe7jvI860wCLcBGAs/s1600/witchescheese.pngNovember\">https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lsoHT_JgaCA/XCCNCvHP7BI/AAAAAAAAO_M/em2HYEomdnk-FgSKOhygt_TUe7jvI860wCLcBGAs/s1600/witchescheese.pngNovember</url> is upon us!And Ben opened with the big tasty decision from the CJEU whichrejected a controversial attempt to use copyright law to protect the distinct taste of a food product, in this case a Dutch cheese. The court explained that taste is too subjective to allow a work to be uniquely identified, even using science, and so taste cannot be protected,concurring with the Advocate General's opinion that an artistic work must be capable of being seen and heard. It was the first time the court had been asked to decide whether copyright applies to taste as an artistic work and one which is not defined by the InfoSec Directive, holding thatthat the taste of a food product is not eligible for copyright protection and the taste of a food product cannot be classified as a 'work'. In C-310/17[40]Levola Hengelo BV v Smilde Foods BV[41]the Court made it clear that in order to be protected by copyright under the Directive, the taste of a food product must be capable of being classified as a 'work' within the meaning of the Directive. Classification as a 'work' requires (a) that the subject matter concerned is an original intellectual creation and(b) there must be an 'expression' of that original intellectual creation. Elsewhere, six of the eleven 'Trans Pacific Partnership\" member states ratified the Trans Pacific Partnership 11 Agreement. The agreement will go into effect on December 30th 2018. The amendment of Japan's copyright law will be effective on the same day, and the statutory term will be extended to life + 70 years from January 2019, including for those creators whose copyrights would have expired on December 31, even though the United States government has withdrawn from the TPP agreement (at least for now). What is interesting is how the \"war extension\" in copyright law might (or might not) be accommodated. An attempt by the NFL to re-open theSpinellilitigation was rejected by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which refused to re-hear the case 'en banc', andNew Zealand's Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, Hon Kris Faafoi, released an issues paper marking the first stage of public consultation on changes to the Copyright Act 1994, saying all Kiwis should consider taking part. 'Copyright affects all New Zealanders. We create copyright works when we take a photograph, record a video, or write an email, and we use copyright works by watching a sports broadcast, streaming a movie, listening to music, or reading a book' said the minister. News broke that agroup of Satanists, who had sued Netflix and Warner Bros for $50 million (38 million) in a copyright row over the TV drama seriesSabrina,had \"amicably\" settled the lawsuit. The Satanic Temple claimed the entertainment giants had copied its depiction of goat-headed deity Baphomet in \"The Chilling Adventures Of Sabrina\". The only publicly released terms were that \"The unique elements of the Satanic Temple's Baphomet statue have been acknowledged in the credits of episodes which have already been filmed.\" And finally,Lyor Cohen became the latest YouTube executive to take aim at the planned reforms to EU Copyright Law, and in particular Article 13. An ex-record label man himself, Cohen is now YouTube's global head of music and he posted a warning about the new Copyright Directive saying 'Let me be clear: we understand and support the intent of Article 13. We need effective ways for copyright holders to protect their content' adding 'But we believe that the current proposal will create severe unintended consequences for the whole industry. We still have a couple of weeks to work together towards a better final version of the law. The music industry should really pay attention to these unintended consequences - the system that largely contributes to their success is at risk of major change in the European Union', opining that \"Remixes and covers, tutorials, fan tributes, parodies\" were all at risk, and that \"these are such powerful promotional tools for the industry\".      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nE4R5Z5aKCc/WoFm3w9lP5I/AAAAAAAAOj0/38mqpzTi7fohLxpytkh-VD7XyOK6ONm5gCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/CLASSICS%2BAct.jpegDecember\">https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nE4R5Z5aKCc/WoFm3w9lP5I/AAAAAAAAOj0/38mqpzTi7fohLxpytkh-VD7XyOK6ONm5gCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/CLASSICS%2BAct.jpegDecember</url> began with the news that the Board of CISAC (the International Confederation of Societies of Authors and Composers) has decided to implement itssanctions process[42]against SGAE, which could result in the Spanish collection society's expulsion. SGAE (Sociedad General de Autores y Editores) has been repeatedly in the news since June 2017, when police raided its offices in search of documentation relating to an alleged scam dubbed 'the Wheel' ('la Rueda'), in which a small number of SGAE members and TV executives allegedly conspired to create 'low-quality music' - often reworked versions of songs in the public domain - to be broadcast on late-night TV, generating performance royalties collected by SGAE. Google revealed it had received 3.8 billion URL take-down[43] requests in 2018, with three organisations from the music sector topping the list (The UK's BPI, APDIF Mexico and APDIF Brasil). As Christmas approached, the 'Blurred Lines' song-theft saga finally came an end after thedeadline passed[44]for Pharrell Williams and Robin Thicke to take the case to US Supreme Court, with the Marvin Gaye estate now entitled to receive 50% of any future royalties generated by the song.And whilst the MMA will make important changes going forwards in the USA,Techcrunch was one of many online publications[45]reporting that Spotify has settled the $1.6 billion lawsuit filed by music publisher Wixen Music Publishing in December 2017. The publisher, which represented artists including Tom Petty, Stevie Nicks and Neil Young, alleged copyright infringement, saying that Spotify had used its catalogue without a proper license and had not obtained either a direct or a compulsory mechanical license.The financial terms of the settlement were not disclosed but Spotify and Wixen issued a joint statement saying 'The conclusion of that litigation is a part of a broader business partnership between the parties, which fairly and reasonably resolves the legal claims asserted by Wixen Music Publishing relating to past licensing of Wixen's catalog and establishes a mutually-advantageous relationship for the future.' At the same time the United States Copyright Office formally kicked off the process[46] to establish the MMA's Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) by putting out a request for information to help inform its choice for designating both the members of the MLC and Digital Licensee Coordinator (DLC).The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reached its decision in Capitol Records, LLC v. ReDigi Inc., No. 16-2321, confirming thatonline music service ReDigi infringed Capitol Records' copyrights[47] by allowing users to resell legally purchased iTunes MP3 files with a decision[48] thatdrove a stake through the heart of the business of re-marketing 'second hand' digital files[49].The ever busyAG Szpunar issued his opinion for the European Union's Court Of Justice in the long running legal battle between Kraftwerk and rapper Moses Pelham. concluding that using a two second sample of a sound recording without permission does indeed constitute copyright infringement saying \"Artists must be particularly aware of the limits and restrictions that life imposes on creative freedom where they concern the rights and fundamental freedoms of others, in particular their right to property, including intellectual property. In such cases, the balancing of different rights and interests is a particularly complex exercise and there is rarely a 'one size fits all' solution\". Next, it's back to the planned reforms to EU Copyright law and in particular that pesky Article 13 which if implemented as it stands would mean user upload platforms might be liable for infringements by their users in a change to safe harbour provisions. In response to 'tech' lobbying, a consortium of companies and trade groups speaking for the copyright industriespublished an open letter[50]expressing concerns about any Article 13 compromise saying \"As we reach the very final stages of this process, and negotiators seek to finalise a compromise text, we urge you to remember that the overall aim of the original European Commission proposal was to correct the distortion of the digital market place caused by user-upload content services, which enable users to upload content onto their sites and then profit from the availability of creative content without returning fair revenues to rightsholders, who create and invest in such content\" and that only the reforms to safe harbour restrictions outlined in existing drafts of the directive will \"meaningfully address\" this issue. In the US, America's Computer and Communications Industry Association had the reverse approach when responding to a call for submissions by the US Trade Representative on the latest round of talks about a possible trade agreement between the US and the EU, criticising Article 13 saying \"The proposed copyright directive disrupts settled law protecting [internet] intermediaries by weakening established protections ... and by imposing an unworkable filtering mandate on hosting providers that would require automated 'notice-and-stay-down' for a wide variety of copyrighted works. If adopted, the directive would dramatically weaken these long-standing liability protections which suggests that most modern service providers may be ineligible for its protections\". To end the year[51]: works first published in the USA in 1923 including \"The Great American Novel\" by William Carlos Williams, Cecil B. DeMille's original version of \"The 10 Commandments\" and one of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot novels will fall into the public domain[52];Beijing's newly established internet court dismissed the ByteDance-backed Douyin's copyright lawsuit against Baidu, a dispute that marked the first time a Chinese court has recognized short videos under the country's copyright laws and accepted blockchain evidence[53];New Zealand's Supreme Court agreed to hear the final MegaUpload extradition appealby Kim Dotcom and the other former big wigs at the one-time file-transfer platform who face extradition to the US to face charges of criminal copyright infringement.And finally (phew) the fall out from the Cox case continued with amagistrate judge in the US advising[54] that internet service provider Grande Communications should be denied safe habour protection in its legal battle with the Recording Industry Association Of America, noting that simply having a policy to deal with repeat infringers was not enough, it had to be effective, and that herethe ISP \"affirmatively decided in 2010 that it would not enforce the policy at all, and that it would not terminate any customer's account regardless of how many notices of infringement that customer accumulated\". Sadly we have lost some important creative talent this year. In music,Arethra Franklin,Pete Shelly (the Buzzcocks),Avicii,Hugh Masekela,Dolores O'Riordan (the Cranberries), Yvonne Staples, Arun Bhaduri, Jabulani \"HHP\" Tsambo and'Fast' Eddie Clark (Motorhead)were just some of those who passed. Film, TV and theatre lost a wealth of talent including the actors Sondra Locke,Geetha Salam,Yuriko Hoshi,Burt Reynolds, Peter Wyngarde, Reg E. Cathey, Yukiji Asaoka, John Mahoney, Penny Marshall, Eli Ajaz and Margot Kidder,along with the film directorsBernardo Bertolucci, Milos Forman,Augusto FernandesandNicolas Roeg. We lost'Star Wars' producer Gary Kurtz,writer and producer Steven Bochco, chef and TV presenter Anthony Bourdain,master magician Ricky Jay, composer Galt McDermot, the Marvel comic book legend Stan Lee, claymation artist Will Vinton, the graphic artist Bill Gold, Atari co-founder Ted Dabney, writerRobin Leach,fashion designer Kate Spade,screenwriterWilliam Goldman, \"Star Trek\" writerHarlan Ellison, animatorStephen Hillenburgandplaywright Neil Simon. So all we can do is wish you a happy and healthy 2019, and that you 'live long and prosper'. .      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1olWyjrt7lk/TzJHM0gekuI/AAAAAAAAAs8/gPtrSp43nyENN13R3ZGxP8--7Enw1gIYQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/eff1.jpghttps://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dgeOR8BT0Cs/Vnfzp_R3rUI/AAAAAAAAMH0/_FmWQESB58sGyh9vggin-Si8eOmNIp77QCPcB/s1600/Kataward.jpgYou\">https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1olWyjrt7lk/TzJHM0gekuI/AAAAAAAAAs8/gPtrSp43nyENN13R3ZGxP8--7Enw1gIYQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/eff1.jpghttps://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dgeOR8BT0Cs/Vnfzp_R3rUI/AAAAAAAAMH0/_FmWQESB58sGyh9vggin-Si8eOmNIp77QCPcB/s1600/Kataward.jpgYou</url> can catch up with Eleonora's excellent and well observed2018 Copyright Awards[55]on the IPKat here[56]- and some are mentioned above (thank goodness!!).The EFF also has a number ofreviews[57]of 2018, which you can find here[58]and here[59]and if the GDPR is your 'thang' then also here[60].

But that isn't the complete picture.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> To be clear, those tech company-instigated concerns are all extremely important issues and will likely impact not just the tech world, but our overall society for many years to come. However, there were also quite a few positive and forward-looking developments that came from the tech industry this year as it's struggled through its awkward adolescent stage and into full adulthood.</p><p> For one, 2018 was the year when the idea of voice computing went mainstream. Thanks to the ongoing success of products like Amazon's Alexa-powered Echo line and the Google Assistant-driven Google Home series, a large percentage of US homes now have an entirely new way to interact with the internet and information in general. While there are certainly growing pains to overcome and capabilities to expand, there's no doubt that we'll soon look backward to 2018 as the real beginning of an entirely new way of interacting with the digital world in a more invisible, more science-fiction-like \"ambient computing\" type of manner.</p><p> More: Tech in 2019: 5G, AI, 8K \u2013 the year ahead looks like an alphabet soup of progress</p><p> More: You're going to love 5G, but there are a few things you need to know first</p><p> More: From autonomous cars to foldable phones, 2019 looks promising for 5G wireless technology</p><p> From AI to augmented reality</p><p> The past year also saw computing and digital technology take on new forms. Consider the latest iteration of Sony's somewhat expensive (yet still sold out of its initial run) Aibo robotic dog. Leveraging the latest artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, a gaggle of sensors, and important refinements in personal robotics technologies, Aibo previews a world of robotic companions. More importantly, it provides a positive perspective on how we might be able to have more \"human\" interactions with technology-based products in the future.</p><p> And 2018 was also the year, however, when technologies that seemed unstoppable started to hit a wall \u2014 at least for the near term. After years of growth, the worldwide smartphone market saw sales declines \u2014 in no small part because, well, they've become boring. Sure, they're amazing devices that all we spend way too much time on, but at this point, they pretty much all look (and dare I say function) the same. Thankfully, the expected launch of foldable screens and 5G networks promises to spice things up in the smartphone market in 2019.</p><p> Similarly, despite years of hype, the market for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) products has yet to go mainstream. Yes, this year saw the debut of the widely anticipated Magic Leap headset, but its inauspicious launch as a development platform has yet to make even the tiniest ripple in the market. Plus, the last few months have seen the rapid declines of several noteworthy startups in the field including Meta, ODG, Blippar and others. Most companies involved aren't yet giving up on AR/VR devices, but there's certainly been a resetting of expectations and refocusing on more niche opportunities.</p><p> More: These vehicles will be killed in 2019: Say goodbye to Chevrolet, Ford, Nissan cars</p><p> Tech on the roadways</p><p> In the automotive world, 2018 saw some tremendous technology advancements \u2014 most consumers are now as interested, if not more interested, in the tech features that come in a car as they are in traditional performance metrics. Unfortunately, these tech advances were largely offset by the deeply disturbing fact that early efforts at autonomous driving have been directly and indirectly involved in the deaths of civilians over the past year.</p><p> Life-and-death consequences are a harsh new reality for the tech world and there's no question that it's going to take a long time before most consumers completely trust autonomous driving efforts. Thankfully, excellent progress is being made on more practical safety advances in technology-driven assisted driving features, such as automatic braking and drowsiness monitoring, and we should see a lot more in 2019.</p><p> Through a technology business lens, 2018 saw several surprising developments. First, after years of incredible growth, big tech leaders saw their stock prices take dramatic hits. The FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) stocks, in particular, are now all down over 20% for the year. In addition, Apple was recently dethroned as the most valuable company in the world \u2014 after several years on top \u2014 replaced by another, long-established tech giant, Microsoft. In part, this is indicative of a sharper focus on the growth potential of the more business-to-business focused tech strategy that Microsoft has, but it's also an acknowledgment that Microsoft's capabilities have successfully expanded into a much broader range of tech-based offerings, including cloud computing, than it ever has before.</p><p> All told, 2018 was both a remarkable and tumultuous year for the tech industry that set the stage for what promises to be an even more incredible year in 2019. Between the growing power and influence of AI, the widespread launch of 5G, and the inevitable movements towards meaningful national regulation on certain aspects of tech industry, 2019 is already shaping up to be the most highly anticipated year for tech industry observers in quite some time.</p><p> Bob O'Donnell is the president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research, a market research and consulting firm that provides strategic consulting and market research services to the technology industry and professional financial community.

But that isn't the complete picture.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> To be clear, those tech company-instigated concerns are all extremely important issues and will likely impact not just the tech world, but our overall society for many years to come. However, there were also quite a few positive and forward-looking developments that came from the tech industry this year as it's struggled through its awkward adolescent stage and into full adulthood.</p><p> For one, 2018 was the year when the idea of voice computing went mainstream. Thanks to the ongoing success of products like Amazon's Alexa-powered Echo line and the Google Assistant-driven Google Home series, a large percentage of US homes now have an entirely new way to interact with the internet and information in general. While there are certainly growing pains to overcome and capabilities to expand, there's no doubt that we'll soon look backward to 2018 as the real beginning of an entirely new way of interacting with the digital world in a more invisible, more science-fiction-like \"ambient computing\" type of manner.</p><p> More: Tech in 2019: 5G, AI, 8K \u2013 the year ahead looks like an alphabet soup of progress</p><p> More: You're going to love 5G, but there are a few things you need to know first</p><p> More: From autonomous cars to foldable phones, 2019 looks promising for 5G wireless technology</p><p> From AI to augmented reality</p><p> The past year also saw computing and digital technology take on new forms. Consider the latest iteration of Sony's somewhat expensive (yet still sold out of its initial run) Aibo robotic dog. Leveraging the latest artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, a gaggle of sensors, and important refinements in personal robotics technologies, Aibo previews a world of robotic companions. More importantly, it provides a positive perspective on how we might be able to have more \"human\" interactions with technology-based products in the future.</p><p> And 2018 was also the year, however, when technologies that seemed unstoppable started to hit a wall \u2014 at least for the near term. After years of growth, the worldwide smartphone market saw sales declines \u2014 in no small part because, well, they've become boring. Sure, they're amazing devices that all we spend way too much time on, but at this point, they pretty much all look (and dare I say function) the same. Thankfully, the expected launch of foldable screens and 5G networks promises to spice things up in the smartphone market in 2019.</p><p> Similarly, despite years of hype, the market for virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) products has yet to go mainstream. Yes, this year saw the debut of the widely anticipated Magic Leap headset, but its inauspicious launch as a development platform has yet to make even the tiniest ripple in the market. Plus, the last few months have seen the rapid declines of several noteworthy startups in the field including Meta, ODG, Blippar and others. Most companies involved aren't yet giving up on AR/VR devices, but there's certainly been a resetting of expectations and refocusing on more niche opportunities.</p><p> More: These vehicles will be killed in 2019: Say goodbye to Chevrolet, Ford, Nissan cars</p><p> Tech on the roadways</p><p> In the automotive world, 2018 saw some tremendous technology advancements \u2014 most consumers are now as interested, if not more interested, in the tech features that come in a car as they are in traditional performance metrics. Unfortunately, these tech advances were largely offset by the deeply disturbing fact that early efforts at autonomous driving have been directly and indirectly involved in the deaths of civilians over the past year.</p><p> Life-and-death consequences are a harsh new reality for the tech world and there's no question that it's going to take a long time before most consumers completely trust autonomous driving efforts. Thankfully, excellent progress is being made on more practical safety advances in technology-driven assisted driving features, such as automatic braking and drowsiness monitoring, and we should see a lot more in 2019.</p><p> Through a technology business lens, 2018 saw several surprising developments. First, after years of incredible growth, big tech leaders saw their stock prices take dramatic hits. The FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) stocks, in particular, are now all down over 20% for the year. In addition, Apple was recently dethroned as the most valuable company in the world \u2014 after several years on top \u2014 replaced by another, long-established tech giant, Microsoft. In part, this is indicative of a sharper focus on the growth potential of the more business-to-business focused tech strategy that Microsoft has, but it's also an acknowledgment that Microsoft's capabilities have successfully expanded into a much broader range of tech-based offerings, including cloud computing, than it ever has before.</p><p> All told, 2018 was both a remarkable and tumultuous year for the tech industry that set the stage for what promises to be an even more incredible year in 2019. Between the growing power and influence of AI, the widespread launch of 5G, and the inevitable movements towards meaningful national regulation on certain aspects of tech industry, 2019 is already shaping up to be the most highly anticipated year for tech industry observers in quite some time.</p><p> Bob O'Donnell is the president and chief analyst of TECHnalysis Research, a market research and consulting firm that provides strategic consulting and market research services to the technology industry and professional financial community.

In the first, Silicon Valley firms make all the running as they create new markets and eviscerate weak firms in sleepy industries. This has been the story until now. Tech firms have captured 42% of the rise in the value of America's stockmarket since 2014 as investors forecast they will win an ever-bigger share of corporate profits. A new, terrifying phrase has entered the lexicon of business jargon: being \"Amazoned\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The second phase favours the incumbents, Ms Rometty believes, and is starting about now. They summon the will to adapt, innovate to create new, digital, products and increase efficiency. The schema is plainly self-serving. IBM is itself fighting for survival against cloud-based tech rivals and most of its clients are conventional firms. Yet she is correct that incumbents in many industries are at last getting their acts together on technology.</p><p>Enough time has elapsed for even the dopiest to see the threat. It is 11 years since Netflix began streaming video and five since Tesla unveiled the Model S. The evisceration by tech firms of some mid-sized businesses, such as department-store retail, has concentrated minds. Lagging share prices have helped. In 2017 Ford fired its boss, Mark Fields, despite near-record profits. Its board concluded he was complacent about technological change.</p><p>Taking a sample of America's 20 most valuable non-tech firms, 14 now have a digital dimension to their strategies. Some blue-chip firms are mixing fashionable cocktails of e-commerce, big data and artificial-intelligence (AI) initiatives. But others are making comprehensive, multi-billion-dollar bets. General Motors is developing a suite of electric and autonomous vehicles. Walmart is in the midst of a massive online shopping push. Investors view such initiatives as central to these firms' prospects.</p><p>A round of mergers and acquisitions has kicked off as firms respond to the threat from Silicon Valley. On December 14th Walt Disney said it would spend $66bn buying most of 21st Century Fox. One motivation for the deal is to counter the menace of streaming video services, most notably those of Netflix and Amazon. In 2019 Disney will stop distributing new films through Netflix and launch its own streaming services. On December 12th Westfield and Unibail, a pair of huge operators of shopping malls, joined forces with two main aims: to bulk up in response to e-commerce and to build a global brand with a digital presence.</p><p>Incumbents have lots going for them. They own 80% of the commercial world's data, as Ms Rometty has noted. If AI is set to change civilisation by using data to make better decisions, most of the historical data-sets about, say, jet-engine performance or clothing supply chains belong to established firms, beyond the reach of Amazon and Facebook. Incumbents have vast resources: among S&amp;P 500 firms, their total cashflow is four times that of tech firms' and 18 times what venture capitalists invest each year.</p><p>Established giants also enjoy barriers to entry such as strong brands and lobbying skills, the latter being especially crucial in America's money-driven political system. Also on December 14th, American regulators abolished \"net neutrality\" rules requiring telecoms carriers to treat all internet traffic equally\u2014a victory for conventional telecoms and cable firms. Silicon Valley faces a global regulatory \"techlash\" over issues such as privacy and tax.</p><p>A typical approach by conventional firms is a blend of bolt-on acquisitions of startups and organic investment in new technologies. GM has invested in Lyft, a ride-sharing firm, and developed electric engines. On December 13th, Target, which operates discount stores, bought Shipt, a online-delivery platform. Walmart has bought Jet.com, an e-commerce firm. Western banks have been busy buying fintech firms, although the cleverest incumbents in finance are Asian. Ping An, a Chinese insurance firm, has 265m users for its app. DBS, South-East Asia's biggest lender, has set up online banks in both India and Indonesia.</p><p>A few firms are opting for huge deals. On December 3rd CVS, a drugstore and health-care benefits manager, said it would pay $77bn for Aetna, a health-insurance company. The idea is to bulk up and lock in customers before Amazon enters the business of selling medicines. Within the tech industry, IBM is not the only mature firm trying to adapt. In March Intel bought Mobileye for $15bn\u2014it specialises in chips and software for driverless cars.</p><p>Conventional wisdom says incumbent firms are timid about technological change, scared to cannibalise profits and trapped in an unimaginative mindset. In 1997 Clayton Christensen laid out this view in \"The Innovator's Dilemma\". Kodak, which folded after failing to see that camera film would become obsolete, is the classic example. Yet for every Kodak there is a Marconi, that goes too far, too fast. Formerly called GEC, it was Britain's largest industrial firm in the 1990s but collapsed after wrecking its balance-sheet with acquisitions of fashionable but flaky tech firms in 1999.</p><p>A few firms have already been indisciplined. John Flannery, General Electric's new boss, has axed some digital projects after judging them extravagant. But no one is yet making existential wagers. Taking a sample of eight incumbents, on average their digital initiatives are worth 14% of the size of the firm (using a range of metrics, including sales, investment and market value). So for example, e-commerce eats up only a fifth of Walmart's investment budget. Even Disney-Fox's existing initiatives are small. Hulu, a streaming service that it will control, makes losses equivalent to less than a tenth of its parents' annual spending on content.</p><p>Conventional firms' digital bets will only grow larger, as more bosses note the rising share prices of pioneers such as Walmart and GM. Overall this makes sense, even if plenty of companies make an utter hash of things. For large incumbents, in 2018 digital strategy will stop being about trendy experiments and start being a matter of life and death.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-ME6UPG5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RB9-SJT1-JBKN-B3S5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1034\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

There was a huge feeling of accomplishment. And it was emotional to be standing among many of the people who had worked to get us there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  It was a bit disappointing to open a bit down from the I.P.O. price, in large part because you want to see the new buyers of the stock benefit. You want them to be proud shareholders who feel lucky to be invested. It's unfortunate they weren't rewarded in the short term.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  I felt relief it was done, joy for what an amazing company Uber had become, gratitude for the whole Uber team. It was an important financing, providing cash for Uber to fund their still-big plans.</p><p>Uber's I.P.O. did affect the other unicorn I.P.O.s this year. It was a reminder to all: Public market investors care about good unit economics and a path to profitability.</p><p>  As told to ERIN GRIFFITH</p><p>  Antitrust regulators target Big Tech</p><p>  May 31, 2019</p><p>  News breaks that the Department of Justice is scrutinizing Google and whether it has used its power in anticompetitive ways, foreshadowing antitrust investigations against Big Tech companies by the Federal Trade Commission, dozens of states and Congress.</p><p>  Tim Wu, a Columbia University law professor: We're witnessing the end of the long antitrust winter. After years of discussing and agonizing and asking whether Big Tech has gotten too powerful, things reached a breaking point this year.</p><p>  You saw the first official action by federal and state agencies. And the beginning of a national conversation, which is what antitrust does at its best, as to whether Big Tech is too powerful.</p><p>  There are many historical analogies. Antitrust is one way in which America has conversations about economic power and the size of individual companies. The original conversation on this topic surrounded Standard Oil in the 1870s through the 1890s, and that led to the passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act.</p><p>  The first great trustbusting exercise, which was roughly the first 15 years of the 20th century, was much more extensive than what we're talking about now. The Gilded Age concern was that nearly every industry had been monopolized. They went after almost every monopoly in the country, and they broke up many of them.</p><p>  Today, there is a lot of market concentration in industries generally. So why focus on Big Tech in particular?</p><p>  I think there's two things. First of all, they're very visible monopolies and dominant firms. You touch and feel and sense them every day. And second, just like Standard Oil, there's a sense they have a power beyond our imagination and beyond our tolerance.</p><p>  It comes not just from market power, but a power over the distribution of information. And from that, some apparent power over elections and how elections are contested. They're places where people share information, but also political advertising platforms. They know more about you than anyone, including the federal government.</p><p>  So they have a particularly personal kind of power that I think people feel very sensitive to. It's almost unprecedented other than in totalitarian societies.</p><p>  Mr. Wu works on a joint proposal with Scott Hemphill of New York University and Chris Hughes, a co-founder of Facebook, to break up the social network. They present it to regulators.</p><p>  I've always felt that Facebook's acquisitions of its main competitors were exceptionally vulnerable to an antitrust challenge. Standard Oil was broken up because of its campaign to acquire its competitors. So if we wanted to revitalize the law, it struck me that easiest place to start was with Facebook.</p><p>  The barriers to revitalizing antitrust are inertia and old habits and some degree of fear on the part of government that it will overextend itself. It was not exactly routine, but it was normal for the government to break up concentrated companies for much of its history.</p><p>  As told to STEVE LOHR</p><p>Google reaches 'quantum supremacy'</p><p>  June 13, 2019</p><p>  The company achieves a technological feat that could allow new kinds of computers to do calculations at speeds that are inconceivable with conventional equipment.</p><p>  Hartmut Neven, founder of Google's quantum computing lab: An abacus and a modern digital computer are the same kind of machine. If you have a computational task -- let's say multiplying -- they both solve the task with the same steps.</p><p>  A quantum computer is a different beast. It can solve certain tasks with fewer steps -- sometimes exponentially fewer steps.</p><p>  Sergio Boixo, Google quantum computing researcher: We thought we had achieved quantum supremacy with a data set measured on April 22. The calibration had been steadily improving.</p><p>  During May, we were performing extensive simulations to check the data. On May 31, a Friday, we got the first results. I was quite dismayed.</p><p>  By June 13, the preliminary checks looked better than in any previous experiment, so at that point we were pretty sure that we had achieved quantum supremacy. But we couldn't really rest until we got that email confirming we had new experimental data.</p><p>  We got an email from a researcher in the quantum lab at 2 p.m. I was elated.</p><p>  I thought of the time when I first learned about quantum computing in college. I was mesmerized by the possibility that there existed a more efficient way to do computations than what humanity had been doing for more than 2,000 years, since the invention of the abacus. At the time, it was only a theoretical possibility. I thought I wouldn't see it realized in my lifetime.</p><p>  As told to CADE METZ</p><p>  Mark Zuckerberg says Facebook won't fact-check political ads</p><p>  Oct. 17, 2019</p><p>  In a speech at Georgetown University, Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, says his social network stands for free expression and that he will not fact-check for truth in political ads. Mo Elleithee of Georgetown interviews Mr. Zuckerberg after the speech.</p><p>  Mr. Zuckerberg: Over the last few years, we've had to deal with all of these different issues around content and voice, and I realized I never wrote out a full articulation of how I think about this stuff.</p><p>  Mr. Elleithee, founding executive director of the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service: We were interested in doing a series of conversations on democracy in the digital age. We began soft outreach, and in the course of conversations with Facebook, we got a call from them saying, ''We may have something that fits.''</p><p>  From the second that they told us it was Mark Zuckerberg, we knew this was going to be a big moment.</p><p>  Mr. Zuckerberg: So basically, the speech kind of breaks out into three sections, and it's comprehensive. That might just be another word for saying it's long.</p><p>  Mr. Elleithee: I met him for the first time the night before the speech, when he came with his team to check out the venue and did a run-through. He gave me a brief overview of what he planned to say to help me think through the Q. and A.</p><p>  Mr. Zuckerberg: I hope that this is a moment to put our place in history, in perspective, but also to put some perspective around the individual decisions that we make on different types of harm and risks that come up.</p><p>  I don't expect everyone to agree with me on everything.</p><p>  Mr. Elleithee: The speech was at 1 p.m. the next day, and when I showed up on campus at 8 a.m. there was already a line out the door of students waiting to get in. There were clearly students who had slept there.</p><p>  Just before Zuckerberg got onstage, I did a walk-through of the room, and I could tell from the beginning that he was going to walk into a room full of skeptics. The room was totally focused on him. You could hear a pin drop.</p><p>  You could tell he was nervous in the beginning. But as the speech progressed, he got more comfortable.</p><p>  The students asked tough questions. We must have had 15 cards that wanted to know, from an ethical perspective, how the company saw its responsibility when bad actors used Facebook for genocide. I don't think he was comfortable with every question, and he didn't have a good answer to that one.</p><p>  (Mr. Zuckerberg was interviewed two days before the speech.)</p><p>  As told to MIKE ISAAC and CECILIA KANG</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS (PHOTOGRAPHS BY ANNA MONEYMAKER/THE NEW YORK TIMES</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p> JUSTIN T.

In addition to retaking the majority of attorneys general (AG) offices in the country, RAGA broke fundraising records and celebrated its 20th Anniversary in style. Read more about the top moments of 2019 below.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. Jeff Landry Re-Elected Louisiana AG, Leads Southern Sweep of 2019 Elections</p><p>Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry safely won re-election after trouncing his Democrat opponent by more than 33 points. AG Landry is a leader among his peers, having served as president of the bipartisan National Association of Attorneys General and leading numerous multi-state investigations and lawsuits to protect consumers and promote and defend the Constitution and rule of law. RAGA supported AG Landry's campaign efforts through paid advertisements. AG Landry's victory was the first of three in 2019 and set the stage for retaking the majority.</p><p>2. Daniel Cameron Battles Strong Headwinds in Kentucky and Becomes First Republican AG since 1948</p><p>Daniel Cameron was sworn in as Kentucky's first African American attorney general on December 17, 2019. Cameron is also the first Republican to hold this office since 1948. Despite the Republican Kentucky Governor's defeat on Election Day, AG Cameron overcame headwinds and beat his Democrat opponent by almost 16 points. RAGA's nearly $7 million investment in Kentucky was more complex than just television ads or mail, and featured a highly targeted, data-driven approach which included RAGA's first-ever field program. Cameron's victory, as well as victories in Mississippi and Louisiana, make RAGA the only national political committee to secure a clean sweep of victories during the 2019 election.</p><p>3. Lynn Fitch Ends Democrat Dominance in Mississippi and Becomes First Republican AG since 1878</p><p>Lynn Fitch, Mississippi's first female AG, was elected on November 5, 2019, beating her Democrat opponent by more than 15 points. Fitch, the former Mississippi Treasurer, is also the state's first Republican attorney general since 1878. AG-Elect Fitch plans to focus her efforts on Mississippi's opioid crisis, in addition to protecting veterans, the elderly, children and the mentally ill from scams and exploitation. RAGA supported Fitch's campaign efforts through paid advertisements.</p><p>4. Defending the Constitution</p><p>Republican AGs are actively working with the Trump Administration to restore the rule of law and correct previous unconstitutional overreaches. In 2019, Republican AGs continued their fight against Obamacare in Texas v. Azar and realized a victory in Federal Court earlier this month. Across the country, legal battles are also being waged by Republican AGs against the unconstitutionality of California's emissions standards, the Endangered Species Act, and the Equal Rights Amendment. From landmark investigations of Big Tech to the continued fight against overregulation and government overreach, Republican AGs are more united than ever in the fight for freedom.</p><p>5. Two Decades of Electing Rule of Law Attorneys General</p><p>On September 20, 2019, nearly 40 current and former attorneys general from across the nation gathered to celebrate RAGA's 20th Anniversary. Special guests included former Texas Solicitor General and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz and former Alabama Attorney General, U.S. Senator, and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, as well as former Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour and former Alabama Attorney General and U.S. Senator Luther Strange.</p><p>Leonard Leo, Co-Chairman and Executive Vice President of The Federalist Society, was honored with a special award during the 20th Anniversary celebration. Leonard Leo has helped shape the trajectory of RAGA and the conservative legal movement more than anyone else. As RAGA's greatest champion, Leonard Leo reimagined the role of the state attorney general and promoted men and women dedicated to the persistence of the rule of law and the original meaning of the Constitution.</p><p>6. The AG Farm Team Expands</p><p>The offices of state attorneys general have become a \"Farm Team\" nationally. Attorneys general and senior staff members have gone on to serve their country in other prestigious offices, both elected and appointed. The federal judiciary, federal agencies, U.S. Attorney offices, Congress, and governors' offices across the country are filled with attorney general alumni.</p><p>In 2019, 15 AG alumni were confirmed to the federal judiciary by the U.S. Senate. In total, 26 of President Trump's confirmed appointments to the federal judiciary worked in an attorneys general office and President Trump's Supreme Court shortlist includes one of RAGA's founding fathers as well as three former AG staff members.</p><p>7. RAGA Garners National News Coverage</p><p>Notable election victories in 2019, as well as the continued expansion of the AG Farm Team drew the attention of national news publications.</p><p>Fox News: \"Republicans boost Trump's judicial 'farm team' after AG elections, set sights on Bloomberg\"</p><p>Townhall.com: \"It Turns Out RAGA Is the Perfect Place to Find Judicial Nominees\"</p><p>Wall Street Journal: \"Daniel Cameron Overcame Racism to Make History in Kentucky\"</p><p>8. Multi-State Milestones</p><p>Republican AGs continue to come together to protect the Constitution and preserve the rule of law. This year, RAGA's policy arm, the Rule of Law Defense Fund (RLDF) saw an unprecedented amount of coordination between offices across the country. Republican AGs led comment letters on a wide range of federal regulations including the CFPB's Small Dollar Rule, the EPA's Waters of the United States (WOTUS) and Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rules, and DOL's Overtime Rule.</p><p>9. Preeminent Public Policy</p><p>RAGA's policy arm, the Rule of Law Defense Fund (RLDF), broke records of its own in 2019. Throughout the year, RLDF hosted 95 different policy panels, conversations, and working sessions on 119 different policy topics, made up of 175 panelists and speakers. Notable speakers included Senator Marco Rubio, former White House Counsel Don McGahn, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, and former Acting U.S. Attorney General Matthew Whitaker.</p><p>10. New Leadership Takes the Helm</p><p>Republican attorneys general elected a new slate of leaders, led by Chairman Louisiana Attorney General Jeff Landry and Vice-ChairmanGeorgia Attorney General Chris Carr. The 2020 leadership team will focus on defending five incumbent races and expanding the majority. These changes come after outgoing ChairmanTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton led RAGA during 2019, a historic year where Republican candidates won all three AG races across the country, placing Republicans back in the majority.</p><p>[Category: Law/Legal]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6973960 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6973960</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XW9-BWX1-JC11-137W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1129\"/><timeReceived>8:40 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 1, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

But the army backs President Nicolas Maduro and he remains in his post.In mid-September major demonstrations erupt in Haiti after fuel shortages, demanding the resignation of President Jovenel Moise. Violence claims more than 40 lives.A metro ticket hike in Chile's capital mid-October is the trigger for protests that claim more than 20 lives before a referendum on reforms is agreed.Bolivia is gripped by three weeks of demonstrations after President Evo Morales claims to win a fourth term on October 20. Dozens are killed. Morales resigns on November 10 and flees into exile as the government works on new elections.Ecuador is paralysed by nearly two weeks of protests in October and in Colombia strikes and demonstrations against the right-wing government begin mid-November.- North Africa/Mideast fury -On February 22, unprecedented protests break out in Algeria against a fifth term for frail President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, in power for 20 years.He loses the army's backing and resigns on April 2. But demonstrations continue, demanding an overhaul of the entire political establishment and rejecting new president Abdelmadjid Tebboune, elected on December 12 in polls marked by record abstention.In Sudan, the military on April 11 ends Omar al-Bashir's three decades in power, a key demand in four months of nationwide protests. </p><p>Demonstrations continue until a hard-won agreement in August sets up a joint governing council to oversee a transition to civilian rule. More than 250 people are killed, according to protesters.In Iraq, mass demonstrations erupt on October 1 against unemployment, corruption and poor public services, degenerating into violence that claims more than 460 lives. On December 1, parliament accepts the government's resignation.In Lebanon, rolling mass protests start on October 17, triggered by plans for a messaging app tax and turning against the political elite. They continue even after Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigns on October 29, with protesters rejecting new premier-designate Hassan Diab, an engineering professor backed by Hezbollah chosen on December 19 to form a government.Iran sees an explosion of riots on November 15 after a fuel price hike. Authorities crush the unrest but Amnesty International says more than 304 people were killed, most shot by security forces, a toll denied by the authorities.- IS leader killed -After a five-year offensive to seize vast Islamic State (IS) territory in Iraq and Syria, the jihadists were driven out of their last bastion in March by Kurdish-led forces.On October 27, President Donald Trump announces that IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed in a US special forces raid in Syria, blowing himself up as he was pursued.- Boeing MAX grounded -A March 10 Ethiopian Airlines crash leads to the global grounding of Boeing 737 MAX planes. It follows a Lion Air crash involving the same model six months earlier, with 346 lives lost in the two incidents.Boeing faces investigations and lawsuits, and is forced to upgrade its systems, in a crisis that costs it billions of dollars.In mid-December production of the plane is suspended. On December 23, Boeing chief Dennis Muilenburg resigns.- Brexit saga -Britain's March 29, 2019, deadline for leaving the European Union following a 2016 referendum is postponed three times, with the British parliament unable to agree to the divorce terms negotiated by Prime Minister Theresa May with Brussels, nor a second accord negotiated by her successor Boris Johnson.After widely winning early elections on December 12, Johnson gets support at the first reading by the lower house for his accord. He seeks final adoption on January 9, and to leave the EU on January 31, 2020.- First black hole photo -On April 10, astronomers unveil the first photograph of a black hole, a phenomenon they were convinced existed even if it had never been seen before.Drawn from mountains of data captured two years earlier by telescopes across the world, it shows a supermassive black hole 50 million lightyears away.- Notre Dame burns -On April 15, flames destroy the spire and roof of Paris's beloved Notre-Dame cathedral, but firefighters manage to save the gothic building, while many of its arts, relics and other treasures are rescued.

Violence claims more than 40 lives.A metro ticket hike in Chile's capital mid-October is the trigger for protests that claim more than 20 lives before a referendum on reforms is agreed.Bolivia is gripped by three weeks of demonstrations after President Evo Morales claims to win a fourth term on October 20. Dozens are killed. Morales resigns on November 10 and flees into exile as the government works on new elections.Ecuador is paralysed by nearly two weeks of protests in October and in Colombia strikes and demonstrations against the right-wing government begin mid-November.\u00a0 North Africa/Mideast fury\u00a0 \u00a0On February 22, unprecedented protests break out in Algeria against a fifth term for frail President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, in power for 20 years.He loses the army's backing and resigns on April 2. But demonstrations continue, demanding an overhaul of the entire political establishment and rejecting new president Abdelmadjid Tebboune, elected on December 12 in polls marked by record abstention.In Sudan, the military on April 11 ends Omar al-Bashir's three decades in power, a key demand in four months of nationwide protests.Demonstrations continue until a hard-won agreement in August sets up a joint governing council to oversee a transition to civilian rule. </p><p>More than 250 people are killed, according to protesters.In Iraq, mass demonstrations erupt on October 1 against unemployment, corruption and poor public services, degenerating into violence that claims more than 460 lives.On December 1, parliament accepts the government's resignation.In Lebanon, rolling mass protests start on October 17, triggered by plans for a messaging app tax and turning against the political elite. They continue even after Prime Minister Saad Hariri resigns on October 29, with protesters rejecting new premier-designate Hassan Diab, an engineering professor backed by Hizbollah chosen on December 19 to form a government.Iran sees an explosion of riots on November 15 after a fuel price hike.

He seeks final adoption on January 9, and to leave the EU on January 31, 2020\u00a0 First black hole photo\u00a0 \u00a0On April 10, astronomers unveil the first photograph of a black hole, a phenomenon they were convinced existed even if it had never been seen before.Drawn from mountains of data captured two years earlier by telescopes across the world, it shows a supermassive black hole 50 million lightyears away.

The expanding definition of fintech and its increasing reach and interconnectivity helped keep fintech investment robust despite the global economic and trade challenges that hindered growth in 2019, including concerns related to Brexit and ongoing trade tensions between China and the US.</p><p>In fact, despite these concerns, cross-border transactions remained high with $54.2 billion in cross-border M&amp;A deal value across 138 deals. This focus on cross-border transactions will likely continue as maturing fintechs look to grow and achieve scale and the big tech giants look to extend their reach and gain market share in less developed markets.</p><p>Many niche areas of fintech continued to grow and evolve throughout 2019; in particular, proptech investment grew from $1.9 billion in 2018 to a record $2.6 billion in 2019, while fintech-focused cybersecurity investment more than doubled from $316.9 million to $646.2 million. Blockchain and cryptocurrency investment continued to fluctuate, falling from $6.3 billion to $4.7 billion year-over-year, although Facebook's announcement of Libra and the People's Bank of China's announcement of accelerated research and experimentation on digital currency and electronic payments have helped breathe new life into the space.</p><p>2019 Key Global Highlights</p><p><br/>Global fintech investment fell just short of 2018's record year, with $137.5 billion invested in 2019 compared to $141 billion in 2018.<br/><br/>Global corporate VC investment participation rose during every quarter of 2019, leading to $16.7 billion in total annual VC invested with CVC involvement; CVC-related deal volume was also robust, with 553 deals over 2019, including 166 in Q3'19 \u2013 the second-highest quarter ever in terms of CVC fintech deals volume after Q2'18.<br/><br/>The number of fintech deals by global tech giants \u2013 including Alibaba Group, Alphabet, Apple, Baidu, IBM, Microsoft and Tencent \u2013 increased for the fifth straight year, with $3.5 billion invested across 46 deals in 2019.<br/><br/>Cybersecurity related fintech investment more than doubled year-over-year, from $316.9 million to $646.2 million.<br/><br/>Proptech investment rose to a record high of $2.6 billion in 2019 from $1.9 billion in 2018.</p><p>According to Manav Prakash Advisory Partner at KPMG in Bahrain \"In 2020, the lines are going to continue to blur between financial services and non-financial services \u2013 with big techs like Alibaba, Tencent, Google and others continuing to look for ways to integrate financial services within their ecosystem of offerings to their customers. Integration will be a big priority and the unbundling of financial services that has occurred over the past few years will likely start to reverse as fintechs, traditional financial institutions, and big techs look to provide more value and more seamless experiences to their customers\"</p><p>Key Predictions for 2020</p><p><br/>The big tech giants like Alphabet, Alibaba and Tencent will increase their focus on the fintech space, both working to increase their reach into developing markets and to increase the value of their ecosystems to their customers.<br/><br/>Maturing fintechs and challenger banks will continue to expand the breadth of their service offerings beyond their initial niche focus areas and make strategic moves across international borders.<br/><br/>The unbundling of financial products will begin to reverse course as consumers increasingly seek a primary interface to manage all of their financial affairs on a holistic level.<br/><br/>Cybersecurity-focused fintechs will become more attractive as traditional financial institutions shift from building to buying cyber solutions, particularly in areas like fraud, security, and identity management.<br/><br/>Consolidation is going to increase, with bigger and bolder M&amp;A deals becoming the norm in more mature fintech sub-sectors.<br/><br/>Building on the momentum of Hong Kong (SAR) and Australia, more countries in the Asia Pacific region will develop digital banking regimes and use digital banking licenses to guide digital bank efforts.<br/><br/>The focus on open data opportunities will move beyond banking and into other aspects of the financial services industry.</p><p>Anthony Harris, Head of Digital and Innovation at KPMG in Bahrain notes that \"Regulators are increasingly allowing new Fintech entrants into their financial sectors in order to accelerate industry transformation. And as the Fintech-driven unbundling of incumbent financial institutions' product portfolios hits a peak, the race is now on to re-bundle services and experiences around customer-centric, data-driven platforms. Competition is coming from Neo Banks, Fintechs as they look to scale, and Technology Platform Challengers such as Amazon, WeChat, Alibaba. Firms that effectively orchestrate platform or ecosystem environments typically end up as the winners.\"</p><p>*All figures cited are in USD</p><p>Click here to read the full report</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ALBAWA-169633697</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ALBAWA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YD2-0SD1-F11P-X1K2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">343610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"869\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Albawaba.com - Al Bawaba (Middle East) Ltd.

Q3 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc[4] New York, NY - December 19, 2018 - Indus Valley Partners, a provider of technology solutions to the buy side, has announced its 2019 trend outlook for the asset management[5] community. </p><p>With a growing demand for scalability and transparency throughout the front, middle and back office of funds, IVP continues to adapt to client needs by leveraging the latest advancements in technology and expertise necessary to enable a manager's full devotion to the generation and retention of alpha. Taking a look back at 2018, the desire for funds to possess a defining competitive advantage took the spotlight as artificial intelligence and machine learning[6]-driven technology began to fully emerge and showcase its power to allow for more efficient fund processes. However, with this desire comes the need for funds to shift to a more unified model to empower a seamless transition into a world where mundane functions no longer exist. As we look ahead, the following trends will begin to take shape as outsourcing various functions-as-a-service becomes a core aspect of a fund's infrastructure.Hyper Outsourcing Becomes the \"Norm\"The need for funds to stick to one or two providers is now an expired ideology with the adoption of hyper outsourcing, which is the strategic and tactical use of multiple service providers (6-10+) enabled by digitalization across the value chain. This model allows for targeted outsourcing of core functions including operations, data[7], treasury, compliance, risk, IT and accounting as managers find that the pressures of cost, headcount and data control have recently intensified. If funds are not leveraging outsourcing, they will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage to their peers.Data Management is a Critical Competency for Asset Managers NowAs hyper outsourcing models become the new norm, the ability to consume, curate, govern and catalog the datasets generated by outsourcing providers will become critical. Funds are now also experimenting with alternative datasets being brought into these data layers to enable additional front office insight codification while leveraging data science capabilities. Managers who implement this model will be able to create near real-time views/dashboards for their front, middle and back office teams. With this, managers can leverage the cost reduction that outsourcing offers to better manage their business on a day-to-day basis, allowing for more superior information access at their fingertips.Rise of the \"Digital-First\" Outsourcing ProviderThere is feverish activity in the Managed Services market due to disruption caused by intense digitalization[8] over the last several years as new technologies such as machine learning, AI, NLP and RPA are establishing footholds in the asset management world. The managed services model of yesteryears is now under threat by a new, more efficient type of \"digital-first\" managed services provider. The \"digital-first\" provider does not price services by headcount since it leverages technology to automate manual processes, AI/ML to drive efficiencies in decision making and supplies full transparency via system access to clients. IVP entered the managed services space by offering \"digital-first\" principles and has since been driving efficiencies across reconciliation, treasury, data management, regulation reporting and trade processing functions via IVP platforms to create the only 100% transparent managed services model in our industry that is equipped with an 'audit anytime' capability. '2018 has been a crucial year for our industry as it seems that we are now at a stage where our world is cycling through new technological advancements on a routine basis,' said Gurvinder Singh, CEO of Indus Valley Partners. 'Those who continue to adapt to change and stay abreast of the latest trends impacting asset managers will not only find themselves in a better position to allow for a continued focus on alpha generation by leveraging some of the latest technologies out there, but will double their edge while continuing to reduce operating costs measurably in areas that matter most.'About Indus Valley Partners Founded in 2000, Indus Valley Partners has more than 135 global asset managers and private equity funds among its client base. $1.5 trillion of global hedge fund AUM is managed using IVP technology.

Iron ore prices hit $US120 per tonne early in 2019, delivering a windfall to Australia's big miners and in particular Fortescue. Shareholders were also keen on the company's record annual dividend of $1.14, which included a special dividend of 11??. However, the extraordinary run experienced by Fortescue is less likely to be repeated in 2020 as iron ore prices experienced the steepest monthly decline in more than eight years in September as US-China trade wars and a slow-down in growth weighs on Chinese steel-making demand. And as global supply returns to normal as Vale resumes production in Brazil.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Xero, up 94 per cent to $83.23</emphasis></p><p>Shares in accounting platform Xero almost doubled in value over the course of 2019 starting the year at $42.02 and ending at $83.23. Led by chief executive Steve Vamos, the company capitalised on the move of many small business owners to its cloud-based accounting platforms. It booked a 32 per cent increase in half-yearly revenue at $338.7 million in November. Xero made a modest profit after tax of $1.3 million but Mr Vamos said Xero's focus was on \"reinvesting for growth\". The Kiwi-founded company's dominance is expected to continue, as Xero hit the two-million subscriber mark late in 2019. Investor John Hempton described the company as \"growing like a weed\" as it focused on expansion in the United Kingdom and United States. Xero ended the year with a change of chairman with former Telstra chief executive David Thodey set to take over from Graham Smith who is set to step down due to family health issues.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Afterpay, up 135 per cent to $29.20</emphasis></p><p>Afterpay's eventful 2019 saw its share price rocket upwards despite uncertainty over an Austrac-directed audit of its anti-money laundering compliance. The buy-now, pay-later darling rounded the year out with good news: the audit found no solid evidence the millennial-focused payments platform was being used for money laundering. The company told investors in December it had hit $1 billion in monthly sales and has reported solid growth in the US and UK markets. However, there are still some voices urging caution: UBS has taken the most bearish view of the stock so far, after it initiated coverage of the stock in October with a sell recommendation and a target price of $17.60.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Appen, up 82 per cent to $23.37</emphasis></p><p>This artificial intelligence (AI) company got as high as $31.42 this year, thereby cementing itself as a key Australian export with \"crowdsource\" contractors feeding big tech platforms information to improve machine-based learning functionality. This member of the tech-group known as 'WAAAX' posted strong numbers throughout the year including a number of profit upgrades, but it lost share price momentum in August when half year results raised questions over whether it overpaid when buying San Francisco AI startup Figure Eight. Appen rounded out the year with renewed share price traction after analysts at Bell Potter upgraded the stock to a buy, saying it was \"puzzling\" that the share price hadn't recovered since the middle of the year and adding a target price of $27.50</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JB Hi-Fi, up 80 per cent to $39.82</emphasis></p><p>Electronics retailer JB Hi-Fi was the first retailer to report full-year results against a backdrop of negative sentiment that had some investors bracing for the worst. But yet again, chief executive Richard Murray proved he and his team know how to retail, posting a 6.5 per cent increase in earnings. While Murray has remained confident on his business' ability to execute on the \"basics of retail\" amid a difficult market, his outlook for the rest of the financial year is one of cautious optimism, believing consumers still aren't raring to spend. Nevertheless, the company remains on the front foot, looking at new small-format stores to tap into retail locations such as airports, and continuing to expand its product offering in key categories. The amount of JB Hi-Fi shares held in a short position has fallen from 17.9 per cent at the start of 2019 down to 11.7 per cent. The one dark spot on the business' record is its Good Guys home appliances business.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aristocrat Leisure up 59 per cent to $34.63</emphasis></p><p>Slot machine giant Aristocrat Leisure delivered a jackpot for investors this year as its pokies business in the United States delivered earnings growth and the online computer game division became a revenue powerhouse. The group grew normalised full-year profit by 22 per cent to $752 million - about 3 per cent higher expected. Revenue from Aristocrat's North American pokies business grew 23 per cent to $1.9 billion, while profit jumped 25 per cent to $1 billion. Aristocrat's portfolio of online video games including War of Clans and RAID: Shadow League brought in almost as much revenue ($1.7 billion, up 33 per cent), but less profit ($529 million). However the company says the games division will become more profitable as new titles reach a critical mass of players and it can trim a hefty marketing bill. A strengthening balance sheet has investors hopeful of buybacks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CSL, up 52 per cent to $282.29</emphasis></p><p>Investors can thank a global shortage of immunoglobulin for pushing Melbourne-headquartered biotech CSL's shares to record highs this year. The group's market value soared to $129 billion - making it the second largest company on the ASX, behind Commonwealth Bank. Immunoglobulin (or IG) is one of the proteins the company extracts from donors' blood plasma that can be used to treat rare and deadly immunodeficiency and auto-immune diseases. Demand for IG has been growing and CSL is already the world's largest producer. The stock is trading on a high price-to-earnings multiple, but true believers say that's justified by its earnings growth - up 55 per cent over the past five years to $2.7 billion. All eyes will be on a heart-attack prevention human trial in 2020.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Goodman Group, up 29 per cent to $13.71</emphasis></p><p>Industrial giant Goodman has topped its real estate investment trust peers as one of the best performers for the 2019 year, thanks to the booming e-commerce sector. While warehouses were once the ugly duckling of the corporate real estate sector, they are now sought-after fulfilment centres, and Goodman Group is purely focused on industrial real estate. As a result Goodman topped the annual BDO REIT survey based on an overall return of 55.8 per cent - more than double the return on the previous year. BDO's national leader for Real Estate and Construction, Sebastian Stevens, said the performance of the Industrial REITs was driven by the value of high-quality assets in urban corridors which command strong rents.\"Online shopping continues to fuel demand for fulfilment centres for retailers. They want well located distribution centres to efficiently service their shops and customers. This has been good news for REITs such as Goodman and is resulting in a surge in speculative industrial development,\" Mr Stevens said. CEO Greg Goodman has forecast a strong 2020 and earnings per security are expected to be 56.3 cents in 2019-20, up 9 per cent on FY19.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Woolies and Coles, up 33 per cent to $37.37 and $15.25 respectively</emphasis></p><p>The 33 per cent rise in Australia's major supermarkets' share price can be in part attributed to small brightly-coloured plastic things. In 2019, Coles and Woolworths both realised collectables were a surefire way to boost sales and foster loyalty. It helped both stores post strong like-for-like sales in each quarter, with Woolworths' growing a record 6.6 per cent for the first quarter of 2020 and Coles' staying positive despite broad expectations of a drop. But the supermarkets' success stretches beyond gimmicky marketing tools. As one of Australia's largest retailers, Woolworths attracted investors as a safe bet in an unpredictable landscape. Similarly, investors interest in Coles was piqued after its successful de-merger from Wesfarmers last year, with the $15 stock under half the price of its competitor and chief executive Steven Cain on a $1 billion cost-cutting warpath. With price wars at a ceasefire (for now), both supermarkets are looking towards online and service as ways to bolster market share. However, as German hypermarket Kaufland is set to arrive next year, they could find themselves under a new wave of pressure in 2020.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qantas, up 26 pc to $7.33</emphasis></p><p>The flying kangaroo ended the year near all-time highs as investors gained confidence the airline can generate stable earnings in a slowing economy. Qantas' domestic network, the backbone of the company's earnings, faces only tepid competition from Virgin Australia, which is pulling back capacity and focusing more on leisure travel in an effort to stem its losses. Qantas' international arm has been helped by foreign carriers facing higher oil prices and pulling capacity out of Australia for the first time in close to a decade. Meanwhile, earnings continue to grow in the group's loyalty business, which now offers everything from health insurance to credit cards, acting as a buffer to the perpetually volatile airline business.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Domino's Pizza, up 33 per cent to $54.10</emphasis></p><p>Just like a fresh pizza pie, Domino's shares have risen throughout 2019, regardless of the company's falling local profit and franchisee concerns over its ???fortressing' strategy. But shareholder enthusiasm for the discount pizza slinger isn't based on its 825 Australian stores, with the lion's share of revenue and profit growth coming from its nascent Japanese and European network. Earnings for those regions were up 32.1 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively, with chief executive Don Meij imploring investors to look abroad at its full-year results in August. \"If you're an investor in our business, north of 80 per cent of profit growth will come from international markets,\" he said. However, its controversial ???fortressing' strategy - where the company adjusts the delivery boundaries of existing Domino's stores to allow for new stores - has gotten off to a slow start. Total sales for the first quarter of 2020 actually fell compared to last year, though same-store sales increased. Domino's still maintains guidance of 3-6 per cent same-store growth and a 7-9 per cent increase in store footprint over the next 3-5 years.</p><p>Losers</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Costa Group, down 61 per cent to $2.53</emphasis></p><p>2019 was a tough year for Costa Group, which describes itself as \"Australia's largest grower, packer and marketer of fresh fruit and vegetables\". While Costa ends the year an industry heavyweight, its stock price is far lighter than 12 months ago. What happened is that the year started off bad for Costa, with a January announcement of a profit downgrade, and then got worse. Events culminated with a $176 million capital raising announced in late October to pay down debt, as the company cited the impact of drought, high water prices, and smaller harvests from key crops on its financial performance. All up, the company has issued four profit warnings in calendar 2019. For Costa, the challenges over the past 12-15 months have been many. It has had to contend with \"crumbly\" raspberries which reduced yields from its raspberry crops and led to a substantial replanting program, low prices for mushrooms, and extreme dry conditions that affected the size and yield of major crops like avocados, blueberries, and the late-season citrus crop.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pilbara Minerals, down 64 per cent to 26??</emphasis></p><p>Pilbara Minerals is one of Australia's biggest producers of lithium and its share price was at $1.18 in early 2018. When 2019 started lithium was still highly popular, having tripled in price since 2010, as it is a key ingredient in the rechargeable batteries that power electric vehicles, computers, mobile phones, and energy storage. However, the rush to mine lithium saw too many producers bring too much volume too quickly, and the Chinese uptake of electric vehicles has been slower than many predicted. All this undermined demand, sending the price of lithium derived from Australian hard-rock plunging 40 per cent. Pilbara Minerals' stock price plunged to a three-year low by December. It has now delayed expanding it Pilgangoora lithium-tantalum project citing market conditions. While few dispute the long-term prospects for lithium alongside the electric vehicle revolution, this year has been a tough one for producers with one mine being placed into the hands of administrators and other operators, including Pilbara Minerals, scaling back production.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Blackmores, down 29 per cent to $86.45</emphasis></p><p>\"We're too fat, we're too bureaucratic, we're too complex and we don't make decisions quick enough. And we have to address those things,\" Marcus Blackmore told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald back in May. It was refreshing candour from a business leader dealing with a challenging year for the vitamins maker. At the time Mr Blackmore was the interim chief executive of the company founded by his father Maurice, following the resignation in February of former chief executive Richard Henfrey. Blackmores was one of the first stocks on the ASX to surpass $200, back in late 2015, and started 2019 above $120. But investors have since watched the stock fall as low as $63.64 in August, as the market absorbed a series of announcements. This included the CEO's sudden departure in February, a long-running search for its next CEO, the resignation of the boss of its Australian and New Zealand operations in May, and a 24 per cent fall in full year net profit to $53 million. Changes in Chinese e-commerce laws reduced China sales by 15 per cent. Some bright news emerged in July, when Blackmores announced the appointment of Alastair Symington as its next CEO. Blackmores shares ended the year at $86.45, which was 29 per cent lower than 2018, but above the depths plumbed in August.</p><p>Big four banks,</p><p>The big four banks have generally lagged the wider market in 2019, against a backdrop of slow credit growth, costly customer refunds, and low interest rates. However, some have performed better than others. The country's largest bank Commonwealth Bank has been the standout of the majors, avoiding the falls of rivals Westpac, ANZ Bank and National Australia Bank in the latest quarter. This slump happened as Westpac, NAB and ANZ each reported soft profits in the year to September. Their outlook for the year ahead was not much better, even as the property market improves. The weakness was compounded in November by the explosive money-laundering lawsuit lodged against Westpac, which sparked a dramatic resignation from former CEO Brian Hartzer, and a pledge by chairman Lindsay Maxsted to step down early. Further weighing on the share price, Westpac had cut its dividend and raised capital earlier that month. There are fears NAB has its own money laundering compliance problems lurking, and it has acknowledged it is talking with the financial intelligence agency, AUSTRAC. ANZ has said it has no material issues with AUSTRAC, but its chairman David Gonski has also said he can't promise there won't be any surprises.</p><p>Chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management, Hugh Dive, points out that CBA settled its lawsuit from AUSTRAC last year with a $700 million penalty, and its September quarter profit was well-received by the market.</p><p>\"CBA had a relatively good quarter. They've already had their AUSTRAC fine,\" Mr Dive said.</p><p>While the profits of banks have been soft, however, the sector's share prices did receive a boost this year from the royal commission's final report in February being less tough than feared, and the re-election of the Morrison government.</p><p>Outside the big four, a particularly weak performer has been Bank of Queensland, whose shares have fallen 22 per cent since the start of the year. The regional bank has had a tough year, posting disappointing profits, cutting its dividend, and warning of a weaker bottom line result next year. The bank's new chief executive, former Westpac banker George Frazis, also tapped shareholders for another $275 million in equity capital.</p><p>All share prices are until December 24. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contributors: Charlotte Grieve, Dominic Powell, Cara Waters, Emma Koehn, Darren Gray, Nick Toscano, Patrick Hatch, Carolyn Cummins, and Clancy Yeates.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520219350</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XV8-K2J1-DY19-C22G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3237\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

They've got an enormous amount of debt so they've got very little strategic flexibility to generate growth,'' he said.</p><p>Unusually, advanced markets have more geopolitical risk than emerging markets currently, he says, which makes it very tough for investors.</p><p>\"You put all these things together and I honestly think it's the toughest environment we've seen since 1982. I don't envy the job of chief investment officers trying to allocate, whether they're going to go to Australia or not, hedge or not hedge, cash and fixed interest or listed equities.\"</p><p>So what were the best, worst, and most interesting performances of 2019?</p><p>Winners</p><p>Fortescue, up <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">184 per cent to $10.91</emphasis></p><p>The iron-ore pure play had the biggest gains of the S&amp;P/ASX200 during 2019, rising from $3.80 to $10.91. The company has been surfing a boom in iron ore prices driven by extremely strong demand from Chinese steel mills and global supply constraints after a fatal dam collapse at an iron ore mine in Brazil. Iron ore prices hit $US120 per tonne early in 2019, delivering a windfall to Australia's big miners and in particular Fortescue. Shareholders were also keen on the company's record annual dividend of $1.14, which included a special dividend of 11??. However, the extraordinary run experienced by Fortescue is less likely to be repeated in 2020 as iron ore prices experienced the steepest monthly decline in more than eight years in September as US-China trade wars and a slow-down in growth weighs on Chinese steel-making demand. And as global supply returns to normal as Vale resumes production in Brazil.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Xero, up 94 per cent to $83.23</emphasis></p><p>Shares in accounting platform Xero almost doubled in value over the course of 2019 starting the year at $42.02 and ending at $83.23. Led by chief executive Steve Vamos, the company capitalised on the move of many small business owners to its cloud-based accounting platforms. It booked a 32 per cent increase in half-yearly revenue at $338.7 million in November. Xero made a modest profit after tax of $1.3 million but Mr Vamos said Xero's focus was on \"reinvesting for growth\". The Kiwi-founded company's dominance is expected to continue, as Xero hit the two-million subscriber mark late in 2019. Investor John Hempton described the company as \"growing like a weed\" as it focused on expansion in the United Kingdom and United States. Xero ended the year with a change of chairman with former Telstra chief executive David Thodey set to take over from Graham Smith who is set to step down due to family health issues.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Afterpay, up 135 per cent to $29.20</emphasis></p><p>Afterpay's eventful 2019 saw its share price rocket upwards despite uncertainty over an Austrac-directed audit of its anti-money laundering compliance. The buy-now, pay-later darling rounded the year out with good news: the audit found no solid evidence the millennial-focused payments platform was being used for money laundering. The company told investors in December it had hit $1 billion in monthly sales and has reported solid growth in the US and UK markets. However, there are still some voices urging caution: UBS has taken the most bearish view of the stock so far, after it initiated coverage of the stock in October with a sell recommendation and a target price of $17.60.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Appen, up 82 per cent to $23.37</emphasis></p><p>This artificial intelligence (AI) company got as high as $31.42 this year, thereby cementing itself as a key Australian export with \"crowdsource\" contractors feeding big tech platforms information to improve machine-based learning functionality. This member of the tech-group known as 'WAAAX' posted strong numbers throughout the year including a number of profit upgrades, but it lost share price momentum in August when half year results raised questions over whether it overpaid when buying San Francisco AI startup Figure Eight. Appen rounded out the year with renewed share price traction after analysts at Bell Potter upgraded the stock to a buy, saying it was \"puzzling\" that the share price hadn't recovered since the middle of the year and adding a target price of $27.50</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JB Hi-Fi, up 80 per cent to $39.82</emphasis></p><p>Electronics retailer JB Hi-Fi was the first retailer to report full-year results against a backdrop of negative sentiment that had some investors bracing for the worst. But yet again, chief executive Richard Murray proved he and his team know how to retail, posting a 6.5 per cent increase in earnings. While Murray has remained confident on his business' ability to execute on the \"basics of retail\" amid a difficult market, his outlook for the rest of the financial year is one of cautious optimism, believing consumers still aren't raring to spend. Nevertheless, the company remains on the front foot, looking at new small-format stores to tap into retail locations such as airports, and continuing to expand its product offering in key categories. The amount of JB Hi-Fi shares held in a short position has fallen from 17.9 per cent at the start of 2019 down to 11.7 per cent. The one dark spot on the business' record is its Good Guys home appliances business.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aristocrat Leisure up 59 per cent to $34.63</emphasis></p><p>Slot machine giant Aristocrat Leisure delivered a jackpot for investors this year as its pokies business in the United States delivered earnings growth and the online computer game division became a revenue powerhouse. The group grew normalised full-year profit by 22 per cent to $752 million - about 3 per cent higher expected. Revenue from Aristocrat's North American pokies business grew 23 per cent to $1.9 billion, while profit jumped 25 per cent to $1 billion. Aristocrat's portfolio of online video games including War of Clans and RAID: Shadow League brought in almost as much revenue ($1.7 billion, up 33 per cent), but less profit ($529 million). However the company says the games division will become more profitable as new titles reach a critical mass of players and it can trim a hefty marketing bill. A strengthening balance sheet has investors hopeful of buybacks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CSL, up 52 per cent to $282.29</emphasis></p><p>Investors can thank a global shortage of immunoglobulin for pushing Melbourne-headquartered biotech CSL's shares to record highs this year. The group's market value soared to $129 billion - making it the second largest company on the ASX, behind Commonwealth Bank. Immunoglobulin (or IG) is one of the proteins the company extracts from donors' blood plasma that can be used to treat rare and deadly immunodeficiency and auto-immune diseases. Demand for IG has been growing and CSL is already the world's largest producer. The stock is trading on a high price-to-earnings multiple, but true believers say that's justified by its earnings growth - up 55 per cent over the past five years to $2.7 billion. All eyes will be on a heart-attack prevention human trial in 2020.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Goodman Group, up 29 per cent to $13.71</emphasis></p><p>Industrial giant Goodman has topped its real estate investment trust peers as one of the best performers for the 2019 year, thanks to the booming e-commerce sector. While warehouses were once the ugly duckling of the corporate real estate sector, they are now sought-after fulfilment centres, and Goodman Group is purely focused on industrial real estate. As a result Goodman topped the annual BDO REIT survey based on an overall return of 55.8 per cent - more than double the return on the previous year. BDO's national leader for Real Estate and Construction, Sebastian Stevens, said the performance of the Industrial REITs was driven by the value of high-quality assets in urban corridors which command strong rents.\"Online shopping continues to fuel demand for fulfilment centres for retailers. They want well located distribution centres to efficiently service their shops and customers. This has been good news for REITs such as Goodman and is resulting in a surge in speculative industrial development,\" Mr Stevens said. CEO Greg Goodman has forecast a strong 2020 and earnings per security are expected to be 56.3 cents in 2019-20, up 9 per cent on FY19.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Woolies and Coles, up 33 per cent to $37.37 and $15.25 respectively</emphasis></p><p>The 33 per cent rise in Australia's major supermarkets' share price can be in part attributed to small brightly-coloured plastic things. In 2019, Coles and Woolworths both realised collectables were a surefire way to boost sales and foster loyalty. It helped both stores post strong like-for-like sales in each quarter, with Woolworths' growing a record 6.6 per cent for the first quarter of 2020 and Coles' staying positive despite broad expectations of a drop. But the supermarkets' success stretches beyond gimmicky marketing tools. As one of Australia's largest retailers, Woolworths attracted investors as a safe bet in an unpredictable landscape. Similarly, investors interest in Coles was piqued after its successful de-merger from Wesfarmers last year, with the $15 stock under half the price of its competitor and chief executive Steven Cain on a $1 billion cost-cutting warpath. With price wars at a ceasefire (for now), both supermarkets are looking towards online and service as ways to bolster market share. However, as German hypermarket Kaufland is set to arrive next year, they could find themselves under a new wave of pressure in 2020.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qantas, up 26 pc to $7.33</emphasis></p><p>The flying kangaroo ended the year near all-time highs as investors gained confidence the airline can generate stable earnings in a slowing economy. Qantas' domestic network, the backbone of the company's earnings, faces only tepid competition from Virgin Australia, which is pulling back capacity and focusing more on leisure travel in an effort to stem its losses. Qantas' international arm has been helped by foreign carriers facing higher oil prices and pulling capacity out of Australia for the first time in close to a decade. Meanwhile, earnings continue to grow in the group's loyalty business, which now offers everything from health insurance to credit cards, acting as a buffer to the perpetually volatile airline business.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Domino's Pizza, up 33 per cent to $54.10</emphasis></p><p>Just like a fresh pizza pie, Domino's shares have risen throughout 2019, regardless of the company's falling local profit and franchisee concerns over its ???fortressing' strategy. But shareholder enthusiasm for the discount pizza slinger isn't based on its 825 Australian stores, with the lion's share of revenue and profit growth coming from its nascent Japanese and European network. Earnings for those regions were up 32.1 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively, with chief executive Don Meij imploring investors to look abroad at its full-year results in August. \"If you're an investor in our business, north of 80 per cent of profit growth will come from international markets,\" he said. However, its controversial ???fortressing' strategy - where the company adjusts the delivery boundaries of existing Domino's stores to allow for new stores - has gotten off to a slow start. Total sales for the first quarter of 2020 actually fell compared to last year, though same-store sales increased. Domino's still maintains guidance of 3-6 per cent same-store growth and a 7-9 per cent increase in store footprint over the next 3-5 years.</p><p>Losers</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Costa Group, down 61 per cent to $2.53</emphasis></p><p>2019 was a tough year for Costa Group, which describes itself as \"Australia's largest grower, packer and marketer of fresh fruit and vegetables\". While Costa ends the year an industry heavyweight, its stock price is far lighter than 12 months ago. What happened is that the year started off bad for Costa, with a January announcement of a profit downgrade, and then got worse. Events culminated with a $176 million capital raising announced in late October to pay down debt, as the company cited the impact of drought, high water prices, and smaller harvests from key crops on its financial performance. All up, the company has issued four profit warnings in calendar 2019. For Costa, the challenges over the past 12-15 months have been many. It has had to contend with \"crumbly\" raspberries which reduced yields from its raspberry crops and led to a substantial replanting program, low prices for mushrooms, and extreme dry conditions that affected the size and yield of major crops like avocados, blueberries, and the late-season citrus crop.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pilbara Minerals, down 64 per cent to 26??</emphasis></p><p>Pilbara Minerals is one of Australia's biggest producers of lithium and its share price was at $1.18 in early 2018. When 2019 started lithium was still highly popular, having tripled in price since 2010, as it is a key ingredient in the rechargeable batteries that power electric vehicles, computers, mobile phones, and energy storage. However, the rush to mine lithium saw too many producers bring too much volume too quickly, and the Chinese uptake of electric vehicles has been slower than many predicted. All this undermined demand, sending the price of lithium derived from Australian hard-rock plunging 40 per cent. Pilbara Minerals' stock price plunged to a three-year low by December. It has now delayed expanding it Pilgangoora lithium-tantalum project citing market conditions. While few dispute the long-term prospects for lithium alongside the electric vehicle revolution, this year has been a tough one for producers with one mine being placed into the hands of administrators and other operators, including Pilbara Minerals, scaling back production.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Blackmores, down 29 per cent to $86.45</emphasis></p><p>\"We're too fat, we're too bureaucratic, we're too complex and we don't make decisions quick enough. And we have to address those things,\" Marcus Blackmore told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald back in May. It was refreshing candour from a business leader dealing with a challenging year for the vitamins maker. At the time Mr Blackmore was the interim chief executive of the company founded by his father Maurice, following the resignation in February of former chief executive Richard Henfrey. Blackmores was one of the first stocks on the ASX to surpass $200, back in late 2015, and started 2019 above $120. But investors have since watched the stock fall as low as $63.64 in August, as the market absorbed a series of announcements. This included the CEO's sudden departure in February, a long-running search for its next CEO, the resignation of the boss of its Australian and New Zealand operations in May, and a 24 per cent fall in full year net profit to $53 million. Changes in Chinese e-commerce laws reduced China sales by 15 per cent. Some bright news emerged in July, when Blackmores announced the appointment of Alastair Symington as its next CEO. Blackmores shares ended the year at $86.45, which was 29 per cent lower than 2018, but above the depths plumbed in August.</p><p>Big four banks,</p><p>The big four banks have generally lagged the wider market in 2019, against a backdrop of slow credit growth, costly customer refunds, and low interest rates. However, some have performed better than others. The country's largest bank Commonwealth Bank has been the standout of the majors, avoiding the falls of rivals Westpac, ANZ Bank and National Australia Bank in the latest quarter. This slump happened as Westpac, NAB and ANZ each reported soft profits in the year to September. Their outlook for the year ahead was not much better, even as the property market improves. The weakness was compounded in November by the explosive money-laundering lawsuit lodged against Westpac, which sparked a dramatic resignation from former CEO Brian Hartzer, and a pledge by chairman Lindsay Maxsted to step down early. Further weighing on the share price, Westpac had cut its dividend and raised capital earlier that month. There are fears NAB has its own money laundering compliance problems lurking, and it has acknowledged it is talking with the financial intelligence agency, AUSTRAC. ANZ has said it has no material issues with AUSTRAC, but its chairman David Gonski has also said he can't promise there won't be any surprises.</p><p>Chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management, Hugh Dive, points out that CBA settled its lawsuit from AUSTRAC last year with a $700 million penalty, and its September quarter profit was well-received by the market.</p><p>\"CBA had a relatively good quarter. They've already had their AUSTRAC fine,\" Mr Dive said.</p><p>While the profits of banks have been soft, however, the sector's share prices did receive a boost this year from the royal commission's final report in February being less tough than feared, and the re-election of the Morrison government.</p><p>Outside the big four, a particularly weak performer has been Bank of Queensland, whose shares have fallen 22 per cent since the start of the year. The regional bank has had a tough year, posting disappointing profits, cutting its dividend, and warning of a weaker bottom line result next year. The bank's new chief executive, former Westpac banker George Frazis, also tapped shareholders for another $275 million in equity capital.</p><p>All share prices are until December 24. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contributors: Charlotte Grieve, Dominic Powell, Cara Waters, Emma Koehn, Darren Gray, Nick Toscano, Patrick Hatch, Carolyn Cummins, and Clancy Yeates.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520219350</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XV8-K2J1-DY19-C22D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3237\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Fortescue, Wesfarmers, CSL, Qantas, and JB Hi-Fi all ended the year in uncharted territory.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The investment director at Bennelong Australian Equity Partners, Julian Beaumont, says the past twelve months held a lot of surprises.</p><p>\"Fair to say that 2019 was a better year than most would have ever expected. If you were able to predict the uncertainty hanging over markets from the trade-war, Brexit, Hong Kong riots, weaker than expected global and domestic growth, and poor corporate earnings, then you wouldn't probably have predicted a strong market.</p><p>\"And it really just goes to show that whatever is happening politically, socially, and on a macro front, aren't necessarily the drivers of stock market returns. Ultimately the biggest driver of returns this year was interest rates and their precipitous fall.\"</p><p>The lower interest rate environment boosts other asset prices. So while stock prices might be more expensive than ever before, this is not because companies are performing better than ever before.</p><p>\"Over-valuation has to be put in context. And right now when you consider where interest rates are, where housing yields are, where property cap rates are, then in that context equity is actually probably rationally priced. From the point of view of earnings and dividend yield they are actually quite attractive versus the [other asset classes].''</p><p>IFM's outgoing chief executive Brett Himbury said the current investment climate was the toughest he has seen since the early 1980s due to low interest rates, geopolitical volatility in advanced markets, the rise of \"burdensome\" regulation, and levels of trust in financial services being at an \"all-time low\".</p><p>\"Most governments, except Australia, are really fiscally constrained. They've got an enormous amount of debt so they've got very little strategic flexibility to generate growth,'' he said.</p><p>Unusually, advanced markets have more geopolitical risk than emerging markets currently, he says, which makes it very tough for investors.</p><p>\"You put all these things together and I honestly think it's the toughest environment we've seen since 1982. I don't envy the job of chief investment officers trying to allocate, whether they're going to go to Australia or not, hedge or not hedge, cash and fixed interest or listed equities.\"</p><p>So what were the best, worst, and most interesting performances of 2019?</p><p>Winners</p><p>Fortescue, up <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">184 per cent to $10.91</emphasis></p><p>The iron-ore pure play had the biggest gains of the S&amp;P/ASX200 during 2019, rising from $3.80 to $10.91. The company has been surfing a boom in iron ore prices driven by extremely strong demand from Chinese steel mills and global supply constraints after a fatal dam collapse at an iron ore mine in Brazil. Iron ore prices hit $US120 per tonne early in 2019, delivering a windfall to Australia's big miners and in particular Fortescue. Shareholders were also keen on the company's record annual dividend of $1.14, which included a special dividend of 11??. However, the extraordinary run experienced by Fortescue is less likely to be repeated in 2020 as iron ore prices experienced the steepest monthly decline in more than eight years in September as US-China trade wars and a slow-down in growth weighs on Chinese steel-making demand. And as global supply returns to normal as Vale resumes production in Brazil.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Xero, up 94 per cent to $83.23</emphasis></p><p>Shares in accounting platform Xero almost doubled in value over the course of 2019 starting the year at $42.02 and ending at $83.23. Led by chief executive Steve Vamos, the company capitalised on the move of many small business owners to its cloud-based accounting platforms. It booked a 32 per cent increase in half-yearly revenue at $338.7 million in November. Xero made a modest profit after tax of $1.3 million but Mr Vamos said Xero's focus was on \"reinvesting for growth\". The Kiwi-founded company's dominance is expected to continue, as Xero hit the two-million subscriber mark late in 2019. Investor John Hempton described the company as \"growing like a weed\" as it focused on expansion in the United Kingdom and United States. Xero ended the year with a change of chairman with former Telstra chief executive David Thodey set to take over from Graham Smith who is set to step down due to family health issues.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Afterpay, up 135 per cent to $29.20</emphasis></p><p>Afterpay's eventful 2019 saw its share price rocket upwards despite uncertainty over an Austrac-directed audit of its anti-money laundering compliance. The buy-now, pay-later darling rounded the year out with good news: the audit found no solid evidence the millennial-focused payments platform was being used for money laundering. The company told investors in December it had hit $1 billion in monthly sales and has reported solid growth in the US and UK markets. However, there are still some voices urging caution: UBS has taken the most bearish view of the stock so far, after it initiated coverage of the stock in October with a sell recommendation and a target price of $17.60.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Appen, up 82 per cent to $23.37</emphasis></p><p>This artificial intelligence (AI) company got as high as $31.42 this year, thereby cementing itself as a key Australian export with \"crowdsource\" contractors feeding big tech platforms information to improve machine-based learning functionality. This member of the tech-group known as 'WAAAX' posted strong numbers throughout the year including a number of profit upgrades, but it lost share price momentum in August when half year results raised questions over whether it overpaid when buying San Francisco AI startup Figure Eight. Appen rounded out the year with renewed share price traction after analysts at Bell Potter upgraded the stock to a buy, saying it was \"puzzling\" that the share price hadn't recovered since the middle of the year and adding a target price of $27.50</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JB Hi-Fi, up 80 per cent to $39.82</emphasis></p><p>Electronics retailer JB Hi-Fi was the first retailer to report full-year results against a backdrop of negative sentiment that had some investors bracing for the worst. But yet again, chief executive Richard Murray proved he and his team know how to retail, posting a 6.5 per cent increase in earnings. While Murray has remained confident on his business' ability to execute on the \"basics of retail\" amid a difficult market, his outlook for the rest of the financial year is one of cautious optimism, believing consumers still aren't raring to spend. Nevertheless, the company remains on the front foot, looking at new small-format stores to tap into retail locations such as airports, and continuing to expand its product offering in key categories. The amount of JB Hi-Fi shares held in a short position has fallen from 17.9 per cent at the start of 2019 down to 11.7 per cent. The one dark spot on the business' record is its Good Guys home appliances business.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aristocrat Leisure up 59 per cent to $34.63</emphasis></p><p>Slot machine giant Aristocrat Leisure delivered a jackpot for investors this year as its pokies business in the United States delivered earnings growth and the online computer game division became a revenue powerhouse. The group grew normalised full-year profit by 22 per cent to $752 million - about 3 per cent higher expected. Revenue from Aristocrat's North American pokies business grew 23 per cent to $1.9 billion, while profit jumped 25 per cent to $1 billion. Aristocrat's portfolio of online video games including War of Clans and RAID: Shadow League brought in almost as much revenue ($1.7 billion, up 33 per cent), but less profit ($529 million). However the company says the games division will become more profitable as new titles reach a critical mass of players and it can trim a hefty marketing bill. A strengthening balance sheet has investors hopeful of buybacks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">CSL, up 52 per cent to $282.29</emphasis></p><p>Investors can thank a global shortage of immunoglobulin for pushing Melbourne-headquartered biotech CSL's shares to record highs this year. The group's market value soared to $129 billion - making it the second largest company on the ASX, behind Commonwealth Bank. Immunoglobulin (or IG) is one of the proteins the company extracts from donors' blood plasma that can be used to treat rare and deadly immunodeficiency and auto-immune diseases. Demand for IG has been growing and CSL is already the world's largest producer. The stock is trading on a high price-to-earnings multiple, but true believers say that's justified by its earnings growth - up 55 per cent over the past five years to $2.7 billion. All eyes will be on a heart-attack prevention human trial in 2020.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Goodman Group, up 29 per cent to $13.71</emphasis></p><p>Industrial giant Goodman has topped its real estate investment trust peers as one of the best performers for the 2019 year, thanks to the booming e-commerce sector. While warehouses were once the ugly duckling of the corporate real estate sector, they are now sought-after fulfilment centres, and Goodman Group is purely focused on industrial real estate. As a result Goodman topped the annual BDO REIT survey based on an overall return of 55.8 per cent - more than double the return on the previous year. BDO's national leader for Real Estate and Construction, Sebastian Stevens, said the performance of the Industrial REITs was driven by the value of high-quality assets in urban corridors which command strong rents.\"Online shopping continues to fuel demand for fulfilment centres for retailers. They want well located distribution centres to efficiently service their shops and customers. This has been good news for REITs such as Goodman and is resulting in a surge in speculative industrial development,\" Mr Stevens said. CEO Greg Goodman has forecast a strong 2020 and earnings per security are expected to be 56.3 cents in 2019-20, up 9 per cent on FY19.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Woolies and Coles, up 33 per cent to $37.37 and $15.25 respectively</emphasis></p><p>The 33 per cent rise in Australia's major supermarkets' share price can be in part attributed to small brightly-coloured plastic things. In 2019, Coles and Woolworths both realised collectables were a surefire way to boost sales and foster loyalty. It helped both stores post strong like-for-like sales in each quarter, with Woolworths' growing a record 6.6 per cent for the first quarter of 2020 and Coles' staying positive despite broad expectations of a drop. But the supermarkets' success stretches beyond gimmicky marketing tools. As one of Australia's largest retailers, Woolworths attracted investors as a safe bet in an unpredictable landscape. Similarly, investors interest in Coles was piqued after its successful de-merger from Wesfarmers last year, with the $15 stock under half the price of its competitor and chief executive Steven Cain on a $1 billion cost-cutting warpath. With price wars at a ceasefire (for now), both supermarkets are looking towards online and service as ways to bolster market share. However, as German hypermarket Kaufland is set to arrive next year, they could find themselves under a new wave of pressure in 2020.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qantas, up 26 pc to $7.33</emphasis></p><p>The flying kangaroo ended the year near all-time highs as investors gained confidence the airline can generate stable earnings in a slowing economy. Qantas' domestic network, the backbone of the company's earnings, faces only tepid competition from Virgin Australia, which is pulling back capacity and focusing more on leisure travel in an effort to stem its losses. Qantas' international arm has been helped by foreign carriers facing higher oil prices and pulling capacity out of Australia for the first time in close to a decade. Meanwhile, earnings continue to grow in the group's loyalty business, which now offers everything from health insurance to credit cards, acting as a buffer to the perpetually volatile airline business.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Domino's Pizza, up 33 per cent to $54.10</emphasis></p><p>Just like a fresh pizza pie, Domino's shares have risen throughout 2019, regardless of the company's falling local profit and franchisee concerns over its ???fortressing' strategy. But shareholder enthusiasm for the discount pizza slinger isn't based on its 825 Australian stores, with the lion's share of revenue and profit growth coming from its nascent Japanese and European network. Earnings for those regions were up 32.1 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively, with chief executive Don Meij imploring investors to look abroad at its full-year results in August. \"If you're an investor in our business, north of 80 per cent of profit growth will come from international markets,\" he said. However, its controversial ???fortressing' strategy - where the company adjusts the delivery boundaries of existing Domino's stores to allow for new stores - has gotten off to a slow start. Total sales for the first quarter of 2020 actually fell compared to last year, though same-store sales increased. Domino's still maintains guidance of 3-6 per cent same-store growth and a 7-9 per cent increase in store footprint over the next 3-5 years.</p><p>Losers</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Costa Group, down 61 per cent to $2.53</emphasis></p><p>2019 was a tough year for Costa Group, which describes itself as \"Australia's largest grower, packer and marketer of fresh fruit and vegetables\". While Costa ends the year an industry heavyweight, its stock price is far lighter than 12 months ago. What happened is that the year started off bad for Costa, with a January announcement of a profit downgrade, and then got worse. Events culminated with a $176 million capital raising announced in late October to pay down debt, as the company cited the impact of drought, high water prices, and smaller harvests from key crops on its financial performance. All up, the company has issued four profit warnings in calendar 2019. For Costa, the challenges over the past 12-15 months have been many. It has had to contend with \"crumbly\" raspberries which reduced yields from its raspberry crops and led to a substantial replanting program, low prices for mushrooms, and extreme dry conditions that affected the size and yield of major crops like avocados, blueberries, and the late-season citrus crop.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pilbara Minerals, down 64 per cent to 26??</emphasis></p><p>Pilbara Minerals is one of Australia's biggest producers of lithium and its share price was at $1.18 in early 2018. When 2019 started lithium was still highly popular, having tripled in price since 2010, as it is a key ingredient in the rechargeable batteries that power electric vehicles, computers, mobile phones, and energy storage. However, the rush to mine lithium saw too many producers bring too much volume too quickly, and the Chinese uptake of electric vehicles has been slower than many predicted. All this undermined demand, sending the price of lithium derived from Australian hard-rock plunging 40 per cent. Pilbara Minerals' stock price plunged to a three-year low by December. It has now delayed expanding it Pilgangoora lithium-tantalum project citing market conditions. While few dispute the long-term prospects for lithium alongside the electric vehicle revolution, this year has been a tough one for producers with one mine being placed into the hands of administrators and other operators, including Pilbara Minerals, scaling back production.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Blackmores, down 29 per cent to $86.45</emphasis></p><p>\"We're too fat, we're too bureaucratic, we're too complex and we don't make decisions quick enough. And we have to address those things,\" Marcus Blackmore told The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald back in May. It was refreshing candour from a business leader dealing with a challenging year for the vitamins maker. At the time Mr Blackmore was the interim chief executive of the company founded by his father Maurice, following the resignation in February of former chief executive Richard Henfrey. Blackmores was one of the first stocks on the ASX to surpass $200, back in late 2015, and started 2019 above $120. But investors have since watched the stock fall as low as $63.64 in August, as the market absorbed a series of announcements. This included the CEO's sudden departure in February, a long-running search for its next CEO, the resignation of the boss of its Australian and New Zealand operations in May, and a 24 per cent fall in full year net profit to $53 million. Changes in Chinese e-commerce laws reduced China sales by 15 per cent. Some bright news emerged in July, when Blackmores announced the appointment of Alastair Symington as its next CEO. Blackmores shares ended the year at $86.45, which was 29 per cent lower than 2018, but above the depths plumbed in August.</p><p>Big four banks,</p><p>The big four banks have generally lagged the wider market in 2019, against a backdrop of slow credit growth, costly customer refunds, and low interest rates. However, some have performed better than others. The country's largest bank Commonwealth Bank has been the standout of the majors, avoiding the falls of rivals Westpac, ANZ Bank and National Australia Bank in the latest quarter. This slump happened as Westpac, NAB and ANZ each reported soft profits in the year to September. Their outlook for the year ahead was not much better, even as the property market improves. The weakness was compounded in November by the explosive money-laundering lawsuit lodged against Westpac, which sparked a dramatic resignation from former CEO Brian Hartzer, and a pledge by chairman Lindsay Maxsted to step down early. Further weighing on the share price, Westpac had cut its dividend and raised capital earlier that month. There are fears NAB has its own money laundering compliance problems lurking, and it has acknowledged it is talking with the financial intelligence agency, AUSTRAC. ANZ has said it has no material issues with AUSTRAC, but its chairman David Gonski has also said he can't promise there won't be any surprises.</p><p>Chief investment officer at Atlas Funds Management, Hugh Dive, points out that CBA settled its lawsuit from AUSTRAC last year with a $700 million penalty, and its September quarter profit was well-received by the market.</p><p>\"CBA had a relatively good quarter. They've already had their AUSTRAC fine,\" Mr Dive said.</p><p>While the profits of banks have been soft, however, the sector's share prices did receive a boost this year from the royal commission's final report in February being less tough than feared, and the re-election of the Morrison government.</p><p>Outside the big four, a particularly weak performer has been Bank of Queensland, whose shares have fallen 22 per cent since the start of the year. The regional bank has had a tough year, posting disappointing profits, cutting its dividend, and warning of a weaker bottom line result next year. The bank's new chief executive, former Westpac banker George Frazis, also tapped shareholders for another $275 million in equity capital.</p><p>All share prices are until December 24. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contributors: Charlotte Grieve, Dominic Powell, Cara Waters, Emma Koehn, Darren Gray, Nick Toscano, Patrick Hatch, Carolyn Cummins, and Clancy Yeates.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WATDAY-1520219350</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WATDAY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XV8-K2J1-DY19-C22M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404062</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3237\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.
