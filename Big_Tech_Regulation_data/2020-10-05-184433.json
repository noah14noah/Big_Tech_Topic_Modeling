(Most smart-city gear is purchased by governments.) And much of that money will be lavished on untested technologies that lack adequate cybersecurity protections.</p><p>To be sure, there are at least three certainties here.</p><p>Every proposed smart city is a \"surveillance city,\" in which ubiquitous sensors spy on residents 24/7. Smart cities will be acutely vulnerable to cyberattack. And the smart-city movement is driven not by the public, but by what can be called the \"urban-industrial complex\" (UIC).</p><p>The UIC is a partnership of Big Tech and government to spend an estimated $158 billion (U.S.) per year on smart-city makeovers by 2022. That amounts to a colossal $1.6 trillion over the following decade. (All figures in U.S. dollars.)</p><p>The UIC's Big Tech members include Bell Canada and Telus Corp. here at home, as well as foreign tech giants IBM Corp., Microsoft Corp., General Electric Co., Intel Corp., Siemens AG, Cisco Systems Inc. and Huawei Technologies Inc., among others.</p><p>Like other countries, Canada and the U.S. are also running smart city competitions. Those initiatives can be lauded for generating grassroots ideas.</p><p>But most of the smart city decision-making is top-down. It is Big Tech and its government partners trying to impose radical change on urban life worldwide.</p><p>The enthusiasm about smart cities needs to be curbed. Here are some reasons why.</p><p>They're all or nothing</p><p>The smart-city concept doesn't work unless everything and everyone in the city is digitally connected.</p><p>As the smart-city advocates promote it, there is no such thing as a smart-city building. If we're serious about using this new orthodoxy to create an urbanity of unprecedented efficiency, all buildings, infrastructure and people must be digitally equipped and interconnected.</p><p>Only by that means can \"interoperability\" be achieved among police, public transit, power and water utilities, education, health care and ATM machines, all of them collecting and sharing data to make the city safer and more efficient.</p><p>Because all that data is interconnected in a smart city, somebody somewhere will know the route you take in picking up your kids from school, your state of health, and how you spend your money. Mere pilot projects don't work in this area.</p><p>No sooner had Google unveiled its master plan for Quayside, on June 24, than it demanded much more land than it was allotted to make its project viable. Even then, the Sidewalk Labs project is just a gimmick, unless the entire GTA remakes itself according to Google's plan for Quayside.</p><p>\"Smart Cities are Going to be a Security Nightmare\" That's how the Harvard Business Review, a journal not given to alarmism, has described just one smart-city challenge.</p><p>And it's true that when you connect a city's public services, transportation, utilities, financial institutions and retailers into a digitalized whole, you are giving hackers the chance to inflict multiple, simultaneous system failures.</p><p>Or, as Todd Thibodeaux, head of CompTIA, one of America's biggest IT trade associations, has put it, a determined hacker, in compromising just one system, can \"shut down multiple city services from a single entry point.\"</p><p>We'll neglect nondigital priorities</p><p>There are urban crises that do not lend themselves to a high-tech solution. At least not yet.</p><p>Those include shortages of affordable housing, child poverty, income inequality, gang violence, spousal and elder abuse, substance addiction, and the gender-pay gap.</p><p>The annual Smart City Index (SCI) doesn't measure those things in ranking the world's smartest cities. The major indexes of the world's most livable cities do. Only one city, Melbourne, ranks in the Top 10 on both the SCI and most livable city indices.</p><p>The SCI looks at the rate of digital, or cashless, payments in a city; digital traffic-control systems; digital provision of health services, and digital systems for detecting areas of high crime. At least so far, the \"smartest\" cities aren't the most livable ones. And that's after almost a decade of implementing smart city ideas.</p><p>Smart city innovations should be encouraged, as there is proof that in selected applications they work. Toronto is now using digital sensors on civic vehicles to fix them before they break down, and on sewer pipes to more quickly detect leaks. The grandiose vision of smart-city champions, who walk away from any challenge that doesn't have a digital solution, threatens to distract us from practical measures.</p><p>For instance, if Toronto had an urban planning function worthy of the name, the city wouldn't be walled off from Lake Ontario by look-alike luxury condo towers.</p><p>And if three levels of government could agree on a world-class transportation system for Toronto, and release more than $20 billion designated for that purpose, we could solve a problem without handing Big Tech a billion-dollar payday. The same applies in the crisis of affordable housing. And a digital utopia is not required to get serious about energy-efficient retrofits of our buildings, one of the greatest blows we can strike in the fight global warming.</p><p>We're now faced with a tradeoff.</p><p>In effect, residents of cities that are candidates to be completely digitized are being asked to surrender their privacy and tax dollars so that a driver on the DVP can adjust the chlorine levels of his swimming pool with his smartphone.</p><p>We don't need smart cities. We need sensible cities, where such moronic trade-offs are laughed out of the room.</p><p>Twitter: @TheGrtRecession</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSTAR-2019072055114153</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSTAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WM3-CP41-DY91-K1BJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1081\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Toronto Star Newspapers Limited</copyright><publicationName>The Toronto Star</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 20, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>NEWSPAPER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>COLUMN</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0002R2W</classCode><className>SIEMENS AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC00028PZ</classCode><className>TELUS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000299K</classCode><className>GENERAL ELECTRIC CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0002D0X</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0001P56</classCode><className>CISCO SYSTEMS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The commission, chaired by former Obama administration chief economic adviser Jason Furman, found that Google, Amazon, and Facebook don't face enough competition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This shouldn't come as a surprise, given the recent attention on tech giants' business models by governments across the world. But this review is interesting not just for what it recommends, but what it doesn't - coming as it did just days after the Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren called for breaking up the tech giants and implementing utility-style regulation. Fellow Democrat Furman rejected Warren's proposals, instead opting for what he calls a \"pro-competition approach\" that targets barriers to entry and anti-competitive tactics, in order to undermine the factors that lead many digital markets to tip in favour of one big winner.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The problem with utility-style regulation, according to Furman, is that it accepts the monopoly position of the utility as a given and rejects the possibility of competition. In some cases, utility-style regulation is necessary (who expects competition in sewers?), but it should be seen as a last resort - regulated utilities rarely innovate.</p><p>The push to break up the tech giants has been driven by an influential group of young academics and activists. Big tech's hipster anti-trust critics argue that a narrow focus on consumer welfare by competition authorities has meant they've been blind to bad behaviour by the providers of free online services. They prefer the naive \"big is bad\" approach that was rejected in the 70s.</p><p>However, Furman argues that this is unnecessary. Keeping the consumer at the forefront of competition law still gives us reason to act when Google or Facebook engage in anti-competitive behaviour. After all, free services might be more innovative when facing competition. But we don't need to repeat the mistakes of the past by viewing all \"bigness\" with suspicion.</p><p>Instead, it makes a series of moderate recommendations, including calling for an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) into the digital advertising market and tighter controls on tech mergers.</p><p>Most significant is a call for a new digital markets unit within the CMA, tasked with setting up a \"code of competitive conduct\" for firms with \"strategic market status\", to make it easier for users to switch between products and move their data elsewhere.</p><p>While you already have a right to download your personal data from Facebook and Google under GDPR, it's not provided in a format that makes it easy to move over to other search engines or social media services. Some economists argue that the only way to break Facebook's stranglehold is to allow users to keep their contacts when they switch to a new service. There's precedent here: Instagram grew off the back of Twitter users' ability to port over data on who they followed. But we should be careful not to think of data portability as a panacea.</p><p>In the case of Facebook there's a risk that it might backfire. Most of your Facebook friends are people you knew offline first and are already in your phone's address book. You probably don't gain much from the ability to port over your Facebook friends onto another site, whereas if data portability goes both ways, it could end up helping Facebook more than it hurts it.</p><p>Nonetheless, it is interesting to see a state-backed review look at regulation from the perspective of users, rather taking the starting point that it is the size of these networks that is automatically the problem.</p><p>Interventions can have unintended consequences that undermine competition - GDPR, for instance, hit small adtech firms hardest, leading to increased market shares for Google and Facebook. What this industry needs is a pro-competition approach that tackles unnecessary barriers to entry. But to make it reality, governments will need to go after anti-competitive regulation too.</p><p>\u00a3 Sam Dumitriu is research director at The Entrepreneurs Network.</p><p>Don't repeat the mistakes of the past by viewing all 'bigness' with suspicion</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-147489723</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNV-FW21-JCBW-N2J6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"686\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 City A.M.

Although that advertising revenue has not necessarily been directly received from news content, there's basically no denying that people are drawn to their platforms, because it includes that news content.\"</p><p>Senator Patrick said threats by Google and Facebook to not publish Australian news and news snippets on their platforms were hollow. \"If they did (walk away) it isn't the end of the world, I think it would open up other opportunities for local players and that's not a bad thing.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUSTOL-92c9eb1832d2cff5e7168212142e024f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUSTOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V9-JCD1-JBR4-F269-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472302</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"750\"/><timeReceived>00:12 AEDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"464E\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 15, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The code simply aims to bring fairness and transparency to Facebook and Google's relationships with Australian news media businesses,\" Mr Sims said.</p><p>\"We note that according to the University of Canberra's 2020 Digital News Report, 39 per cent of Australians use Facebook for general news, and 49 per cent use Facebook for news about COVID-19.</p><p>\"As the ACCC and the government work to finalise the draft legislation, we hope all parties will engage in constructive discussions.\"</p><p>Professor Allan Fels, the former chair of the ACCC, told The Australian that instead of making threats, Facebook should engage in constructive discussions with the both the regulator and the government. </p><p>\"It's normal when the ACCC proposes action that those potentially affected threaten job losses, investment strikes, bankruptcy, withdrawal from the country and so on,\" he said. \"Experience shows that a smarter way to do business is to engage in serious negotiations with the ACCC. Usually the valid concerns are resolved.</p><p> \"The ACCC would clearly have been aware that Facebook and others have withdrawn in somewhat similar circumstances overseas and have framed a law that will be harder to avoid. \"Also they are carrying in their back pocket the option, if all else fails, of a general ten per cent tax on digital revenue and that would be a precedent the platforms would want to avoid.\"</p><p>Facebook's move comes after fellow tech giant  whenever they do a Google search, saying \"the way Aussies use Google is at risk\".</p><p>Google and Facebook will both be covered by the mandatory code announced last month, and will have to pay media outlets for news, and face fines of up to $10m if they fail to treat Australian media companies fairly.</p><p>The digital platforms will also be required to give media companies 28 days' notice if algorithm changes are likely to materially affect referral traffic to news, and publishers will need to be inform\u00aded of substantial changes to the display and presentation of news.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/google-a-suspect-in-scare-tactics/news-story/7008182b8f475ec0b922f7bca9f563dd\">The Australian reported last week</url> Senators and MPs had been flooded with emails, each containing the same body of text calling the mandatory bargaining code an \"assault on Australia's democracy\". </p><p/><p>Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has said the changes would address the \"very unequal bargaining position \u00adbetween Australian news media businesses that produce original content and the digital platforms\".</p><p>\"As the power, the wealth, the influence of these digital platforms, namely Google and Facebook, has grown, our regulatory framework has not kept up,\" the Treasurer said, adding that for every $100 spent in Australia's $9bn-a-year online advertising market, $47 went to Google, $24 to Facebook and $29 to other participants.</p><p>The pending bargaining code legislation is expected to have bipartisan support.

This has been the consistent response by 'Big Tech' where democratically elected governments have sought to protect the interests of their citizens,\" he said.</p><p>\"This builds on Facebook's refusal to ensure truth in political advertising or proactively moderate divisive and destructive content on its site.</p><p>\"In fact, if they follow through on this threat Facebook will removing trusted journalism from its site allowing disinformation and conspiracy theories to flourish.\"</p><p>The stand-off is also being watched globally. Facebook on Tuesday denied Australian media interviews, instead dropping news of its threats to US outlets, highlighting the global nature of what's at stake.</p><p>\"Facebook's threat to block real journalism from its properties is simply an attempt to bully the Australian government and legislature.

All I need to do is charge the device at home with electricity. </p><p>Now, it only takes around 15 minutes to get to work, compared to 30 minutes stuck on a bus during rush hour.'\u00e3\u20ac\u20acKim is just one of many South Koreans who view electric scooters as an effective way to commute to and from work or school. Together with recreational riders, e-mobility users like Kim are fueling the popularity of personal mobility devices, or PMDs, here.\u00e3\u20ac\u20acPMDs broadly refer to motorized, one-person vehicles powered by electricity, including standing electric scooters, two-wheeled Segways, hands-free hoverboards and electric bikes. \u00e3\u20ac\u20acThough varying by model, they can travel at a maximum speed of around 20 to 40 kilometers an hour. A standard e-scooter costs around 500,000 won ($450) at local retail prices.\u00e3\u20ac\u20acAnd demand for PMDs is growing quickly. According to the Korea Transport Institute, approximately 75,000 PMDs were sold here in 2017, up 20 percent from 60,000 units the previous year. By 2022, this number is expected to surpass 200,000 units, according to the institute. \u00e3\u20ac\u20acThough PMDs initially garnered interest as recreational devices in Korea, they are now perceived more as practical vehicles for commuting.\u00e3\u20ac\u20acAccording to a 2017 KTI survey of 150 personal mobility device users, 55.3 percent said they used PMDs as a means of commuting to work or school, exceeding those who were using them for recreational purposes (46.7 percent).\u00e3\u20ac\u20acDespite the growth, the regulations surrounding PMDs have been ambiguous, if not absent, leading to safety risks as well as widespread confusion among scooter riders, cars and pedestrians.\u00e3\u20ac\u20acIn Korea, most people ride their e-scooters on sidewalks or in a bike lane when available. Many ride them at public parks. Most people do not wear helmets, and few can be seen riding in the streets. \u00e3\u20ac\u20acHowever, this is all illegal according to Korea's transport regulations.\u00e3\u20ac\u20acThe Road Traffic Act categorizes PMDs as motorbikes, treating them similar to a standard motorcycle. This means the legal way to ride a PMD here is to stay in regular car lanes and wear a helmet. The rider must also be over the age of 16 and hold a two-wheeled motor vehicle driving license. \u00e3\u20ac\u20acIn reality, however, most e-mobility riders don't follow these rules, largely because they are unaware. Enforcement has been weak as well, with surveillance mostly limited to sporadic inspections at Seoul parks.\u00e3\u20ac\u20acThis legal stipulation itself is self-contradictory. While PMDs are required to travel within car lanes, there is no law mandating e-mobility devices obtain the governmental safety certification required of all vehicles on the roads.\u00e3\u20ac\u20acLegal issues aside, experts warn it is realistically dangerous to send e-scooter riders to the roads to travel next to regular cars that are going at much higher speeds. \u00e3\u20ac\u20ac'Personal mobility devices are here and growing in scope, but the regulations are not keeping pace, hurting both the industry and PMD riding culture,' said Kim Pil-su, an automotive engineering professor at Daelim University and chairman of the Korea Electric Vehicle Association. \u00e3\u20ac\u20ac'Asking PMD riders to travel on car lanes is like sending them out to die,' he said. 'The government needs to legislate clear rules on travel speed, permitted locations and driving qualifications for PMD vehicles by benchmarking successful models from overseas.'\u00e3\u20ac\u20acIn June 2017, local lawmakers proposed a revision to the Road Traffic Act to include legislation specific to personal mobility devices and the correct way to ride them. But the revision is still under consideration at the National Assembly.\u00e3\u20ac\u20acThe regulatory gap is hurting efforts to create an improved riding environment for PMDs as well. The Seoul Metropolitan Government announced plans last year to build specialized paths for PMDs such as e-scooters and Segways in test beds in Seoul by the end of this year. \u00e3\u20ac\u20acHowever, the city has had to halt the project for now, as it is waiting until the related regulations are formalized, a Seoul City official confirmed.\u00e3\u20ac\u20acUnder current circumstances, it is also difficult for Korea to accept dockless e-scooter sharing service models that are already popular overseas. It is a system where users can use an app to pay for, pick up and drop off any e-scooter distributed in an urban area.\u00e3\u20ac\u20acStartups pursuing this model, including Lime and Bird, currently operate in major cities in the US and Europe, though permit issues are being resolved in some locations.\u00e3\u20ac\u20acLime and Bird have also been garnering interest from big tech investors, raising millions of dollars in funding from firms like Uber and Alphabet to secure a valuation of $1 billion or more.\u00e3\u20ac\u20acBy Sohn Ji-young (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jys@heraldcorp.com\">jys@heraldcorp.com</email>)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHERLD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHERLD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T3H-D1D1-JCF4-M258-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"923\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Korea Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>THE KOREA HERALD</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 23, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Bicycles</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzI1NzcxRjQ3QTQxNEVBOTg5RDFFRkYyRTM3QzdENkI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUI2RkNERjc3QTRCNEEyRkI5QkQwRTRFMzFBQkUxMjA</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzlBQTcxNUI4NTU0NDdGQkE4MjE1NTA0QjU1RTVDNjY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjY1RENBNzc2NUE5NDgzOEI1MDEwMDVFMjI4QjFDMDQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Issuance &amp;

Some Game of Thrones prequel news[2] to hold you off. Just a story of two people on the internet ruining a stranger's life[3] for no particular reason. Home runs lost to history[4] because games were rained out. </p><p>In a slightly different universe, Babe Ruth has 716, Hank Aaron has 756, and Roger Maris had 62 in 1961. 'Brushing past the fact that, even without the Doctor, male role models are still vastly overrepresented in almost all industries including pop culture, this statement rests on the sexist belief[5] that women cannot be role models for boys or men.' There will be a documentary[6] made about the 'Cajun Navy'. So, how's that Brexit[7] going? 'Bigfoot has become a hot topic[8] in Virginia's 5th Congressional District race.' 'Now, Fin must travel back in time to stop the Sharknado[9] that started it all'. Please don't cybersquat on Prince[10]. I shouldn't even have to say these things. 'That means there is no way to oppose abortion in 2018 without supporting the punishment of women[11] who terminate their pregnancies.' 'Here are five key ways to identify possible bots[12] in your Twitter feed'. Welcome to Fantasy Island - The Movie[13]. The case for deleting[14] your old tweets. 'In a policy paper obtained by Axios, Sen. Mark Warner's office laid out 20 different paths to address problems posed by Big Tech platforms[15] \u2014 ranging from putting a price on individual users' data to funding media literacy programs.' A profile of Kris Kobach[16], the Harold Hill of immigrant hatred. 'North Korea has almost certainly not sent back anything close to 200 bodies[17]. In the past, the regime has promised to return the remains of servicemen, but actually handed over unidentifiable bones of many people and some animals.' 'With Donald Trump's former campaign chairman on trial, America is reckoning with its very serious kleptocracy problem[18].' 'Telling people how to use their 3D printers in a way that would allow them to circumvent air safety restrictions, should they want to do so for whatever reason, is not speech that deserves a high level of protection[19]. It's not political speech, it's not comedic speech, it's not even commercial speech. It's just some dangerous crap somebody wants to put on the internet.' 'Do we remember that Mike Pence was Paul Manafort's choice[20] for Veep?' All dogs deserve to have a quince\u00f1era[21] when they turn 15.

His list of b\u00eates noires is so long and ludicrous, people tend to assume he makes half of it up, but he has always sworn he means every rant sincerely. The jewel in the arch-controversialist\"s crown though is his friendship with President Trump.</p><p>In the upside-down world of the coronavirus crisis, however, Morgan has emerged as something approaching a national hero in his efforts to speak truth to obfuscating power.</p><p>He\"s also turned on Trump.</p><p>So how would he feel if Trump unfollowed him on Twitter?.</p><p>\"I\"d be fine,\" he says shortly. \"Given the scale of this crisis, I literally don\"t give a flying f***.\"</p><p>Decca Aitkenhead of The Times talks to Morgan about why he doesn\"t think Trump should be re-elected.</p><p>A \"very, very messy\" process: How pandemics end</p><p>When will the Covid-19 pandemic end? And how?</p><p>According to historians, pandemics typically have two types of endings: the medical, which occurs when the incidence and death rates plummet, and the social, when the epidemic of fear about the disease wanes.</p><p>But for whom does it end, and who gets to decide? The New York Times reports.</p><p>What happens if we get a vaccine and people won\"t take it?</p><p>All the misinformation we\"ve seen so far during the Covid-19 pandemic - the false rumours that 5G cellphone towers fuel the coronavirus, that drinking bleach or injecting UV rays can cure it, that Dr Anthony Fauci is part of an anti-Trump conspiracy - may be just the warm-up act for a much bigger information war when an effective vaccine becomes available to the public.</p><p>This war could pit public health officials and politicians against an anti-vaccination movement that floods social media with misinformation, conspiracy theories and propaganda aimed at convincing people that the vaccine is a menace rather than a lifesaving, economy-rescuing miracle.</p><p>The New York Times looks at how social media is already filling up with misinformation about a Covid-19 vaccine, months or years before one even exists.</p><p>Jerry Seinfeld is making peace with nothing: I\"m \"post-show business\"</p><p>Many of us have been wondering lately what Jerry Seinfeld, the sitcom character, would be doing in this current era of home quarantines and social distancing: how his extreme fastidiousness, self-centredness and constant scrutiny of quotidian details (not to mention the hyperbolic traits of his fictional friends and neighbours) would be stretched to hilarious extremes in an environment of isolation and anxiety.</p><p>However, the real Jerry Seinfeld - the one who gave up the sitcom long ago to focus on an occasional talk show and a peerless stand-up career - is not the same guy.</p><p>In a wide-ranging interview from his home quarantine, the comedian tell The New York Times why his new Netflix special may be his last.</p><p>Why the coming emerging markets debt crisis will be messy</p><p>Zambia, Ecuador and Rwanda have all announced in recent weeks that they are struggling to repay their debts. Lebanon has already kicked off its restructuring process, while Argentina, which was battling its creditors even before the pandemic struck, appears to be heading for its ninth sovereign default since independence in 1816. Investors believe many other developing countries are not too far behind.</p><p>The Financial Times looks at how large investment funds could play hardball with developing countries that default.</p><p>Big tech has crushed the news business. That\"s about to change</p><p>It reads like a coroner\"s report on the news business, 623 pages filled with charts and graphs detailing the devastating decline in local news and public policy reporting of the past decade. It landed on the Australian prime minister\"s desk last summer, unnoticed by most news consumers in America and around the world.</p><p>But the report by Australian regulators left little doubt about what they see as the cause of local journalism\"s demise - the near monopolistic power of Google and Facebook. And it has set off a chain of events that could shift the balance of power between big tech and the news at a dire moment for journalism.</p><p>The New York Times looks at how news organisations are moving to make tech platforms pay them for news.</p><p>Covid-19 crisis: Does value investing still make sense?</p><p>Value investing has gone through several bouts of existential angst over the past century, and always comes back strongly. But its poor performance during the coronavirus crisis has only added to the crisis of confidence. The strength and length of the recent woes raises some thorny questions. Why has value lost its mojo and is it gone forever?</p><p>The Financial Times looks at how the strategy that once worked for Warren Buffett has performed badly.</p><p>Born into carnage, 18 Afghan babies face an uncertain fate</p><p>When the carnage was over, the dead bodies bagged and the guns put away, what was left behind spoke of the true extent of the tragedy: 18 newborn babies, many covered in blood and most now motherless - casualties of war before they had even left the hospital.</p><p>Even for a country steeped in violent death to the point of numbness,the assault on a maternity clinic in Kabul on Tuesday was unfathomable in its cruelty.</p><p>But what do you do with so many babies, all too similar in their little shapes and raw faces, most of them now without the first people in their lives and evacuated from a blown-up hospital?</p><p>The New York Times looks at how authorities are struggling to reconnect the children with families.</p><p>Quarantining with a ghost? It\"s scary</p><p>For those whose experience of self-isolation involves what they believe to be a ghost, their days are punctuated not just by Zoom meetings or home schooling but by disembodied voices, shadowy figures, misbehaving electronics, invisible cats cozying up on couches, caresses from hands that aren\"t there and even, in some cases - to borrow the technical parlance of Ghostbusters - free-floating, full-torso vaporous apparitions.</p><p>Some of these people are frightened, of course. Others say they just appreciate the company.</p><p>The New York Times looks at how the pandemic has been less isolating than some people bargained for.</p><p>Latin America\"s outbreaks rival Europe\"s. But its options are worse</p><p>Deaths doubled in Lima, rivalling the worst month of the pandemic in Paris. They tripled in Manaus, a metropolis tucked deep in Brazil\"s Amazon - a surge similar to what London and Madrid endured.</p><p>In Guayaquil, a port city in Ecuador, the sudden spike in fatalities in April was comparable to what New York City experienced during its worst month: more than five times the number of people died than in previous years.</p><p>An analysis by The New York Times found some cities in Latin America have seen increases in death matching the worst of the pandemic anywhere else.</p><p>The devastation there offers a glimpse into the damage the virus can inflict in developing nations.</p><p>China is defensive. The US is absent. Can the rest of the world fill the void?</p><p>Confronting a once-in-a-generation crisis, the world\"s middle powers are urgently trying to revive the old norms of can-do multilateralism.</p><p>Countries in Europe and Asia are forging new bonds on issues like public health and trade, planning for a future built on what they see as the pandemic\"s biggest lessons: that the risks of China\"s authoritarian government can no longer be denied, and that the United States cannot be relied on to lead when it\"s struggling to keep people alive and working, and its foreign policy is increasingly \"America first.\"</p><p>The New York Times explores how smaller countries like Australia are trying to build a new kind of alliance, by first investigating what went wrong in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZHRLD-12332029</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZHRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YX3-2681-JCBG-G10Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257912</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1355\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The New Zealand Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New Zealand Herald</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 15, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp;

Sadiq Khan acknowledges that lockdown has taken a toll on him.</p><p>\"I\"ve found it really tough. So, for eight weeks I didn\"t leave, literally, my home and Tooting Common. That\"s it. I thrive on company, on being out and about. And I was struggling.\" It seriously affected his mental health? \"I\"ve got no doubt it did. In the sense of just feeling a bit down. There are days when I\"m not providing proper leadership. I definitely ... I felt fragile.</p><p>Khan tells Decca Aitkenhead of The Times about his self-doubt, his hopes for post-lockdown London and why he feels \"stitched up\" by the government.</p><p>Wall St, bribery and an opioid epidemic: Inside story of a disgraced drugmaker</p><p>The opioid epidemic has shaped America. There have been 750,000 overdose deaths since the crisis began in 1999, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and about two-thirds involved an opioid.</p><p>Many people hooked on illegal opioids start on painkillers prescribed by doctors. At first, marketers convinced some physicians that opioids were not as addictive as previously thought. But in some regions, the abuse became brazen.</p><p>Executives from Insys, the maker of a drug containing fentanyl, have become the first pharmaceutical bosses to be handed prison time for their role in the epidemic.</p><p>Why were the warning signs around Insys ignored for so long? The FT and PBS series Frontline investigate.</p><p>Can the German economy pull Europe out of the coronavirus crisis?</p><p>Just like most of its neighbours, Germany has been ravaged by a global health emergency that has left devastation in its wake. It is facing the worst recession in its postwar history, with rising unemployment and collapsing exports and manufacturing output. The mood among Germany\"s captains of industry is bleak.</p><p>Yet Germany could still end up recovering from its downturn far faster than most of its neighbours.</p><p>The Financial Times looks at how the ability of \"Mittelstand\" companies to adapt means it is well placed to resume its role as the continent\"s economic motor.</p><p>Don\"t talk weather with Granny, talk parties, snogging and Tinder</p><p>When I talk to older people, I find myself sticking to neutral subjects out of an innate desire not to shock them. Staying off Tinder and on the weather just seems more respectful. It\"s just the way things are: everyone speaks differently to their grandmother than to their friends.</p><p>Why, though?</p><p>Louise Callaghan of The Times explains why we should break down the pointless barriers we put up between generations.</p><p>When the soldiers meant to protect you instead come to kill</p><p>Over the past four years, Burkina Faso has fallen into chaos, with gunmen robbing, killing and threatening some of the poorest citizens in this landlocked West African nation, and causing 850,000 to flee their homes.</p><p>Some of the gunmen are terrorists, loosely allied with the Islamic State group or al-Qaida.</p><p>Some are bandits.</p><p>Some are vigilantes.</p><p>It is seldom spoken of, and the government denies it, but some are soldiers in Burkina Faso\"s armed forces.</p><p>The New York Times travelled to the country\"s volatile far north to investigate the abuses.</p><p>Dressing up again? Fashion tries to recover from \"brutal\" crisis</p><p>The gradual end of lockdowns across Europe and the US is providing some much-needed respite for fashion retailers. In England, where shops reopened this week, long queues outside Primark and other stores hinted at the potential for considerable pent-up demand.</p><p>However, across the industry, from bargain stores on the high street to luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton, the impact of Covid-19 has been severe, upending an industry dependent on global supply chains, healthy levels of discretionary spending and tourism, and brick-and-mortar stores.</p><p>So how will an industry dependent on tourism and high spending recover? The Financial Times reports.</p><p>Prospering in the pandemic: The top 100 companies - Part 1</p><p>In a dismal year for most companies, a minority have shone: pharmaceutical groups boosted by their hunt for a Covid-19 vaccine; technology giants buoyed by the trend for working from home; and retailers offering lockdown necessities online.</p><p>Public companies had the tailwind of a surprisingly robust stock market - which many believe is a bubble.</p><p>The Financial Times has ranked the top 100 companies to prosper during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>ALSO READ:</p><p>  Prospering in the pandemic: The top 100 companies - Part 2</p><p>Who\"s in the running to be Joe Biden\"s Vice President?</p><p>Joe Biden is deep into his search for a running mate. The process began with a list of more than a dozen potential candidates, all of them women. His team has narrowed that list, conducting multiple interviews and collecting sensitive personal documents from a number of the most important contenders.</p><p>The New York Times looks at the 12 women who have been under consideration by Joe Biden, and why each might be chosen - and might not be.</p><p>How the world is learning to live with a deadly pandemic</p><p>China is testing restaurant workers and delivery drivers block by block. South Korea tells people to carry two types of masks for differing risky social situations. Germany requires communities to crack down when the number of infections hits certain thresholds. Britain will target local outbreaks in a strategy that Prime Minister Boris Johnson calls \"Whac-A-Mole.\"</p><p>Around the world, governments that had appeared to tame the coronavirus are adjusting to the reality that the disease is here to stay.</p><p>The New York Times looks at how officials around the world are turning to targeted and fast-but-flexible approaches to stop third or fourth waves.</p><p>Wirecard: The rise and fall of a German tech icon</p><p>How did the payments group became one of the hottest stocks in Europe while battling persistent allegations of fraud?</p><p>The Financial Times provides a detailed timeline of the company\"s rise and fall.</p><p>What\"s Facebook\"s deal with Donald Trump?</p><p>Have Mark Zuckerberg and President Donald Trump reached some kind of accommodation?</p><p>Zuckerberg needs, and appears to be getting, a pass both on angry tweets from the president and the serious threats of lawsuits and regulation that face other big tech companies.

JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) broke out as financials hiked\u00a0buybacks and dividends after passing stress tests. And Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) dropped its plan to buy Rite Aid (RAD).</p><h>Market Uptrend Under Pressure As Techs Dive</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The major market averages retreated during a volatile week, with big tech-led sell-offs on Tuesday and Thursday surrounding a Wednesday rally. The Nasdaq fell 2% for the week dropping below its 50-day moving average. Microsoft and Alphabet (which got a big EU fine) were among the many top techs\u00a0joining Apple below that key level.The Dow industrials and S&amp;P 500 index retreated 0.2% and 0.6%, respectively. Financials such as JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) rallied after announcing big shareholder return plans following the second round of annual stress tests. Energy stocks rose as oil prices climbed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hawkish comments from European Central Bank chief <person><nameText>Mario Draghi </nameText></person>lifted the euro and eurozone bond yields, pushing up U.S. Treasury rates and pressuring stocks.</p><p>The market direction was downgraded to \"uptrend under pressure.\"</p><h>Inflation Weakens</h><p>The U.S. economy grew at 1.4% in the first quarter, revised up from the 1.2% prior estimate, the Commerce Department reported. Consumer spending rose at a 1.1% rate, revised up from 0.6%. Economists expect growth near 3% in the just-ending second quarter, resulting in a steady but unimpressive 2.2% rate for the first half of the year. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's primary inflation gauge, the PCE price index, rose just 1.4% from a year ago in May, down from the 2.1% annual gain in February. Core PCE inflation, stripping out food and energy, slipped to 1.4% from 1.8% in February, undercutting the case for near-term rate hikes.</p><h>Draghi Signals Bond-Buying Bye-Bye</h><p>European Central Bank President <person><nameText>Mario Draghi </nameText></person>put investors on notice that his days of bond buying to boost the economy and elevate asset prices are winding down. Stock prices took a tumble, particularly technology stocks, after Draghi's Tuesday speech that economists interpreted as a signal that the ECB will begin to taper off its bond purchases by the start of 2018. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve chief <person><nameText>Janet Yellen </nameText></person>and Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer both talked about fairly rich equity prices as the U.S. central bank gears up to begin slowly unwinding its financial crisis asset purchases later this year. The takeaway: Less supportive central banks will be a headwind for stocks, but not a hurricane, as long as policymakers don't move too fast.</p><p>RELATED:</p><p/><h>Payouts Follow Stress Tests</h><p>The Federal Reserve OK'd JPMorgan, Citigroup and all other large U.S. banks to move forward with their dividend and buyback increases after the central bank released results from part two of its annual stress tests. Most banks quickly announced big shareholder returns, sending their shares higher. Capital One Financial (COF) will need to resubmit its capital plan by Dec. 28 to \"address weaknesses\" in its planning procedures. The Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review \u2014 evaluated banks' capital cushions, risk management procedures and payout plans. Banks cleared the first round of tests earlier in June.</p><p>RELATED:</p><p/><h>EU Fines Google $2.7 Billion</h><p>The European Union said\u00a0the Google parent skewed search results to benefit its own shopping search service vs. those of rivals. Alphabet must end the offending practices within 90 days or face further penalties. The impact to Google's Product Listing Ads (PLA) revenue is not clear, depending on what remedies the internet search giant takes. The EU is also probing Google's Android operating system, its AdSense online ad service and Google Maps. One wild card is the Trump administration's reaction. The Federal Trade Commission in 2013 ended an investigation into Google's business practices after the internet search giant agreed to some voluntary changes to its practices.</p><h>Google, Apple Team Up With Rental Car Firms</h><p>Shares of car rental companies jumped on Monday amid reports that Avis Budget Group (CAR) inked a deal to manage a car fleet for Waymo, the self-driving tech unit of Alphabet (GOOGL). Hertz (HTZ) got an extra pop later in the day on reports said Apple AAPL was leasing a handful of its cars to test self-driving technology. It's not clear how much of a financial boost the rental car firms would get.</p><h>Walgreens, Rite Aid Go Halfsies</h><p>Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) scrapped its bid to acquire Rite Aid (RAD). But it announced a deal in which Walgreens would pay $5.18 billion for 2,186 Rite Aid stores, or roughly half of the total. The new deal is expected to close in six months. It would follow months of attempts to ease regulators' concerns that the merger would not harm competition and reports on the merger's prospects that whiplashed Rite Aid's stock. Rite Aid also pulled out of a deal with Fred's (FRED), the pharmacy chain set to receive hundreds of Rite Aid stores under the merger agreement with Walgreens. Walgreens rose 1.7% on Thursday. Investors fear Rite Aid and Fred's may be too small to be competitive. Rite Aid crashed 26.5% on Thursday to its worst levels in nearly four years. Fred's tumbled 23%.</p><p>RELATED:</p><p/><h>Stand Up For This Sit-Down Chain</h><p>Olive Garden parent Darden Restaurants (DRI) logged a 7% EPS gain on 8% sales growth to $1.93 billion, besting expectations Overall same-store sales grew 3.3%, including a 4.4% comp gain at Olive Garden.

Sales rose 92% to $5.57 billion. Analysts expected $1.51 and $5.41 billion. For the current quarter, Micron expects to earn $1.80 a share excluding items, reversing a year-earlier loss of 5 cents, on sales of $5.9 billion, up 83%, based on the midpoint of its guidance. Wall Street was modeling for $1.57 and $5.62 billion.</p><p>Analysts hailed the results and guidance, but Micron shares fell 5.1% on Friday, dropping below their buy point..</p><h>Western Digital-Toshiba Saga</h><p>Western Digital (WDC) resubmitted a bid to acquire the memory chip business of Toshiba that the two jointly run. Japan-based Toshiba wants to sell the unit to a consortium that includes Korea-based SK Hynix and Bain Capital Japan, which reportedly bid $19 billion. Western Digital gained a stake in the operation via its $15.8 billion SanDisk acquisition and says Toshiba can't sell the unit without its OK. Toshiba sued Western Digital for $1 billion. Western Digital also raised earnings guidance but left revenue targets intact.</p><h>Blue Apron IPO Disappoints</h><p>The initial public offering of Blue Apron (APRN) fell flat, with shares pricing at the low end of a downwardly revised range. Blue Apron traded flat in Thursday's debut and fell to 9.34 on Friday. Blue Apron was one of nine companies that schedule an IPO this past week, most of which struggled. A top performer was Dova Pharmaceuticals (DOVA), which opened for a 13% gain and jumped nearly 12% Friday.</p><h>Merck Drug Fails To Impress Investors</h><p>Dow component Merck (MRK) said Tuesday its cholesterol-reducing drug, anacetrapid, was able to reduce heart attacks, cardiac death and the need for certain heart surgery in patients already on cholesterol-lowering statins. But anacetrapid built up in fat tissue and, unlike similar studies, Merck didn't test the effect of anacetrapid on reducing the risk of strokes. Esperion Therapeutics (ESPR) stock, though, broke out Wednesday after it announced a trial combining its bempedoic acid with anacetrapid to lower \"bad' cholesterol.</p><h>KB Home Earnings Strong</h><p>KB Home (KBH) Q2 results beat analysts expectations with earnings up 94% to 33 cents and revenue up 24% to $1 billion.

On Monday, legislation to\u00a0force\u00a0the Prime Minister to request an extension to Article 50, unless the Commons approves either an agreed deal or No Deal before 19 October, received Royal Assent. MPs also rejected his attempt to call a general election for 15 October, which could have allowed him to circumvent the extension Act if he won a majority.\u00a0This has narrowed Johnson\u2019s\u00a0options. Unless he manages to agree and pass a deal before 19 October, he will almost certainly face an unpalatable trilemma: ask for an extension (and break his promise); refuse to ask for an extension (and break the law); or resign as Prime Minister. A deal would offer him a way out \u2013 but what are the prospects of reaching one that Parliament can support?</p><p><br/>Arriving in No 10 back in July, Johnson\u2019s proposal for reaching such a deal was to remove the contentious backstop negotiated under Theresa May completely.\u00a0Writing\u00a0to European Council President Donald Tusk later in August, Johnson suggested \u201calternative ways [to the backstop] of managing the customs and regulatory differences\u201d post-Brexit must be considered, and that the negotiations should turn towards agreeing alternative arrangements to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Yet there was little detail\u00a0on what such proposals might include at the time.<br/>This week, some details of\u00a0alternative proposals\u00a0have emerged, but it seems the UK and the EU are talking at cross purposes. On the UK side, Johnson has\u00a0held talks\u00a0with Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader, Arlene Foster, regarding the possibility of replacing the backstop with an all-Ireland zone for\u00a0agri-food products\u00a0and an enhanced \u201cStormont lock\u201d, which would\u00a0allow the Northern Ireland Assembly to have a say\u00a0in any changes to existing\u00a0regulatory\u00a0arrangements. Some commentators have interpreted this as a softening of Johnson\u2019s position, demonstrating his willingness to consider retaining aspects of the backstop.<br/>The EU side appear to agree with this interpretation, with its newly nominated trade Commissioner, Phil Hogan, a member of\u00a0Leo Varadkar\u2019s\u00a0Fine Gael\u00a0party,\u00a0saying\u00a0the proposal of an all-Ireland agri-food zone \u201cis certainly a clear indication of divergence between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, the EU and the rest of the UK. If we can build on that we certainly might get closer to one another in terms of a possible outcome.\u201d However, Hogan added that though there was \u201cmovement happening on both sides,\u201d Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was looking to \u201crevisit\u201d the Northern Ireland-only backstop,\u00a0originally proposed by the EU (and rejected by the UK) in March 2018.<br/>Talk\u00a0of a Northern Ireland-only backstop\u00a0as an alternative to the current deal, however, seems difficult to reconcile with the parliamentary arithmetic. As Open Europe\u2019s Dominic Walsh\u00a0writes\u00a0in this week\u2019s New Statesman, it is highly likely that such a proposal would be whole-heartedly\u00a0opposed by the DUP and a number of Conservative MPs \u2013\u00a0for many, it would arguably be a worse outcome than the existing backstop, as it would mean Northern Ireland would be separated from Great Britain for customs purposes as well as regulations. The core difficulty in striking a deal is, as it has always been, the question of how to develop a mechanism whereby the whole UK can leave the customs union without creating a customs border on the island of Ireland.<br/>It has been argued by some that, as the Government now has no majority anyway, it no longer needs to seek a deal that the DUP could back \u2013 and should instead look for support among Labour MPs who are now ready to back the deal.\u00a0But a Northern Ireland-only backstop would be worse than the current deal for many in this group too; it would give a Conservative majority government the ability to pursue a Canada-style Brexit for Great Britain, which is precisely the opposite of what even Brexit-reconciled Labour MPs want. In theory, Labour MPs might reluctantly support such a deal over No Deal or No Brexit; but with No Deal on 31 October unlikely, and an election around the corner, it is unclear whether they would have an incentive to do so.<br/>To fulfil his promise of leaving on 31 October, Johnson has a strong incentive to find a deal that Parliament can support. It is not clear, however, that reviving the Northern Ireland-only backstop proposal would secure the parliamentary support Johnson requires to pass a deal. Indeed, on most measures, it might be even more difficult to ratify than the previous deal.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">News in brief</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1.\u00a0Government publishes \u201creasonable worst case\u201d No Deal planning assumptions</emphasis><br/>Last night the Government published an \u201cOperation Yellowhammer\u201d\u00a0document revealing its reasonable worst case planning assumptions for its No Deal Brexit preparations after a \u201chumble address\u201d motion requesting the document was passed by Parliament on Monday. The Government\u2019s worst-case assumptions include rising food and fuel princes, civil disorder on streets, and disruption to trade with EU member states. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, who is in charge of No Deal planning,\u00a0said\u00a0this morning that the assumptions \u201care produced so Government can make plans and take steps in order to mitigate any of those consequences. And over the course of the last six weeks, this Government has taken considerable steps in order to ensure that, if there is a No Deal scenario, we can leave in the safest and smoothest possible way.\u201d<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Two members of the Government resign</emphasis><br/>Two members of the Government have resigned in the last week. The first was Jo Johnson, the Universities Minister and young brother of the Prime Minister, who stepped down last Thursday due to\u00a0being\u00a0\u201ctorn between family loyalty and the national interest.\u201d The second was Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd, who\u00a0said\u00a0she \u201cno longer believe[d] leaving with a deal is the Government\u2019s main objective,\u201d and cited her opposition to the Government\u2019s decision to remove the whip from 21 of her Conservative colleagues. Rudd also resigned the party whip.<br/>Elsewhere, The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow,\u00a0announcedon Monday that he would stand down as both the speaker and an MP at either the next election or on 31 October, whichever arrives first, adding it would be the \u201cleast disruptive and most democratic\u201d option.<br/>Meanwhile, the Chief Whip last night sent letters to the 21 Conservative MPs who were expelled from the party last week after voting against the Government on legislation which sought to force the Prime Minister to request an extension to Article 50. The letters\u00a0reportedly\u00a0set out an appeal process available to the group, offering them a way back into the party. However, at least three versions of the letter were sent differing in their welcome tone.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Scottish court rules prorogation is unlawful</emphasis><br/>Yesterday Scotland\u2019s highest court\u00a0ruled\u00a0that Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation of Parliament, which started at the end of business on Monday, was unlawful. The Edinburgh Court of Session, that ruled on the matter, said the decision was \u201cmotivated by the improper purpose of stymying Parliament.\u201d The ruling differs from that of the London High Court released on Wednesday that said suspending Parliament was an \u201cinherently political\u201d matter that could not be reviewed by the court. The Supreme Court, which decides legal matter across the UK, will start hearings on the case on Tuesday.<br/>Separately, a Northern Irish court\u00a0ruled\u00a0today that prorogation would not undermine agreements between the UK and Irish governments agreed during the peace process.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4. UK agrees</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0trade continuity with six Southern African nations</emphasis><br/>On Tuesday the\u00a0Government\u00a0reached an \u201cagreement in principle\u201d with the South African Customs Union and Mozambique that would allow businesses to continue trading on the preferential terms they currently trade on after Brexit.\u00a00.7% of UK exports\u00a0in 2017 were to countries covered by the agreement.<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5. EU Commission announced nominations for commissioners</emphasis><br/>Incoming European Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, announced her nominations for the 26 EU commissioners on Tuesday. Notable nominations include Danish\u00a0Margrethe Vestager\u00a0who will remain as the competition commissioner, after taking a tough stance on big tech companies, and Irish\u00a0Phil Hogan\u00a0as the trade commissioner, who is an ally of Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. The European Parliament will have to approve the whole College of Commissioners.Open Europe in the media<br/>Open Europe\u2019s Acting Director,\u00a0Stephen Booth, told\u00a0Sky News, \u201cI think it\u2019s nigh on impossible now [to negotiate with the European Union] because what the EU was always going to do was see what happened here in Parliament and Parliament has effectively said we\u2019re not willing to implement the result if the result is No Deal. I think the Prime Minister is right to say to some degree that it is difficult to go into negotiations with the other side if they believe ultimately that you\u2019re not going to leave.\u201d<br/>Dominic Walsh\u00a0took a further look at the parliamentary obstacles to a Northern Ireland-only backstop in an\u00a0article\u00a0for the New Statesman. He writes, \u201cFor many MPs, Conservative, DUP and Labour alike, a Northern Ireland-only backstop would not just be a bad deal, but worse than the deal that many of them have already rejected.\u201d Walsh also\u00a0told\u00a0TRT, \u201cThe opposition parties have made a big gamble. They\u2019ve assumed that by forcing Boris Johnson to break his promise of breaking his promise of leaving the EU by the 31 October, the Conservative Party will then lose votes to the Brexit Party in any election that follows\u2026 But the question then is: do the Brexit party actually blame Boris Johnson, or do they blame the MPs who passed this law that tied his hands?\u201d<br/>Pieter Cleppe\u00a0wrote in the\u00a0Daily Telegraph, \u201cAlthough the PM has moved on food checks in the Irish Sea, the EU and the Irish government have not softened their positions; they are still simply repeating that they are open to the idea of going back to the original Northern Ireland-only backstop.\u201d Cleppe also gave\u00a0evidence\u00a0to the House of Lords Internal Market Sub-Committee, spoke to Belgian TV Programme\u00a0De Zevende Dag,\u00a0and was interviewed by Dutch newspaper\u00a0Trouw.<br/>Anna Nadibaidze\u00a0was quoted in\u00a0La Razon\u00a0Spanish newspaper saying, \u201cIn order for the extension to be granted, [the EU27] will want to know what is the purpose of the extension, whether Boris Johnson is serious about getting a deal and whether he can guarantee this deal will pass Parliament. At the moment the EU thinks that Johnson is not looking for a deal, and is suspicious of making concessions, because he has lost his majority and so any new agreement risks not being ratified by the UK Parliament.\u201d<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CETWEN-74967</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CETWEN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1T-RWC1-JBJN-M36D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468581</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1823\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Content Engine, LLC.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Open Europe, Great Britain All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Open Europe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 12, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp;

The tech giant joins a recent trend of Silicon Valley companies entering the financial sector. 'Last year, Amazon had reportedly been in talks with J.P. Morgan over a checking account. Apple launched a credit card for iPhone users earlier this year with Goldman Sachs. </p><p>Uber announced its push into financial services last month, and just Tuesday Facebook announced a new system to facilitate payments across its social media and messaging systems,' CNBC writes.[1]  These efforts have faced obstacles, reports CNBC[2]. Apple created tension with its partner Goldman Sachs after advertising its new credit card as being created without the help of a bank. Facebook's digital currency libra spawned regulatory concerns, causing an exodus of financial backers. Google hopes its entrance into consumer banking will go more smoothly. Google launched Google Wallet in 2011, so the financial-services industry isn't new for the behemoth. It now aims to offer bank accounts run by Citigroup Inc. and a credit union at Stanford University, reports The Wall Street Journal[3]. Big Tech has recently faced scrutiny due to privacy concerns, so Google will have to convince users that it can be trusted with their finances and personal data. Virginia Senator Mark Warner has been closely following this trend of tech companies entering the financial sector with skepticism. 'I'm concerned when we got, whether it's libra or the Google proposal, these giant tech platforms entering into new fields before there are some regulatory rules of the road. Because once they get in, the ability to extract them out is going to be virtually impossible,' said Warner[4]. However, Google claims to want to put the financial institutions it's partnering with, not itself, front and center. Says Google executive Caesar Sengupta[5], 'Our approach is going to be to partner deeply with banks and the financial system.' As people rarely switch checking accounts, these bank accounts could provide Google with a treasure trove of information, including access to how much money people make and where they spend it, reports the Journal[6]. Mr. Sengupta says that this information would not be sold to advertisers, but would instead be used to bring value to consumers, including loyalty programs. Consulting firm McKinsey .... released a survey stating 58% of people would trust Google with their finances, which was better than Apple and Facebook but not Amazon, reports the Journal[7]. With their eyes on the millions of users Silicon Valley can access, banks are trying to figure out how to best partner with tech companies in order to grow and remain competitive. Says Citigroup's US consumer bank head, Anand Selva[8], 'We have to be where our consumers are.' Sectors: The average momentum score for the Sector Benchmark ETFs[9] decreased from 17.36 to 15.91. Momentum increased for six of the 11 sectors last week. Technology's momentum score jumped 6 points, the largest increase of the week. Utilities, which lost 14 points, had the largest drop in momentum score for the week. Technology overtook Financials for the top spot, while Utilities remained the laggard. Factors: Among the Factor Benchmark ETFs[10], the average factor score increased from 18.92 to 19.17. Momentum increased in six of the 12 factors last week. Momentum, which gained 4 points, had the largest increase in momentum score for the week. Quality remained neutral. Dividend Growth, which lost 4 points, had the largest drop in momentum score for the week. Value remained in the top spot, and Low Volatility remained at the bottom. Global: The average Global Benchmark ETF[11] momentum score decreased from 24.09 to 20.00 for the week. Momentum in the global sector decreased in all but two of 11 regions last week. Latin America, which lost 23 points, had the largest decrease in momentum score for the week. This plunged Latin America into last place. Japan remained in first place despite a 2-point decrease in momentum score.

Early returns suggest that my prior years of springtime toil have led to less chickweed, so I've got that going for me. 3/11/2019: How traffic lights might talk to your next car[2], Yahoo Finance I spent a few days driving around D.C. and northern Virginia in an A8 that Audi loaned to test its Traffic Light Information system. The whole experience got a little more terrifying when I looked at the spec sheet for the loaner vehicle and realized that I was trying test-driving Audi's stoplight-to-car data service in a sedan with a list price above six figures. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://robpegoraro.com/2019/03/17/weekly-output-audi-stoplight-smarts-big-tech-banter-at-sxsw-sxsw-strangeness-facebook-outage-spotify-vs-apple/usat-sxsw-2019-post/3/13/2019:\">https://robpegoraro.com/2019/03/17/weekly-output-audi-stoplight-smarts-big-tech-banter-at-sxsw-sxsw-strangeness-facebook-outage-spotify-vs-apple/usat-sxsw-2019-post/3/13/2019:</url> Breaking up Big Tech: Advocates spar over how to trim sails of technology giants at SXSW[3], USA Today I did not get to as manySXSW[4]panels as I wanted, but I did watch the session featuring Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D.-Mass.). Warren advocated forced break-ups of tech giants, and over the next several days multiple SXSW speakers took it to task. The critiques you'll see in USAT comments on this piece, however, amount to trash. 3/13/2019: SXSW 2019: Synthetic sushi, a buggy demo, and other weird gadgets[5], Yahoo Finance I didn't even have the SXSW trade-show exhibits on my must-see list until meeting a friend for lunch, at which point he strongly suggested I check out Sushi Singularity. He was right. 3/14/2019: Facebook outage, Al Jazeera[6] The Arabic-language news channel had me on to talk about the Wednesday outage of Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp. My takes: Securities and Exchange Commission regulations give us strong reasons to take Facebook at its word about the causes of this downtime; we should all work to depend less on Facebook and its vassal states for communication with bystanders, customers and fans. 3/15/2019: Spotify has a point about Apple's App Store fees[7], Yahoo Finance If you were reading me eight years ago[8], this column should not have surprised you. My opinion hasn't changed since because Apple still acts as if it has a God-given right to annex up to 30 percent of the content income of many App Store developers.

Then, among other things, CERT-In warned of a dangerous strain of malware, NASA's robotic rover went looking for ancient Martian life, and ISRO's Chandrayaan-2 rover \"Pragyan\" was said to be intact on the lunar surface.   Let's take a look at everything.   News #1: Grilling of Big Tech CEOs   On Wednesday, Google's Sundar Pichai, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, and Apple's Tim Cook appeared to testify for a congressional hearing on antitrust .   They were questioned over their companies' market practices and grilled by lawmakers over concerns that, at some point, they exploited their market dominance and crushed small competitors.   Google and Facebook, in particular, faced a lot of flak during the trial.   News #2: NASA launches Mars rover, ISRO's rover found intact on Moon   In addition to the hearing, NASA's launch of the Perseverance rove r to find signs of ancient life on Mars also made headlines. The space agency is also poised to make history by bringing American astronauts back to Earth on SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft .   Meanwhile, in India, a Chennai-based techie claimed that the Pragyan rover of ISRO's Chandrayaan-2 mission is intact on the lunar surface.   News #3: Apple iPhone 12 delayed, Google extends work from home   This week, Apple reported an 11% growth in revenue but also admitted that its next flagship, the iPhone 12, is running late and will be debuting a few weeks later than anticipated.   Google, on the other hand, extended the work from home option given to its employees until July 2021, tested a new context tab for news , and got sued by Australia's competition regulator .   News #4: Twitter's controversies continued   Twitter said this week that its July 15 hack was carried out by targeting select employees through phone-based spear-phishing .   Then, the company drew more criticism after Bloomberg reported that its contractors spied on celebs like Beyonc\u00e9 using their internal tools. The site also restricted Donald Trump Jr. from tweeting to force him to remove a fake video he had tweeted.   News #5: Multiple cyber-security issues flagged   India's cybersecurity agency CERT-In warned of BlackRock , a dangerous Android malware that is spreading as fake Google updates and using legitimate branded apps to steal people's bank credentials, card details, and other data.   Additionally, two bugs were also flagged \u2014 one risking the private data of OkCupid app and the other risking private Zoom meetings . Both have been fixed now.   Hardware: Finally, some major hardware launches   For gadget lovers, a number of devices were unveiled this week, including Realme C15 , Nubia Red Magic 5S , Samsung Galaxy M31s , TECNO Spark 6 Air , OPPO Reno4 Pro , Huawei Honor 9A and 9S , and Black Shark 3S .   Additionally, ASUS launched a new Zenbook and Vivobook notebooks , Honor launched the MagicBook 15 , while Nokia unveiled a new 65-inch 4k Android TV at Rs. 65,000.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42745051321</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60H2-V9X1-JCSC-J2CT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"567\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Yahoo!

xml:space=\"preserve\"><br/>The <br/>Australian sharemarket ended the week with a modest improvement and <br/>reached an eight-month high. <br/><br/>Investors tracked some of Wall Street but were mainly influenced <br/>by local economic data, including the belief by the Prime Minister that a <br/>surplus should bring lower interest rates from the RBA. <br/><br/>To achieve a surplus will require a mass of cuts in economic <br/>support that could well trigger a recession if the mining industry does <br/>not come up to expectations as a milch cow. </pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><br/><br/>There are also worries about an inflationary trend that the RBA <br/>has always been wary of, while a rate cut at the next Board meeting is <br/>not a fait accompli. <br/><br/>In the market,the ASX 200 rose 3.8 points to 4366.5 today and <br/>advanced 43.2 points for the week. <br/><br/>The broader All Ordinaries rose 40.2 points over the five trading <br/>days after puttong on 3.1 points to 4444.4 in the latest session. <br/><br/>Overnight, US equities were lower after disappointing earnings <br/>reports from big tech companies, and growing concern over Spain's debt <br/>problems and the possibility of a bailout. <br/><br/>There was also a disappointing reading on jobless numbers and <br/>signs of a slowdown in manufacturing activity. <br/><br/>The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 68 points, and the S&amp;#38;P 500 <br/>was down eight points. <br/><br/>The Nasdaq Composite index fell 23 points and the 100 index was <br/>off 29 points. <br/><br/>On the four trading days, the Dow is 115 points in front while <br/>the S&amp;#38;P 500 is up seven. <br/><br/>But the techs dipped into negative with the Nasdaq Composite off <br/>four points and the 100 index has lost 12. <br/><br/>In economic news, the Labor Department reported that jobless <br/>claims had fallen to 386,000 last week, down from a revised 388,000 the <br/>previous week. <br/><br/>Analysts had been predicting a fall to around 374,000. <br/><br/>There was also some disappointing manufacturing data from the <br/>Philadelphia Federal Reserve's business condition index. <br/><br/>The index fell to 8.5 in April, down from 12.5 in March. <br/><br/>A separate report showed sales of previously owned homes had <br/>unexpectedly fallen in March, to an annual rate of 4.48m, down from 4.6m <br/>in February. <br/><br/>On the home front, financial markets again sifted over the <br/>minutes of the RBA Board meeting two weeks ago, looking for a glimmer of <br/>hope that the Australian economy is on the right track, but there were no <br/>major surprises. <br/><br/>There was a slim chance that officials perhaps would embellish <br/>the minutes to massage the market away from pricing a May rate cut as a <br/>near-certainty, says Stephen Walters, chief economist for JP Morgan <br/>Australia. <br/><br/>Instead, though, the minutes delivered the same rhetorical tone <br/>as the policy announcement two weeks ago, he pointed out. <br/><br/>The bottom line is that officials believe there may be a case to <br/>ease policy again, but they want to see the most up-to-date and <br/>comprehensive information on prices before making that assessment. <br/><br/>That is, they want to see next week's CPI reading before <br/>assessing the case for another rate cut. <br/><br/>Also, officials want to be confident that the inflation outlook <br/>allows room for the rate cut, not just a benign historical reading. <br/><br/>Next week's inflation data will colour this assessment, clearly, <br/>but so too will other moving parts, including the outlook for the economy <br/>and productivity. <br/><br/>The JP Morgan forecast is that the headline inflation rate next <br/>Tuesday will be 0.8 per cent, and that the core will be 0.7 per cent. <br/><br/>These outcomes will see the annual rate of inflation decline to <br/>2.4 per cent - below the mid-point of the target range - but will not <br/>necessarily imply the outlook for inflation has improved. <br/><br/>Indeed, both of these outcomes, if delivered, will be sequential <br/>accelerations from inflation in the prior quarter. <br/><br/>The minutes reinforce the importance of sustained productivity <br/>improvement in delivering a better inflation outlook. <br/><br/>This is far from a given in the context of rising industrial <br/>disputation, increased regulation in product and labour markets, and the <br/>ongoing mining boom, in which the ratio of capital inputs to output is <br/>soaring. <br/><br/>And then, of course, there is the carbon tax, the inflation <br/>implications of which we are less relaxed about than RBA officials appear <br/>to be. <br/><br/>The mining industry was rocked during the week about a tax deal <br/>planned by former PM Kevin Rudd with Andrew Forrest, chairman of <br/>Fortescue Metals. <br/><br/>The deal was agreed upon the day before he was deposed by Julia <br/>Gillard who was setting up her arrangement with BHP Billiton and Rio <br/>Tinto. <br/><br/>In fact, the idea might have solved a lot of problems still <br/>floating around. <br/><br/>Mr Forrest suggested that mining companies could have avoided <br/>liability for the proposed 40 per cent tax by writing off their capital <br/>expenditure on infrastructure instead. <br/><br/>He said it would have transformed the resource super profits tax <br/>into a radical proposal to revolutionise the delivery of infrastructure <br/>in Australia. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, it's been a tough week for minerals with prices <br/>falling sharply, especially the base metals. <br/><br/>Gold rallied 40c to $1,642.10 oz overnight but has lost more than <br/>$26 far this week while the AUD is hovering between $US1.03 and $1.04 <br/>against the greenback. <br/><br/>Looking back on Europe, Spain has replaced Greece as the country <br/>that needs help with its unemployment up to 23 per cent. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, in a general overview of the industrial scene, Chris <br/>Corrigan, the man who reformed the waterfront while at the helm of <br/>Patrick Stevedoring, believes port productivity has fallen away since the <br/>MUA regained control of wharf employees. <br/><br/>It has now been revealed that the Finance Department and <br/>Deregulation gave the Gillard Government advice about the Fair Work <br/>review which was ignored. <br/><br/>In another development relating to the carbon tax, electricity <br/>generator Macquarie Generation has taken a $700 million write-off <br/>attributed to the upcoming tax. <br/><br/>The state-owned power generator has cut its asset values by more <br/>than a third from more than $1.8 billion to $1.1 billion. <br/><br/>Stocks with Prospects ... with THE FERRET <br/><br/>----------------------------------------- <br/><br/>Shares of TELSTRA CORPORATION (ASX:TLS) traded erratically <br/>yesterday after the company failed to announce a share buyback, but <br/>indicated dividend would be held at 28c per share. <br/><br/>The shares fell 6c to $3.30 at one stage but rallied to close 3c <br/>firmer at $3.39. <br/><br/>Telstra had outlined its capital management strategy, with <br/>principles included a set of balance sheet settings that will provide <br/>confidence and consistency to the debt and equity markets following the <br/>finalisation of agreements for the National Broadband Network. <br/><br/>The company also announced that it expected to generate between <br/>$2 billion and $3 billion in excess free cash over the next three years, <br/>subject to the NBN rollout schedule and market conditions. <br/><br/>In this context, the company discussed its NBN plans for retail <br/>and wholesale and reinforced its focus on differentiated product <br/>offerings and customer service. <br/><br/>\"Telstra is focused on serving our customers through improved <br/>service, offering new products, as well as leveraging our rich set of <br/>assets,\" chief executive David Thodey said. <br/><br/>He also said that Telstra was making no change to its guidance <br/>for the 2012 financial year and reinforced its intention to pay a 28c per <br/>share fully franked dividend in 2012 and 2013. <br/><br/>----- <br/><br/>BANK OF QUEENSLAND (ASX:BOQ) incurred a net loss of $90.6 million <br/>in the half year ended February 29 but it could be explained by <br/>extenuating circumstances. <br/><br/>It was largely due to impairment charges of $328 million on loans <br/>in the latest half. <br/><br/>Interim dividend was held at 26c. <br/><br/>The market thought this was a bit of a one off and lifted the <br/>shares 4c to $7.08, a gain of 19c so far this week. <br/><br/>In line with guidance provided to the market on March 26, BOQ <br/>confirmed underlying profit growth, but increased provisioning for <br/>troublesome property loans, which resulted in the statutory loss <br/><br/>In announcing the result, BOQ managing director and CEO Stuart <br/>Grimshaw said the foundations had now been set for promising organic <br/>growth for BOQ. <br/><br/>\"Our prudent and robust approach to collective loan provisioning <br/>will enhance protection against any further deterioration in the <br/>Queensland economy and the recent $450 million capital raising is on <br/>track to position BOQ as one of the strongest Core Tier 1 banks in <br/>Australia today,\" Mr Grimshaw said. <br/><br/>\"We've maintained discipline in expenditure, bucked the industry <br/>trend with improved NIM performance in a tough funding environment and <br/>taken a responsible and conservative approach to management of our loan <br/>book. <br/><br/>\"With a new executive team at the helm, we look forward to <br/>getting on with the job of delivering our strategy for growth,\" he said. <br/><br/>----- <br/><br/>LINC ENERGY (ASX:LNC) has been a volatile stock over the week. <br/><br/>The shares yesterday edged up 1.5c to $1.20 but a week ago stood <br/>at $1.07. <br/><br/>The company has a real speculative streak in its composition, up <br/>20c in one session and down 16.5c the next. <br/><br/>The reason is due to a complex restructuring bringing in the <br/>China factor at a price above the market level. <br/><br/>On Monday Linc Energy received a big boost to its underground <br/>coal gasification technology, sealing a deal with a Hong Kong <br/>conglomerate, Golden Concord Holdings in which it will invest $120 <br/>million in the company or paying $4.50 a share compared with yesterday's <br/>market price of $1.105 <br/><br/>LNC has has agreed on key commercial terms with GCL Projects Ltd, <br/>a subsidiary of Golden Concord Holdings, to form a joint venture to <br/>commercialise underground coal gasification (UCG) to gas to liquids (GTL) <br/>in China. <br/><br/>This will be the first multi-gasifier project to start <br/>construction within six months of completion of the suite of formal <br/>binding legal agreements. <br/><br/>GCL-Poly has interests in power generation, coal and <br/>poly-silicon production and one of its subsidiaries, GCL-Poly Energy <br/>Holdings Ltd, is a Hong Kong Stock Exchange listed company. <br/><br/>GCL will take a $120 million private placement in Linc Energy for <br/>about 5 per cent of the issued share capital (at $4.50 per share), giving <br/>Linc an implied valuation of $2.3 billion at a share price of $1.15. <br/><br/>GCL will provide $US15 million in working capital to the joint <br/>venture. <br/><br/>----- <br/><br/>EMU NICKEL NL (ASX:EMU) STRAITS RESOURCES LTD (ASX:SRQ) merger <br/>EMU Nickel to be renamed Ancoa NL while the shares yesterday traded at <br/>12.5c. <br/><br/>Priority will be offered to Straits shareholders. <br/><br/>As advised on February 8, Straits has entered into an agreement <br/>with ANCOA and Emu Nickel NL for the sale of the Hillgrove antimony/gold <br/>mine. <br/><br/>The terms of the sale were approved by Emu shareholders on <br/>April 4. <br/><br/>Under the terms of the agreement with ANCOA and Emu, Straits <br/>shareholders have an entitlement to a pool of shares to be issued by Emu <br/>of up to $15 million in aggregate. <br/><br/>The Hillgrove gold/antimony project is located approximately 25 <br/>kms east of Armidale in NSW. <br/><br/>Mining started in the Hillgrove area in the 1870s and has <br/>continued with breaks due to war and fluctuations in metal prices to the <br/>present day. <br/><br/>One of the largest producers was the Bakers Creek mine which <br/>produced 870,000t of ore at a grade of 10g/t (280,000oz) Au. <br/><br/>The mineralisation at Hillgrove is located within narrow <br/>sub-vertical structures. <br/><br/>The antimony mineralisation is present as stibnite and occurs in <br/>narrow veins within a broader zone mineralised with arsenopyrite and <br/>stibnite. <br/><br/>The gold mineralisation occurs as free gold and as refractory <br/>gold with the stibnite and arsenopyrite. </pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

However, we must mention that on the latter dynamic, those concerns were abated Friday by the nonfarm payroll report which saw solid job gains month over month and positive revisions. While the macro readings provide one angle pointing to a relatively resilient consumer, we also got some positive earnings updates to kick of the season that helped the \"strong consumer\" argument, as names like PepsiCo  and McCormick  put up solid numbers versus expectations -- though it worth keeping in mind how these names and products are staples in nature and carry virtually zero economic sensitivity.</p><p>Given the dynamics of the week, we believe we are once again in a \"bad news is good news\" environment with Thursday's midday reversal to the upside giving us some indication that this is the case. The thinking is that weak data will prompt the Fed to cut rates again before the end of the year. To this point, last Friday (September 27<sup>th</sup>), the  indicated a ~50% chance for a cut this month and ~70% chance for at least one 25bps cut by the end of the year. However, going into this weekend (i.e. since last week, now knowing the most recent ISM numbers and employment readings), the FedWatch Tool is indicating a ~80% chance for an October cut and a ~95% chance for at least one 25bps cut by the end of the year.</p><p>That said, there is no doubt that things are choppy and it is important to remember that every cut made now, is one less cut the Fed has at its disposal in the future. As a result, we believe that while one more cut may help the market, the real, bankable catalyst that would allow us to prolong the expansion without further diminishing the Fed's ability to deploy expansionary tools in the future is a trade deal with China. As a result, our near-term focus is it intensely concentrated on next week's  with the Chinese delegation. Outside of trade, the other key overhang would have to be the Democratic primary race which has been of increasing concern for investors as Elizabeth Warren, a candidate who has not been shy in calling for the breakup of big tech and higher taxes on the wealthy is now viewed as the front runner. We will continue to monitor on all fronts.</p><p>Lastly and with all of this in mind, we remind members of how we prepared for this mid-week selloff by raising cash to a level that represented our near highest year to date. Then when the pullback occurred, we did not run from the market as we instead viewed the selloff with an opportunistic lens. We felt that we finally got the pullback we had long waited for, and after all, we didn't raise all that cash in hopes of buying stocks at higher prices.</p><p>10-year Treasury yields plummeted from around 1.65% to the low 1.50s% on economic growth concerns, while gold prices wavered around the ~$1,500s per ounce level. The U.S. dollar index remained elevated around the 99 level while WTI oil prices pulled back to about $53.</p><p>Third-quarter earnings season is underway. Within the portfolio, we herd from PepsiCo, on Thursday, before the opening bell.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PepsiCo </emphasis><br/></p><p>PepsiCo reported a top and bottom-line beat with its third-quarter results. Revenues of $17.19 billion (+4.3% year over year) topped the consensus of $16.93 billion, and earnings per share of $1.56 (-1% year over year) exceeded the consensus by $0.06.</p><p>In addition to the high-quality earnings beat, organic revenue growth of +4.3% exceeded consensus expectations of +3.5% and lapped an extremely strong +4.9% growth rate from the third quarter a year ago.

To put the new number in perspective, from October 2018 through September 2019, PMI has reached a high of 58.8%, a current low of 47.8%, and has averaged 53.5%. See  for our full analysis.</p><p>On Wednesday, the ADP National Employment Report was released, indicating a 135,000 private-sector seasonally adjusted payroll increase for the month of September, missing expectations for 140,000 added jobs. Compounding the September miss, August's reading was revised down to +157,000 (from +195,000), while July's reading was nudged up to +143,000 (from +142,000 previously). See  for our full analysis.</p><p>On Thursday, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that the non-manufacturing index (NMI), which tracks the service sector of the economy, fell 3.8 percentage points in September to 52.6%, missing expectations for a 55.3% reading, following August's 56.4% reading. For perspective, over the past 12 months, the NMI has averaged 56.8% with a high of 60.4% and a low of 52.6%. See  for our full analysis.</p><p>Also, on Thursday, shortly after the opening bell, the Commerce Department reported that new orders for manufactured goods (durable and nondurable) in August declined 0.1% (or $0.4 billion), to $499.8 billion, slightly above expectations for a 0.2% decline following a 1.4% advance in July. Shipments decreased 0.1% to $503.0 billion, unfilled orders of durable goods ticked up 0.1% to $1,162.9 billion and inventories were \"virtually unchanged,\" falling $0.3 billion to $696.9 billion</p><p>Importantly, new orders of non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft (i.e., core capital goods) decreased 0.4% in August, following a flat July reading and 0.9% increase in June.

Importantly, the four-week moving average for claims (used as a gauge to offset volatility in the weekly numbers) was 212,500, unchanged from the previous week's revised average of 212,500 (revised up from 212,000). The low rate of layoffs reflects a strengthening labor market as claims have remained below 300,000 -- the threshold typically used to categorize a healthy jobs market - for an incredible 238 consecutive weeks, the longest streak for weekly records dating back to 1967. The previous longest stretch ended in April 1970 and lasted for 161 weeks.

In addition to the September figure, the July reading was revised up to +166,000 from +159,000, and August's reading was also up to +168,000 from +130,000. In total, the two revisions represent a net gain of 45,000 from what was previously reported. After the revisions, job gains have now averaged 157,000 over the last three months and 161,000 per month year to date, a slowed rate compared to 2018's 223,000 average. At 3.5%, the unemployment rate fell by 0.2 percentage points from August's reading, and now sits at a 50-year low. Additionally, average hourly earnings (i.e., wage inflation) have increased 2.9% from the same time last year, the slowest rate of change in 14 months.

On the supply side, Saudi Aramco has now restored production capacity to the level before the recent attack, easing concerns of a supply side constraint and further pressuring oil prices. Add to this the  seen in the U..S and we get a picture of waning future demand expectations (though a U.S./China trade deal could help growth expectations) with a wealth of supply -- a dynamic that works to the advantage of those paying at the pump (and as a result those companies that compete with gasoline costs for discretionary dollars) but one that also pressures oil prices and therefore the profitability of energy producers.</p><p>On the domestic front, on Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), reported that in the week ending September 27, U.S. stockpiles (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) increased by 3.1 million barrels to 422.6 million barrels, a bearish reading versus expectations for a 1.57 million barrel increase. Additionally, U.S. production ticked down to 12.4 million bpd. Lastly, net imports increased by 29,000 bpd as imports decreased by 87,000 bpd, while exports decreased by 116,000 bpd. See  for the full report.</p><p>Lastly, we note that the spread between WTI and Brent sits at around the $5-6 per barrel level. Recall, this is a key metric as the wider the spread, the more attractive US based crude (WTI) becomes to foreign buyers, though we note that strength in the dollar can offset this effect as foreign buyers convert their home currencies to the dollar.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stocks</emphasis><br/></p><p>In the portfolio this week, we swapped out Amgen  for AbbVie  in our Alert  .

We believe the company's opportunities for upside rest with additional Libre uptake, the Alinity U.S. launch, and an expanded indication of the Mitraclip.

Per the report, \"Amazon is eager to place the underlying components for that experience inside other companies' stories to speed up transactions.\" Also this week, Amazon  , AWS IQ, \"a new service that helps customers quickly find, engage, and do business with AWS-Certified third party experts for on-demand project work.\" Per the release, \"To get started, customers simply log into AWS IQ and describe their project needs in a few sentences. They can then chat with experts to clarify details of the project, compare proposals, review expert profiles, and select the expert that best fits their needs. There are no upfront commitments required to use AWS IQ, and customers pay for completed project milestones through their existing AWS account.\" With AWS already being the leading cloud provider, we view this as another step in the right direction as it serves to make the platform more approachable, regardless of a business's own in-house programming expertise. As noted in the release, \"many small and mid-sized businesses have embraced AWS for its secure, flexible, cost-effective, and scalable infrastructure and services. As these customers begin or expand their use of AWS, they sometimes need help executing or thinking through a project, and could benefit from specialized knowledge and experience.\" This is where AWS IQ comes in as it \"simplifies the process of finding and connecting with AWS-Certified experts for consultation or project-based work. Customers only need to describe their needs in a few sentences to receive tailored responses directly from experts who can help. They can then evaluate expert profiles, view expert ratings, compare details like rates and relevant AWS Certifications, and make an informed decision without spending time browsing forums or hunting down information across websites.\" All in, we continue to view AWS as the cloud leader and believe this program will help it remain a go to platform for businesses of all sizes. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Additionally, we believe profitability will continue to improve as AWS and advertising account for a larger portion of total sales as both these segments sport higher margins than the eCommerce operation. And while we believe the increasing share of revenue from these higher margin businesses will be key to driving profitability longer-term, we believe margins on ecommerce stand to improve as the company's infrastructure is further built out and economies of scale further kick in.

Key to the AbbVie's future is the acquisition of Allergan, a deal that will diversify the company's revenue stream and give it exposure to Medical Aesthetics, neuroscience, and eye care, while also increase operating cash flow.

Per the blog post (linked above), \"When you turn on Incognito mode in Maps, your Maps activity on that device, like the places you search for, won't be saved to your Google Account and won't be used to personalize your Maps experience.\" The second update was an expansion of Google's  to YouTube. With this, users can set an expiration date at which point, Google will delete the selected data. The third update relates to the Google Assistant, and \"new ways to easily understand and manage your data in the Assistant.\" With this, users can ask how Google keeps data safe and receive information on the company's data privacy practices, or request that the history of old commands (be it the most recent command or those from the last week) be deleted. Finally the company announced Password Checkup and update for to Google's password manager that with a single click \"tells you if any of your passwords are weak, whether you've reused them across multiple sites, or if we've discovered they've been compromised (for example, in a third-party data breach).\" While these updates are incremental and not material from a financial perspective, we believe data privacy to be an area of concern big tech must do everything in their power to address. As a result, incremental updates such as this are key to Alphabet keeping and growing user trust, an issue all big tech names are currently struggling with. Also, this week, analysts at Deutsche Bank raised their price target to $1,600 from $1,475 which they base on a sum-of-the-parts valuation, something we discussed in more detail,  . <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

AI is what has made the company's Search, Video (YouTube) and targeted ad capabilities best-in-class and is the driving force behind the company's success in voice (Google Home) and autonomous driving (Waymo). Furthermore, we believe it is this AI expertise that will also make the company more prevalent in other industries, including healthcare via subsidiary Verily, as AI and machine learning continue to disrupt operations across industries. We believe Alphabet's willingness to invest in new areas, knowing most will fail, is a recipe for long-term success as while most \"  \" projects may fail, every once in a while, you end up with a Waymo, perhaps the division's, most successful graduate to date. Lastly, compounding out positive view of the company's future opportunities, we believe that Alphabet's free cash flow generation and solid balance sheet set it apart and are what will allow the company to continue taking chances on far-out ground-breaking and potentially world changing projects.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $1,400;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Regulatory risk (data privacy), competition, macroeconomic slowdown impacting consumers and therefore ad buyer activity</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Goldman Sachs</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $200.8; 475 shares; 3.52%; Sector: Financials</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: This week, we  share to a One while adding to our position as the stock moved below tangible book value. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Meanwhile, the firm has delivered consistent improvements to its return on equity and return on tangible common equity metrics-which are drivers of a premium over book price-while tangible book value has continued to grow. Another reason why we think the share price deserves a greater premium is because of management's emphasis on fee-based, or more recurring, revenue streams. At the end of 2018, 61% of Goldman's revenues were fee-based, up from 48% in 2013. The firm's tangible book value per share as of the end of the second quarter 2019 is $203.05. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $270;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: The economic cycle, Financial System regulation, 1MDB litigation, interest rates, financial market activity</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,   ,  ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Johnson &amp; Johnson </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $133.66; 575 shares; 2.84%; Sector: Healthcare</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: This week, Johnson &amp; Johnson announced that the FDA has approved a new indication of INVOKANA \"to reduce the risk of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), worsening of kidney function, cardiovascular (CV) death, and hospitalization for heart failure in adults with type 2 diabetes and diabetic kidney disease (nephropathy) with a certain amount of protein in the urine.\" With this expanded indication, \"INVOKANA<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><sup>\u00ae</sup></emphasis> is now the only type 2 diabetes medicine indicated to both treat diabetic kidney disease and reduce the risk of hospitalization for heart failure in patients with T2D and DKD.\" Also, this week, The Wall Street Journal  that Johnson &amp; Johnson and others tied to ongoing opioid-related litigation, \"are exploring an unusual way to settle the cases: by participating in Purdue Pharma LP's bankruptcy, according to internal documents and a person familiar with the matter.\" Per the report, \"The mechanism, if successful, would allow the companies to contribute money into a trust set up through the bankruptcy in exchange for a complete release from liability.\" Unlikely as this sounds, the article does go onto to note that there is \"some precedent\" to using this mechanism of settling cases.

In line with this view, we also believe the shift to ecommerce to be a tailwind as online purchases inherently require some form of digital payments. In the near-term we also expect a tailwind to result from the coming release of the Apple Card as MasterCard was selected as the card's payment processing platform. Furthermore, we value MasterCard for the strong three-year Performance Objectives management laid out on their fourth quarter 2018 and full year 2018 financial results conference call. For 2019 - 2021, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding future acquisitions and Special Items, management's goal is for low-teen Net Revenue CAGR (compound annual growth rate), a minimum 50% Annual Operating Margin, and high-teens percent earnings per share CAGR.

In addition, (as others, including us, have called out previously) management's guidance for a ~$600 million run rate in 5G-related revenues likely has \"significant upside potential,\" thanks to \"greater customer market share (the company's lead customer is aiming to double its global market share from 4G to 5G), increased content per system (particularly as more power-efficient ASICs displace FPGAs), and additional customer wins.\" All in, while there was little in terms of new information, we believe the analysts' commentary serves to support our view that if you want exposure to the 5G upgrade cycle you have to get in now and perhaps more importantly, the move to 5G is a secular one that can cut through the headwinds of an economic slowdown. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

As noted in our initiation alert, we believe that the 5G upgrade cycle remains in early stages and that from an infrastructure viewpoint, which Marvell plays to by creating the network that needs to be built and running to support all of the new, Marvell will benefit as 5G enabled devices begin coming to market over the next several years. Additionally, we believe the Cavium deal was a big step in the company's transformation while the acquisition of Aquantia, a leader in Multi-Gig Ethernet connectivity, will help in broadening Marvell's connectivity solutions portfolio and capitalizing on the future of high-speed networking requirements in cars that are needed to enable autonomous, electric, and safety/security applications. Furthermore, on the M&amp;A front, we believe plans to acquire Avera Semiconductor, a developer of custom ASICs for networking and telecom equipment was a 5G additive play as Avera's biggest end market exposure is base stations, which are leveraged to 5G. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $28;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Further intensification on the US/China trade front, a delayed ramp in 5G infrastructure buildouts.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Microsoft Corp </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $138.12; 550 shares; 2.8%; Sector: Technology</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: This week, Microsoft hosted an  to introduce its newest lineup of Surface notebooks refresh (and a pair of Surface Earbuds).

While companies may look to build out multi-cloud environments, Microsoft's Azure offering will be a prime choice thanks to the company's decision to provide the same \"stack\" used in the public cloud, to companies for their on-premise data centers. Additionally, we would note that hybrid environments are currently the preference for most companies because it allows them to maintain critical data in house while taking advantage of the agility and scalability provided by public clouds. Outside of the cloud opportunity, we maintain a positive view on the company's growing gaming business, which we believe is becoming an increasingly prominent factor in the Microsoft growth story as gaming becomes more mainstream, management works to convert its gaming revenue from one-time license purchase to a recurring subscription model and as technologies like augmented/virtual reality evolve. Finally, as it relates to LinkedIn and other subscription-based services such as O365 and various Dynamics products, we continue to value them highly for their recurring revenue streams, which we remind members, provides for greater transparency of future earnings.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Target Price</emphasis>: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Raised</emphasis> to $150;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Slowdown in IT spending, competition, cannibalization of on premises business by the cloud</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,   ,   ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Nvidia </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $181.97; 500 shares; 3.36%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Sector: Info.

That said, we will certainly know more by the end of next week as China is set to send a  to the U.S. next week for further talks.

Furthermore, we believe the cloud (i.e. data center) growth will be even more of a factor in upside following the acquisition of Mellanox, which thanks to its low latency \"InfiniBand\" technology, provides Nvidia the ability be a more integral player in the buildout of data centers by working to both accelerate server subsystems via GPU-acceleration and accelerate the data center overall by \"tying together\" the multiple subsystems and allowing them to operate as a single cohesive unit. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $205;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: slow uptake of ray-tracing chips which will depend on gaming publishers' implementation of the new technology in software releases, a slowdown in the IT/data center spending, competition, slower than expected inventory channel normalization.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,    ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Novartis </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $85.94; 750 shares; 2.38%;</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"> Sector: Healthcare</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: This week, Novartis  that it has selected Microsoft as its \"strategic AI and data-science partner\" to help the company on its mission of \"reimagining medicine\" via the launch of its \"Novartis AI innovation lab.\" Per the release, the partnership represents a multi-year R&amp;D effort.

By bringing together vast amounts of Novartis datasets with Microsoft's advanced AI solutions, the lab will aim to create new AI models and applications that can augment our associates' capabilities to take on the next wave of challenges in medicine.\" Second is \"AI Exploration,\" where \"the lab will use the power of AI to tackle some of the hardest computational challenges within life sciences, starting with generative chemistry, image segmentation &amp; analysis for smart and personalized delivery of therapies and optimization of cell and gene therapies at scale.\" Speaking on the release, CEO Vas Narasimhan stated, \"As Novartis continues evolving into a focused medicines company powered by advanced therapy platforms and data science, alliances like this will help us deliver on our purpose to reimagine medicine to improve and extend patients' lives. Pairing our deep knowledge of human biology and medicine with Microsoft's leading expertise in AI could transform the way we discover and develop medicines for the world.\" While not material in the near-term, we view this as a positive step that will help Novartis remain on the cutting edge of medical research. As tech companies such as Apple and Alphabet (via Verily) seek to push deeper into the medical field, we view it as only logical that existing healthcare companies seek to partner with tech companies in order to remain competitive with AI driven solutions. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Also this week, more critical to the Services story, Reuters  that as part of its antitrust investigation into Apple: \"The U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Committee reached out to the music streaming service [Spotify] with broad requests for information.\" As noted in the article, \"Spotify and other developers have alleged that Apple engages in anticompetitive behaviour by imposing rules that hamper distribution via its App Store, the only way for third-party developers to reach more than 900 million iPhone users.\" While we do not expect a resolution on this front any time soon and remind members that The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are looking into big tech in general, with investigations also open on Google, Facebook and Amazon, we will continue to monitor for updates. That said, we do want members to understand that the outcome of this trial does pose a risk to Apple should it impact the company's methods of monetizing the App Store. While we do not believe Apple to be guilty of anti-competitive practices, this nonetheless remains an overhang that we must contend with and keep in mind going forward. Nearer-term, we remind members that U.S./China trade negotiations are the main overhang on Apple and as a result, next week's October 10<sup>th</sup> meeting between the two nations will be key to the stocks next move. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Services provide for a recurring revenue stream at higher margins, a factor that serves to reduce earnings volatility while allowing for a higher percentage of sales to fall to the bottom line, as a result, we believe that Services growth and the installed base, are much more important than how many devices the company can sell in a given 90-day period. In addition to improved profitability we also believe the transparent nature of this revenue stream will demand an expanded price-to-earnings multiple as segment sales grow. Furthermore, we believe that Apple's desire to push deeper into the healthcare arena will help make its devices invaluable as more life-changing features are added and the company works to democratize health records. Lastly, also see upside resulting from increased adoption of wearables (think the Apple Watch) and potential new product announcements such as an AR/VR headset or an update on project Titan, the company's secretive autonomous driving program. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $260;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Slowdown in consumer spending, competition, lack of new product innovation, elongated replacement cycles, failure to execute on Services growth initiative</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  Interview  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">B</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">P PLC</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $36.96; 1750 shares; 2.39%; Sector: Energy</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: While not exactly \"news\" we want to be sure that members are aware that CEO Bob Dudley (age 64) has  his previous messaging that he would look to retire at age 65, stating in Moscow this week at Russia Energy Week, \"I said a long time ago that around the age of 65 I would.\" The exact timing is still unknown, and we will continue to monitor for updates.

Additionally, they noted an acceleration in new store openings which they believe \"should translate to an accelerating tailwind to corporate SSS and EBIT margin improvement in 2020 and beyond.\" Additionally, on the investment side, the analysts believe that recent fears of a step-up on this front due to \"pockets of underinvestment\" to be overblown and that any increases would be positively correlated revenue increases -- as the analysts put it, their math \"shows strong evidence that recent SG&amp;A investments have been strongly correlated to sales increases.\" <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

The bargains Burlington's stores offer creates a \"treasure hunting\" experience for its shoppers, and this cannot be replicated by e-commerce. Therefore, we believe Burlington's business model keeps them immune from the pressures facing department stores, and we expect the company will continue to deliver low single digit same store sales growth. Lastly, any supply chain disruptions caused by tariffs may work to Burlington's favor, as off-price's value will gain additional favor should either prices increase, or stores need to unload inventory. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $220;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: Two </emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Consumer spending, inventory availability, fashion trends</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:   ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Caterpillar </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $121.04; 650 shares; 2.9%; Sector: Industrials</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: None <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

That's up from about $14 billion in 2016, and management's target is to do about $28 billion in Services sales by 2026. If Caterpillar delivers on this target, it would effectively double its Services businesses over a 10-year span. An enhanced and more consistent capital return policy is also a major theme of the new Caterpillar. Back at the company's May Investor Day, not only did it announce a 20% increase to the quarterly dividend payment effective in July, but it also revealed a target of at least high-single-digit percent increases to the dividend over each of the next four years. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $150;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis> Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Though we believe the growth of services will help, Caterpillar operates in a cyclical industry tied to economic growth and construction, as a result macro weakness, be it from the US/China trade conflict or a general slowing of growth globally pose risks.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Citigroup</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $68.18; 900 shares; 2.26%; Sector: Financials</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: None <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Additionally, the acquisition provides Comcast access to Sky's \"Q Box,\" which said to be even better than the X1 and provides a buffer should cord cutting accelerate in Europe. Recall, domestically, the X1 has been shown to be more resilient to the trend than competing platforms. Regarding the debt load on the balance sheet resulting from the acquisition, we reaffirm that management has an excellent M&amp;A track record and believe strong cash flow generation will provide the means to successfully de-leverage overtime, allowing shares to re-rate higher over time. Lastly, regarding the US business, we believe management's decision to focus operations around broadband is continuing to be rewarded with higher margins and providing a greater ability to bundle cheaper, less in demand services such as video. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $56; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: An acceleration of cord cutting, failure to realize targeted Sky integration synergies, 5G impacting broadband business, competition</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,   ,  ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Disney</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $130.27; 775 shares; 3.73%; Sector: Communication Services</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: This week, analysts at Morgan Stanley published a note titles \"Preparing for Liftoff\" in which they reiterated their Overweight rating and raised their estimates for the soon to launch Disney+ streaming service. Supporting their raised expectations, the analysts called out that \"wide device compatibility, including integration with Apple TV, improves access to Consumers,\" adding that \"Disney's global distribution agreements with Apple, Google, Microsoft, Roku, and Sony secure Disney Plus availability on a wide range of devices to stream.\" While Amazon is a notable exclusion, the analysts believe a deal could be reached in coming months. We view this is key to widespread adoption as, although Disney may be a household name, it's not a household device company and as a result, these deals will be key to actually putting the service in front of potential buyers, in their own homes. However, the analysts did downwardly revise near-term earnings estimates due to lower-than-expected fiscal third-quarter results, weak fiscal fourth-quarter guidance, and \"more significant secular pressure on both legacy and acquired TV network assets.\" In addition to the secular pressure in traditional pay TV assets (which should come as no surprise given the now well understood cord cutting dynamic) the analysts called out margin pressure resulting from investments in original content creation, and the removal of licensing revenue as Disney brings assets in-house to build out its own streaming platforms. In our view, this too is well understood and a worthwhile tradeoff as we believe Disney needs to come out of the gate strong with its Disney+ release in order to solidify its service as a must have in the increasingly competitive streaming space -- especially if the company is to ultimately grow through the cord cutting dynamic. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

They believe this contraction in mortgage costs (down from 5% to 3.65%) \"help fuel\" Home Depot's fundamentals. \"We are increasingly optimistic that a recent, meaningful moderation in mortgage rates should prove an incremental sales tailwind within the space and help support further the multiples at which HD and LOW trade.\" We are still looking for a pullback to the $215 level as the price we would upgrade shares back to a ONE, which we indicated last week in our Alert  . <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

We initiated our position shortly before the Spring--Home Depot's \"Holiday season\" --expecting the company to outperform expectations. Longer term, management's 2020 financial targets include sales to increase to the range of $115 billion to $120 billion, with operating margins in a range of 14.4% to 15% and return on invested capital of more than 40%. Lastly, Home Depot is a cash-generating machine. Making good use of its cash flows, the company recently authorized a 32% increase to its quarterly dividend (which puts the yield ~3.0%) as well as announced a $15 billion share repurchase program. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $230;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Consumer Spending habits; Housing market downturn; inclement weather</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  , <url normalizedValue=\"http://ir.homedepot.com/\">Investor Relations</url><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Honeywell</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $163.63; 300 shares; 1.81%; Sector: Industrials</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: No company updates this week, but Credit Suisse did publish their U.S. Multi Industry Q319 preview. Honeywell was labeled one of two names they believe are \"most favorable into the print,\" acknowledging that Q3 organic sales could see some pressure, but the analysts expect modest negative revisions to 2019/2020 EPS compared to other industrials.

Recall, last week we noted that messaging on Micron's conference call was mixed as the company called for a decline in capex while at the same time pointing to improving demand trends. As a result, we told members that \"while the capex commentary was a negative, industry commentary was a positive and we ultimately believe that as inventories shrink, capex will have to ramp back up to meet the demand.\" Backing this view, the analysts at KeyBanc stated, \"if memory enters undersupply in 2020 (which we expect), we think capex budgets will increase quickly.\" Speaking to our desire to own shares for the time being, rather than try to time the exact point at which we will see a capex ramp from customers, the analysts sated, \"while demand remains uncertain, we view mid-2019 as a likely trough. If so, we expect semiconductor equipment stocks to have limited downside risk over the midterm, and significant upside potential through 2020 as positive long-term tailwinds kick in. We view the long-term dynamics as healthy for semiconductor equipment, and valuations are attractive.\" It is precisely this risk/reward dynamic that we are focused on and why we are happy to stay patient and collect the ~2% dividend in the meantime. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

We believe that memory (DRAM &amp; NAND) companies, which are customers of Lam Research, are currently holding back on capital expenditures in an effort to boost near-term profits and preserve cash flows, a dynamic that will ultimately result in supply growth lagging demand growth. Moreover, we believe that thanks to the digital revolution and rapidly growing internet of things space, we believe the demand for memory is becoming less cyclical in nature and as a result, we believe that should our thesis prove correct and we do see a supply shortage in the back half of 2019, then memory prices should begin to rebound and lead to increased CapEx/investments in capital equipment (what Lam sells) in the future. As we noted in out initiation, the current dynamic resembles the first half of 2016, a period that immediately preceded an inflection in prices, which lead to a sharp increase in Lam's earnings. Regarding management signaling, we also believe an inflection is coming due to the timing of management's recently announced $5 billion share repurchase program, which we view as a \"call\" that the industry dynamic is about to turn, and the stock has bottomed because the earnings decline is about to end. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $230;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: A delay in semiconductor companies increasing capital expenditures, a macroeconomic slowdown that hampers demand for memory chips.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Schlumberger </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $31.88; 1500 shares; 1.76%; Sector: Energy</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: None <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Although the company's earnings power is dependent on the timing of the upstream investment cycle, management has a strong reputation in execution as well as a good handle in understanding the supply/demand dynamic of the industry. The company's premier technology gives it an advantage over peers and allows for market share gains. Furthermore, we value the company's international presence as it means a lessened exposure to North America, where new drilling activity remains limited.

Such storylines include antitrust probes of some of the largest tech companies in the market, signs that the U.S. economy has slowed, indications from the bond market that suggest a rate cut is necessary (speeches from Fed officials were quite dovish this week), and the Trump Administration showing no signs of letting up on the tariff front, with tariffs set to be implemented on Mexico come Monday should an immigration deal not be reached over the weekend. As a reminder, the administration has guided that it will start with a 5% tariff and then increase the rate by five percentage points every month until a deal is reached. But markets were quite optimistic that a deal will be struck in a timely manner following the interview with White House Council of Economic Advisers Chairmen Kevin Hassett on Friday's \"Squawk on the Street.\" And to the point of the Fed, \"bad news\" has become \"good news\" as each tepid economic data point (like the jobs number from Friday) provides the Fed with justification to reverse a potential policy stake from last December. </p><p>Backing this view, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in prepared remarks at a speech this week that, \"We are closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the U.S. economic outlook and, as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective.\" With these comments suggesting that the market is not \"fighting the Fed\", equities were able to strongly rally from what was a severe oversold condition.</p><p>At the same time, there has been little progress on the China trade front, with the threat of additional tariffs still in play. With that in mind, we have raised cash in anticipation of increased volatility, especially as we approach debate/campaign season, and have remained patient before putting our precious cash to work, widening our scales and picking our spots carefully. As a result of our discipline, we are being rewarded with the ability to remain calm and focused, and to view any pullback through a long-term buyer's lens.</p><p>The 10-Year Treasury yield moved lower to ~ 2.08% as trade tensions and concerns of a slowdown in the economy increased. Meanwhile gold prices rallied to the ~$1,340 per ounce level. The U.S. dollar index pulled back to the 96 - 97 range while WTI oil prices were volatile but pared losses by the end of the week and ultimately settled around $54.</p><p>First-quarter earnings season is winding down. Within the portfolio, we heard from Salesforce  and Five Below  .</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Salesforce</emphasis><br/></p><p>Salesforce.com reported a strong top and bottom-line beat with its fiscal first-quarter 2020 result. Non-GAAP revenue of $3.798 billion (+26% year over year on a constant currency, or cc, basis) beat the consensus of $3.685 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.63 (which we adjusted to exclude a $0.27 benefit related to the company's required mark-to-market accounting on its strategic investment) exceeded the consensus expectation of $0.61.</p><p>In addition to the positive headline results, the company reported billings of $2.758 billion, topping estimates of $2.212 billion. Digging into each cloud service offering's subscription and support revenue, Sales Cloud increased 11% year over year to about $1.1 billion, Service cloud increased 20% year over year to about $1 billion, Salesforce Platform and Other increased 46% year over year to $800 million, and lastly, Marketing Cloud &amp; Commerce Cloud increased 33% year over year to $600 million. Taking a look at full-year guidance, management raised both its revenue and non-GAAP EPS expectations. Management now expects revenues to be in the range of $16.1 billion to $16.25 billion, representing an increase of 21% to 22% year over year growth, respectively with non-GAAO earnings per share in the range of $2.88 to $2.90.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Five Below</emphasis><br/></p><p>Five Below, Inc. reported a top and bottom-line beat with its fiscal first-quarter earnings results. Sales of $364.76 million (+23.1% year over year) edged the consensus of $363.95 million, and earnings per share of $0.46 (+31.4% year over year, although this includes $0.11 benefit related to share-based accounting) beat the consensus of $0.34.</p><p>The company opened thirty-nine new stores during the quarter and expanded into three new states. Of those new stores, twelve appeared on the company's top twenty-five all-time spring grand opening list, representing a testament of how successful (with quick payback periods) the company's regional to national expansion is. As for guidance, management raised its full-year outlook despite the incorporation of the increased tariff rates. Management now expects earnings per share to be in the rage of $3.11 to $3.18 per share (consensus $3.06) from the range of $3.00 to $3.07 per share on a re-affirmed net sales outlook.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Economy</emphasis><br/></p><p>On Monday, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that the purchasing managers' index (PMI), which measures the economic environment within the manufacturing sector, fell 0.7 percentage points in May to 52.1%, missing expectations of an increase to 53.0% reading. For reference, over the past 12-month period (June 2018 through May 2019), PMI has reached a high of 60.8%, a low of 52.1% and averaged 56.7%. This marks the 121<sup>st</sup>consecutive month of expansion in the overall economy and the 33<sup>rd</sup> in the manufacturing sector. See  for our full analysis.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that new orders for manufactured goods (durable and nondurable) in April fell 0.8% (or $4.0 billion), to $499.3 billion, exceeding expectations for a 0.95% decrease following a 1.3% advance in March (revised down from +1.9% previously reported). Additionally, new orders of non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft (i.e., core capital goods) fell 1.0% in April, following a 0.3% advance in both March and February. See  for our full analysis.</p><p>On Wednesday, the ADP National Employment Report was released, indicating a 27,000 private-sector seasonally adjusted payroll increase for the month of May, well short of expectations for 185,000 added jobs. Additionally, April's reading was revised down to +271,000, from +275,000 previously reported, while March's reading was increased to +158,000 from +151,000 previously reported. See  for our full analysis.</p><p>Also, On Wednesday, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that the non-manufacturing index (NMI), which tracks the service sector of the economy, increased 1.4 percentage points in May to 56.9%, exceeding expectations for 55.4%, following April's 55.5% reading. See  for our full analysis.</p><p>On Thursday, the Department of Labor reported that initial jobless claims for the week ending June 1 were 218,000, unchanged from the previous week's revised level of (revised up from 215,000 previously reported) and 3,000 claims above expectations. Importantly, the four-week moving average for claims (used as a gauge to offset volatility in the weekly numbers) was 215,000, a decrease of 2,500 from the previous week's revised average of 217,500 (from 216,750 previously reported). The low rate of layoffs reflects a strengthening labor market as claims have remained below 300,000 -- the threshold typically used to categorize a healthy jobs market - for an incredible 222 consecutive weeks, the longest streak for weekly records dating back to 1967. The previous longest stretch ended in April 1970 and lasted for 161 weeks. For the official weekly release, please see  .</p><p>Finally, on Friday, the U.S. Labor Department reported that the economy added 75,000 jobs during the month of May, missing expectations for a 185,000 gain. In addition to the weaker-than-expected results, March's reading was revised down to +153,000 from +189,000, and April's reading was revised down to +224,000 from +263,000. With these big downward revisions, job gains have now averaged 151,000 over the last three months for a much slower pace than previously. In addition to the headline number, the unemployment rate held steady at 3.6% and continues to sit at its lowest level since 1969. In May, average hourly earnings for all employees on nonfarm payrolls increased by $0.06 to $27.83, a steady rate that followed a $0.06 gain in April. Over the year, average hourly earnings (i.e., wage inflation) have increased 3.1%, a tick slower rate from what we saw in April. See  for our full analysis.</p><p>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Note: T is the most recent period, T-1 is the prior period's reading and T-2 is two periods back, the intent being to illustrate any trends</emphasis>)</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oil</emphasis><br/></p><p>On the commodity front, prices remain under pressure as, despite OPEC's best efforts to reduce supply and sanctions remaining in place on Venezuela and Iran, U.S. production continues to break records and global growth concerns weigh on the demand side of the equation. Further pressuring the demand side is the increased trade rhetoric as tariffs are set to be enacted on Mexico come Monday, should a deal not be reached over the weekend. As called out earlier this week by CNBC (  ), according to Chief Executive of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers trade association, Chet Thompson, \"if these tariffs take hold, particularly if they're able to get up to 25%, that could really impact the overall competitiveness of the U.S. refining industry.\" Per the report, \"Mexico's oil is heavy and refiners need it to blend with lighter U.S. oil to produce diesel fuel, gasoline and other products. Tariffs would drive up the cost of those imports.\" That in mind, we would also note that should the tariffs be put it in place, it would no doubt result in higher prices at the pump, something President Trump has been trying to avoid and a factor that would also impact consumer discretionary dollars, proving an additional headwind for industries that rely on consumers' after-tax spending power such as restaurants and retailers.</p><p>On the domestic front, on Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA), reported that in the week ending May 31, U.S. stockpiles (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) surged by 6.8 million barrels to 483.3 million barrels, a bearish reading versus expectations for a ~850,000-barrel decrease. Additionally, U.S. production ticked up to a new all-time high, increasing by 100,000 bpd to 12.4 million bpd. Lastly, net imports increased by 1.084 million bpd as imports increased by 1.065 million bpd, while exports decreased by 19,000 bpd. See  for the full report.</p><p>Lastly, we note that the spread between WTI and Brent sits at roughly $9 per barrel. Recall, this is a key metric as the wider the spread, the more attractive US based crude (WTI) becomes to foreign buyers, though we note that strength in the dollar can offset this effect as foreign buyers convert their home currencies to the dollar.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stocks</emphasis><br/></p><p>In the portfolio this week, while we did net into the market this week, putting just under $10,000 to work, we balanced our desire to buy with our understanding that there remains a great deal of uncertainty given the upcoming political debates and trade overhang. That in mind, we took advantage of weakness to bulk up on our position in Goldman Sachs  and Nvidia  (  and  ), and Kohl's  (  and  ).</p><p>However, we offset these buys with sales of Comcast  (  ), Abbott Laboratories  (  ), and Citigroup  (  ).</p><p>Moving on to the broader market, first-quarter earnings season is wrapping up and the results thus far have been relatively positive versus beaten down expectations coming into the season, with 75.7% of companies reporting a positive EPS surprise. For the first-quarter, earnings growth has increased roughly 0.8% year over year vs. expectations for an overall 0.72% advance throughout the season; of the 418 non-financials that reported, earnings growth is up 0.6%. Revenues are up 4.7% vs. expectations throughout the season for a 3.86% increase; 75.7% of companies beat EPS expectations, 18.3% missed the mark and 6.0% were in line with consensus.

Additionally, we believe profitability will continue to improve as AWS and advertising account for a larger portion of total sales as both these segments sport higher margins than the eCommerce operation. And while we believe the increasing share of revenue from these higher margin businesses will be key to driving profitability longer-term, we believe margins on ecommerce stand to improve as the company's infrastructure is further built out and economies of scale further kick in.

Dow Inc has streamlined its operations and now sells into six different businesses in three market verticals: Performance Materials and Coating; Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure; and Packaging and Specialty Products. Capital discipline is of greater importance at the company, with management favoring brownfield projects over greenfield and focusing on incremental, high return on invested capital projects. This strategy allows management to offer a significant capital return policy and target a peer leading dividend payout ratio of approximately 45% across the cycle. From its first day post-separation, Dow Inc was the high yielding stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and management has a program in place to repurchase $3 billion worth of stock. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $62;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Macroeconomic slowdown, margin compression due to commodity prices, competition</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Facebook  ; $173.35; 425 shares; 2.78%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Sector: </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Communication Services</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: Shares came under pressure this week as the company is set to undergo an  by the Federal Trade Commission. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

It monetizes its platforms and delivers targeted advertisements across all major demographics at a high ROI. Although revenue is expected to decelerate as the company transitions its monetization emphasis to Instagram Stories from Facebook's NewsFeed, and there are additional risks to margins related to increased OpEx spending, we believe both processes have become well understood by investors at this point. Plus, we think future growth opportunities exist through increased monetization of the WhatsApp and Messenger verticals. While critics claim the member base has become disengaged, Facebook's first quarter results showed trends have held with daily active users (DAUs) of 1.56 billion and monthly active users (MAUs) of 2.375 billion.

AI is what has made the company's Search, Video (YouTube) and targeted ad capabilities best-in-class and is the driving force behind the company's success in voice (Google Home) and autonomous driving (Waymo). Furthermore, we believe it is this AI expertise that will also make the company more prevalent in other industries, including healthcare via subsidiary Verily, as AI and machine learning continue to disrupt operations across industries. We believe Alphabet's willingness to invest in new areas, knowing most will fail, is a recipe for long-term success as while most \"  \" projects may fail, every once in a while, you end up with a Waymo, perhaps the division's, most successful graduate to date. Lastly, compounding out positive view of the company's future opportunities, we believe that Alphabet's free cash flow generation and solid balance sheet set it apart and are what will allow the company to continue taking chances on far-out ground-breaking and potentially world changing projects.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $1,400;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Regulatory risk (data privacy), competition, macroeconomic slowdown impacting consumers and therefore ad buyer activity</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  , ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Goldman Sachs Group  ; $189.81; 600 shares; 4.30%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Sector: </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Financials</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: This week, we took advantage of weakness to bulk up on our position at a time where shares had fallen more than $16 below the tangible book value per share the firm reported last quarter. As noted in our  , even with all the headlines around 1MDB, we believe Goldman Sachs should be in better position to perform at this year's test compared to last year based on the fact that management did not have to suspend its buyback program in the second quarter, which they did in 2018. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk. Price Change</emphasis>: 4.01%; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yield</emphasis>: 1.79%</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INVESTMENT THESIS</emphasis>: Goldman Sachs is a strong performing investment bank, and the firm is currently ahead of its goal to generate an additional $5 billion in annual revenue by 2020. Meanwhile, the firm has delivered consistent improvements to its return on equity and return on tangible common equity metrics-which are drivers of a premium over book price-while tangible book value has continued to grow. Another reason why we think the share price deserves a greater premium is because of management's emphasis on fee-based, or more recurring, revenue streams. At the end of 2018, 61% of Goldman's revenues were fee-based, up from 48% in 2013. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $270;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: The economic cycle, Financial System regulation, 1MDB litigation, interest rates, financial market activity</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,   ,  ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Home Depot  ; $197.30; 275 shares; 2.05%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Sector: </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"> Consumer Discretionary</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: None <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

We initiated our position shortly before the Spring--Home Depot's \"Holiday season\" --expecting the company to outperform expectations. Longer term, management's 2020 financial targets include sales to increase to the range of $115 billion to $120 billion, with operating margins in a range of 14.4% to 15% and return on invested capital of more than 40%. Lastly, Home Depot is a cash-generating machine. Making good use of its cash flows, the company recently authorized a 32% increase to its quarterly dividend (which puts the yield ~3.0%) as well as announced a $15 billion share repurchase program. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $210;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Consumer Spending habits; Housing market downturn; inclement weather</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:   ,  ,  ,  ,  , <url normalizedValue=\"http://ir.homedepot.com/\">Investor Relations</url><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Johnson &amp; Johnson  ; $138.55; 550 shares; 2.88%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Sector: </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Healthcare</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: The company presented phase 3 COLUMBA data of Darzalex at the ASCO 2019 conference.

As noted in our  , we are expecting the second half of the year to be a true return to growth for the company, as key initiatives/launches like the nationwide rollout of the Amazon return program, the Nine West and Scott Living brand launches, and the additional store space dedicated to the high-performing active brands, are all due to occur later this year. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

We believe that memory (DRAM &amp; NAND) companies, which are customers of Lam Research, are currently holding back on capital expenditures in an effort to boost near-term profits and preserve cash flows, a dynamic that will ultimately result in supply growth lagging demand growth. Moreover, we believe that thanks to the digital revolution and rapidly growing internet of things space, we believe the demand for memory is becoming less cyclical in nature and as a result, we believe that should our thesis prove correct and we do see a supply shortage in the back half of 2019, then memory prices should begin to rebound and lead to increased CapEx/investments in capital equipment (what Lam sells) in the future. As we noted in out initiation, the current dynamic resembles the first half of 2016, a period that immediately preceded an inflection in prices, which lead to a sharp increase in Lam's earnings. Regarding management signaling, we also believe an inflection is coming due to the timing of management's recently announced $5 billion share repurchase program, which we view as a \"call\" that the industry dynamic is about to turn, and the stock has bottomed because the earnings decline is about to end. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $230;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: A delay in semiconductor companies increasing capital expenditures, a macroeconomic slowdown that hampers demand for memory chips.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Mastercard  ; $265.80; 125 shares; 1.25%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Sector: Info.

In line with this view, we also believe the shift to ecommerce to be a tailwind as online purchases inherently require some form of digital payments. In the near-term we also expect a tailwind to result from the coming release of the Apple Card as MasterCard was selected as the card's payment processing platform.

For 2019 - 2021, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding future acquisitions and Special Items, management's goal is for low-teen Net Revenue CAGR (compound annual growth rate), a minimum 50% Annual Operating Margin, and high-teens percent earnings per share CAGR. Lastly, the company also has a hefty share repurchase program in place. In December 2018, the company announced a new share repurchase program worth $4 billion, which went on top of an existing program.

In addition to improved profitability we also believe the transparent nature of this revenue stream will demand an expanded price-to-earnings multiple as segment sales grow. Furthermore, we believe that Apple's desire to push deeper into the healthcare arena will help make its devices invaluable as more life-changing features are added and the company works to democratize health records.

And while tariffs may pressure the supply chain, should they increase, we believe management is already taking steps to mitigate any potential margin pressure. Lastly, while an economic slowdown could impact all retailers, we believe that Five Below's focus on less expensive products will allow it to be resilient as shoppers will naturally look for discounts when funds run low, making Five Below stores all the more attractive in such an environment. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $135;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Economic slowdown leading to less consumer spending, competition, lack of innovative product mix</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , <url normalizedValue=\"http://investor.fivebelow.com/investors/default.aspx\">Investor Relations</url><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Honeywell International  ; $172.26; 650 shares; 4.23%;</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"> Sector: Industrials</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: None <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

The two segments we remain most positive on for their long-term growth profiles are Aerospace and Safety and Productivity Solution, as both stand to benefit from strong secular trends. Additionally, we appreciate management's ability to drive operational improvements in areas such as margin and free cash flow.

While companies may look to build out multi-cloud environments, Microsoft's Azure offering will be a prime choice thanks to the company's decision to provide the same \"stack\" used in the public cloud, to companies for their on-premise data centers. Additionally, we would note that hybrid environments are currently the preference for most companies because it allows them to maintain critical data in house while taking advantage of the agility and scalability provided by public clouds. Outside of the cloud opportunity, we maintain a positive view on the company's growing gaming business, which we believe is becoming an increasingly prominent factor in the Microsoft growth story as gaming becomes more mainstream, management works to convert its gaming revenue from one-time license purchase to a recurring subscription model and as technologies like augmented/virtual reality evolve. Finally, as it relates to LinkedIn and other subscription-based services such as O365 and various Dynamics products, we continue to value them highly for their recurring revenue streams, which we remind members, provides for greater transparency of future earnings.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $140;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Slowdown in IT spending, competition, cannibalization of on premises business by the cloud</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,   ,   ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Palo Alto Networks  ; $195.54; 225 shares; 1.66%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Sector: Info.

Despite poor earnings from select retailers that have failed to adapt to the shift in consumer trends toward online shopping and a growing preference for off-price retail, we saw incredibly strong results from key retailer Target  . With each quarter Target looks to have gained more and more market share from mall-based stores. That said, the market remains in a holding pattern with earnings season winding down and the nearing holiday season, which will be another test of the strength of the consumer. Regarding trade, recent optimism diminished this week. President Trump appears reluctant to reduce tariffs without further concessions from China, while Beijing has voiced strong disapproval regarding a bill supporting pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, passed by the Senate and the House, that is waiting for the president's signature. Due to our concern of a new tariff threat, we chose to lock in our gains in Caterpillar  and exit our position.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yields on 10-year Treasury notes hovered around the 1.75% level, while gold prices remained around the ~$1,470s per ounce level. The dollar index stood at the 98 level while WTI oil prices moved to the upper $50s near their two-month high.</p><p>Third-quarter earnings season is underway. Within the portfolio, we heard from Kohl's  and Home Depot  .</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Kohl's reported mixed earnings with its FY3Q19 earnings results. On the top line, sales of $4.625 billion (-0.1% YoY) outpaced the $4.399 billion consensus. However, on the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share of $0.74 (-24% YoY) sorely missed expectations of $0.86 per share.</p><p>An annual contraction on the margin front was expected, given the impact of tariffs and promotional efforts, two factors management has spoken to in the past. However, the results were a hair short of expectations coming in at 36.3% (-63bps YoY) versus 36.6% expected. Additionally, although same-store sales did return to growth following a 2.9% decline in the prior quarter, it missed expectations, coming in at 0.4% versus a 0.9% consensus.</p><p>Unfortunately, numbers speak louder than words and while the third-quarter results were disappointing, we believe guidance to be most responsible for Tuesday's decline, as despite returning to growth on same store sales, management was force to cut its full-year earnings forecast to the range of $4.75 to $4.95 per share, down from their prior guidance range of $5.15 to $5.45 per share.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Home Depot reported a mixed headline result with its third-quarter earnings. Sales of $27.2 billion (+3.5% year-over-year) came in light against the $27.53 billion consensus and adjusted earnings per share of $2.53 beat the consensus by one penny.</p><p>Looking at comparable sales, Home Depot saw a 3.6% increase at the company level against consensus expectations of 4.6% growth, while U.S. comps grew 3.8% against expectations of 4.7%. The pace of growth slowed as Home Depot moved through the quarter, with total company comps of 4.1% in August; 3.7% in September; and 3.1% in October with U.S. comps of 4.4% in August; 3.9% in September; and 3.3% in October.</p><p>Looking at the rest of fiscal 2019, management now expects sales to increase 1.8% and comp sales to increase 3.5% (compared to 3.9% consensus expectations). These two figures were both negatively revised from prior expectations for 2.3% sales growth and comp sales growth of 4%. This comp guidance implies fourth-quarter comp growth of roughly 5%, representing a solid acceleration from this quarter, but of course down from prior consensus expectations of 5.5%. When asked about its confidence in this 5% guide, management cited an absence or reversal of pressure of third quarter headwinds such as lumber deflation, foreign currency exchange, and event-timing shift. Bottom line expectations were held steady with management maintaining its earnings per share outlook of $10.03 compared to $10.13 consensus expectations.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Economy</emphasis><br/></p><p>On Tuesday, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that housing starts advanced 3.8% month over month in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.314 million. That was up from September's revised rate of 1.266 million but below expectations for a 1.32-million-unit rate. With October's reading, housing starts are up 8.5% from the same time last year. As for building permits, which \"provide national, state, and local statistics on the number and valuation of new privately-owned housing units authorized by building permits in the United States,\" units authorized in October advanced 5.0% month over month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.461 million, exceeding expectations for a 1.39 million seasonally adjusted rate. This follows a revised September reading of 1.391 million. With October's monthly advance, permits are up 14.1% from the same time last year.

With October's reading, overall existing home sales are up 4.6% from the same time last year. On the pricing front, the median existing home price increased 6.2% YoY to $270,900, marking the 92nd consecutive month of year-over-year price gains. Additionally, regarding 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgages, according to Freddie Mac, the average commitment rate was 3.69% in October, slightly above the 3.61% rate seen in September, but well below the 4.54% average commitment rate across all of 2018. As for unsold inventory, supplies remain below the six-month level many view as balanced, currently sitting at a 3.9-month supply given the current rate of sales, down from the 4.1-month level seen in September. See  for our full analysis.</p><p>Also on Thursday, the Department of Labor reported that initial jobless claims for the week ending November 16 were 227,000, unchanged from the previous week's revised level (revised up from 225,000), and 9,000 claims above expectations of 218,000. Importantly, the four-week moving average for claims (used as a gauge to offset volatility in the weekly numbers) was 221,000, a 3,500-claim increase from the previous week's revised average of 217,500 (revised up from 217,000). The low rate of layoffs reflects a strengthening labor market as claims have remained below 300,000 - the threshold typically used to categorize a healthy jobs market - for an incredible 245 consecutive weeks, the longest streak for weekly records dating back to 1967. The previous longest stretch ended in April 1970 and lasted for 161 weeks.

We believe the company's opportunities for upside rest with additional Libre uptake, the Alinity U.S. launch, and an expanded indication of the Mitraclip.

Additionally, we believe profitability will continue to improve as AWS and advertising account for a larger portion of total sales as both these segments sport higher margins than the eCommerce operation. And while we believe the increasing share of revenue from these higher margin businesses will be key to driving profitability longer-term, we believe margins on ecommerce stand to improve as the company's infrastructure is further built out and economies of scale further kick in.

Despite the incredible selling strength of this product, investors have shied away from this name due to Humira's lost patent protection in Europe and risk in the United States in 2023. Key to the AbbVie's future is the acquisition of Allergan, a deal that will diversify the company's revenue stream and give it exposure to Medical Aesthetics, neuroscience, and eye care, while also increase operating cash flow.

In addition to strong title launches, we continue to view Activision Blizzard as being at the forefront of the esports industry (though we place little emphasis on this in the near-term as esports profitability remains a longer-term story) thanks to significant investments in the Overwatch league and decision to launch a Call of Duty league in calendar year 2020. Finally, compounding the improving company-specific fundamentals, we believe the industry-wide shift toward digital downloads and in-game monetization to be a material factor that will aid in margin expansion overtime. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $62<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Competition, in-game purchase related regulatory headwinds, failed adoption of new releases.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">CVS Health </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $75.31; 2,175 shares; 5.61%; Sector: Healthcare</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: As we  on Monday, shares continue to benefit from the revised \"Medicare for All\" plan put out by U.S. Sen.

The Wall Street Journal  that the company is looking for ways to reduce the super-targeting of political ads by increasing the minimum amount of people that can be targeted by a given ad \"from 100 to a few thousand.\" Per the article, according to an unnamed source \"Facebook has sought feedback on potential changes with large Republican and Democratic political ad buyers -- about that possible change and other ideas -- in efforts to limit how misinformation is spread, since ads with false or misleading information are often targeted toward specific audiences.\" We view the move as a positive as, despite positive underlying business fundamentals, political headlines have remained an overhang on the company and stock. We believe taking these additional steps will help to address concerns from the political sphere regarding the platform's influence on election results. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

It monetizes its platforms and delivers targeted advertisements across all major demographics at a high ROI. Although revenue is expected to decelerate as the company transitions its monetization emphasis to Instagram Stories from Facebook's NewsFeed, and there are additional risks to margins related to increased OpEx spending, we believe both processes have become well understood by investors at this point. Plus, we think future growth opportunities exist through increased monetization of the WhatsApp and Messenger verticals. While critics claim the member base has become disengaged, Facebook's first quarter results showed trends have held with daily active users (DAUs) of 1.56 billion and monthly active users (MAUs) of 2.375 billion.

Unfortunately, reviews have skewed negative as performance does not appear to be living up to expectations or the promises made by management. That said, it is important that while this may make for poor headlines, Stadia was not expected to represent a material contribution to the top line. Analysts at MKM Partners noted their belief that it would likely not represent more than 0.25% of 2021 sales. That in mind, we do believe the platform to be a step in the right direction as it can serve to increase engagement with users both by giving Alphabet exposure to the rapidly growing gaming market and increasing engagement with YouTube as it tries to compete with Amazon's Twitch. Moreover, it serves to further bolster the company's hardware business, with the analysts at MKM also pointing out that \"hardware sales are growing at 2x the growth rate of core Advertising sales, and will have effectively grown 5x from '16 to '20.\" So, bottom line, this was not as strong a release as expected, but expectations were never that high to begin with. However, we will look for improvements over time as we do believe the gaming to continue growing over time and would not be surprised to see Stadia increase its revenue share in the years to come. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

AI is what has made the company's Search, Video (YouTube) and targeted ad capabilities best-in-class and is the driving force behind the company's success in voice (Google Home) and autonomous driving (Waymo). Furthermore, we believe it is this AI expertise that will also make the company more prevalent in other industries, including healthcare via subsidiary Verily, as AI and machine learning continue to disrupt operations across industries. We believe Alphabet's willingness to invest in new areas, knowing most will fail, is a recipe for long-term success as while most \"  \" projects may fail, every once in a while, you end up with a Waymo, perhaps the division's, most successful graduate to date. Lastly, compounding out positive view of the company's future opportunities, we believe that Alphabet's free cash flow generation and solid balance sheet set it apart and are what will allow the company to continue taking chances on far-out ground-breaking and potentially world changing projects.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $1,400;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Regulatory risk (data privacy), competition, macroeconomic slowdown impacting consumers and therefore ad buyer activity</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Mastercard </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $282.57; 225 shares; 2.18%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Sector: Info.

In line with this view, we also believe the shift to ecommerce to be a tailwind as online purchases inherently require some form of digital payments. In the near-term we also expect a tailwind to result from the coming release of the Apple Card as MasterCard was selected as the card's payment processing platform. Furthermore, we value MasterCard for the strong three-year Performance Objectives management laid out on their fourth quarter 2018 and full year 2018 financial results conference call. For 2019 - 2021, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding future acquisitions and Special Items, management's goal is for low-teen Net Revenue CAGR (compound annual growth rate), a minimum 50% Annual Operating Margin, and high-teens percent earnings per share CAGR. Lastly, the company also has a hefty share repurchase program in place. In December 2018, the company announced a new share repurchase program worth $4 billion, which went on top of an existing program.

Additionally, we believe the Cavium deal was a big step in the company's transformation while the acquisition of Aquantia, a leader in Multi-Gig Ethernet connectivity, will help in broadening Marvell's connectivity solutions portfolio and capitalizing on the future of high-speed networking requirements in cars that are needed to enable autonomous, electric, and safety/security applications. Furthermore, on the M&amp;A front, we believe plans to acquire Avera Semiconductor, a developer of custom ASICs for networking and telecom equipment was a 5G additive play as Avera's biggest end market exposure is base stations, which are leveraged to 5G. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $28;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Further intensification on the US/China trade front, a delayed ramp in 5G infrastructure buildouts.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:   ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Microsoft Corp </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $149.59; 550 shares; 2.82%; Sector: Technology</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: This week, in an update that pressured shares of Slack WORK, Corporate Vice President for Microsoft 365 Jared Spataro announced in a blog  that  , the company's workplace collaboration platform, \"has more than 20 million daily active users.\" The product represents yet another way in which Microsoft is becoming more deeply engrained in the enterprise space -- on top of the simple fact that Azure is fast becoming the backbone of many businesses around the world.

Additionally, we would note that hybrid environments are currently the preference for most companies because it allows them to maintain critical data in house while taking advantage of the agility and scalability provided by public clouds. Outside of the cloud opportunity, we maintain a positive view on the company's growing gaming business, which we believe is becoming an increasingly prominent factor in the Microsoft growth story as gaming becomes more mainstream, management works to convert its gaming revenue from one-time license purchase to a recurring subscription model and as technologies like augmented/virtual reality evolve. Finally, as it relates to LinkedIn and other subscription-based services such as O365 and various Dynamics products, we continue to value them highly for their recurring revenue streams, which we remind members, provides for greater transparency of future earnings.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Target Price</emphasis>: $160;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Slowdown in IT spending, competition, cannibalization of on premises business by the cloud</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,   ,   ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Novartis </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $90.48; 900 shares; 2.79%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Sector: Healthcare</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: None <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Furthermore, we value the company's international presence as it means a lessened exposure to North America, where new drilling activity remains limited.

In addition to improved profitability we also believe the transparent nature of this revenue stream will demand an expanded price-to-earnings multiple as segment sales grow. Furthermore, we believe that Apple's desire to push deeper into the healthcare arena will help make its devices invaluable as more life-changing features are added and the company works to democratize health records.

Therefore, we believe Burlington's business model keeps them immune from the pressures facing department stores, and we expect the company will continue to deliver low single digit same store sales growth.

Meanwhile, the firm has delivered consistent improvements to its return on equity and return on tangible common equity metrics-which are drivers of a premium over book price-while tangible book value has continued to grow. Another reason why we think the share price deserves a greater premium is because of management's emphasis on fee-based, or more recurring, revenue streams. At the end of 2018, 61% of Goldman's revenues were fee-based, up from 48% in 2013. The firm's tangible book value per share as of the end of the second quarter 2019 is $203.05. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $270;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: The economic cycle, Financial System regulation, 1MDB litigation, interest rates, financial market activity</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,   ,  ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Home Depot</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $218.03; 150 shares; 1.12%; Sector: Consumer Discretionary</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: Reported  . <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

We initiated our position shortly before the Spring--Home Depot's \"Holiday season\" --expecting the company to outperform expectations. Longer term, management's 2020 financial targets include sales to increase to the range of $115 billion to $120 billion, with operating margins in a range of 14.4% to 15% and return on invested capital of more than 40%. Lastly, Home Depot is a cash-generating machine. Making good use of its cash flows, the company recently authorized a 32% increase to its quarterly dividend (which puts the yield ~3.0%) as well as announced a $15 billion share repurchase program. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $230;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Consumer Spending habits; Housing market downturn; inclement weather</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  , <url normalizedValue=\"http://ir.homedepot.com/\">Investor Relations</url><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Honeywell</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $176.79; 300 shares; 1.82%; Sector: Industrials</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: Honeywell hosted a two-day ( <url normalizedValue=\"http://investor.honeywell.com/Cache/1500125640.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=1500125640&amp;iid=4121346\">here</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://investor.honeywell.com/Cache/1500125698.PDF?O=PDF&amp;T=&amp;Y=&amp;D=&amp;FID=1500125698&amp;iid=4121346\">here</url> ) Investor showcase of its Honeywell Building Technologies (HBT) business made up of Fire &amp; Life Safety, Building Management Systems, Connected Buildings, Electrical Products, Security, and HON Building Solutions. Management spoke of an industry with a $100 billion-plus total addressable market, with HBT operating in about $60 billion of that market growing at a roughly 4% compound annual growth rate. Management also sees a HBT business that can grow at a mid-single digit percent compound growth rate over the long-term with segment margins of 23%, up from 2019's estimate of about 20.5. We always like to turn to our favorite industrial analyst Stephen Tusa of JPMorgan for his view on the company's in his coverage, and he wrote in a research note this week that HBT \"looks to us like one of the higher value non-residential businesses, with outgrowth potential as these connected building technologies continue to proliferate, and we see HON as positioned well to benefit with HBT segment profit growth of ~7.5% above the EE/MI sector average.\" Lastly and of little surprise, management reaffirmed its 4Q2019 guidance and FY 2019 guidance at the event. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

The two segments we remain most positive on for their long-term growth profiles are Aerospace and Safety and Productivity Solution, as both stand to benefit from strong secular trends. Additionally, we appreciate management's ability to drive operational improvements in areas such as margin and free cash flow.

Importantly, we expect the company's Pharmaceutical and Consumer business to grow above their respective industry growth rates, and even though Medical Devices has lagged, we have seen encouraging signs of improvements.

The firm consistently delivers the best return on equity/tangible common equity performance in the industry, making the stock well deserving of a premium to its growing tangible book value. Not only that, but the Fortress balance sheet provides a degree of insulation to the risks associated with an economic shock. Lastly, we believe the valuation is very reasonable, especially considering the roughly 3% dividend yield and big buyback.

Its brands are tailored to middle-income buyers who shop for value, or good deals, while their store locations remain away from the mall which has been subject to decline in foot traffic. The company is run by a strategic management team who has several strong initiatives in place (standard-to-small initiatives, partnership with Planet Fitness, Fanatics, of course Amazon and more) that drive traffic and improve inventory management.

While we acknowledge that shares have been incredibly strong this year, we remind members that we have booked profits all the way up and given the dynamics in the memory industry, we continue to like the outlook for shares as we continue to believe that DRAM/NAND demand growth will outpace supply growth as we work through CY2020 and ultimately result in increased level of chip maker capex to the benefit of Lam Research. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk. Price Change</emphasis>: -7.65%; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yield</emphasis>: 1.76%</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INVESTMENT THESIS</emphasis>: We see upside resulting from ongoing industry dynamics that we believe will result in a coming inflection point for profitability as we enter the back half of the year. We believe that memory (DRAM &amp; NAND) companies, which are customers of Lam Research, are currently holding back on capital expenditures in an effort to boost near-term profits and preserve cash flows, a dynamic that will ultimately result in supply growth lagging demand growth. Moreover, we believe that thanks to the digital revolution and rapidly growing internet of things space, we believe the demand for memory is becoming less cyclical in nature and as a result, we believe that should our thesis prove correct and we do see a supply shortage in the back half of 2019, then memory prices should begin to rebound and lead to increased CapEx/investments in capital equipment (what Lam sells) in the future. As we noted in out initiation, the current dynamic resembles the first half of 2016, a period that immediately preceded an inflection in prices, which lead to a sharp increase in Lam's earnings. Regarding management signaling, we also believe an inflection is coming due to the timing of management's recently announced $5 billion share repurchase program, which we view as a \"call\" that the industry dynamic is about to turn, and the stock has bottomed because the earnings decline is about to end. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $285;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: A delay in semiconductor companies increasing capital expenditures, a macroeconomic slowdown that hampers demand for memory chips.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Nvidia </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $210.89; 475 shares; 3.43%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Sector: Info.

We also attribute some of the noticeably pronounced declines in healthcare stocks to the rising uncertainty of the Iowa caucuses, and media stocks facing backlash due to persisting concerns of the ongoing challenges related to cord cutting. Elsewhere, we saw our consumer-packaged goods names rally as investors looked for durable yields against a falling 10-Year Treasury yield, and certain semiconductors gained in response to strong outlooks from a few key companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Looking ahead, next week will be the true test as earrings kick into high gear with a number of industry bellwethers reporting. Their unique outlooks will provide in-depth views on global economic activity. Also, several big tech names are set to report earnings which could move markets because tech represents the largest sector of the S&amp;P 500.</p><p>If earnings won't keep you busy enough, we'll hear from the FOMC and Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday following the conclusion of the January FOMC meeting. While the market largely expects rates to go unchanged (87.3% probability at the time this was written according to the  ), commentary around inflation expectations and balance sheet policy will be key to forming future rate movement expectations - a key factor impacting equity valuations.</p><p>10-year Treasury yields continued their downward drift and fell below~1.7%, while gold prices pushed higher to around 1,575. The U.S. dollar index remained between 97 and 98, and WTI oil prices plunged under $55 per barrel due to economic-slowdown concerns related to the coronavirus.</p><p>Fourth-quarter earnings season is picking up. Within the portfolio, we heard from Abbott Laboratories  and Comcast  .</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Abbott Laboratories reported in-line earnings, with its fourth-quarter 2019 results. Revenues of $8.314 billion (+7.1% year over year) came in ahead of the $8.266 billion consensus, while adjusted earnings per share of $0.95 (+17% YoY) matched expectations. On a very positive note, organic sales increased a whopping 8.5% in the quarter, reflecting a nice acceleration from the third quarter's 7.6% rate and topping estimates.</p><p>Management issued full-year 2020 guidance, and from an organic sales perspective they expect growth of 7.0% to 8.0%. In 2019 Abbott delivered organic sales growth of 7.7%. Momentum appears to be on its side and this expected rate of growth for a company of this size (+$100 billion market cap) is nothing short of remarkable. From an earnings perspective, adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.55 to $3.65, which at a midpoint of $3.60 (+11.1% growth YoY) is a penny shy of the $3.61 consensus.</p><p>For the first quarter 2020, management expects adjusted earnings per share to be $0.69 to $0.71, which at a midpoint of $0.70 is two pennies less than the $0.72 consensus. Though bottom line guidance for the first quarter and the full year is a tad below expectations, we think it is worth looking past this forecast due to management's history of conservatism with their initial read.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Comcast reported a top and bottom-line beat with its fourth-quarter results. On the top line, revenue of $28.398 billion (+2% year over year) beat expectations of $28.17 billion. Adjusted EBITDA of $8.436 (+3.0% YoY) billion was roughly in line with $8.45 billion estimates and adjusted earnings per share of $0.79 (+7.7% YoY) edged expectations by three pennies.</p><p>Comcast generated $2.484 billion in free cash flow in the quarter, up about 20% from a year ago, but light against $2.86 billion consensus estimates. The company ended the quarter with consolidated net debt of $96.2 billion, down from $97.1 billion in the prior quarter. This puts pro forma net leverage at 2.8x, down from 2.9x a quarter ago. Although the balance sheet is not yet at the point where Comcast will resume share repurchases, the company announced a 10% increase to its dividend (to $0.92 per share from $0.84 on an annualized basis), representing the 12th consecutive annual increase. This dividend hike will put the new yield slightly below 2.0%.</p><p>As for guidance, management expects 2020 will see higher programming expense growth due to the number of contracts up for renewal, but the increase is expected to be back-half weighted. Still, Comcast expects Cable EBITDA margins to increase 50 basis points from the full year thanks to growth in high-margin connectivity, continued operational improvements, better performance from Xfinity Mobile, and higher political advertising. It looks like consensus was looking for guidance of 50-100 basis points, and that might explain why the stock turned lower after an initial pre-market pop. Nevertheless, management was likely conservative with their initial forecast, just like they were at the start of 2019 (they ended the year with expansion of about 3x their initial forecast). Elsewhere, management expects 2020 capital intensity improvement of \"approximately 50 basis points\" year over year. For Sky, EBITDA is expected to be consistent with 2019 results (before investment and on current FX rates) as tailwinds related to the deployment of Sky Q -- whose current customers tend to have higher viewership, retention levels, ARPU, and better product attachment -- will be met with the challenging macro and gambling legislation.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Economy</emphasis><br/></p><p>On Wednesday, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported that existing home sales -- completed transactions for single-family homes, town homes, condominiums and co-ops - advanced 3.6% in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.54 million, a beat versus expectations for an increase to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.43 million. With December's reading, overall existing home sales are up 10.8% from the same time last year. See  for our full analysis.</p><p>On Thursday, the Department of Labor reported that initial jobless claims for the week ending January 18 were 211,000, an increase of 6,000 from the previous week's revised level of 205,000 (revised up from 204,000), however, 4,000 claims below expectations of 215,000. Importantly, the four-week moving average for claims (used as a gauge to offset volatility in the weekly numbers) was 213,250, a 3,250-claim decrease from the previous week's revised average of 216,500 (revised up from 216,250). The low rate of layoffs reflects a strengthening labor market as claims have remained below 300,000 - the threshold typically used to categorize a healthy jobs market - for an incredible 254 consecutive weeks, the longest streak for weekly records dating back to 1967. The previous longest stretch ended in April 1970 and lasted for 161 weeks. For the official weekly release, please see  .</p><p>On Friday, the IHS Markit Group reported that the IHS Markit Flash U.S. Composite PMI Output Index for January registered a reading of 53.1, up from 52.7 in December. Driving the headline number was accelerated services sector growth. The Flash U.S. PMI Services Business Activity Index advanced to 53.2 (from 52.8 in December), while the IHS Markit Flash U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 51.7 (from 52.4 in December). However, the Flash U.S. Manufacturing Output Index was unchanged, holding at 52.4 in January. See  for our full analysis.</p><p>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Note: T is the most recent period, T-1 is the prior period's reading and T-2 is two periods back, the intent being to illustrate any trends</emphasis>)</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oil</emphasis><br/></p><p>On the commodity front, prices moved lower as the U.S. continues to pump at record levels and concerns regarding the  on Chinese growth, global travel and global economic growth in general as a result, pressured future demand expectations. Those concerns more than offset favorable  such as OPEC+ production cuts, Iranian sanctions,  and increased tensions in the Middle East in general following the assassination of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.</p><p>On the domestic front, on Thursday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), reported that in the week ending January 17, U.S. stockpiles (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) decreased by 0.4 million barrels to 428.1 million barrels, a bearish reading versus expectations for a 1.0 million barrel decrease. Additionally, U.S. production held at all-time highs of 13.0 million bpd. Lastly, net imports decreased by 53,000 bpd as imports decreased by 120,000 bpd, while exports decreased by 67,000 bpd. See  for the full report.</p><p>Lastly, we note that the spread between WTI and Brent sits at around the $6 per barrel level. Recall, this is a key metric as the wider the spread, the more attractive US based crude (WTI) becomes to foreign buyers, though we note that strength in the dollar can offset this effect as foreign buyers convert their home currencies to the dollar.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stocks</emphasis><br/></p><p>In the portfolio this week, we viewed weakness as an opportunity to increase our stake in Tyson Foods<br/>  and Bristol-Myers Squibb<br/>  . On the other hand, we trimmed several positions including PepsiCo<br/>  , and Facebook  , UnitedHealth Group  and Marvel Technology Group  -- with a Kohl's  exit --  .</p><p>Moving on to the S&amp;P 500, fourth-quarter earnings season is ramping up. Members should take the following data with a grain of salt as the data set is somewhat limited so early in the season. That said, 69.3% of companies reporting so far have posted a positive EPS surprise. For the fourth quarter, earnings growth is down roughly 1.3% year over year vs. expectations for an overall 1.76% decline throughout the season; of the 49 non-financials that reported, earnings are down 3.1%. Revenues for the S&amp;P 500 are up 3.3% vs. expectations throughout the season for a 2.55% increase; 69.3% of companies beat EPS expectations, 24.0% missed the mark and 6.7% were in line with consensus. On a year-over-year comparison basis, 64.0% beat the prior year's EPS results, 34.67% came up short and 1.33% were virtually in line. The best performing sectors so far have been Information Tech, Communication Services and Consumer Staples, while the worst performing have been Materials, Industrials and Real Estate.</p><p>Next Sunday is the Superbowl, but the week ahead is the \"Super Bowl of earnings\" with 130 companies in the S&amp;P 500 set to report. Within the portfolio, we will hear from Starbucks  and Apple  on Tuesday after the close; Novartis  and Mastercard  on Wednesday before the open; Microsoft  , Lam Research  and Facebook  on Wednesday after the close; Amazon  on Thursday after the close; and Honeywell  on Friday before the open.</p><p>Other key earnings reports for the market include: D.R.

In addition to strong title launches, we continue to view Activision Blizzard as being at the forefront of the esports industry (though we place little emphasis on this in the near-term as esports profitability remains a longer-term story) thanks to significant investments in the Overwatch league and decision to launch a Call of Duty league in calendar year 2020.

That in mind, the big, \"control your own destiny move\" the company made was the Celegene deal. From a financial perspective, the deal is expected to achieve greater than 40% accretion in the first full year with roughly $800 million in synergies in 2020, 2021, and 2022.

Furthermore, we value the company's international presence as it means a lessened exposure to North America, where new drilling activity remains limited.

We think this company will be one of the biggest winners of the Phase One trade deal with China because of the country's pledge to increase imports U.S., and more specifically, its need for more pork (and substitutes like Chicken) to offset falling supplies related to the African Swine Flu. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $105;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Higher input costs, commodity pricing, product recalls</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">ViacomCBS</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $35.74; 2,981 shares; 3.46%; Sector: Communications Services</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: As noted in our previous  , while there was no company-specific news, we believe shares came under severe pressure this week due to commentary impacting the TV industry as a whole, including the shift away from linear TV to streaming (discussed on the Netflix earnings call) and expectations for increased cord cutting (discussed on the Comcast earnings call). <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

On the synergy side, management expects to deliver an estimated $500 million in annualized run-rate cost synergies within 12-24 months of the merger closing date, and we think there is room for upside here in both value size and timeline.

Services provide for a recurring revenue stream at higher margins, a factor that serves to reduce earnings volatility while allowing for a higher percentage of sales to fall to the bottom line, as a result, we believe that Services growth and the installed base, are much more important than how many devices the company can sell in a given 90-day period. In addition to improved profitability we also believe the transparent nature of this revenue stream will demand an expanded price-to-earnings multiple as segment sales grow. Furthermore, we believe that Apple's desire to push deeper into the healthcare arena will help make its devices invaluable as more life-changing features are added and the company works to democratize health records.

Therefore, we believe Burlington's business model keeps them immune from the pressures facing department stores, and we expect the company will continue to deliver low single digit same store sales growth.

Regarding the debt load on the balance sheet resulting from the acquisition, we reaffirm that management has an excellent M&amp;A track record and believe strong cash flow generation will provide the means to successfully de-leverage overtime, allowing shares to re-rate higher over time.

With that, given the ongoing spread of the virus in the region, it is worth noting that should we see a similar move in Hong Kong, Disney maintains 47% ownership of the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort. While we do not want to make light of the situation, we want members to understand Disney's exposure. That said, outside of the theme parks we will also continue monitor the impact on movie theaters as many in China have been closed due to the outbreak and depending on the timeline may result in some pressure on global box office sales. While this is more difficult to quantify (some revenues may be delayed rather than lost and again the timeline of these closures, including the length of closures and the timing around Disney movie releases, will be key), we will continue to monitor the situation and update members as we learn more. In other news, we want to point out that Disney announced it moved up the launch date for Disney+ in West Europe markets by one week, and analysts at Morgan Stanley raised their price target on the stock off higher DTC estimates. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Although revenue is expected to decelerate as the company transitions its monetization emphasis to Instagram Stories from Facebook's NewsFeed, and there are additional risks to margins related to increased OpEx spending, we believe both processes have become well understood by investors at this point. Plus, we think future growth opportunities exist through increased monetization of the WhatsApp and Messenger verticals. While critics claim the member base has become disengaged, Facebook's first quarter results showed trends have held with daily active users (DAUs) of 1.56 billion and monthly active users (MAUs) of 2.375 billion.

AI is what has made the company's Search, Video (YouTube) and targeted ad capabilities best-in-class and is the driving force behind the company's success in voice (Google Home) and autonomous driving (Waymo). Furthermore, we believe it is this AI expertise that will also make the company more prevalent in other industries, including healthcare via subsidiary Verily, as AI and machine learning continue to disrupt operations across industries. We believe Alphabet's willingness to invest in new areas, knowing most will fail, is a recipe for long-term success as while most \"  \" projects may fail, every once in a while, you end up with a Waymo, perhaps the division's, most successful graduate to date. Lastly, compounding out positive view of the company's future opportunities, we believe that Alphabet's free cash flow generation and solid balance sheet set it apart and are what will allow the company to continue taking chances on far-out ground-breaking and potentially world changing projects.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $1,400;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Regulatory risk (data privacy), competition, macroeconomic slowdown impacting consumers and therefore ad buyer activity</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Goldman Sachs</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $241.46; 450 shares; 3.53%; Sector: Financials</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: CEO David Solomon  with CNBC this week in Davos at the  . <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Meanwhile, the firm has delivered consistent improvements to its return on equity and return on tangible common equity metrics-which are drivers of a premium over book price-while tangible book value has continued to grow. Another reason why we think the share price deserves a greater premium is because of management's emphasis on fee-based, or more recurring, revenue streams. At the end of 2018, 61% of Goldman's revenues were fee-based, up from 48% in 2013.

Longer term, management's 2020 financial targets include sales to increase to the range of $115 billion to $120 billion, with operating margins in a range of 14.4% to 15% and return on invested capital of more than 40%.

We believe that memory (DRAM &amp; NAND) companies, which are customers of Lam Research, are currently holding back on capital expenditures in an effort to boost near-term profits and preserve cash flows, a dynamic that will ultimately result in supply growth lagging demand growth. Moreover, we believe that thanks to the digital revolution and rapidly growing internet of things space, we believe the demand for memory is becoming less cyclical in nature and as a result, we believe that should our thesis prove correct and we do see a supply shortage in the back half of 2019, then memory prices should begin to rebound and lead to increased CapEx/investments in capital equipment (what Lam sells) in the future. As we noted in out initiation, the current dynamic resembles the first half of 2016, a period that immediately preceded an inflection in prices, which lead to a sharp increase in Lam's earnings. Regarding management signaling, we also believe an inflection is coming due to the timing of management's recently announced $5 billion share repurchase program, which we view as a \"call\" that the industry dynamic is about to turn, and the stock has bottomed because the earnings decline is about to end. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $315 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: A delay in semiconductor companies increasing capital expenditures, a macroeconomic slowdown that hampers demand for memory chips.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Mastercard </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $322.36; 200 shares; 2.1%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Sector: Info.

In line with this view, we also believe the shift to ecommerce to be a tailwind as online purchases inherently require some form of digital payments. In the near-term we also expect a tailwind to result from the coming release of the Apple Card as MasterCard was selected as the card's payment processing platform. Furthermore, we value MasterCard for the strong three-year Performance Objectives management laid out on their fourth quarter 2018 and full year 2018 financial results conference call. For 2019 - 2021, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding future acquisitions and Special Items, management's goal is for low-teen Net Revenue CAGR (compound annual growth rate), a minimum 50% Annual Operating Margin, and high-teens percent earnings per share CAGR.

Additionally, we believe the Cavium deal was a big step in the company's transformation while the acquisition of Aquantia, a leader in Multi-Gig Ethernet connectivity, will help in broadening Marvell's connectivity solutions portfolio and capitalizing on the future of high-speed networking requirements in cars that are needed to enable autonomous, electric, and safety/security applications. Furthermore, on the M&amp;A front, we believe the acquisition Avera Semiconductor, a developer of custom ASICs for networking and telecom equipment was a 5G additive play as Avera's biggest end market exposure is base stations, which are leveraged to 5G. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $28;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>   to Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Further intensification on the US/China trade front, a delayed ramp in 5G infrastructure buildouts.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,   ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Microsoft Corp </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $164.9; 500 shares; 2.68%; Sector: Technology</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: CEO Satya Nadella  at the World Economic Forum this week in Davos to discuss \"unlocking inclusive economic growth and equitable globalization through technological progress.\" Nadella also sat down with Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga to  \"The Role of the New Industrialists.\" We look forward to hearing from management when the company reports results on Wednesday, after the closing bell, where we will be looking for earnings of $1.32 per share on sales of $35.686 billion. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Additionally, we would note that hybrid environments are currently the preference for most companies because it allows them to maintain critical data in house while taking advantage of the agility and scalability provided by public clouds. Outside of the cloud opportunity, we maintain a positive view on the company's growing gaming business, which we believe is becoming an increasingly prominent factor in the Microsoft growth story as gaming becomes more mainstream, management works to convert its gaming revenue from one-time license purchase to a recurring subscription model and as technologies like augmented/virtual reality evolve. Finally, as it relates to LinkedIn and other subscription-based services such as O365 and various Dynamics products, we continue to value them highly for their recurring revenue streams, which we remind members, provides for greater transparency of future earnings.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Target Price</emphasis>: $160;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Slowdown in IT spending, competition, cannibalization of on premises business by the cloud</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  , Jim sits down with CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood -  ,  (1/16/2020),  ,  ,  ,   ,   ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Nvidia </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $249.8; 475 shares; 3.86%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Sector: Info.

The company has democratized several communications channels like voice, text, chat, and video, and its services are the building blocks of many disruptive software/tech companies that need to push their technology to the cloud. Recent product introductions include Twilio Flex, the first fully programmable cloud contact center platform that helps companies modernize outdated call centers.

While there may always be some pressure as a result of either profit taking or intensifying trade rhetoric -- especially given that we are making new all-time highs and the bears will look for any reason to sell -- we remain bullish thanks to a resilient consumer on the back of a strong job market as we enter the holiday season -- a factor causing much of the recent strength seen in the retail sector (think Kohl's KSS, Burlington BURL, and Home DepotHD). Moreover, we continue to believe that if we truly are inching closer to a deal, manufacturing activity will be able to pick back up and become less worse with a recovery in global economic growth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">10-year Treasury yields slipped to the 1.8% level, while gold prices remain around the ~$1,470s per ounce level. The dollar index stands at around the 98 level while WTI oil prices are in the mid- to- upper-$50s region.</p><p>Third-quarter earnings season is underway. Within the portfolio, we heard from Cisco, Viacom  and Nvidia  .</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Cisco Systems reported a top- and bottom-line beat with its fiscal first quarter 2020 results. Revenue of $13.20 billion (+2% YoY excluding the SPVSS divestment) edged past the consensus of $13.08 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of 84 cents (+12% YoY) beat the consensus by three pennies.</p><p>Digging deeper, product revenue was flat YoY at $9.878 billion but in line with $9.824 billion consensus, while service was up 4% at $3.281 billion -- and in line with the $3.254 billion consensus. Breaking products down further, infrastructure platforms revenue fell 1% YoY to $7.538 billion vs. $7.608 billion consensus; application revenue was up 6% to $1.499, in line with $1.476 billion consensus; security revenue grew 22% to $815 million, which was strong compared to $723 million consensus; and \"other products\" revenue fell to $26 million, vs. a $36 million consensus. Software subscriptions as a percent of total software revenue -- one of the more meaningful metrics for assessing the company's transformation -- now sits at 71%, up 1 percentage point quarter-over-quarter, and 12 percentage points year-over-year.</p><p>Guidance was a big disappointment and sent shares lower the next day. For the second quarter of fiscal 2020, revenue is expected to decline 3% to 5% year-over-year, well below Street estimates of 2.4% growth. Moving through guidance, adjusted gross margins are expected range from 64.5% to 65.5% (vs. the Street's expectation of 64.5%) with an adjusted operating margin rate of 32.5% to 33.5% (vs. the Street's 32.5%). All of this leads to an adjusted earnings-per share guidance in the range of 75 cents to 77 cents, which is light against a 79-cent consensus expectation.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Viacom reported a top and bottom-line beat with its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings results. Revenues of $3.433 billion (-1% YoY, flat constant currency) topped the consensus of $3.42 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.79 (-20% YoY; -14% on constant currency) exceeded estimates by $0.03.</p><p>At Filmed Entertainment, revenues of $851 million (-14% YoY) came in short of the $865 million estimates. But more importantly, adjusted operating income was $54 million (+42% YoY), exceeding estimates of $14 million and marked the 11th straight quarter of YoY operating income improvement. At Media Networks, revenues of $2.614 billion (+4 YoY, +6% constant currency) beat $2.584 billion consensus expectations, while adjusted operating income of $597 million (-16% YoY, -13% constant currency) was below $623 million expectations.</p><p>With this likely the last reported quarter for Viacom as a standalone company, investors focus now moves to the Viacom-CBS merger. During the Q&amp;A, management spoke to four revenue opportunities of the combination: distribution, U.S. advertising, content licensing, and streaming.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Nvidia reported a top- and bottom-line beat with its fiscal third quarter 2020 results. Revenue of $3.014 billion (-5% YoY) outpaced the $2.921 billion consensus, while adjusted earnings per share of $1.78 (-3% YoY) surpassed expectations of $1.58 per share. On the margin front, Nvidia outperformed its own guidance with adjusted gross margins coming in at a strong 64.1%, up 400 basis points sequentially and a solid beat versus prior guidance of 62.5% +/-50bps.</p><p>In the upcoming quarter management expects revenue in the range of $2.95 billion +/-2%, which at the midpoint is a tad short vs. the $3.066 billion consensus.</p><p>But while the revenue guide may have come up short, gross margins guidance more than makes up for it as management expects adjusted gross margins for the fourth quarter in the range of 64.5% +/- 50bps, a strong forecast vs. the 62.65% consensus heading into the print. Adjusted operating expense guidance of $805 million on the other hand was a bit high vs. expectations of $783 million and up slightly from third quarter adjusted operating expenses of $774 million.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Economy</emphasis><br/></p><p>On Wednesday, The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) advanced 0.4% in October on a seasonally adjusted basis, edging out expectations for a 0.3% monthly advance, following a flat September reading. Over the last 12 months, the CPI has increased 1.8% before seasonal adjustment, also outpacing the 1.7% consensus and representing an acceleration versus the 1.7% rate seen in August and September.</p><p>The \"core\" CPI rose 0.2% in October, in line with expectations. Over the past 12 months, core CPI has risen 2.3%, below expectations for a 2.4% advance. However, while the advance is above the Fed's 2.0% target, the reading represents a deceleration from the 2.4% annual rate of advance seen in August and September. See  for our full analysis.</p><p>On Thursday, The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that the Producer Price Index for final demand advanced 0.4% (seasonally adjusted) in October, edging out expectations for a 0.3% advance and coming on the heels of a 0.3% decline in September.

Importantly, the four-week moving average for claims (used as a gauge to offset volatility in the weekly numbers) was 217,000, a 1,750-claim increase from the previous week's unrevised average of 215,250. The low rate of layoffs reflects a strengthening labor market as claims have remained below 300,000 - the threshold typically used to categorize a healthy jobs market - for an incredible 244 consecutive weeks, the longest streak for weekly records dating back to 1967. The previous longest stretch ended in April 1970 and lasted for 161 weeks.

However, partially offsetting the miss, September's reading was revised up to indicate a 0.3% decline (from -0.4% previously). Capacity utilization also came in below expectations for October, registering a 76.7% reading versus a 77.0% consensus.

We believe the company's opportunities for upside rest with additional Libre uptake, the Alinity U.S. launch, and an expanded indication of the Mitraclip. We believe in CEO Miles White and the Abbott management team, who has a strong track record of integrating acquisitions and delivering double-digit earnings per share growth.

Additionally, we believe profitability will continue to improve as AWS and advertising account for a larger portion of total sales as both these segments sport higher margins than the eCommerce operation. And while we believe the increasing share of revenue from these higher margin businesses will be key to driving profitability longer-term, we believe margins on ecommerce stand to improve as the company's infrastructure is further built out and economies of scale further kick in.

Despite the incredible selling strength of this product, investors have shied away from this name due to Humira's lost patent protection in Europe and risk in the United States in 2023. Key to the AbbVie's future is the acquisition of Allergan, a deal that will diversify the company's revenue stream and give it exposure to Medical Aesthetics, neuroscience, and eye care, while also increase operating cash flow.

While the recurring sales power of the mobile game remains to be seen we believe the update to support our view that it is certainly increasing the company's reach and therefore in-game monetization potential. As for consoles, the report also noted that according to Game Sales Data (GSD), \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare </emphasis>was the best-selling title (physical + digital) in Europe for the week-ended November 3<sup>rd</sup>.\" Given the ongoing sales momentum, we continue to believe that fourth-quarter guidance provided on the most recent earnings release will ultimately prove conservative. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

In addition to strong title launches, we continue to view Activision Blizzard as being at the forefront of the esports industry (though we place little emphasis on this in the near-term as esports profitability remains a longer-term story) thanks to significant investments in the Overwatch league and decision to launch a Call of Duty league in calendar year 2020. Finally, compounding the improving company-specific fundamentals, we believe the industry-wide shift toward digital downloads and in-game monetization to be a material factor that will aid in margin expansion overtime. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $62<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Competition, in-game purchase related regulatory headwinds, failed adoption of new releases.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">CVS Health </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $74.29; 2175 shares; 5.52%; Sector: Healthcare</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: Credit Suisse hosted CEO Larry Merlo and CFO Eva Boratto for a presentation at the 28<sup>th</sup> Annual Credit Suisse Healthcare Conference.

During the Credit Suisse presentation, Boratto said they plan to give more quantitative metrics by the middle of next year.

We believe the new CVS Health will transform into a diversified pharmacy/healthcare retailer that is integrated with a managed care operation, creating a more personalized and analytic-based experience that all patients will want. Additionally, we value shares because CVS is an all-domestic company (providing insulation from trade-related headwinds) in the healthcare field (defensive) without a lot of cyclicality, making it even more attractive as we are faced with a barrage of headlines about slower global economic growth. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $84; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Failure to execute on Aetna integration, greater than expected rebate guarantee headwinds on PBM business, regulatory headwinds</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , <url normalizedValue=\"http://investors.cvshealth.com/\">Investor Relations</url><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Salesforce</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $163.21; 775 shares; 4.32%; Sector: Info.

Members should also note that while we may see some integration in the future, this is separate from the companies digital currency (Libra) ambitions and is therefore likely to face less scrutiny from regulators, though it will certainly add to the amount and type of data being collected and housed on Facebook servers - which could raise some eyebrows. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

It monetizes its platforms and delivers targeted advertisements across all major demographics at a high ROI. Although revenue is expected to decelerate as the company transitions its monetization emphasis to Instagram Stories from Facebook's NewsFeed, and there are additional risks to margins related to increased OpEx spending, we believe both processes have become well understood by investors at this point. Plus, we think future growth opportunities exist through increased monetization of the WhatsApp and Messenger verticals. While critics claim the member base has become disengaged, Facebook's first quarter results showed trends have held with daily active users (DAUs) of 1.56 billion and monthly active users (MAUs) of 2.375 billion.

Per the report, \"The data involved in the initiative encompasses lab results, doctor diagnoses and hospitalization records, among other categories, and amounts to a complete health history, including patient names and dates of birth.\" While the news appeared to violate the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPA), the companies claimed it was compliant with federal law. As also noted in the article, HIPA \"allows hospitals to share data with business partners without telling patients, as long as the information is used 'only to help the covered entity carry out its health care functions.'\" We will continue to monitor for updates. However, while this may be technically legal, it certainly does not help Alphabet's case as regulators and politicians continue to look at the company with many calling for a breakup. That said, as we've noted before, we do not believe a potential breakup would ruin the investment case and continue to believe that a breakup of big tech may even unlock value as faster growing segments would be freed up to trade at an expanded multiple. In other news, just in case a massive data collection on millions of American's health records wasn't enough to draw further scrutiny, the WSJ also  this week that Google has its sights trained on consumer finance with plans to roll out consumer checking accounts.

AI is what has made the company's Search, Video (YouTube) and targeted ad capabilities best-in-class and is the driving force behind the company's success in voice (Google Home) and autonomous driving (Waymo). Furthermore, we believe it is this AI expertise that will also make the company more prevalent in other industries, including healthcare via subsidiary Verily, as AI and machine learning continue to disrupt operations across industries. We believe Alphabet's willingness to invest in new areas, knowing most will fail, is a recipe for long-term success as while most \"  \" projects may fail, every once in a while, you end up with a Waymo, perhaps the division's, most successful graduate to date.

In the near-term we also expect a tailwind to result from the coming release of the Apple Card as MasterCard was selected as the card's payment processing platform.

For 2019 - 2021, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding future acquisitions and Special Items, management's goal is for low-teen Net Revenue CAGR (compound annual growth rate), a minimum 50% Annual Operating Margin, and high-teens percent earnings per share CAGR.

Additionally, we believe the Cavium deal was a big step in the company's transformation while the acquisition of Aquantia, a leader in Multi-Gig Ethernet connectivity, will help in broadening Marvell's connectivity solutions portfolio and capitalizing on the future of high-speed networking requirements in cars that are needed to enable autonomous, electric, and safety/security applications.

Services provide for a recurring revenue stream at higher margins, a factor that serves to reduce earnings volatility while allowing for a higher percentage of sales to fall to the bottom line, as a result, we believe that Services growth and the installed base, are much more important than how many devices the company can sell in a given 90-day period. In addition to improved profitability we also believe the transparent nature of this revenue stream will demand an expanded price-to-earnings multiple as segment sales grow. Furthermore, we believe that Apple's desire to push deeper into the healthcare arena will help make its devices invaluable as more life-changing features are added and the company works to democratize health records. Lastly, also see upside resulting from increased adoption of wearables (think the Apple Watch) and potential new product announcements such as an AR/VR headset or an update on project Titan, the company's secretive autonomous driving program. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: $270 ;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Slowdown in consumer spending, competition, lack of new product innovation, elongated replacement cycles, failure to execute on Services growth initiative</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  Interview  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">B</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">P PLC</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $39.21; 1750 shares; 2.34%; Sector: Energy</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE:</emphasis> None <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

The bargains Burlington's stores offer creates a \"treasure hunting\" experience for its shoppers, and this cannot be replicated by e-commerce. Therefore, we believe Burlington's business model keeps them immune from the pressures facing department stores, and we expect the company will continue to deliver low single digit same store sales growth. Lastly, any supply chain disruptions caused by tariffs may work to Burlington's favor, as off-price's value will gain additional favor should either prices increase, or stores need to unload inventory. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $220;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: Two </emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Consumer spending, inventory availability, fashion trends</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:   ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Caterpillar </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $145.31; 400 shares; 1.98%; Sector: Industrials</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: This week, in line with  , we  on our position with our highest sale price to date as we question how long this rotation into cyclicals will last. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

If Caterpillar delivers on this target, it would effectively double its Services businesses over a 10-year span. An enhanced and more consistent capital return policy is also a major theme of the new Caterpillar.

Meanwhile, the firm has delivered consistent improvements to its return on equity and return on tangible common equity metrics-which are drivers of a premium over book price-while tangible book value has continued to grow. Another reason why we think the share price deserves a greater premium is because of management's emphasis on fee-based, or more recurring, revenue streams. At the end of 2018, 61% of Goldman's revenues were fee-based, up from 48% in 2013. The firm's tangible book value per share as of the end of the second quarter 2019 is $203.05. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $270;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: The economic cycle, Financial System regulation, 1MDB litigation, interest rates, financial market activity</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,   ,  ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Home Depot</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $237.29; 150 shares; 1.22%; Sector: Consumer Discretionary</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: We look forward to hearing from management when the company reports earnings next week on Tuesday, before the opening bell, where we will be looking for sales of $27.525 billion and earnings of $2.52 per share. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

We initiated our position shortly before the Spring--Home Depot's \"Holiday season\" --expecting the company to outperform expectations. Longer term, management's 2020 financial targets include sales to increase to the range of $115 billion to $120 billion, with operating margins in a range of 14.4% to 15% and return on invested capital of more than 40%. Lastly, Home Depot is a cash-generating machine. Making good use of its cash flows, the company recently authorized a 32% increase to its quarterly dividend (which puts the yield ~3.0%) as well as announced a $15 billion share repurchase program. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $230;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Consumer Spending habits; Housing market downturn; inclement weather</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  , <url normalizedValue=\"http://ir.homedepot.com/\">Investor Relations</url><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Honeywell</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $181.75; 300 shares; 1.86%; Sector: Industrials</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa published several takeaways from a dinner he had with CEO Darius Adamczyk the previous week. What we were focused on was the conversation around Safety and Productivity Solutions, which we remind you has hit a bit of a rough patch in terms of organic growth and margins over the past several quarters. Importantly, management said margins have bottomed and will expand next year with the help of easier comps. Additionally, Intelligrated is still growing strong and had 24% order growth in the third quarter. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

The two segments we remain most positive on for their long-term growth profiles are Aerospace and Safety and Productivity Solution, as both stand to benefit from strong secular trends. Additionally, we appreciate management's ability to drive operational improvements in areas such as margin and free cash flow.

Importantly, we expect the company's Pharmaceutical and Consumer business to grow above their respective industry growth rates, and even though Medical Devices has lagged, we have seen encouraging signs of improvements.

The firm consistently delivers the best return on equity/tangible common equity performance in the industry, making the stock well deserving of a premium to its growing tangible book value. Not only that, but the Fortress balance sheet provides a degree of insulation to the risks associated with an economic shock. Lastly, we believe the valuation is very reasonable, especially considering the roughly 3% dividend yield and big buyback.

Its brands are tailored to middle-income buyers who shop for value, or good deals, while their store locations remain away from the mall which has been subject to decline in foot traffic. The company is run by a strategic management team who has several strong initiatives in place (standard-to-small initiatives, partnership with Planet Fitness, Fanatics, of course Amazon and more) that drive traffic and improve inventory management.

Price Change</emphasis>: 4.03%; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yield</emphasis>: 1.62%</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INVESTMENT THESIS</emphasis>: We see upside resulting from ongoing industry dynamics that we believe will result in a coming inflection point for profitability as we enter the back half of the year. We believe that memory (DRAM &amp; NAND) companies, which are customers of Lam Research, are currently holding back on capital expenditures in an effort to boost near-term profits and preserve cash flows, a dynamic that will ultimately result in supply growth lagging demand growth. Moreover, we believe that thanks to the digital revolution and rapidly growing internet of things space, we believe the demand for memory is becoming less cyclical in nature and as a result, we believe that should our thesis prove correct and we do see a supply shortage in the back half of 2019, then memory prices should begin to rebound and lead to increased CapEx/investments in capital equipment (what Lam sells) in the future. As we noted in out initiation, the current dynamic resembles the first half of 2016, a period that immediately preceded an inflection in prices, which lead to a sharp increase in Lam's earnings. Regarding management signaling, we also believe an inflection is coming due to the timing of management's recently announced $5 billion share repurchase program, which we view as a \"call\" that the industry dynamic is about to turn, and the stock has bottomed because the earnings decline is about to end. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $285;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: A delay in semiconductor companies increasing capital expenditures, a macroeconomic slowdown that hampers demand for memory chips.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Nvidia </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $204.19; 475 shares; 3.31%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Sector: Info.

Furthermore, we believe the cloud (i.e. data center) growth will be even more of a factor in upside following the acquisition of Mellanox, which thanks to its low latency \"InfiniBand\" technology, provides Nvidia the ability be a more integral player in the buildout of data centers by working to both accelerate server subsystems via GPU-acceleration and accelerate the data center overall by \"tying together\" the multiple subsystems and allowing them to operate as a single cohesive unit. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $220;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: slow uptake of ray-tracing chips which will depend on gaming publishers' implementation of the new technology in software releases, a slowdown in the IT/data center spending, competition, slower than expected inventory channel normalization.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,    ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Schlumberger </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $35.36; 1500 shares; 1.81%; Sector: Energy</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: None <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Although the company's earnings power is dependent on the timing of the upstream investment cycle, management has a strong reputation in execution as well as a good handle in understanding the supply/demand dynamic of the industry. The company's premier technology gives it an advantage over peers and allows for market share gains. Furthermore, we value the company's international presence as it means a lessened exposure to North America, where new drilling activity remains limited.

The rule presented Friday, expected to be enacted in 2021, will go further by requiring hospitals to also post the prices paid by various insurance plans.\" This new policy may be a \"better than feared outcome.\" While the strong move on Friday came following President Trump's press conference on the planned rule, we believe it was also aided by the release of Elizabeth Warrens,  , which appears to be less extreme than feared, at least to start, as it noted that a transition to a full Medicare for All system would take multiple years and start with a \"Medicare for All option.\" <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Regarding the tariffs, China plans to implement tariffs of 5% to 10% on $75 billion worth of U.S. goods in two stages, the first coming on September 1<sup>st</sup> and the second on December 15<sup>th</sup>, the same dates that US tariffs on Chinese goods are currently set to take effect.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, while the news out of China sent Friday's pre-market activity from positive to negative almost instantly, markets attempted to pare losses flip back to positive territory as  , noting that the challenge now is to sustain the US economic expansion (indicating that they will act as necessary to do so). Additionally, he stated that while inflation has ticked up slightly in their view, they will continue to consider global dynamics, including the ongoing U.S./China trade war, asserting that the Fed can adjust policy as a result of trade developments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nevertheless, the rally attempt was ultimately stymied as President Trump responded to China's tariff announcement by  :</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\"Our Country has lost, stupidly, Trillions of Dollars with China over many years. They have stolen our Intellectual Property at a rate of Hundreds of Billions of Dollars a year, &amp; they want to continue. I won't let that happen! We don't need China and, frankly, would be far better off without them. The vast amounts of money made and stolen by China from the United States, year after year, for decades, will and must STOP. Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China, including bringing your companies HOME and making your products in the USA. I will be responding to China's Tariffs this afternoon. This is a GREAT opportunity for the United States. Also, I am ordering all carriers, including Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS and the Post Office, to SEARCH FOR &amp; REFUSE, all deliveries of Fentanyl from China (or anywhere else!). Fentanyl kills 100,000 Americans a year. President Xi said this would stop - it didn't. Our Economy, because of our gains in the last 2 1/2 years, is MUCH larger than that of China. We will keep it that way!\"</emphasis><br/></p><p>While the tweets were certainly intense, we remind members that this is President Trump's negotiating style, to hit hard and later walk it back. As a result, we remain focused on the underlying fundamentals of our positions and will look to use any ensuing weakness to our advantage by buying those stocks that do not rely on lower rates or global growth and are instead, exposed to secular multi-year trends.</p><p>10-year Treasury yields are hovering around the 1.5% 2-10 spread continues to play in inversion territory. Gold prices remain in the low $1,500s per ounce level. The U.S. dollar stands at ~97 level while WTI oil prices continue to tread water in the mid-$50s per barrel region.</p><p>Second-quarter earnings season is winding down. Within the portfolio, we heard from Home Depot, Kohl's and Salesforce.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Home Depot  reported a mixed headline result with its second-quarter earnings. Sales of $30.8 billion (+1.2% year-over-year) came in shy against the $30.98 billion consensus, but adjusted earnings per share of $3.17 beat the consensus by nine cents.</p><p>Looking at comparable sales, Home Depot saw a +3% increase at the company level compared to expectations of 3.4%, with +3.1% in the United States. Importantly, comps picked up speed through the quarter, as the monthly cadence was +0.2% in May, +4.1% in June, and +4.6% in July, and the U.S. delivering +0.6% comps in May, +4.1% in June, and +4.7% in July. All but two regions in the United delivered positive comps, and every merchandising department, expect for lumber, was in positive territory.</p><p>On guidance, Management trimmed its full year sales outlook to +2.3%, with comparable sales of +4%, a change from previous guidance of a +5% comps growth. This new target reflects continued lumber price deflation and some conservatism around how the U.S. consumer may be affected by the trade war.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Kohl's  reported a top- and bottom-line beat with its FY2Q19 earnings results. On the top line, sales of $4.43 billion (-3.1% YoY) outpaced the $4.31 billion consensus. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share of $1.55 (-12% YoY) exceeded expectations of $1.53 per share. In addition to the headline results, while the company's gross margin declined 70 bps from the year ago period at 38.8%, it was largely in line with expectations. Looking to the all-important retail metric, same-store sales (a.k.a. comps), while the headline numbers came in above estimates, same-store sales were somewhat disappointing at -2.9% versus the -2.4% analysts were looking for. While this is certainly not what it was in the year-ago period when same store sales advanced 3.1%, it is a sequential improvement versus the FY1Q19's 3.4% decline and in line with CFO Bruce Besanko's commentary on the first-quarter conference call, where he stated, \"We expect Q2 comps to remain soft but show relative improvement to Q1.\"</p><p>Additionally, despite the second-quarter comps miss, it is important to remember that sentiment was about as bad as it could have been coming into the release and as a result, in our view, the same store sales miss is forgivable given the simple fact that despite all the pressures facing retail such as trade, a tight labor market and fears of a recession on the horizon, the company managed to reaffirm its adjusted annual earnings guidance (which management reiterated does take into account tariff concerns) of $5.15 to $5.45 per diluted share, which at the midpoint ($5.30 per share) exceeds the $5.23 per share consensus.</p><p><br/><br/></p><p>Salesforce.com  reported a strong top- and bottom-line beat with its fiscal second quarter 2020 earnings. Revenue of $4 billion (+23% year-over-year on a constant currency, or CC, basis) beat the consensus of $3.955 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of 66 cents (including items) exceeded the consensus expectation of 47 cents.</p><p>By services: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">sales cloud</emphasis> revenue growth accelerated sequentially to 12.5% with its $1.13 billion number; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">service cloud</emphasis> increased 22% year-over-year to about $1.1 billion; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Salesforce platform and \"other\"</emphasis> increased 28% year-over-year to $0.9 billion (and that includes $159 million of \"Mulseoft,\"); and lastly, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">marketing cloud &amp; commerce cloud</emphasis> increased 36% year-over-year to $0.6 billion.</p><p>Salesforce.com's current remaining performance obligation, which represents all future revenue under contract that has not been recognized as revenue yet, increased 25% YoY CC to $12.1 billion, topping expectations of $11.82 billion. Cash flow was strong relative to expectations, decreasing 5%YoY to $436 million but greatly exceeding estimates of $271 million.</p><p>For the full year, management raised its full fiscal year revenue outlook to $16.75 billion to $16.90 billion (+26% to 27% YoY growth), smashing current consensus of $16.435 billion. In addition, adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $2.82 to $2.84, an outlook that is greater than the current consensus of $2.77. Plus, operating cash flow is expected to grow 21% to 22% YoY.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Economy</emphasis><br/></p><p>On Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported that existing home sales - completed transactions for single-family homes, town homes, condominiums and co-ops - popped 2.5% in July to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.42 million, exceeding expectations for a 2.3% increase (or 5.39 million rate). Compounding the advance, June's reading was revised up to a 5.29 million unit rate from 5.27 million previously reported. With July's reading, existing home sales are up 0.6% from the same time last year. As for pricing, the median existing home price increased 4.3% YoY to $280,800, marking the 89th consecutive month of yearly price gains. Additionally, regarding 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgages, the average commitment rate was 3.77% in July, down from 3.80% in June and below the 4.54% average for all of 2018, according to Freddie Mac. See  for our full analysis.</p><p>On Thursday, the Department of Labor reported that initial jobless claims for the week ending August 17 were 209,000, a 12,000-claim decrease from the previous week's revised level of 221,000 (revised up from 220,000), and 7,000 claims below expectations of 216,000 initial jobless claims. Importantly, the four-week moving average for claims (used as a gauge to offset volatility in the weekly numbers) was 214,500, an increase of 500 from the previous week's revised average of 214,000 (revised up from 213,750). The low rate of layoffs reflects a strengthening labor market as claims have remained below 300,000 -- the threshold typically used to categorize a healthy jobs market - for an incredible 233 consecutive weeks, the longest streak for weekly records dating back to 1967. The previous longest stretch ended in April 1970 and lasted for 161 weeks. For the official weekly release, please see  .</p><p>On Friday, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that new home sales in July dropped 12.8% month over month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 635,000. However, while the decline missed expectations for a 0.16% advance on a percentage point basis (to a 647,000 seasonally adjusted unit rate), June's reading was revised sharply upward to a rate of 728,000 (from 646,000 previously), more than making up for the July miss.</p><p>Digging deeper, month over month, sales surged 50.0% in the Northeast (+56.0% YoY), however, this was more than offset by an 11.1% decline in the Midwest (-18.8% YoY), a 14.2% pullback in the West (+8.4.0% YoY), and a 16.1% drop in the South (+3.2% YoY). As for costs, the average selling price in July advanced to $388,000 (from $354,500 in June). The median sales price also moved higher, increasing to $312,800 (from $306,000 in June). See  for our full analysis.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oil</emphasis><br/></p><p>On the commodity front, the dynamic remains largely unchanged. Oil prices remain in limbo as fears of a global slowdown continue to be counter balanced by ongoing tensions in the Middle East. While the global growth fears remain a result of ongoing trade issues, tensions in the Middle East intensified coming into the week as  . A larger than expected U.S. inventory drawdown also helped support prices.</p><p>On the domestic front, on Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), reported that in the week ending August 16, U.S. stockpiles (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) decreased by 2.7 million barrels to 437.8 million barrels, a bullish reading versus expectations for a 1.89 million barrel drawdown. Additionally, U.S. production was unchanged at 12.3 million bpd. Lastly, net imports fell by 617,000 bpd as imports decreased by 497,000 bpd, while exports increased by 120,000 bpd. See  for the full report.</p><p>Lastly, we note that the spread between WTI and Brent currently stands at ~$5 per barrel. Recall, this is a key metric as the wider the spread, the more attractive U.S. based crude (WTI) becomes to foreign buyers, though we note that strength in the dollar can offset this effect as foreign buyers convert their home currencies to the dollar.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stocks</emphasis><br/></p><p>In the portfolio this week, we added to our positions in Palo Alto Networks  (  ), Citigroup  (  ) and Viacom  (  ).</p><p>Moving on to the broader market, second-quarter earnings season is winding down with 74.3% of companies reporting a positive EPS surprise. For the second-quarter, earnings growth is up roughly 2.2% year over year vs. expectations for an overall 2.07% advance throughout the season; for the 408 non-financials that reported, earnings are up 2.0%. Revenues are up 3.6% vs. expectations throughout the season for a 3.13% increase; 74.3% of companies beat EPS expectations, 18.3% missed the mark and 7.4% were in line with consensus. On a year-over-year comparison basis, 67.58% beat the prior year's EPS results, 31.58% came up short and 0.84% were virtually in line. The best performing sectors so far have been Healthcare, Information Tech and Communication Services, while the worst performing have been Consumer Discretionary, Energy and Utilities.</p><p>Next week, 26 companies in the S&amp;P 500 will report earnings.

This investment will enhance Amazon's existing portfolio of investments in the payments landscape in India.\" We view this as a solid move that should aid the company's push into the India, a market that has been incredibly difficult to gain traction in due to regulation, however, one that is highly sought after given its over 6% GDP growth rate (one of the fastest in the world), ~1.34 billion population and rapidly growing middle class (think a greater base of consumers able to buy discretionary items). 1-Wk.

And while we believe the increasing share of revenue from these higher margin businesses will be key to driving profitability longer-term, we believe margins on ecommerce stand to improve as the company's infrastructure is further built out and economies of scale further kick in.

The bargains Burlington's stores offer creates a \"treasure hunting\" experience for its shoppers, and this cannot be replicated by e-commerce. Therefore, we believe Burlington's business model keeps them immune from the pressures facing department stores, and we expect the company will continue to deliver low single digit same store sales growth.

If Caterpillar delivers on this target, it would effectively double its Services businesses over a 10-year span. An enhanced and more consistent capital return policy is also a major theme of the new Caterpillar.

AI is what has made the company's Search, Video (YouTube) and targeted ad capabilities best-in-class and is the driving force behind the company's success in voice (Google Home) and autonomous driving (Waymo). Furthermore, we believe it is this AI expertise that will also make the company more prevalent in other industries, including healthcare via subsidiary Verily, as AI and machine learning continue to disrupt operations across industries. We believe Alphabet's willingness to invest in new areas, knowing most will fail, is a recipe for long-term success as while most \"  \" projects may fail, every once in a while, you end up with a Waymo, perhaps the division's, most successful graduate to date. Lastly, compounding out positive view of the company's future opportunities, we believe that Alphabet's free cash flow generation and solid balance sheet set it apart and are what will allow the company to continue taking chances on far-out ground-breaking and potentially world changing projects.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $1,400;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Regulatory risk (data privacy), competition, macroeconomic slowdown impacting consumers and therefore ad buyer activity</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  , ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Johnson &amp; Johnson </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  $127.73; 575 shares; 2.81%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"> Sector: Healthcare</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: We checked up on this position ahead of next week's expected ruling in Oklahoma where a judge is set to rule (on Monday) on the opioid lawsuit against Johnson &amp; Johnson.

We see it as being in line with our prior commentary that Mastercard is doing everything it needs to in order to ensure that it remains on the cutting edge of payments technology and prepare for a world where plastic will be outdated and payments will leap over plastic right into digital. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk. Price Change</emphasis>: -0.90%; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yield</emphasis>: 0.49%</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INVESTMENT THESIS</emphasis>: We believe upside will result from the secular shift toward digital payments and a growing \"network effect\" as acceptance rates of digital payments increase among merchants. In line with this view, we also believe the shift to ecommerce to be a tailwind as online purchases inherently require some form of digital payments. In the near-term we also expect a tailwind to result from the coming release of the Apple Card as MasterCard was selected as the card's payment processing platform. Furthermore, we value MasterCard for the strong three-year Performance Objectives management laid out on their fourth quarter 2018 and full year 2018 financial results conference call. For 2019 - 2021, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding future acquisitions and Special Items, management's goal is for low-teen Net Revenue CAGR (compound annual growth rate), a minimum 50% Annual Operating Margin, and high-teens percent earnings per share CAGR. Lastly, the company also has a hefty share repurchase program in place. In December 2018, the company announced a new share repurchase program worth $4 billion, which went on top of an existing program.

Additionally, we believe the Cavium deal was a big step in the company's transformation while the acquisition of Aquantia, a leader in Multi-Gig Ethernet connectivity, will help in broadening Marvell's connectivity solutions portfolio and capitalizing on the future of high-speed networking requirements in cars that are needed to enable autonomous, electric, and safety/security applications.

Additionally, we would note that hybrid environments are currently the preference for most companies because it allows them to maintain critical data in house while taking advantage of the agility and scalability provided by public clouds. Outside of the cloud opportunity, we maintain a positive view on the company's growing gaming business, which we believe is becoming an increasingly prominent factor in the Microsoft growth story as gaming becomes more mainstream, management works to convert its gaming revenue from one-time license purchase to a recurring subscription model and as technologies like augmented/virtual reality evolve.

While the figure is a sharp increase from the $1 billion committed in Apple's first year of original content, it's pales in comparison to the $15 billion that industry leader Netflix is expected to spend this year. Lastly, 9to5Mac reported that the upcoming Apple Arcade subscription gaming service will likely be priced at $4.99 per month. We view all three of these new and upcoming releases as supportive of our view that in the long run, a heftier Services offering will allow Apple to increase its recurring revenue stream and expand companywide margins. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Services provide for a recurring revenue stream at higher margins, a factor that serves to reduce earnings volatility while allowing for a higher percentage of sales to fall to the bottom line, as a result, we believe that Services growth and the installed base, are much more important than how many devices the company can sell in a given 90-day period. In addition to improved profitability we also believe the transparent nature of this revenue stream will demand an expanded price-to-earnings multiple as segment sales grow. Furthermore, we believe that Apple's desire to push deeper into the healthcare arena will help make its devices invaluable as more life-changing features are added and the company works to democratize health records. Lastly, also see upside resulting from increased adoption of wearables (think the Apple Watch) and potential new product announcements such as an AR/VR headset or an update on project Titan, the company's secretive autonomous driving program. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $260;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Slowdown in consumer spending, competition, lack of new product innovation, elongated replacement cycles, failure to execute on Services growth initiative</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  Interview  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Comcast</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  $42.43; 1400 shares; 2.27%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"> Sector: Communication Services</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE1</emphasis>: None <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Recall, domestically, the X1 has been shown to be more resilient to the trend than competing platforms. Regarding the debt load on the balance sheet resulting from the acquisition, we reaffirm that management has an excellent M&amp;A track record and believe strong cash flow generation will provide the means to successfully de-leverage overtime, allowing shares to re-rate higher over time.

Plus, we think future growth opportunities exist through increased monetization of the WhatsApp and Messenger verticals.

Another reason why we think the share price deserves a greater premium is because of management's emphasis on fee-based, or more recurring, revenue streams.

Making good use of its cash flows, the company recently authorized a 32% increase to its quarterly dividend (which puts the yield ~3.0%) as well as announced a $15 billion share repurchase program. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>:  to $230;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Consumer Spending habits; Housing market downturn; inclement weather</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  , <url normalizedValue=\"http://ir.homedepot.com/\">Investor Relations</url><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Honeywell</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  $156.49; 350 shares; 2.09%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"> Sector: Industrials</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: None <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

The two segments we remain most positive on for their long-term growth profiles are Aerospace and Safety and Productivity Solution, as both stand to benefit from strong secular trends. Additionally, we appreciate management's ability to drive operational improvements in areas such as margin and free cash flow.

Its brands are tailored to middle-income buyers who shop for value, or good deals, while their store locations remain away from the mall which has been subject to decline in foot traffic. The company is run by a strategic management team who has several strong initiatives in place (standard-to-small initiatives, partnership with Planet Fitness, Fanatics, of course Amazon and more) that drive traffic and improve inventory management. Additionally, Kohl's continues to be a large beneficiary of peer closings (like Bon-Ton), resulting in increased market share. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reduced to </emphasis>$56;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: A decline in consumer spending, shifts in consumer fashion preferences, margin pressure related to increased competition, weather impacting consumer shopping habits, tariffs,</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   ,   ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Lam Research </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  $200.39; 350 shares; 2.68%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Sector: Info.

We believe that memory (DRAM &amp; NAND) companies, which are customers of Lam Research, are currently holding back on capital expenditures in an effort to boost near-term profits and preserve cash flows, a dynamic that will ultimately result in supply growth lagging demand growth. Moreover, we believe that thanks to the digital revolution and rapidly growing internet of things space, we believe the demand for memory is becoming less cyclical in nature and as a result, we believe that should our thesis prove correct and we do see a supply shortage in the back half of 2019, then memory prices should begin to rebound and lead to increased CapEx/investments in capital equipment (what Lam sells) in the future. As we noted in out initiation, the current dynamic resembles the first half of 2016, a period that immediately preceded an inflection in prices, which lead to a sharp increase in Lam's earnings. Regarding management signaling, we also believe an inflection is coming due to the timing of management's recently announced $5 billion share repurchase program, which we view as a \"call\" that the industry dynamic is about to turn, and the stock has bottomed because the earnings decline is about to end. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $230;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: A delay in semiconductor companies increasing capital expenditures, a macroeconomic slowdown that hampers demand for memory chips.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Shopify </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  $382.75; 45 shares; 0.66%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"> Sector: Info.

Its platform acts as a \"retail operating system\" for businesses and provides tools that assist in areas such digital marketing, payments and shipping. Instead of putting goods directly on an e-commerce marketplace, Shopify helps businesses build their own websites and online presence, allowing them to connect directly with their audience. Additionally, part of the Shopify value proposition relates to its benefit of scale which allows the company to negotiate online payment rates and shipping rates on their customer's behalf. Shopify also empowers small businesses and helps merchants thrive through the merchant funding and by offering cash advances.

Even though we added to our position, we are not changing our Three rating as our stance on the upcoming quarter has not changed. That said, as noted in our  our thinking at the time of the trade was that we now have a stock that is too cheap to sell and its sharp, overreacted selloff has created an interesting opportunity for a trade.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> 1-Wk.

As members know, we believe the trade negotiations to be the primary focus of the market as any positive development can serve to reinvigorate business confidence and potentially cause an uptick in U.S. manufacturing activity and business investments and as a result, keep the expansion going. On the other hand, we believe a breakdown in negotiations would prove highly detrimental as the U.S. and global economy in general are already showing signs of a slowdown and any further tariffs or added friction in the supply chain via sanctions (such as those on Huawei) would certainly see a further reduction in business confidence and slowdown in growth.</p><p>While G-20 is our current focus, it isn't the only event the markets had to contend with this week as Wednesday and Thursday evening saw campaign season kick off with the first of the Democratic debates. Though it's still too early to speculate as to whom the Democratic front runner will be, we'll be watchful of how polling progresses and what platform with respect to U.S. healthcare system, tax reform, student debt and more they run on. While we do our best to avoid being political, we will of course continue to monitor the political sphere for new developments as, the closer we get to the 2020 election, the more the risk landscape facing our holdings will shift.</p><p>Lastly, outside of the political spectrum, after the close on Thursday, the Federal Reserve announced the second stage  of its annual stress tests on the country's 18 largest banks.</p><p>The 10-Year Treasury yield dipped yet hovered right above the ~2.0% level while gold prices pushed through the ~$1,400 per ounce level. The U.S. dollar index remains in the 96-97 range while WTI oil prices went into the weekend pressed up against the $60 per barrel level.</p><p>First-quarter earnings season has come to a close. No portfolio companies reported this week.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Economy</emphasis><br/></p><p>On Tuesday, shortly after the opening bell, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that new home sales in May declined 7.8% month over month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 626,000. The reading missed expectations for an increase to 683,750, however, was slightly offset by an upward revision to April's estimates, which was revised up to 679,000 (from 673,000). With the May reading, on a year-over-year basis, sales are down 3.7% from May's 2018's estimate of 650,000. As for costs, the average selling price in May decreased to $377,200 (from $386,500 in April). The median sales price also moved lower, decreasing to $308,000 (from $335,100 in April). See  for our full analysis.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Commerce Department reported that new orders for manufactured durable goods fell 1.3% in May to $243.4 billion, following a 2.8% decline in April (revised down from -2.1% previously reported). The reading missed expectations for a 0.2% decline. With the monthly advance, new orders for durable goods are up 1.0% from the same time last year. Shipments for manufactured durable goods increased 0.4% to $254.1 billion in May, following a 1.6% decrease in April. Driving the move was a 1.1% increase in shipments of machinery. Unfilled orders fell in May, declining 0.5% to $1.1712 trillion, following a 0.2% decline in April and were led by a 0.7% pullback in unfilled orders of transportation equipment. Finally, inventories bumped up 0.5% in May to $424.6 billion, following a 0.4% advance in April led by a 1.6% increase in transportation equipment. With April's readings, shipments are up 3.9%, unfilled orders increased 5.0%, and total inventories have grown by 0.8% from the same time last year.</p><p>New orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft (i.e., core capital goods) increased 0.4% in May, quadrupling expectations of a 0.1% monthly increase. This followed a 0.3% advance in March and a 1.0% decline in April. Shipments of core capital goods, popped 0.7% last month, outpacing expectations for a 0.1% increase. With the monthly readings, new orders for core capital goods are up 2.3% from the same time last year while shipments are up 3.8% annually. See  for our full analysis.</p><p>On Thursday morning before the opening bell, The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) reported in its third reading (based on a more complete set of data than the second reading released last month on May 30) that real Gross Domestic Product -- GDP adjusted for inflation, our best gauge for economic growth -- increased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.1% in the first quarter of 2019. That figure was a tick short of expectations for a 3.2% increase, but was in line with the 3.1% rate seen in the second reading. This latest reading follows readings of 2.2% and 3.4% annual rates of growth in the fourth and third quarters of 2018, respectively.</p><p>In addition to real GDP, we want to note that the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which takes out food and energy to reduce month-to-month volatility, rose 1.7% from the same time last year (first quarter of 2018). It was a deceleration from the 1.9% annual rate of increase seen in the fourth quarter of 2018 but up from 1.6% in the BEA's second estimate. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, the core PCE price index is up 1.2%, also a deceleration from the fourth quarter's 1.8% quarterly advance but up from 1.0% in the BEA's second reading. See  for our full analysis.</p><p>Also, on Thursday, The National Association of Realtors reported that its Pending Home Sales Index rebounded 1.1% in May to 105.4, a tick above expectations for a 10.% monthly advance and coming on the heels of a 1.5% decline in April. Recall that pending home sales represent contracts signed for existing home sales set to close in the next one to two months. With May's reading, pending home sales are down 0.7%, year over year, missing expectations for a 0.4% annual uptick and marking the 17th straight month of year-over-year declines. See  for our full analysis.</p><p>Lastly on Thursday, the Department of Labor reported that initial jobless claims for the week ending June 22 were 227,000, a 10,000-claim increase from the previous week's revised level of 217,000 (revised up from 216,000) and 7,000 claims above expectations for a 220,000-claim reading. Importantly, the four-week moving average for claims (used as a gauge to offset volatility in the weekly numbers) was 221,250, an increase of 2,250 from the previous week's revised average of 219,000 (revised up from 218,750). The low rate of layoffs reflects a strengthening labor market as claims have remained below 300,000 -- the threshold typically used to categorize a healthy jobs market - for an incredible 225 consecutive weeks, the longest streak for weekly records dating back to 1967. The previous longest stretch ended in April 1970 and lasted for 161 weeks.

Personal income rose 0.5% (or $88.6 billion), exceeding expectations for a 0.3% advance and coming on the heels of 0.5% increase in April. Personal disposable income - the income available for spending or saving after taxes - also rose 0.5% (or $72.6 billion) in May, following a similar advance in April.</p><p>Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased 0.4% (or $59.7 billion) in May, coming up short versus a 0.5% consensus following a 0.6% increase in April. When adjusted for inflation, real PCE increased 0.2% (or $32.9 billion) monthly, in line with expectations for an unchanged reading, following a similar gain in April.</p><p>Notably, the PCE price index ticked up 0.2% in May, following a 0.3% advance in April. The Core PCE price index (which takes out food and energy to reduce month-to-month volatility) rose 0.2% in May following a similar advance in April. More importantly, on a year-over-year basis, the core index was up 1.6% in May, coming off the heels of a similar advance in April.

We believe the new CVS Health will transform into a diversified pharmacy/healthcare retailer that is integrated with a managed care operation, creating a more personalized and analytic-based experience that all patients will want. Additionally, we value shares because CVS is an all-domestic company (providing insulation from trade-related headwinds) in the healthcare field (defensive) without a lot of cyclicality, making it even more attractive as we are faced with a barrage of headlines about slower global economic growth. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $84; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Failure to execute on Aetna integration, greater than expected rebate guarantee headwinds on PBM business, regulatory headwinds</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , <url normalizedValue=\"http://investors.cvshealth.com/\">Investor Relations</url><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Salesforce</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $151.73; 775 shares; 4.33%; Sector: Info.

Bottom line, despite the recent pressure on shares, we believe the Tableau acquisition will ultimately prove a win for Salesforce longer-term. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Dow Inc has streamlined its operations and now sells into six different businesses in three market verticals: Performance Materials and Coating; Industrial Intermediates and Infrastructure; and Packaging and Specialty Products. Capital discipline is of greater importance at the company, with management favoring brownfield projects over greenfield and focusing on incremental, high-return on invested capital projects. This strategy allows management to offer a significant capital return policy and target a peer leading dividend payout ratio of approximately 45% across the cycle. From its first day post-separation, Dow Inc was the high yielding stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and management has a program in place to repurchase $3 billion worth of stock. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $62;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Macroeconomic slowdown, margin compression due to commodity prices, competition</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Alphabet</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $1,082.80; 70 shares; 2.79%; Sector: Communication Services</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: As members know, one of the reasons we think so highly of Alphabet is the company's willingness to take chances on new initiatives via the \"X Moonshot Factory\" This week, Google Cloud CEO, Thomas Kurian  that another project born in the X moonshot factory, \"  \" will be making its way to the Google Cloud. Per the announcement, \"this union will create a powerful and comprehensive security portfolio that will benefit all of our customers.\" We welcome the news as we view security advancements as key to Alphabet's ability to entice potential customers to adopt the company's cloud solution, which is well-known to be lagging the likes of Microsoft's Azure and Amazon's AWS. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

AI is what has made the company's Search, Video (YouTube) and targeted ad capabilities best-in-class and is the driving force behind the company's success in voice (Google Home) and autonomous driving (Waymo). Furthermore, we believe it is this AI expertise that will also make the company more prevalent in other industries, including healthcare via subsidiary Verily, as AI and machine learning continue to disrupt operations across industries. We believe Alphabet's willingness to invest in new areas, knowing most will fail, is a recipe for long-term success as while most \"  \" projects may fail, every once in a while, you end up with a Waymo, perhaps the division's, most successful graduate to date. Lastly, compounding out positive view of the company's future opportunities, we believe that Alphabet's free cash flow generation and solid balance sheet set it apart and are what will allow the company to continue taking chances on far-out ground-breaking and potentially world changing projects.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $1,400;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Regulatory risk (data privacy), competition, macroeconomic slowdown impacting consumers and therefore ad buyer activity</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  , ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Goldman Sachs</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $204.60; 600 shares; 4.52%; Sector: Financials</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: On the back of a successful completion of the Fed's  , Goldman Sachs meaningfully increased its quarterly dividend payment per share to $1.25 from $0.85.

Meanwhile, the firm has delivered consistent improvements to its return on equity and return on tangible common equity metrics-which are drivers of a premium over book price-while tangible book value has continued to grow. Another reason why we think the share price deserves a greater premium is because of management's emphasis on fee-based, or more recurring, revenue streams.

Though Micron did note that it may need to reduce capex in the near-term in order to bring supply back in line with demand (a negative for Lam Research as Micron capex is essential Lam Research's revenue), management helped in that investors were given more clarity into the timing of when the supply and demand would be back in balance -- recall, the market can adjust to good news or bad news, it's uncertainty that causes the greatest deal of volatility. As called out on our  , when this balance is achieved and demand growth once again begins to outplace supply growth, we believe capex will ramp back up as memory prices inflect and our patience in LRCX (which we are being compensated for thanks to the stock's ~2.5% dividend yield) will be rewarded.

We believe that memory (DRAM &amp; NAND) companies, which are customers of Lam Research, are currently holding back on capital expenditures in an effort to boost near-term profits and preserve cash flows, a dynamic that will ultimately result in supply growth lagging demand growth. Moreover, we believe that thanks to the digital revolution and rapidly growing internet of things space, we believe the demand for memory is becoming less cyclical in nature and as a result, we believe that should our thesis prove correct and we do see a supply shortage in the back half of 2019, then memory prices should begin to rebound and lead to increased CapEx/investments in capital equipment (what Lam sells) in the future. As we noted in out initiation, the current dynamic resembles the first half of 2016, a period that immediately preceded an inflection in prices, which lead to a sharp increase in Lam's earnings. Regarding management signaling, we also believe an inflection is coming due to the timing of management's recently announced $5 billion share repurchase program, which we view as a \"call\" that the industry dynamic is about to turn, and the stock has bottomed because the earnings decline is about to end. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $230;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: A delay in semiconductor companies increasing capital expenditures, a macroeconomic slowdown that hampers demand for memory chips.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Mastercard </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $264.53; 175 shares; 1.71</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Sector: Info.

Additionally, we believe the visibility behind this theme provides a sense of durability to long-term sales and earnings growth.

In line with this view, we also believe the shift to ecommerce to be a tailwind as online purchases inherently require some form of digital payments. In the near-term we also expect a tailwind to result from the coming release of the Apple Card as MasterCard was selected as the card's payment processing platform. Furthermore, we value MasterCard for the strong three-year Performance Objectives management laid out on their fourth quarter 2018 and full year 2018 financial results conference call. For 2019 - 2021, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding future acquisitions and Special Items, management's goal is for low-teen Net Revenue CAGR (compound annual growth rate), a minimum 50% Annual Operating Margin, and high-teens percent earnings per share CAGR. Lastly, the company also has a hefty share repurchase program in place. In December 2018, the company announced a new share repurchase program worth $4 billion, which went on top of an existing program.

Services provide for a recurring revenue stream at higher margins, a factor that serves to reduce earnings volatility while allowing for a higher percentage of sales to fall to the bottom line, as a result, we believe that Services growth and the installed base, are much more important than how many devices the company can sell in a given 90-day period. In addition to improved profitability we also believe the transparent nature of this revenue stream will demand an expanded price-to-earnings multiple as segment sales grow. Furthermore, we believe that Apple's desire to push deeper into the healthcare arena will help make its devices invaluable as more life-changing features are added and the company works to democratize health records.

The main goal of these assets is for divestitures, which management plans to execute on through the year and the proceeds of which will be used for bolt-on M&amp;A and/or share buybacks.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $80;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Ongoing challenges in its three largest businesses: Automotive (15% of net sales), Smartphone (5% of net sales) and North American Residential Construction (4% of net sales); Softening demand due to tariffs,</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , <url normalizedValue=\"http://investors.dupont.com/\">Investor Relations</url><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Facebook</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $193.00; 375 shares; 2.67%; Sector: Communication Services</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: While we remain bullish on the company (and stock) longer-term and believe the introduction of  can certainly aid Facebook in building out its ecommerce revenue stream, we opted to  ahead of the political debates in order to hedge against headline risk (it's no secret that politicians on both sides of the aisle have called for increased scrutiny of big tech and potential the breakup of some companies) and the potential that too much good news has been priced in too quickly following the Libra announcement. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

It monetizes its platforms and delivers targeted advertisements across all major demographics at a high ROI. Although revenue is expected to decelerate as the company transitions its monetization emphasis to Instagram Stories from Facebook's NewsFeed, and there are additional risks to margins related to increased OpEx spending, we believe both processes have become well understood by investors at this point. Plus, we think future growth opportunities exist through increased monetization of the WhatsApp and Messenger verticals. While critics claim the member base has become disengaged, Facebook's first quarter results showed trends have held with daily active users (DAUs) of 1.56 billion and monthly active users (MAUs) of 2.375 billion.

Additionally, we value Five Below for its entirely domestic revenue stream, which insulates it from global trade dynamics and any slowing of global growth. And while tariffs may pressure the supply chain, should they increase, we believe management is already taking steps to mitigate any potential margin pressure. Lastly, while an economic slowdown could impact all retailers, we believe that Five Below's focus on less expensive products will allow it to be resilient as shoppers will naturally look for discounts when funds run low, making Five Below stores all the more attractive in such an environment. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $135;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Economic slowdown leading to less consumer spending, competition, lack of innovative product mix</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , <url normalizedValue=\"http://investor.fivebelow.com/investors/default.aspx\">Investor Relations</url><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Honeywell</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $174.59; 650 shares; 4.18%; Sector: Industrials</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: None <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

The two segments we remain most positive on for their long-term growth profiles are Aerospace and Safety and Productivity Solution, as both stand to benefit from strong secular trends.

Also this week, in line with management's focus on advancing the technological side of the banking business, Sky News  that \"JP Morgan is finalizing a deal that would see it becoming a sizeable minority shareholder in 10x Future Technologies, which develops the tech platforms underpinning digital banking operations.\" While not a game changer for a firm the size of JPMorgan, we view it as another step in the right direction (should it be confirmed in coming weeks) that will help ensure the bank maintains its competitive edge in an industry that is seeing more disruption than ever before. As noted in the article, ex-Barclays chief Antony Jenkins \"set up 10x in 2016, backed by a belief that most traditional banking infrastructure was being rendered obsolete by advances in technology and changing customer behaviour.\" <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

The firm consistently delivers the best return on equity/tangible common equity performance in the industry, making the stock well deserving of a premium to its growing tangible book value. Not only that, but the Fortress balance sheet provides a degree of insulation to the risks associated with an economic shock.

While companies may look to build out multi-cloud environments, Microsoft's Azure offering will be a prime choice thanks to the company's decision to provide the same \"stack\" used in the public cloud, to companies for their on-premise data centers. Additionally, we would note that hybrid environments are currently the preference for most companies because it allows them to maintain critical data in house while taking advantage of the agility and scalability provided by public clouds. Outside of the cloud opportunity, we maintain a positive view on the company's growing gaming business, which we believe is becoming an increasingly prominent factor in the Microsoft growth story as gaming becomes more mainstream, management works to convert its gaming revenue from one-time license purchase to a recurring subscription model and as technologies like augmented/virtual reality evolve. Finally, as it relates to LinkedIn and other subscription-based services such as O365 and various Dynamics products, we continue to value them highly for their recurring revenue streams, which we remind members, provides for greater transparency of future earnings.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $140;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Slowdown in IT spending, competition, cannibalization of on premises business by the cloud</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,   ,   ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Palo Alto Networks </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $203.76; 17</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">5 shares; 1.31%; Sector: Info.

As a reminder, we believe years of underinvestment by global exploration and production companies is resulting in a deterioration of existing wells that will ultimately result in a windfall in production investments to the benefit of Schlumberger. While this has been our view for some time and we were clearly too early coming into the name, we continue to believe that it is a question of when, not if as investments will eventually be forced as wells dry up. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Although the company's earnings power is dependent on the timing of the upstream investment cycle, management has a strong reputation in execution as well as a good handle in understanding the supply/demand dynamic of the industry. The company's premier technology gives it an advantage over peers and allows for market share gains. Furthermore, we value the company's international presence as it means a lessened exposure to North America, where new drilling activity remains limited. As compensation for our patience in the investment cycle's recovery, shares offer an attractive dividend that was confirmed to be backed by cash flow on the company's most recent earnings call. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $65;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Commodity price pressure, weak capital spending of upstream oil and gas operators.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  (1/22/19),  ,  , <url normalizedValue=\"http://investorcenter.slb.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=97513&amp;p=irol-irhome\">Investor Relations</url><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Shopify </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $300.15; 75 shares; 0.83%; Sector: Info.

Supportive of this view, analysts at Wedbush came out the day after our trim with a downgrade from Buy to Neutral stating, \"While we continue to like Shopify's positioning, vision, and competitive moat as it builds a strong retail operating system for merchants, we downgrade to NEUTRAL, as we believe shares appropriately reflect the opportunity ahead.\" The analysts also noted that \"most impactful announcement [from the Shopify Unite conference], Shopify Fulfillment Network (SFN) isn't expected to generate profits until 2023.\" <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Its platform acts as a \"retail operating system\" for businesses and provides tools that assist in areas such digital marketing, payments and shipping. Instead of putting goods directly on an e-commerce marketplace, Shopify helps businesses build their own websites and online presence, allowing them to connect directly with their audience. Additionally, part of the Shopify value proposition relates to its benefit of scale which allows the company to negotiate online payment rates and shipping rates on their customer's behalf. Shopify also empowers small businesses and helps merchants thrive through the merchant funding and by offering cash advances.

And while this next round may be taxed at a lower rate than past tranches, this time around the tax is on consumer goods and makes it so that all Chinese goods coming into the U.S. have some form of tariff levied on them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although the trade war is clearly intensifying and this next round, on the consumer, is the real deal, we are flush with cash and have been patient in redeploying funds raised earlier in the year in anticipation of increased trade rhetoric and political headlines. As a result we are viewing the market through a buyers' lens and will remain disciplined, waiting for pullbacks that improve our basis in order to preserve our ammo and make every buy count.</p><p>Treasuries fell below the 2.0% level this week as the Fed cut rates and President Trump threatened additional tariffs, while gold prices pushed higher into the mid-$1,400s per ounce level. The dollar index also strengthened following the rate cut, pushing to over the 98 level while WTI oil prices remains in the mid-$50s per barrel region.</p><p>We're in the heart of second-quarter earnings season. Within the portfolio, we heard from Mastercard  , BP plc  , Apple  , Amgen  , Lam Research  , Twilio  , DuPont  and Shopify  .</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Mastercard reported a top and bottom-line beat with its second-quarter 2019 earnings results. Revenues accelerated to $4.1 billion (+15% year over year on a currency-neutral basis), edging estimates of $4.08 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.89 (+17% YoY on a currency-neutral basis) beat estimates of $1.83. In addition to the positive headline results, operating margins of 58.3% were better than the 57.2% Street expectation.</p><p>Looking ahead, management continues to see \"healthy consumer spending with some moderation versus a year ago as expected.\" Full-year net revenues are still expected to grow at a low-teens rate for the year.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>BP plc reported better-than-expected results with its second-quarter earnings. Underlying replacement cost profit -- a non-GAAP proxy for net income defined as the replacement cost of inventories sold in the period and arrived at by excluding inventory holding gains and losses from profit or loss -- came in at $2.811 billion (\"similar to a year earlier\"), reflecting a good operating performance offset by lower oil prices compared with the second quarter for 2018. The result, which excludes $861 million of non-operating items, came in ahead of the $2.529 billion consensus and resulted in earnings of $0.83 per ADR.</p><p>On the release, management backed their view of organic capital expenditures in the $15 billion to $17 billion range for the year. Looking forward to the next two years, management still plans to complete more than $10 billion in divestitures through 2019/2020 as it fine tunes the portfolio. Free cash flow is expected to continue to grow as gearing moves toward the middle of management's targeted gearing range (20% to 30%) through 2020. Speaking to the company's commitment to increasing shareholder returns, on the release, management noted, \"With the continuing momentum across the business, and growing free cash flow, we remain confident in our medium-term financial frame and the strength of our balance sheet. This in turn underpins our commitment to growing distributions to shareholders over the long-term.\"</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Apple reported a top- and bottom-line beat with its fiscal year 2019 third-quarter earnings results. On the top line, revenues of $53.809 billion (+1.02% YoY) outpaced expectations of $53.316 billion. On the bottom line, earnings per share of $2.18 (-6.84% YoY) edged out the consensus of $2.09 per share.</p><p>For the upcoming quarter, management expects sales of $61 billion to $64 billion, a beat at the midpoint vs. expectations of $60.905 billion. Overall, GMs are expected to come in between 37.5% and 38.5%, slightly above implied expectations of ~37.7% at the midpoint. Additionally, management guided for operating expenses of $8.7 billion to $8.8 billion, which is in line with expectations. Lastly, management expects other income of $200 million and a 16.5% tax rate.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Amgen reported a top- and bottom-line beat with its second-quarter earnings result. Total revenues of $5.871 billion (-3% YoY) exceeded estimates of $5.686 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $3.97 (+4% YoY) cruised past estimates of $3.59.</p><p>Taking a look at a couple key products: Worldwide Enbrel sales increased 5% year-over-year to $1.363 billion, topping consensus estimates of $1.235 billion; Neulasta sales declined globally 25% year-over-year to $824 million, falling short of the consensus of $904 million; Repatha saw worldwide sales increase 3% year-over-year to $152 million, a miss against the consensus of $160 million; and Aimovig ended the quarter with U.S. sales of $83 million, a nice beat against a $75 million expectation.</p><p>On guidance, management raised the lower end of its full year and non-GAAP EPS outlook but maintained the top ends of both. Perhaps most importantly, management provided a key update to cancer pipeline drug AMG 510 The next update is expected to come at a conference in early September.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Lam Research reported in-line-to-positive results with its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings.</p><p>On the top line, revenues of $2.361 billion (-3% YoY) were essentially in line with the $2.362 billion consensus, while non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.62 (-2% YoY) outpaced expectations of $3.42 per share. In addition to the positive headline results, gross margin as a percentage of revenue came in at 45.9% (+80 bps YoY), arriving ahead of Street estimates of 45.3%. Operating income as a percentage of revenue of 26.9% (+180 bps YoY) also outpaced the 25.9% consensus.</p><p>As for guidance, in the upcoming quarter, management expects revenue to be in the range of $2.15 billion +/- $150 million, which at the midpoint, represents a miss vs. the $2.279 billion consensus.</p><p>Working our way down, non-GAAP gross margin as a percent of revenue is expected to be 45.0% +/- 1% with non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of revenue expected to come in at 24.5% +/- 1%, both metrics coming up short vs. the 45.9% and 26.5% consensus for gross margins and operating income margins, respectively.</p><p>That brings us to earnings per share, which on a non-GAAP basis management expects to be $3.00 +/- 20 cents, also missing expectations of $3.20 per share. Additionally, it is worth noting that we can expect more buybacks in the current quarter as management's earnings per share figure is based on a diluted share count of 150 million, approximately 4.47 million less than what the company ended this quarter with.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Twilio reported a top- and bottom-line beat with its second quarter results. Total revenues of $275 million (+86% YoY and +18% sequentially for a slight acceleration) breezed past consensus expectations of $264 million, while non-GAAP earnings per share of 3 cents (compared with non-GAAP net profit of 3 cents in 2Q18) exceeded expectations by a penny.</p><p>Twilio had 161,869 Active Customer Accounts as of June 30, more than the 160,216-consensus expectation. Dollar-Based Net Expansion Rate was 140%, topping expectations of 130%. Base revenue million increased +16% sequentially and +90% YoY to $256.7 million, topping expectations of $253 million.</p><p>On full-year guidance, management raised their outlook for total revenue to the range of $1.113 billion to $1.119 billion (from $1.102 billion to $1.111 billion) and adjusted earnings per share to a range of $0.17 to $0.18 (from $0.11 to $0.13). Base revenue was kept largely unchanged, but this was due to the delayed launch of the new Verizon A2P channel.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>DuPont reported mixed but solid headline numbers with its second-quarter results. Although revenue of $5.47 billion (-7% YoY) was light compared to the $5.63 billion consensus, adjusted earnings per share of $0.97 (+9% YoY) exceeded the $0.84 consensus.</p><p>Electronics and Imaging net sales were $858 million (organic -5% YoY) and fell short of the $898 million consensus. Operating EBITDA of $246 million (-15% YoY) also missed the $278 million consensus. Nutrition and Biosciences net sales were $1.558 billion (organic flat YoY) and was light against the $1.604 billion consensus. Operating EBITDA of $391 million (+2% YoY) topped expectations of $370 million consensus. Transportation and Industrial net sales were $1.269 billion (organic -7% YoY) and missed the $1.317 billion consensus. Operating EBITDA of $357 million (+2% YoY) missed expectations of $364 million consensus. Safety and Construction net sales were $1.341 billion (organic +5% YoY), missing expectations of $1.373 billion. Operating EBITDA of $382 million (+2% YoY) exceeded expectations of $328 million consensus.</p><p>For the full year, management expects organic net sales to be \"slightly down\" from previous guidance of up 2% to 3%. On the bottom line, management raised the lower end of its full-year adjusted earnings per share outlook to $3.75 from $3.70 and maintained the top end range of $3.85.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Shopify reported a top and bottom-line beat with its fiscal second-quarter earnings results. On the top line, revenues of $361.98 (+48% YoY) million outpaced a $350.5 million consensus. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share of $0.14 blew past expectations of $0.03 per share. Additionally, Gross profit of $204.8 million (49.5% YoY) outpaced estimates of $196.4 million, while adjusted operating income of $4.8 million flipped to positive from a $4.3 million loss in the year-ago period.</p><p>In addition to the robust headline results, management upped their 2019 revenue outlook to $1.51 billion to $1.53 billion (from $1.48 billion to $1.5 billion), matching consensus at the low end. Additionally, management expects 2019 adjusted operating income in the range of $20 million to $30 million, a tad short of the $29 million consensus at the midpoint. However, likely forgiven as Shopify is in super growth mode and as a result top-line results will tend to carry more weight, with investors understanding that investments must be made to keep the momentum going.</p><p>As for the upcoming quarter, management sees revenues in the range of $377 million to $382 million, well above the $374 million consensus at the midpoint. Additionally, management sees adjusted operating income (excluding stock-based compensation expenses and related payroll taxes of $47 million) coming in at $0 to $3 million, versus a $3 million consensus.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Economy</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>On Tuesday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) released personal income and spending numbers for June. Personal income rose 0.4% (or $83.6 billion), in line with expectations following a similar advance in May. Personal disposable income -- the income available for spending or saving after taxes -- also rose 0.4% (or $69.7 billion) in June, following a 0.3% increase in May. Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) -- i.e., personal spending, which accounts for over two-thirds of U.S. economic activity -- increased 0.3% (or $41.0 billion) in June, also in line with expectations following a 0.5% increase in May. When adjusted for inflation, real PCE increased 0.2% (or $21.4 billion) monthly, again in line with expectations, following a 0.3% gain in May. Notably, the PCE price index ticked up 0.1% in June, following a similar advance in May. The Core PCE price index rose 0.2% in June, also on par with June's monthly rate of advance. More importantly, on a year-over-year basis, the core index was up 1.6% in June, coming on the heels of a 1.5% annual rate of advance in May. See <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/> for our full analysis.</p><p>Also on Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors reported that its Pending Home Sales Index advanced 2.8% in June to 108.3, well ahead of expectations for a 0.5% monthly advance. Recall that pending home sales represent contracts signed for existing home sales set to close in the next one to two months. With June's reading, pending home sales are up 1.6% year over year, also outpacing expectations for a 0.7% annual increase, and putting an end to a 17-month streak of annual declines! See <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/> for our full analysis.</p><p>On Wednesday, the ADP National Employment Report was released, indicating a 156,000 private-sector seasonally adjusted payroll increase for the month of July, exceeding expectations for 150,000 added jobs. Additionally, June's reading was revised up to +112,000 (from +102,000), while May's reading was upped to +46,000 (from +41,000 previously). See <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/> for our full analysis.</p><p>On Thursday, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that the purchasing managers' index (PMI), which measures the economic environment within the manufacturing sector, fell 0.5 percentage points in July to 51.2%, missing expectations for a 52.0% reading. See <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/> for our full analysis.</p><p>Also on Thursday, the Department of Labor reported that initial jobless claims for the week ending July 27 were 215,000, an 8,000-claim increase from the previous week's revised level of 207,000 (revised up from 206,000), and 1,000 claims above expectations of 214,000 initial jobless claims. Importantly, the four-week moving average for claims (used as a gauge to offset volatility in the weekly numbers) was 211,500, a decrease of 1,750 from the previous week's revised average of 213,250 (revised up from 213,000). The low rate of layoffs reflects a strengthening labor market as claims have remained below 300,000 -- the threshold typically used to categorize a healthy jobs market -- for an incredible 230 consecutive weeks, the longest streak for weekly records dating back to 1967. The previous longest stretch ended in April 1970 and lasted for 161 weeks. For the official weekly release, please see <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>.</p><p>On Friday, the U.S. Labor Department reported that the economy added 164,000 jobs during the month of July, a tick short of expectations for a gain of 165,000 jobs. In addition to the headline number, the unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7% but remains at some of the lowest levels seen in decades. On a more positive note, the labor force participation rate ticked up to 63.0%, from 62.9% in June. A different, broader measure of unemployment and underemployment, known as the U-6 -- which accounts for those working part-time because they are unable to find full-time work -- ticked lower to 7.0% on a seasonally adjusted, from 7.2% in June. In July, average hourly earnings for all employees on nonfarm payrolls increased by $0.08 to $27.98, a steady rate that followed similar hourly wage gain in June. Additionally, average hourly earnings (i.e., wage inflation) have increased 3.2% from the same time last year. See <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/> for our full analysis.</p><p>Finally, also on Friday, the Commerce Department reported that new orders for manufactured goods (durable and nondurable) in June advanced 0.6% (or $3.1 billion), to $493.8 billion, just shy expectations for a 0.7% advance following a 1.3% decline in May (revised down from -0.7% previously reported). This is a crucial reading as manufacturing is responsible for roughly 12% of the U.S. economy.</p><p>Importantly, new orders of non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft (i.e., core capital goods) increased 1.5% in June, following a 0.2% increase in May and a 1.1% decline in April. Shipments for core capital goods advanced 0.3% in May, following a 0.4% increase in both May and April. See <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/> for our full analysis.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key Global Economic Readings</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Note: T is the most recent period, T-1 is the prior period's reading and T-2 is two periods back, the intent being to illustrate any trends</emphasis>)</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oil</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>On the commodity front, oil was relatively flat on the week (down ~$1/barrel) as prices advanced through the week before getting <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/> on the President Trump's announcement that he would seek to implement additional tariffs on China should progress not be made by September. While the announcement may not have been directly targeted at oil, the move lower comes as a result of the view that should additional tariffs be levied, global growth will slow further and demand for energy will decline as a result. Also impacting the move (prior to the tariff announcement) was the Fed's press conference following the FOMC meeting as Fed Chair Powell cautioned against the view that this cut was the start of a series of cuts and the dollar strengthened. Recall, a strong dollar makes the purchase of U.S. oil (WTI) more expensive for foreign buyers that must convert their domestic currency into dollars and as a result, can hamper international demand.</p><p>On the domestic front, on Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), reported that in the week ending July 26, U.S. stockpiles (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) fell by 8.5 million barrels to 436.5 million barrels, a bullish reading versus expectations for a 2.59 million barrel drawdown. Additionally, U.S. production jumped by 900,000 bpd to 12.2 million bpd. Lastly, net imports increased by 353,000 bpd as imports fell by 365,000 bpd, while exports fell by 718,000 bpd. See <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/> for the full report.</p><p>Lastly, we note that the spread between WTI and Brent sits at roughly $7 per barrel. Recall, this is a key metric as the wider the spread, the more attractive U.S.-based crude (WTI) becomes to foreign buyers, though we note that strength in the dollar can offset this effect as foreign buyers convert their home currencies to the dollar.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stocks</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>In the portfolio this week, we initiated positions in PepsiCo  (see <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>) and Burlington Stores  (see <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>), we then added to the latter on weakness (see <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>). Also, we bulked up on our position in Marvell Technology  (see <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>).</p><p>On the other hand, we closed out our position in in Dow Inc.  (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>) and reduced our exposure in Lam Research LRCX (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>) and Abbott Laboratories  (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>).</p><p>Lastly, we made a Friday afternoon trade, buying more BURL, while trimming Home Depot  and Honeywell  (see <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>).</p><p>Moving on to the broader market, second-quarter earnings season is well underway with 74.7% of companies reporting a positive EPS surprise. For the second-quarter, earnings growth is up roughly 3.4 year over year vs. expectations for an overall 0.79% decline throughout the season; of the 270 non-financials that reported, earnings are up 3.3%. Revenues are up 4.3% vs. expectations throughout the season for a 3.51% increase; 74.7% of companies beat EPS expectations, 17.7% missed the mark and 7.6% were in line with consensus. On a year-over-year comparison basis, 70.73% beat the prior year's EPS results, 28.66% came up short and 0.61% were virtually in line. The best-performing sectors so far have been Health Care, Materials and Real Estate, while the worst-performing have been Consumer Discretionary, Energy and Utilities.</p><p>Next week, 159 companies in the S&amp;P 500 will report earnings.

As a reminder, the two front runners for the contract have been Amazon and Microsoft, which members know, do have the best cloud options in the world. Per the report, \"the announcement [of the investigation] comes after President Trump said last month that he had <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/> from companies about the process.\" We will continue to monitor the situation and note that some of the prior criticism came as a result of the structure of the bidding, which was set up for a winner-take-all scenario. Per the earlier report (in the second link above), IBM told CNBC, \"IBM has long raised serious concerns about the structure of the JEDI procurement. We continue to believe that the Department of Defense and our men and women in uniform would be best served by a multi-cloud strategy.\" As a result, given that Amazon and Microsoft do sport the two best cloud options, we believe the contract will ultimately go to one or both of these companies and again, will continue to monitor the situation and update members accordingly. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk. Price Change</emphasis>: -6.17%; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yield</emphasis>: 0.00%</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INVESTMENT THESIS</emphasis>: We believe upside will result from Amazon's continued Commerce dominance, AWS' continued leadership in the public cloud space, and ongoing growth of the company's advertising revenue stream, which feeds off Amazon's eCommerce business. Additionally, we believe profitability will continue to improve as AWS and advertising account for a larger portion of total sales as both these segments sport higher margins than the eCommerce operation. And while we believe the increasing share of revenue from these higher margin businesses will be key to driving profitability longer-term, we believe margins on eCommerce stand to improve as the company's infrastructure is further built out and economies of scale further kick in. The embedded call option is that management is always looking to enter a new space and generate new revenue streams. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $2,050; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rating:  </emphasis> to ONE</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: High valuation exposes the stock to volatile swings; eCommerce has exposure to slower consumer spending, competition. The outcome of the Pentagon's $10 billion JEDI contract is also something to watch as Amazon is largely considered to be the front runner; potential headwinds resulting from new eCommerce regulation in India; management is not scared to invest aggressively for growth, which can at times cause volatile reactions as near-term concerns arise relating to the impact on margins.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">  HYPERLINK \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://aap.thestreet.com/story/14938660/1/amazon-smashes-earnings-projections.html\">https://aap.thestreet.com/story/14938660/1/amazon-smashes-earnings-projections.html</url>\",  ,  ,   ,  </emphasis>(1/10/19), <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">  ,  </emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">B</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">P PLC</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $38.48; 2,200 shares; 3.12%; Sector: Energy</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: Reported <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

As called out in our <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>, on the company's first-quarter earnings call in May, CEO Thomas Kingsbury stated, \"we believe over time, tariffs may cause disruption in the supply chain, which is typically a positive for off-price retailers,\" Kingsbury said. \"In addition, if prices do go up across retail, this could possibly make value an even more important driver of consumers into the off-price channel.\" Plus, Kingsbury said only a small percentage of Burlington's total orders were subject to the then current tariffs. The tariffs thus far have not had a material financial impact. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk. Price Change</emphasis>: -2.33%; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yield</emphasis>: 0.00%</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INVESTMENT THESIS</emphasis>: Specializing as an off-price retailer, Burlington Stores sources its merchandise opportunistically, meaning that management purchases excess inventory from struggling retailers and then resells the quality merchandise at everyday low prices. The bargains Burlington's stores offer creates a \"treasure hunting\" experience for its shoppers, and this cannot be replicated by e-commerce. Therefore, we believe Burlington's business model keeps it immune from the pressures facing department stores, and we expect the company will continue to deliver low-single-digit same-store sales growth. Lastly, any supply chain disruptions caused by tariffs may work to Burlington's favor, as off-price's value will gain additional favor should either prices increase, or stores need to unload inventory.

That's up from about $14 billion in 2016, and management's target is to do about $28 billion in Services sales by 2026. If Caterpillar delivers on this target, it would effectively double its Services businesses over a 10-year span. An enhanced and more consistent capital return policy is also a major theme of the new Caterpillar. Back at the company's May Investor Day, not only did it announce a 20% increase to the quarterly dividend payment effective in July, but it also revealed a target of at least high-single-digit percent increases to the dividend over each of the next four years. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $150;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Though we believe the growth of services will help, Caterpillar operates in a cyclical industry tied to economic growth and construction, as a result macro weakness, be it from the U.S./China trade conflict or a general slowing of growth globally pose risks.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:   <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">,  ,  </emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Cisco Systems </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $53.25; 1200 shares; 2.36%; Sector: Info.

We believe the new CVS Health will transform into a diversified pharmacy/healthcare retailer that is integrated with a managed care operation, creating a more personalized and analytic-based experience that all patients will want. Additionally, we value the shares because CVS is an all-domestic company (providing insulation from trade-related headwinds) in the healthcare field (defensive) without a lot of cyclicality, making it even more attractive as we are faced with a barrage of headlines about slower global economic growth. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $84; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Failure to execute on Aetna integration, greater-than-expected rebate guarantee headwinds on PBM business, regulatory headwinds.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  , <url normalizedValue=\"http://investors.cvshealth.com/\">Investor Relations</url></emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Salesforce</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $145.70; 775 shares; 4.17%; Sector: Info.

Furthermore, we believe the acquisition of MuleSoft effectively expanded the company's total addressable market by unlocking data previously trapped on legacy systems, to be used on the Salesforce platform.

And as members know, we believe Alphabet's artificial intelligence dominance to be a key competitive moat for the company that allows it to excel in so many industries and disrupt so many others, this news only bolsters that view. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk. Price Change</emphasis>: -3.93%; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yield</emphasis>: 0.00%</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INVESTMENT THESIS</emphasis>: We believe that while Search and digital ad dominance is what will carry shares in the near- to- midterm, longer-term it is the company's artificial intelligence (AI) \"moat\" that will provide for new avenues of growth. AI is what has made the company's Search, Video (YouTube) and targeted ad capabilities best-in-class and is the driving force behind the company's success in voice (Google Home) and autonomous driving (Waymo). Furthermore, we believe it is this AI expertise that will also make the company more prevalent in other industries, including healthcare via subsidiary Verily, as AI and machine learning continue to disrupt operations across industries. We believe Alphabet's willingness to invest in new areas, knowing most will fail, is a recipe for long-term success as while most \"<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>\" projects may fail, every once in a while, you end up with a Waymo, perhaps the division's most successful graduate to date. Lastly, compounding out positive view of the company's future opportunities, we believe that Alphabet's free cash flow generation and solid balance sheet set it apart and are what will allow the company to continue taking chances on far-out ground-breaking and potentially world changing projects.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $1,400;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Regulatory risk (data privacy), competition, macroeconomic slowdown impacting consumers and therefore ad buyer activity</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">  ,  ,  ,  , ,  ,  ,  </emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">JPM; $112.93; 800 shares; 3.33%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Sector: Financial</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: Though there was no company-specific news this week, the shares came under pressure as the Fed rate cut was met with a rush into 10-year Treasury notes that saw the yield curve flatten further, a dynamic viewed negatively in relation to the financials as banks make less money when the spread narrows. Recall, generally banks will borrow (think take in consumer deposits) at the shorter-term rate and lend at the longer-term rate. When the spread between these two rates narrows, their ability to generate profit declines. Further pressuring shares was the tariff announcement from President Trump as an intensification of the trade war resulted in expectations for slower growth and therefore the view that loan growth will come under pressure, interest on loans being a key way in which banks make money. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

The firm consistently delivers the best return on equity/tangible common equity performance in the industry, making the stock well deserving of a premium to its growing tangible book value. Not only that, but the Fortress balance sheet provides a degree of insulation to the risks associated with an economic shock.

While Kohl's does generate 100% of sales in the U.S., the tariffs are expected to impact the company's supply chain and as a result, squeeze profit margins, or reduce consumer demand should the cost of the tariffs be passed through to the consumer. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Its brands are tailored to middle-income buyers who shop for value, or good deals, while their store locations remain away from the mall which has been subject to decline in foot traffic. The company is run by a strategic management team who has several strong initiatives in place (standard-to-small initiatives, partnership with Planet Fitness, Fanatics, of course Amazon and more) that drive traffic and improve inventory management.

In line with this view, we also believe the shift to e-commerce to be a tailwind as online purchases inherently require some form of digital payments. In the near-term we also expect a tailwind to result from the coming release of the Apple Card as MasterCard was selected as the card's payment processing platform. Furthermore, we value MasterCard for the strong three-year Performance Objectives management laid out on their fourth quarter 2018 and full year 2018 financial results conference call. For 2019 - 2021, on a currency-neutral basis, excluding future acquisitions and Special Items, management's goal is for low-teen Net Revenue CAGR (compound annual growth rate), a minimum 50% Annual Operating Margin, and high-teens percent earnings per share CAGR. Lastly, the company also has a hefty share repurchase program in place.

As noted in our initiation alert, we believe that the 5G upgrade cycle remains in early stages and that from an infrastructure viewpoint, which Marvell plays to by creating the network that needs to be built and running to support all of the new systems, Marvell will benefit as 5G-enabled devices begin coming to market over the next several years. Additionally, we believe the Cavium deal was a big step in the company's transformation while the acquisition of Aquantia, a leader in Multi-Gig Ethernet connectivity, will help in broadening Marvell's connectivity solutions portfolio and capitalizing on the future of high-speed networking requirements in cars that are needed to enable autonomous, electric, and safety/security applications. Furthermore, on the M&amp;A front, we believe plans to acquire Avera Semiconductor, a developer of custom ASICs for networking and telecom equipment was a 5G additive play as Avera's biggest end market exposure is base stations, which are leveraged to 5G. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $28;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Further intensification on the U.S./China trade front, a delayed ramp in 5G infrastructure buildouts.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">  ,  </emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Microsoft Corp </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $136.90; 550 shares; 2.78%; Sector: Technology</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: This week, Microsoft announced the acquisition of BlueTalon, \"a leading provider of Unified Data Access Control solutions for modern data platforms.\" Per the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>, \"BlueTalon works with leading Fortune 100 companies to eliminate data security blind spots and gain visibility and control of data.

While companies may look to build out multi-cloud environments, Microsoft's Azure offering will be a prime choice thanks to the company's decision to provide the same \"stack\" used in the public cloud, to companies for their on-premise data centers. Additionally, we would note that hybrid environments are currently the preference for most companies because it allows them to maintain critical data in house while taking advantage of the agility and scalability provided by public clouds. Outside of the cloud opportunity, we maintain a positive view on the company's growing gaming business, which we believe is becoming an increasingly prominent factor in the Microsoft growth story as gaming becomes more mainstream, management works to convert its gaming revenue from one-time license purchase to a recurring subscription model and as technologies like augmented/virtual reality evolve. Finally, as it relates to LinkedIn and other subscription-based services such as O365 and various Dynamics products, we continue to value them highly for their recurring revenue streams, which we remind members, provides for greater transparency of future earnings.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Target Price</emphasis>: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Raised</emphasis> to $150;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Slowdown in IT spending, competition, cannibalization of on premises business by the cloud.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">  ,  ,   ,   ,  ,  </emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Nvidia </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $161.19; 500 shares; 2.97%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Sector: Info.

Recall, global growth is tied to demand for energy (oil) and with the trade war intensifying, expectations are for growth global to slow further and as a result reduce demand for oil. While Schlumberger is not a producer of oil, the company relies on production-related investments from global producers and if those producers do not expect prices to go higher or sustain current levels they may seek to hold off on necessary investments for as long as possible in order to maintain free cash flows. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Although the company's earnings power is dependent on the timing of the upstream investment cycle, management has a strong reputation in execution as well as a good handle on understanding the supply/demand dynamic of the industry. The company's premier technology gives it an advantage over peers and allows for market share gains. Furthermore, we value the company's international presence as it means a lessened exposure to North America, where new drilling activity remains limited.

Its business is divided into two subsidiaries: UnitedHealthcare, which represents the insurance side of the company, and Optum, a fast-growing, margin expanding, and technology/data leveraging division with exposure to PBM, healthcare consulting, and specialized health and wellness services. We value the company's consistent, economic-cycle resilient performance, supported by management's long-term expectation of 13% to 15% growth.

To this point, we believe Paramount operations, which has undergone a transition from consistent underperformance to now multiple consecutive quarters of improved adjusted operating income with the last three being profitable, will continue to improve and demand more attention as momentum continues and management progresses in further monetizing intellectual property.

The company boasts high-performing franchises in Medical Devices (with strong growth in Diabetes Care) and Diagnostics (with strong gains in Core Laboratory), while Nutrition and Established Pharmaceutical remain strategic parts of its total portfolio. We believe the company's opportunities for upside rest with additional Libre uptake, the Alinity U.S. launch, and an expanded indication of the Mitraclip. We believe in CEO Miles White and the Abbott management team, which has a strong track record of integrating acquisitions and delivering double-digit earnings per share growth.

Services provide for a recurring revenue stream at higher margins, a factor that serves to reduce earnings volatility while allowing for a higher percentage of sales to fall to the bottom line. As a result, we believe that Services growth and the installed base, are much more important than how many devices the company can sell in a given 90-day period. In addition to improved profitability we also believe the transparent nature of this revenue stream will demand an expanded price-to-earnings multiple as segment sales grow. Furthermore, we believe that Apple's desire to push deeper into the healthcare arena will help make its devices invaluable as more life-changing features are added and the company works to democratize health records. Lastly, also see upside resulting from increased adoption of wearables (think the Apple Watch) and potential new product announcements such as an AR/VR headset or an update on project Titan, the company's secretive autonomous driving program. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/> to $260;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Slowdown in consumer spending, competition, lack of new product innovation, elongated replacement cycles, failure to execute on Services growth initiative.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:   <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  </emphasis> Interview<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">  ,  ,  </emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Citigroup</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $67.61; 1,000 shares; 2.41%; Sector: Financials</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: None <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Recall, domestically, the X1 has been shown to be more resilient to the trend than competing platforms. Regarding the debt load on the balance sheet resulting from the acquisition, we reaffirm that management has an excellent M&amp;A track record and believe strong cash flow generation will provide the means to successfully de-leverage overtime, allowing the shares to re-rate higher over time.

Another reason why we think the share price deserves a greater premium is because of management's emphasis on fee-based, or more recurring, revenue streams. At the end of 2018, 61% of Goldman's revenues were fee-based, up from 48% in 2013. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $270;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: The economic cycle, Financial System regulation, 1MDB litigation, interest rates, financial market activity.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">  ,  ,  ,   ,  ,  ,  ,  </emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Home Depot</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $212.15; 225 shares; 1.76%; Sector: Consumer Discretionary</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: While there was no company-specific news this week, we were encouraged by the June Pending home sales report, which pointed to an annual gain in sales that put an end to a 17-month streak of annual declines. That said, while we believe the release supports our view that the housing market is forming a bottom, we must of course now caveat this view by reminding members that President Trump has officially threatened additional tariffs on China in September, a factor that could certainly weigh on the minds of home buyers as they consider whether to make a debt-inducing purchase such as buying a home, given the impact a prolonged trade war may have on the U.S. economy and as a result, the job market. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk. Price Change</emphasis>: -2.19%; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yield</emphasis>: 2.56%</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INVESTMENT THESIS</emphasis>: The unquestioned leader in home improvement supplies, we like Home Depot for its consistent same-store sales performance, ability to gain market share and improve margins, and its business model that is relatively immune from Amazon-like pressures. We initiated our position shortly before the Spring -- Home Depot's \"Holiday season\" -- expecting the company to outperform expectations. Longer term, management's 2020 financial targets include sales to increase to the range of $115 billion to $120 billion, with operating margins in a range of 14.4% to 15% and return on invested capital of more than 40%. Lastly, Home Depot is a cash-generating machine. Making good use of its cash flows, the company recently authorized a 32% increase to its quarterly dividend (which puts the yield ~3.0%) as well as announced a $15 billion share repurchase program. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $210;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>   to TWO.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Consumer Spending habits; Housing market downturn; inclement weather.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">   ,  ,  ,  ,  , <url normalizedValue=\"http://ir.homedepot.com/\">Investor Relations</url></emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Honeywell</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">HON; $168.01; 550 shares; 3.41%; Sector: Industrials</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: None <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

The two segments we remain most positive on for their long-term growth profiles are Aerospace and Safety and Productivity Solution, as both stand to benefit from strong secular trends. Additionally, we appreciate management's ability to drive operational improvements in areas such as margin and free cash flow.

Importantly, we expect the company's Pharmaceutical and Consumer business to grow above their respective industry growth rates, and even though Medical Devices has lagged, we have seen encouraging signs of improvements.

Price Change</emphasis>: -3.16%; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yield</emphasis>: 2.16%</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INVESTMENT THESIS</emphasis>: We see upside resulting from ongoing industry dynamics that we believe will result in a coming inflection point for profitability as we enter the back half of the year. We believe that memory (DRAM &amp; NAND) companies, which are customers of Lam Research, are currently holding back on capital expenditures in an effort to boost near-term profits and preserve cash flows, a dynamic that will ultimately result in supply growth lagging demand growth. Moreover, thanks to the digital revolution and rapidly growing internet of things space, we believe the demand for memory is becoming less cyclical in nature. As a result, we think that should our thesis prove correct and we do see a supply shortage in the back half of 2019, then memory prices should begin to rebound and lead to increased CapEx/investments in capital equipment (what Lam sells) in the future. As we noted in our initiation, the current dynamic resembles the first half of 2016, a period that immediately preceded an inflection in prices, which led to a sharp increase in Lam's earnings. Regarding management signaling, we also believe an inflection is coming due to the timing of management's recently announced $5 billion share repurchase program, which we view as a \"call\" that the industry dynamic is about to turn, and the stock has bottomed because the earnings decline is about to end. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $230;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating:  </emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: A delay in semiconductor companies increasing capital expenditures, a macroeconomic slowdown that hampers demand for memory chips.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,   ,  ,  ,  </emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Shopify </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $332.19; 75 shares; 0.92%; Sector: Info.

Its platform acts as a \"retail operating system\" for businesses and provides tools that assist in areas such digital marketing, payments and shipping. Instead of putting goods directly on an e-commerce marketplace, Shopify helps businesses build their own websites and online presence, allowing them to connect directly with their audience. Additionally, part of the Shopify value proposition relates to its benefit of scale, which allows the company to negotiate online payment rates and shipping rates on their customer's behalf. Shopify also empowers small businesses and helps merchants thrive through the merchant funding and by offering cash advances. Lastly, international expansion represents a key area of opportunity for Shopify. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $350;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Slowing net merchant additions, customer churn, competition, weak execution international expansion.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  </emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THREES</emphasis><br/><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Palo Alto Networks </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $221.56; 1</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">25 shares; 1.02%; Sector: Info.

Given the material change in guidance we want to delve into what this means for the economy and why stocks reacted so favorably.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First, to understand what the guidance means for the economy, we must recall that the Fed's dual mandate is to control inflation and maximize employment. It's the inflation factor we want to focus on following the Wednesday update. The Fed uses rate adjustments to control inflation, ideally targeting a 2% annual rate; when they believe inflation to be getting too high, they raise rates, if it's getting too low, they either pause on rate hikes or potentially reduce rates to stimulate growth. So, what does the reduced guidance tell us? On one hand, it does indicate that growth is slowing, however, on the other hand, it tells us that the Fed understands this and will be more accommodative. This matters to stocks because the reduced interest rate outlook serves to make future earnings more valuable.</p><p>As we noted in our stock valuation white paper that can be found  , the two main items to consider when valuing stock on a discounted cash flow basis are expected cash flows going forward (the numerator) and the required rate of return (the denominator used to discount to present value) on the security in question. If the cash flow estimates remain intact (which is indeed the case for many secular growth companies, such as those in the cloud space) and the discount rate is reduced, the present value of those future cash flows increases and as a result, the estimated intrinsic value of a stock is also increases. It is for this reason that we can get a rally such as the one seen on Thursday, despite the Fed clearly indicating an element of weakness in the U.S. economy. Additionally, we must keep in mind that a portion of the weakness can be attributed to the ongoing trade dispute with China. So, should we see a resolution on this front and global (and U.S.) growth is reinvigorated on the back of positive consumer sentiment and increased business investments, we would be faced with an environment that consists of low interest rates and rebounding growth prospects, making for a highly favorable equities environment.</p><p>Bottom line, while there are reasons to be cautious, namely global growth, there are also reasons for optimism and should we see a trade deal materialize we could certainly make our way to new highs.</p><p>Also, this week, we are proud to announce that our 2018 charitable contribution has been distributed. For the year, despite the market trading lower in 2018, we were able to donate a total of $100,838 (our capital gains plus dividends). Thank you to all our members have and continue to make the ActionAlertsPLUS club possible, we couldn't do it without you!</p><p>Treasury yields were pushed lower, to ~2.45% following the Fed's increasingly dovish guidance while as gold prices rebounded to around the $1,312 per ounce level. The dollar strengthened versus the euro while oil ended the week roughly flat in the upper-$50s, though sold off on Friday</p><p>We're in the final stretch of fourth-quarter earnings season. No portfolio companies reported.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Economy</emphasis><br/></p><p>On Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that new orders for manufactured goods (durable and nondurable) in January ticked up $0.3 billion, or 0.1%, to $500.5 billion, following a 0.1% increase in December. The reading missed expectations of a 0.3% monthly advance. This is a crucial reading as manufacturing is responsible for roughly 12% of the U.S. economy. Importantly, new orders of non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft (i.e., core capital goods) increased 0.8% in January, matching expectations following a 0.8% decline in December and a 1.1% decline in November. Shipments for core capital goods also increased 0.8% in January, following a 0.1% increase in December and a 0.2% decline in November. See  for our full analysis.</p><p>On Thursday, the Department of Labor reported that initial jobless claims for the week ending March 16 were 221,000, a decrease of 9,000 from the previous week's revised level of 230,000 (revised up from 229,000) and 4,000 claims below expectations of 225,000. Importantly, the four-week moving average for claims (used as a gauge to offset volatility in the weekly numbers) was 225,000, an increase of 1,000 from the previous week's revised average of 224,000 (revised up from 223,750). The low rate of layoffs reflects a strengthening labor market as claims have remained below 300,000 -- the threshold typically used to categorize a healthy jobs market - for an incredible 211 consecutive weeks, the longest streak for weekly records dating back to 1967. The previous longest stretch ended in April 1970 and lasted for 161 weeks. For the official weekly release, please see  .</p><p>On Friday, he National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported that existing home sales jumped 11.8% in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.51 million. With February's reading, which exceeded expectations of a 3.2% advance to a 5.1 million unit adjusted sales rate, existing home sales are down 1.8% from the same time last year. The median existing home price was up 3.6% year over year to $249,500 marking the 84th consecutive month of yearly price gains. Additionally, according to Freddie Mac, regarding 30-year, conventional, fixed-rate mortgages, the average commitment rate was 4.37% in February, down from 4.46% in January and below the 4.54% average for all of 2018.

The news this week was that the organization canceled its April meeting, effectively ensuring no change to the ongoing production cut until at least the June meeting, where we remind members, we expect and extension to be announced should the demand/supply environment not balance out by the then. Additionally, the sanctions on Iran and Venezuela are further aiding the supply drawdown and supporting prices, despite the continued record levels of production in the US.</p><p>On the domestic front, on Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA), reported that in the week ending March 15, U.S. stockpiles (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) decreased by 9.6 million barrels to 439.5 million barrels, a bullish reading versus analyst expectations for 390,000 barrel increase. Additionally, U.S. production bumped back up to record levels, increasing by 100,000 bpd to 12.1 million bpd. Lastly, net imports decreased by 660,000 bpd as imports increased by 186,000 bpd, while exports increased by 846,000 bpd. See  for the full report.</p><p>Lastly, we note that the spread between WTI and Brent sits at roughly $8 per barrel. Recall, this is a key metric as the wider the spread, the more attractive U.S. based crude (WTI) becomes to foreign buyers, though we note that strength in the dollar can offset this effect as foreign buyers convert their home currencies to the dollar.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stocks</emphasis><br/></p><p>In the portfolio this week, we  a position in Nvidia as we believe many of the headwinds that caused us to close out our original position October 2018 are either behind us or have been fully priced in.</p><p>On the other hand, we trimmed out position in Amgen (  ), Danaher (  ), Anadarko (  ), Comcast (  ) and Abbott (  ) as the market has gone on a significant run and we sought to raise cash while both booking profits near all-time highs in the case of Abbott, Comcast and Danaher, and lessen exposure to trouble positions such as Anadarko, or those with potential near-term headwinds as is the case with Amgen and the upcoming Enbrel intellectual property court ruling</p><p>Moving on to the broader market, with fourth-quarter earnings season winding down, results thus far have been relatively positive versus expectations with 67.5% of companies reporting a positive EPS surprise. For the fourth-quarter, earnings growth has increased roughly 14.7% year over year vs. expectations for an overall 14.49% increase throughout the season; of the 426 non-financials that reported, earnings growth is up 15.5%. Revenues are up 6.0% vs. expectations throughout the season for an 6.08% increase; 67.5% of companies beat EPS expectations, 23.1% missed the mark and 9.3% were in line with consensus. On a year-over-year comparison basis, 74.4% beat the prior year's EPS results, 23.94% came up short and 1.42% were virtually in line. The best performing sectors so far have been Information Tech, Industrials and Healthcare, while the worst performing have been the Real Estate, Utilities and Energy.</p><p>Next week, 11 companies in the S&amp;P 500 will report earnings.

Additionally, we believe profitability will continue to improve as AWS and advertising account for a larger portion of total sales as both these segments sport higher margins than the eCommerce operation. And while we believe the increasing share of revenue from these higher margin businesses will be key to driving profitability longer-term, we believe margins on ecommerce stand to improve as the company's infrastructure is further built out and economies of scale further kick in.

Although revenue is expected to decelerate as the company transitions its monetization emphasis to Instagram Stories from Facebook's NewsFeed, and there are additional risks to margins related to increased OpEx spending, we believe both processes have become well understood by investors at this point. Plus, we think future growth opportunities exist through increased monetization of the WhatsApp and Messenger verticals. While critics claim the member base has become disengaged, Facebook's third quarter results showed trends have held with daily active users (DAUs) of 1.49 billion (+9% YoY) and monthly active users (MAUs) of 2.27 billion (+10% YoY).

AI is what has made the company's Search, Video (YouTube) and targeted ad capabilities best-in-class and is the driving force behind the company's success in voice (Google Home) and autonomous driving (Waymo). Furthermore, we believe it is this AI expertise that will also make the company more prevalent in other industries, including healthcare via subsidiary Verily, as AI and machine learning continue to disrupt operations across industries. We believe Alphabet's willingness to invest in new areas, knowing most will fail, is a recipe for long-term success as while most \"  \" projects may fail, every once in a while, you end up with a Waymo, perhaps the division's, most successful graduate to date. Lastly, compounding out positive view of the company's future opportunities, we believe that Alphabet's free cash flow generation and solid balance sheet set it apart and are what will allow the company to continue taking chances on far-out ground-breaking and potentially world changing projects.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $1,400;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Regulatory risk (data privacy), competition, macroeconomic slowdown impacting consumers and therefore ad buyer activity</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Goldman Sachs</emphasis></emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $188.96; 550 shares; 4.03%; Sector: Financials</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: There was no major company specific news and shares of the financials were impacted by dovish Fed commentary that led to a flattening of the yield curve, which in turn diminishes the ability of banks to expand net interest margins. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Another reason why we think the share price deserves a greater premium is because of management's emphasis on fee-based, or more recurring, revenue streams.

We believe that memory (DRAM &amp; NAND) companies, which are customers of Lam Research, are currently holding back on capital expenditures in an effort to boost near-term profits and preserve cash flows, a dynamic that will ultimately result in supply growth lagging demand growth. Moreover, we believe that thanks to the digital revolution and rapidly growing internet of things space, we believe the demand for memory is becoming less cyclical in nature and as a result, we believe that should our thesis prove correct and we do see a supply shortage in the back half of 2019, then memory prices should begin to rebound and lead to increased CapEx/investments in capital equipment (what Lam sells) in the future. As we noted in out initiation, the current dynamic resembles the first half of 2016, a period that immediately preceded an inflection in prices, which lead to a sharp increase in Lam's earnings. Regarding management signaling, we also believe an inflection is coming due to the timing of management's recently announced $5 billion share repurchase program, which we view as a \"call\" that the industry dynamic is about to turn, and the stock has bottomed because the earnings decline is about to end. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $210;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: A delay in semiconductor companies increasing capital expenditures, a macroeconomic slowdown that hampers demand for memory chips.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,   ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Nvidia</emphasis></emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $177.50; 150 shares; 1.03%; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Sector: Info.

First, we expect a relief rally in VIAB if the two can strike an agreement. If no deal is made at the deadline, then we wouldn't rule out the two companies making an agreement shortly after, similar to what happened in 2012. Then if AT&amp;T fully wants to shutout Viacom's 23 channels from its service, we think the need for a Viacom-CBS merger would never be greater, thereby providing some downside support in the stock <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

To this point, we believe Paramount operations, which has undergone a transition from consistent underperformance to now multiple consecutive quarters of improved adjusted operating income with the last three being profitable, will continue to improve and demand more attention as momentum continues and management progresses in further monetizing intellectual property.

Appeals will likely ensue should Amgen's patent protections be ruled invalid; however, it is unlikely that the stock will avoid damage. We cannot accurately predict the outcome of the Enbrel decision and what the full downside stock impact would be, but what we can do is control a bit of our own destiny and mitigate our downside risk to a possible unfavorable ruling.

Services provide for a recurring revenue stream at higher margins, a factor that serves to reduce earnings volatility while allowing for a higher percentage of sales to fall to the bottom line, as a result, we believe that Services growth and the installed base, are much more important than how many devices the company can sell in a given 90-day period. In addition to improved profitability we also believe the transparent nature of this revenue stream will demand an expanded price-to-earnings multiple as segment sales grow. Furthermore, we believe that Apple's desire to push deeper into the healthcare arena will help make its devices invaluable as more life-changing features are added and the company works to democratize health records. Lastly, also see upside resulting from increased adoption of wearables (think the Apple Watch) and potential new product announcements such as an AR/VR headset or an update on project Titan, the company's secretive autonomous driving program. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $180;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Slowdown in consumer spending, competition, lack of new product innovation, elongated replacement cycles, failure to execute on Services growth initiative</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,   ,  ,  , The Healthcare Ecosystem  ,  ,  Interview  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Abbott Laboratories</emphasis></emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $77.97; 825 shares; 2.5%; Sector: Healthcare</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: While we remain bullish on Abbott's opportunities in 2019, especially following the expanded indication granted to the company's Mitraclip (which should see estimates and guidance increase), we booked a profit as shares reached our price target and hovered at all-time highs.

The company boasts high performing franchises in Medical Devices (with strong growth in Diabetes Care) and Diagnostics (with strong gains in Core Laboratory), while Nutrition and Established Pharmaceutical remain strategic parts of its total portfolio. We believe the company's opportunities for upside rest with additional Libre uptake, the Alinity U.S. launch, and an expanded indication of the Mitraclip. We believe in CEO Miles White and the Abbott management team, who has a strong track record of integrating acquisitions and delivering double-digit earnings per share growth. Lastly, Abbott has plenty of financial flexibility to pursue mergers/acquisitions and other strategic actions. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $80;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Emerging market exposure, Product disruptions.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:   ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Comcast</emphasis></emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $39.46; 2,200 shares; 3.37%; Sector: Communication Services</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: This week, we  and downgraded the name to a Two. Though we remain bullish on the longer-term opportunity for growth, especially given the added international exposure following the Sky Plc acquisition, we want to remain disciplined and opted to book a profit as shares rallied about 11.65% since the company secured the highest bid for Sky in late September, compared to a roughly 3% drop in the S&amp;P 500. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Additionally, the acquisition provides Comcast access to Sky's \"Q Box,\" which said to be even better than the X1 and provides a buffer should cord cutting accelerate in Europe. Recall, domestically, the X1 has been shown to be more resilient to the trend than competing platforms. Regarding the debt load on the balance sheet resulting from the acquisition, we reaffirm that management has an excellent M&amp;A track record and believe strong cash flow generation will provide the means to successfully de-leverage overtime, allowing shares to re-rate higher over time. Lastly, regarding the U.S. business, we believe management's decision to focus operations around broadband is continuing to be rewarded with higher margins and providing a greater ability to bundle cheaper, less in demand services such as video. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $45; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: An acceleration of cord cutting, failure to realize targeted Sky integration synergies, 5G impacting broadband business, competition</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  (1/23/19),  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Danaher</emphasis></emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $129.69; 550 shares; 2.77%; Sector: Life Sciences</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: With shares continuing to hover at all-time highs and the merger &amp; acquisition catalyst off the table following the company's announcement of plans to acquire General Electric's Life Sciences business for $21.4 billion, a deal that strengthens Danaher's positioning in this high-margin, strong growth industry, we opted to  further so as not to be greedy and realize a gain of approximately 53% while raising our cash levels for future flexibility. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Its largest contributors to organic sales growth come from its Life Science, Diagnostics, and Environment &amp; Applied Solutions divisions. Although its Dental segment continues to lag due to a challenged industry environment, management has strategically planned for a spinoff of this business in the second half of 2019. We believe this action will improve the consistency of the company's overall core sales growth trends, making the stock more deserving of a premium to peers. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>:   <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Exposure to China tariffs, execution and timing risk of Dental spinoff</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:    ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">DowDuPont</emphasis></emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $53.92; 1,375 shares; 2.88%; Sector: Chemicals</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: None <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

The Materials division will spin off by April 1, 2019 with the remainder expected to be broken up by June 1, 2019. Until then, we believe trade progress can be a meaningful driver for shares to grind higher as China has previously agreed to buy more agriculture goods from the U.S. (think soy beans, etc...) and work down the trade deficit over time. Additionally, we believe additional support will come from the company's $3 billion share repurchase program, which we remind members is expected to be completed before the Materials division spinoff and is another factor supporting out positive view of the current risk/reward profile. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $70;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Execution risk relating to the breakup, slowing global growth, trade war intensification, oil prices, natural gas prices</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  , <url normalizedValue=\"http://investors.dupont.com/\">Investor Relations</url><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Five Below Inc</emphasis></emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $116.97; 250 shares; 1.14%; Sector: Consumer Discretionary</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: The company will report earnings next Wednesday, March 27<sup>th</sup>, after the closing bell.

Additionally, we value Five Below for its entirely domestic revenue stream, which insulates it from global trade dynamics and any slowing of global growth. And while tariffs may pressure the supply chain, should they increase, we believe management is already taking steps to mitigate any potential margin pressure. Lastly, while an economic slowdown could impact all retailers, we believe that Five Below's focus on less expensive products will allow it to be resilient as shoppers will naturally look for discounts when funds run low, making Five Below stores all the more attractive in such an environment. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $125;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Economic slowdown leading to less consumer spending, competition, lack of innovative product mix</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  , <url normalizedValue=\"http://investor.fivebelow.com/investors/default.aspx\">Investor Relations</url><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Honeywell</emphasis></emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $155.83; 750 shares; 4.54%; Sector: Industrials</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: Honeywell CEO Darius Adamczyk  on Wednesday about the company's exposure to the Boeing 737 Max 8 crashes. \"We haven't seen any impact on our business at all yet,\" he said. When speaking to the broader business, Adamczyk said, \"overall, the business environment we're seeing in Q1 has been relatively strong and it's been across all four of our business platforms as well as, more or less, all the geographies we participant in, which is more or less everywhere.\" This commentary fits the upbeat tone management provided at a recent analyst conference, which we pointed out  . <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk. Price Change</emphasis>: 0.29%; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yield</emphasis>: 2.11%</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INVESTMENT THESIS</emphasis>: Following a 2018 year when the company spun off two businesses, we believe the new Honeywell is worthy of a premium to its peer group as it has become less cyclical and more focused with stronger organic sales growth trends. The two segments we remain most positive on for their long-term growth profiles are Aerospace and Safety and Productivity Solution, as both stand to benefit from strong secular trends. Additionally, we appreciate management's ability to drive operational improvements in areas such as margin and free cash flow.

Its brands are tailored to middle-income buyers who shop for value, or good deals, while their store locations remain away from the mall which has been subject to decline in foot traffic. The company is run by a strategic management team who has several strong initiatives in place (standard-to-small initiatives, Amazon partnership, etc.) that drive traffic and improve inventory management.

While companies may look to build out multi-cloud environments, Microsoft's Azure offering will be a prime choice thanks to the company's decision to provide the same \"stack\" used in the public cloud, to companies for their on-premise data centers. Additionally, we would note that hybrid environments are currently the preference for most companies because it allows them to maintain critical data in house while taking advantage of the agility and scalability provided by public clouds. Outside of the cloud opportunity, we maintain a positive view on the company's growing gaming business, which we believe is becoming an increasingly prominent factor in the Microsoft growth story as gaming becomes more mainstream, management works to convert its gaming revenue from one-time license purchase to a recurring subscription model and as technologies like augmented/virtual reality evolve. Finally, as it relates to LinkedIn and other subscription-based services such as O365 and various Dynamics products, we continue to value them highly for their recurring revenue streams, which we remind members, provides for greater transparency of future earnings.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $118;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Slowdown in IT spending, competition, cannibalization of on premises business by the cloud</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:   ,  ,   ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Palo Alto Networks</emphasis></emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\"/><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $243.36; </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">275 shares; 2.59%; Sector: Info.

Internationally, we saw China reduce its target GDP growth rate from 6.5% to between 6% and 6.5%. Additionally, China reported abysmal trade data with the countries trade balance coming in at $4.12 billion versus expectations of $26.38 billion. Elsewhere, the European Central Bank (ECB), maintained 0% interest rates, while slashing 2019 GDP estimates from 1.7% to 1.1% and announcing a new stimulus package. Clearly the international picture is not a good one. That said, with the exception of a very poor nonfarm payroll report on Friday, that we believe was impacted by weather conditions, the U.S. economy continues to show signs of growth. However, despite the rosy domestic picture, there are some cracks (housing, autos, potentially in the job market should we not see an upward revision to February on the next release) and we have therefore sought to raise cash in anticipation of any pullbacks.</p><p>Additionally, on the U.S./China trade front, one factor to keep in mind is that given the awful data out of China and decent data out of the U.S., we would not be surprised to see President Trump ramp up the tough talk on China as the data is highly in favor of the U.S. The president, who has pointed to a deal on the horizon, may use this as a chance to \"go for the jugular\" so to speak as we may not see a better setup than the one we have right now to address key issues such as forced IP transfers and government policies designed to undercut U.S. industries.</p><p>Lastly, Zev Fima had the chance this week to sit with TheStreet's Tech Stocks Editor Nelson Wang for Technically Speaking segment to discuss Facebook's shift toward private messaging and TheStreet's London correspondent Martin Baccardax to discuss some of the factors driving the market both abroad and here in the US: Technically Speaking:</p><p>What's driving the market:</p><p>Treasury yields were pushed lower, to around 2.62% following weak macro data abroad and a poor nonfarm payroll report domestically. In line with the treasury move, gold prices pulled back a bit, however, moving below $1,300 per ounce, though rebounded off the lows of the week following the nonfarm report. The dollar strengthened versus the euro following a downward revision in European growth guidance by the ECB while oil ended the week lower, though it continues to hover in the mid-$50s per barrel.</p><p>We're in the final stretch of fourth-quarter earnings season. Within the portfolio we heard from Salesforce and Kohl's.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Salesforce</emphasis><br/></p><p>After the closing bell on Monday, Salesforce.com reported a top and bottom-line beat with its fiscal fourth-quarter 2019 result. Non-GAAP revenue of $3.64 billion (up 27% year over year on a constant currency, or cc, basis) edged the consensus of $3.56 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.70 (up 49% year over year) exceeded the consensus by $0.15.</p><p>Taking a look at guidance, management expects full-year fiscal 2020 revenue to be in the range of $15.95 billion to $16.05 billion (consensus $15.97 billion). On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $2.74 to $2.76, which is in line with the $2.75 consensus. However, investors took issue with what management guided for in the first quarter because it was light of expectations. Revenue is expected to be $3.67 billion to $3.68 billion (consensus $3.691 billion) and adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.60 to $0.61, which is below the $0.63 consensus figure. Nevertheless, we think this was just management being conservative (Q1 is typically the lowest quarter in terms of sales and earnings for the year), and we expect the secular trend of digital transformations will help management achieve its target of $26 to $28 billion in revenue by FY2023, a result that means sales will organically double in the next four years.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kohl's</emphasis><br/></p><p>On Tuesday before the opening bell, Kohl's reported a top and bottom line beat with its fourth quarter earnings result. Revenue of $6.82 billion (down 3.3% year over year) topped consensus of $6.58 billion, and earnings per share of $2.24 (up 20% year over year) exceeded consensus of $2.18. Taking a look at same-store sales, or \"comps\", Kohl's delivered +1% on a shifted basis and -1% on a fiscal basis, with the latter result being in-line with the -1% consensus view.</p><p>Looking at guidance, management expects earnings per share in the range of $5.80 to $6.15, a strong result against a $5.75 consensus view. Meanwhile, the comparable sales change of 0% to +2% was in-line with the 0.9% consensus expectation. Although first-quarter comps are expected to be on the lighter side due to February's poor weather, investors looked past this after management announced the exciting expansion to its partnership with Amazon. Instead of operating as a \"store within\" concept, Kohl's will act more as a wholesale retailer for the e-commerce giant, doubling the number of stores it sells Amazon-based products in.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Economy</emphasis><br/></p><p>On Tuesday, shortly after the opening bell, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that the non-manufacturing index (NMI), which tracks the service sector of the economy, jumped 3 percentage points in February to 59.7%, surpassing expectations of 57.2%, following January's 56.7% reading. The better-than-expected results come after last week's PMI  , which missed expectations, coming in at 54.2% vs. consensus of 55.8%. For perspective, over the past 12 months, the NMI has averaged 58.7% with a high of 60.8% and a low of 56.7%. See  for our full analysis.</p><p>Also on Tuesday, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that new home sales in December increased 3.7% month over month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 621,000. The reading topped expectations of 600,000, however, serving to more than offset the beat, November's reading was revised down to a rate of 599,000 (from 657,000, previously reported). With the December's reading, on a year-over-year basis, sales are down 2.4% from December 2017's estimated rate of 636,000. As for costs, the average selling price in December pushed to $377,000 (from $357,600 in November). The median sales price also increased, swelling to $318,600 (from $303,500 in November). See  for our full analysis.</p><p>On Wednesday, the ADP National Employment Report was released, indicating a 183,000 private sector seasonally adjusted payroll increase for the month of February, missing expectations for 190,000 added jobs. However, partially offsetting the weak results, January's reading was revised up to +300,000, from +213,000 previously reported, and lowered December's reading to +263,000 from +271,000. The headline reading can be further broken down into a \"goods-producing\" sector and a \"service-providing\" sector. The goods-producing sector accounted for 44,000 jobs, while the service-providing sector accounted for 139,000. See  for our full analysis.</p><p>On Thursday, the Department of Labor reported that initial jobless claims for the week ending March 2 were 223,000, a decrease of 3,000 from the previous week's revised level of 226,000 (revised up from 225,000) and 2,000 claims below expectations of 225,000. Importantly, the four-week moving average for claims (used as a gauge to offset volatility in the weekly numbers) was 226,250, a decrease of 3,000 from the previous week's revised average of 229,250 (revised up from 229,000). The low rate of layoffs reflects a strengthening labor market as claims have remained below 300,000 -- the threshold typically used to categorize a healthy jobs market - for an incredible 209 consecutive weeks, the longest streak for weekly records dating back to 1967. The previous longest stretch ended in April 1970 and lasted for 161 weeks. For the official weekly release, please see  .</p><p>On Friday, the U.S. Labor Department reported that the economy added 20,000 jobs during the month of February, well below expectations for a 180,000 gain. This big miss was partially offset by revisions to the December and January readings, which were revised up to +227,000 from +222,000 and to +311,000 from +304,000, respectively. With these revisions, job gains have now averaged 186,000 over the last three months. Even though the jobs number came in well below expectations, the unemployment rate declined 0.2 percentage points to 3.8% in February. Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate held steady at 63.2%. In February, average hourly earnings for all employees on nonfarm payrolls increased by $0.11 to $27.66, following a $0.02 gain in January. Over the year, average hourly earnings (i.e., wage inflation) have increased $0.91, or 3.4%, a tick up from the 3.2% annual rate of advance seen in January. See  for our full analysis.</p><p>Lastly on Friday, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that housing starts surged 18.6% month over month in January to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.230 million, up from December's revised rate of 1.037 million, and outpacing expectations of a 10.86% monthly increase. With January's reading, housing starts were down 7.8% from January 2018. As for building permits, units authorized in January increased 1.4% month over month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.345 million, exceeding expectations of a 2.94% monthly decline. This follows a revised December reading of 1.326 million. With January's monthly advance, permits are down 1.5% from the same time last year. See  for our full analysis.</p><p>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Note: T is the most recent period, T-1 is the prior period's reading and T-2 is two periods back, the intent being to illustrate any trends</emphasis>)</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oil</emphasis><br/></p><p>On the commodity front, prices remain rangebound in the $50s as investors weigh the potential for a US/China trade deal to reignite global growth against a global economic environment in which China and Europe are guiding for slower growth than previously expected. Also helping to support prices are the OPEC+ production cuts, with Russia stating their intention this week, to accelerate the rate of production cuts and sources out of OPEC calling out the possibility for an extension of the current production cut plan that is currently planned to run through the end of the first half of the year.</p><p>On the domestic front, on Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA), reported that in the week ending March 1, U.S. stockpiles (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) increased by 7.1 million barrels to 452.9 million barrels, a bearish reading versus analyst expectations for 1.2-million-barrel increase. Additionally, U.S. production held at a weekly high of 12.1 million bpd. Lastly, net imports increased by 1.647 million bpd as imports increased by 1.084 million bpd, while exports declined by 556,000 bpd. See  for the full report.</p><p>Lastly, we note that the spread between WTI and Brent sits at roughly $9 per barrel. Recall, this is a key metric as the wider the spread, the more attractive U.S. based crude (WTI) becomes to foreign buyers, though we note that strength in the dollar can offset this effect as foreign buyers convert their home currencies to the dollar.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stocks</emphasis><br/></p><p>In the portfolio this week, we initiated a position in Home Depot (  ) and subsequently bulked up on that position (  ) as we believe weather issues that plagued the fourth quarter to be temporary, we expect the housing market to stabilize and believe the risk/reward profile to be favorable thanks to strong dollar headwinds abating as we move through the year and see support resulting from an increased dividend and robust $15 billion share repurchase program.</p><p>Additionally, we used weakness to bulk up on several positions including, CVS (  ), which we continue to view as being vastly oversold; Lam Research (  ,  and  ); and UnitedHealth Group (  ).</p><p>Regarding CVS, we reiterate that you have to buy weakness and exercise wide scales when there is an incessant amount of selling on the same news or no real news, no matter how painful it may be in the short-term. We continue to believe that the pressure will be short-term because the company's only main issues rest with its headwinds related to the Long-Term Care business and industry-related pressures, which are expected to abate as we move through this transition year and into a return to growth in 2020.</p><p>As for Lam Research, quarterly earnings are expected to decline on a sequential basis over the first few quarters of calendar year 2019, however that's not the dynamic investors should be focused on. Instead, it is all about industry conditions and how growth trends in DRAM/NAND supply will be below demand growth in the back half of the year, forcing the memory market to tighten and an inflection in both prices and chip maker spending. Very positive for Lam Research, who is a market share gainer in the industry.</p><p>On the UnitedHealth Group front, Investors have been fretting what the recently introduced \"Medicare for All\" bill will mean for the future health insurance companies, ignoring the facts of how the bill does not have enough support on both party lines and its funding costs will likely be too exorbitant. We acknowledge that this headline risk may linger in the short-term, however, this is classic shoot first, ask questions later type behavior that creates opportunity.</p><p>On the other hand, we raised cash by trimming shares of Danaher (  and  ). As noted in our alert, following the GE BioPharma deal announcement, which is a transformative one that doubles down on the high-margin, strong growing Life Sciences industry and should lead to further gains down the road, the M&amp;A catalyst is now off the table due to the size of the deal and we cannot let ourselves get greedy here.</p><p>Additionally, we closed out our position in PayPal (  ). We are still fans of the digital payment space and how PayPal is monetizing both its namesake platform and Venmo, however, we think the company's valuation has gotten full and we lack catalysts at the moment.</p><p>Moving on to the broader market, with fourth-quarter earnings season winding down, results thus far have been relatively positive versus expectations with 67.5% of companies reporting a positive EPS surprise. For the fourth-quarter, earnings growth has increased roughly 14.7% year over year vs. expectations for an overall 14.45% increase throughout the season; of the 426 non-financials that reported, earnings growth is up 15.5%. Revenues are up 6.0% vs. expectations throughout the season for an 6.08% increase; 67.5% of companies beat EPS expectations, 23.1% missed the mark and 9.3% were in line with consensus. On a year-over-year comparison basis, 74.4% beat the prior year's EPS results, 23.94% came up short and 1.42% were virtually in line. The best performing sectors so far have been Information Tech, Industrials and Healthcare, while the worst performing have been the Real Estate, Utilities and Energy.</p><p>Next week, 23 companies in the S&amp;P 500 will report earnings. No portfolio companies will be reporting.</p><p>Other key earnings reports for the market include: ADT (ADT), Kronos Worldwide (KRO), Stitch Fix (SFIX), PetIQ (PETQ), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), Momo (MOMO), KEYW Holding (KEYW), ZTO Express (ZTO), Quorum (QHC), Cohu (COHU), ZAGG (ZAGG), Everi (EVRI), Express (EXPR), Surgery Partners (SRGY), Vera Bradley (VRA), Daqo New Energy (DQ), Smart &amp; Final Stores (SFS), Tailored Brands (TLRD), Cloudera (CLDR), Domo (DOMO), Embraer SA (ERJ), Genesco (GCO), Hudson (HUD), Cannae Holdings (CNNE), Broadcom (AVGO), Huazhu Group (HTHT), Adobe Systems (ADBE), Ulta Beauty (ULTA), Turquiose Hill Resources (TRQ), Zumiez (ZUMZ), DocuSign (DOCU) and Citi Trends (CTRN)</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Economic Data (*all times ET)</emphasis></emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">U.S.</emphasis></emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Monday (3/11)</emphasis><br/></p><p>Retail Sales Ex Auto MoM (8:30): 0.50% <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">expected</emphasis><br/></p><p>Retail Sales Ex Auto and Gas (8:30): 0.60% <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">expected</emphasis><br/></p><p>Retail Sales Advance MoM (8:30): 0.10% <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">expected</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tuesday (3/12)</emphasis><br/></p><p>NFIB Small Business Optimism (6:00)</p><p>CPI MoM (8:30): 0.20% <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">expected</emphasis><br/></p><p>CPI Ex Food and Energy MoM (8:30): 0.20% <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">expected</emphasis><br/></p><p>CPI YoY (8:30): 1.60% <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">expected</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wednesday (3/13)</emphasis><br/></p><p>MBA Mortgage Applications (7:00)</p><p>PPI Final Demand MoM (8:30): 0.20% <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">expected</emphasis><br/></p><p>PPI Ex Food and Energy MoM (8:30): 0.20% <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">expected</emphasis><br/></p><p>PPI Final Demand YoY (8:30): 1.90% <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">expected</emphasis><br/></p><p>PPI Ex Food and Energy YoY (8:30): 2.60% <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">expected</emphasis><br/></p><p>Durable Goods Orders (8:30): -0.70% <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">expected</emphasis><br/></p><p>Durables Ex Transportation (8:30): 0.20% <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">expected</emphasis><br/></p><p>Cap Goods Orders Nondef Ex Air (8:30)</p><p>Construction Spending MoM (10:00)</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Thursday (3/14)</emphasis><br/></p><p>Import Price Index MoM (8:30): 0.30% <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">expected</emphasis><br/></p><p>Initial Jobless Claims (8:30)</p><p>Continuing Claims (8:30)</p><p>Bloomberg Consumer Comfort (9:45)</p><p>New Home Sales (10:00): 628k <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">expected</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Friday (3/15)</emphasis><br/></p><p>Empire Manufacturing (8:30): 10 <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">expected</emphasis><br/></p><p>Industrial Production MoM (9:15): 0.60% <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">expected</emphasis><br/></p><p>Capacity Utilization (9:15): 78.80% <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">expected</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><br/>of Mich.

On the website, \"Haven was established by Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway, and JPMorgan Chase to bring together the resources and capabilities of the three companies to create better outcomes, greater satisfaction, and lower costs for their U.S. employees and families.\" Additionally, the companies stated mission \"transform health care to create better outcomes and overall experience, as well as lower costs for you and your family.\" We do not expect this to provide a material financial impact to any of the three companies in the near-term, as the early days will be limited regarding reach and availability to the general public. However, longer-term we are very interested to see what the team comes up with as the rising costs of medical care have been a key issue for Americans and anything that helps bring these costs down are not only a positive for those suffering from health issues but for the economy overall as lower medical costs can result increased levels of discretionary income and therefore more consumption, a key driver of U.S. GDP. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Additionally, we believe profitability will continue to improve as AWS and advertising account for a larger portion of total sales as both these segments sport higher margins than the eCommerce operation. And while we believe the increasing share of revenue from these higher margin businesses will be key to driving profitability longer-term, we believe margins on ecommerce stand to improve as the company's infrastructure is further built out and economies of scale further kick in.

While we acknowledge that such a feat would take time, we agree that the company's IP portfolio and brand recognition, along with its ability to potentially bundle the service with ESPN+ and Hulu (something the analysts speculated to as something that could be in the cards), make Disney one of, if not the best suited company to take on Netflix, the clear leader in the streaming place. Additionally, speaking at the company's shareholder meeting, CEO Bob Iger stated, regarding the content that will ultimately be available on the Disney+ platform, \"at some point, fairly soon, after launch, it will house the entire Disney motion picture library.\" The main takeaway being that the days of the \"Disney Vault\" are coming to an end. Additionally, Iger reiterated, \"all of the films that we're releasing, starting this year's slate with Captain Marvel, will also be on the service.\" The only films that will likely not be on the service to start are those still unavailable due to licensing agreements, however, those too will in time arrive on the platform.

While shares are still well off their all-time high, we believe the commitment to, and actions taken to achieve this goal of a more private and secure online platform will be the key factor allowing the company to move past the slew of negative headlines that plagued it in 2018. To achieve this, Zuckerberg outlined several principles (which members can delve deeper into via the link above) that the company will rely on to achieve its goals including: an emphasis on private interactions, encryption, reducing permanence, safety, interoperability, and the need for secure data storage. Bottom line, while there is plenty of work yet to be done, we believe that management has finally gotten the message that if they ever want to the company to return to its former glory, they must start to think about privacy first. The message has been received, the plan is in place, the goal has been made clear and we look forward to seeing management execute and in the process, regain the public's trust. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

It monetizes its platforms and delivers targeted advertisements across all major demographics at a high ROI. Although revenue is expected to decelerate as the company transitions its monetization emphasis to Instagram Stories from Facebook's NewsFeed, and there are additional risks to margins related to increased OpEx spending, we believe both processes have become well understood by investors at this point. Plus, we think future growth opportunities exist through increased monetization of the WhatsApp and Messenger verticals. While critics claim the member base has become disengaged, Facebook's third quarter results showed trends have held with daily active users (DAUs) of 1.49 billion (+9% YoY) and monthly active users (MAUs) of 2.27 billion (+10% YoY).

Furthermore, we believe it is this AI expertise that will also make the company more prevalent in other industries, including healthcare via subsidiary Verily, as AI and machine learning continue to disrupt operations across industries. We believe Alphabet's willingness to invest in new areas, knowing most will fail, is a recipe for long-term success as while most \"  \" projects may fail, every once in a while, you end up with a Waymo, perhaps the division's, most successful graduate to date. Lastly, compounding out positive view of the company's future opportunities, we believe that Alphabet's free cash flow generation and solid balance sheet set it apart and are what will allow the company to continue taking chances on far-out ground-breaking and potentially world changing projects.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $1,400;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Regulatory risk (data privacy), competition, macroeconomic slowdown impacting consumers and therefore ad buyer activity</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Goldman Sachs  ; $195.24; 550 shares; 4.10%; Sector: Financials</emphasis></emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: None <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Meanwhile, the firm has delivered consistent improvements to its return on equity and return on tangible common equity metrics-which are drivers of a premium over book price-while tangible book value has continued to grow. Another reason why we think the share price deserves a greater premium is because of management's emphasis on fee-based, or more recurring, revenue streams.

Longer term, management's 2020 financial targets include sales to increase to the range of $115 billion to $120 billion, with operating margins in a range of 14.4% to 15% and return on invested capital of more than 40%.

And we are. So February quarter-to-date has been pretty strong. We still have a long way to go.\" That's a very encouraging news to hear during a week when concerns of global growth seeped into the broader markets. By business type, JPMorgan analyst Stephen Tusa wrote: \"Long-cycle businesses (~40% of portfolio post-spins) continue strong with Intelligrated and Aerospace in particular, while short-cycle businesses (~60%) are also seeing some growth.\" Recall that when management issued guidance with its last release, short-cycle uncertainty was where much of this year's unpredictably rest.

In terms of out year financials, we also remind members that Barclays forecasts sales upward of $700 million in 2023. And while, that does imply a solid trajectory, we think it understates Spravato's potential -- it should be bigger on an accelerated timeline because of its life-saving possibilities.

Moreover, we believe that thanks to the digital revolution and rapidly growing internet of things space, we believe the demand for memory is becoming less cyclical in nature and as a result, we believe that should our thesis prove correct and we do see a supply shortage in the back half of 2019, then memory prices should begin to rebound and lead to increased CapEx/investments in capital equipment (what Lam sells) in the future. As we noted in out initiation, the current dynamic resembles the first half of 2016, a period that immediately preceded an inflection in prices, which lead to a sharp increase in Lam's earnings. Regarding management signaling, we also believe an inflection is coming due to the timing of management's recently announced $5 billion share repurchase program, which we view as a \"call\" that the industry dynamic is about to turn, and the stock has bottomed because the earnings decline is about to end. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $210;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: A delay in semiconductor companies increasing capital expenditures, a macroeconomic slowdown that hampers demand for memory chips.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,   ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Schlumberger  ; $41.29; 1950 shares; 3.08%; Sector: Energy</emphasis></emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: No company specific news.

Although the company's earnings power is dependent on the timing of the upstream investment cycle, management has a strong reputation in execution as well as a good handle in understanding the supply/demand dynamic of the industry. The company's premier technology gives it an advantage over peers and allows for market share gains. Furthermore, we value the company's international presence as it means a lessened exposure to North America, where new drilling activity remains limited. As compensation for our patience in the investment cycle's recovery, shares offer an attractive dividend that was confirmed to be backed by cash flow on the company's most recent earnings call. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $65;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>One</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Commodity price pressure, weak capital spending of upstream oil and gas operators.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  (1/22/19),  ,  (1/18/19),  , <url normalizedValue=\"http://investorcenter.slb.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=97513&amp;p=irol-irhome\">Investor Relations</url><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">UnitedHealth Group</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $237.29; 300 shares; 2.72%; Sector: Healthcare</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">United Healthcare Group </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">UNH; $221.08; 225 shares; 1.65%; Sector: </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Health</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: This week, we took another look at UNH as shares remain under pressure while investors await updates on the \"Medicare For All\" bill.

Its business is divided into two subsidiaries: UnitedHealthcare, which represents the insurance side of the company, and Optum, a fast-growing, margin expanding, and technology/data leveraging division with exposure to PBM, healthcare consulting, and specialized health and wellness services. We value the company's consistent, economic-cycle resilient performance, supported by management's long-term expectation of 13% to 15% growth.

To this point, we believe Paramount operations, which has undergone a transition from consistent underperformance to now multiple consecutive quarters of improved adjusted operating income with the last three being profitable, will continue to improve and demand more attention as momentum continues and management progresses in further monetizing intellectual property.

The company generates a significant amount of cash flow off its diversified asset base. In 2019, management's capital plan is based on a $50 oil and $3 natural gas environment. Lastly, as mentioned, shareholder returns are always in focus, and last November management announced a $1 billion addition to its existing share-repurchase program, a 20% increase to the quarterly dividend, and a $500 million increase to its debt-reduction program. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $65;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Commodity price pressure, regulatory risk in Colorado, pipeline constraints in the Permian Basin.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE </emphasis>   ,  ,  , <url normalizedValue=\"http://investors.anadarko.com/\">Investor Relations</url><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Apple  ; $172.91; 450 shares; 2.97%; Sector: Technology</emphasis></emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: This week, Fortune reported that Apple acquired the patent portfolio of defunct home security company Lighthouse AI. While details are limited, we would speculate that the move could have been done in anticipation of a home security offering to compete with Alphabet's Nest platform or Amazon's Ring system. Also, this week, 9to5mac  that Apple's long-awaited augmented reality product is expected to go into mass production as soon as the fourth quarter of this year and no later than the second quarter of 2020. While details are limited (this is Apple after all) the report indicated that the first iteration of the new device will likely be highly dependent on the iPhone for much of the computing needs. We view the news as important for two reasons. First, if true, it could serve to silence the bear calls claiming that the company lacks innovation. Second, if the new device truly does rely on the iPhone for processing power, it may be the catalyst the company needs to motivate consumers to upgrade from older devices, addressing the concerns of a mature smartphone market with elongated upgrade cycles. As cited in the article, the timeline matches the one previously  by Bloomberg back in 2017. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk. Price Change</emphasis>: -1.18%; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yield</emphasis>: 1.69%</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">INVESTMENT THESIS</emphasis>: While we acknowledge that near- to- midterm performance remains heavily influenced by iPhone sales, we believe longer-term upside will come as Services revenue grows its share of overall sales. Services provide for a recurring revenue stream at higher margins, a factor that serves to reduce earnings volatility while allowing for a higher percentage of sales to fall to the bottom line, as a result, we believe that Services growth and the installed base, are much more important than how many devices the company can sell in a given 90-day period. In addition to improved profitability we also believe the transparent nature of this revenue stream will demand an expanded price-to-earnings multiple as segment sales grow. Furthermore, we believe that Apple's desire to push deeper into the healthcare arena will help make its devices invaluable as more life-changing features are added and the company works to democratize health records. Lastly, also see upside resulting from increased adoption of wearables (think the Apple Watch) and potential new product announcements such as an AR/VR headset or an update on project Titan, the company's secretive autonomous driving program. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $180;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Slowdown in consumer spending, competition, lack of new product innovation, elongated replacement cycles, failure to execute on Services growth initiative</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:   ,  ,  , The Healthcare Ecosystem  ,  ,  Interview  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Abbott Laboratories  ; $76.63; 925 shares; 2.71%; Sector: Healthcare</emphasis></emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: This week, we received an update on Alinity when the company  that \"Regional Medical Laboratory, Inc. (RML) will use the company's most advanced technology, Alinity ci-series, to conduct diagnostic testing for millions of patients. RML, part of the Ascension network, which is the largest non-profit health system in the U.S., performs diagnostics testing for more than 2.4 million patients through hospital systems in Texas, Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Kansas and Tennessee.\" We are pleased with the news as the U.S. launch of Alinity has been a key pillar of our investment thesis and a primary factor we believed would allow shares to advance in 2019 and build on the strong performance seen in 2018. Also this week, Abbott announced that \"Key medical devices across Abbott's cardiovascular portfolio will be highlighted in five late-breaking clinical trials at the  (ACC 2019) from March 16 - 18 in New Orleans.\" We look forward to learning more at that time and will of course update members as the updates flow in. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

The company boasts high performing franchises in Medical Devices (with strong growth in Diabetes Care) and Diagnostics (with strong gains in Core Laboratory), while Nutrition and Established Pharmaceutical remain strategic parts of its total portfolio. We believe the company's opportunities for upside rest with additional Libre uptake, the Alinity U.S. launch, and an expanded indication of the Mitraclip. We believe in CEO Miles White and the Abbott management team, who has a strong track record of integrating acquisitions and delivering double-digit earnings per share growth. Lastly, Abbott has plenty of financial flexibility to pursue mergers/acquisitions and other strategic actions. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $80;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Emerging market exposure, Product disruptions.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:   ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Danaher  </emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">; $113.81; 925 shares; 4.02%; Sector: Healthcare</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: Though we remain bullish on shares following the news that the company would be acquiring General Electric's life sciences business, we elected to  this week to lock in an impressive gain of about 53% on our earliest remaining lots. As we noted in our alert, while the acquisition is a transformative deal that doubles down on the high-margin, strong growing Life Sciences industry and it should lead to further gains down the road, the M&amp;A catalyst is now off the table due to the size of the deal and we cannot let ourselves get greedy. Lastly, on Friday, after the closing bell, the company announced a $0.01 increase to their divided to $0.17 per share, payable on April 26, 2019 to shareholders of record on March 29, 2019. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Its largest contributors to organic sales growth come from its Life Science, Diagnostics, and Environment &amp; Applied Solutions divisions. Although its Dental segment continues to lag due to a challenged industry environment, management has strategically planned for a spinoff of this business in the second half of 2019. We believe this action will improve the consistency of the company's overall core sales growth trends, making the stock more deserving of a premium to peers. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>:   <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Exposure to China tariffs, execution and timing risk of Dental spinoff</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:    ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">DowDuPont</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $54.68; 1375 shares; 2.87%; Sector: Chemicals</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: None <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

The Materials division will spin off by April 1, 2019 with the remainder expected to be broken up by June 1, 2019. Until then, we believe trade progress can be a meaningful driver for shares to grind higher as China has previously agreed to buy more agriculture goods from the U.S. (think soy beans, etc...) and work down the trade deficit over time. Additionally, we believe additional support will come from the company's $3 billion share repurchase program, which we remind members is expected to be completed before the Materials division spinoff and is another factor supporting out positive view of the current risk/reward profile. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $70;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Execution risk relating to the breakup, slowing global growth, trade war intensification, oil prices, natural gas prices</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  , <url normalizedValue=\"http://investors.dupont.com/\">Investor Relations</url><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">FiveBelow  ; $114.89; 250 shares; 1.10%; Sector: Consumer Discretionary</emphasis></emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: Late on Wednesday, coverage on Five Below was initiated with an Outperform rating and $140 price target at Oppenheimer.

Additionally, we value Five Below for its entirely domestic revenue stream, which insulates it from global trade dynamics and any slowing of global growth. And while tariffs may pressure the supply chain, should they increase, we believe management is already taking steps to mitigate any potential margin pressure. Lastly, while an economic slowdown could impact all retailers, we believe that Five Below's focus on less expensive products will allow it to be resilient as shoppers will naturally look for discounts when funds run low, making Five Below stores all the more attractive in such an environment. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $125;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Economic slowdown leading to less consumer spending, competition, lack of innovative product mix</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  , <url normalizedValue=\"http://investor.fivebelow.com/investors/default.aspx\">Investor Relations</url><br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Kohl's</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $67.77; 900 shares; 2.33%; Sector: Consumer Discretionary</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: This week, Kohl's released a very solid fourth-quarter earnings report that was compounded by a strong FY2019 EPS forecast that topped consensus, at the low end! However, as strong as the results and outlook were, we were even happier to hear that the company's Amazon partnership is about to kick into high gear with management set to transition the program from the current \"store within a store\" concept \"to a more robust wholesale relationship with Amazon.\" As a result, Kohl's plans to double its efforts and expand the store count to over 200, up from current 100 rate. Even further, Kohl's plans to dedicate space in over 200 stores to Amazon devices - basically an Amazon store within a store. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1-Wk.

Its brands are tailored to middle-income buyers who shop for value, or good deals, while their store locations remain away from the mall which has been subject to decline in foot traffic. The company is run by a strategic management team who has several strong initiatives in place (standard-to-small initiatives, Amazon partnership, etc.) that drive traffic and improve inventory management.

While companies may look to build out multi-cloud environments, Microsoft's Azure offering will be a prime choice thanks to the company's decision to provide the same \"stack\" used in the public cloud, to companies for their on-premise data centers. Additionally, we would note that hybrid environments are currently the preference for most companies because it allows them to maintain critical data in house while taking advantage of the agility and scalability provided by public clouds. Outside of the cloud opportunity, we maintain a positive view on the company's growing gaming business, which we believe is becoming an increasingly prominent factor in the Microsoft growth story as gaming becomes more mainstream, management works to convert its gaming revenue from one-time license purchase to a recurring subscription model and as technologies like augmented/virtual reality evolve. Finally, as it relates to LinkedIn and other subscription-based services such as O365 and various Dynamics products, we continue to value them highly for their recurring revenue streams, which we remind members, provides for greater transparency of future earnings.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $118;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Slowdown in IT spending, competition, cannibalization of on premises business by the cloud</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:   ,  ,   ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Palo Alto Networks</emphasis></emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">  ; $234.63; 275 shares; 2.47%; Sector: Technology</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WEEKLY UPDATE</emphasis>: This week, analysts at Barclays published a note following their meeting with CFO Kathy Bonanno and CMO Rene Bonvanie that we discussed in more detail  .

Also pressuring the markets is uncertainty regarding 2019 earnings growth as we are now in the back half of the fourth-quarter earnings season for 2018 and companies across the board will be facing tough comps following a year in which they benefited greatly from the one-time boost provided by corporate tax reform. That said, we believe it is important to keep this week's move and the earnings fears in perspective. Recall, 2018 saw record earnings, so even with the slowdown in growth, company earnings remain relatively robust, which is why, despite booking some profits this week in Palo Alto Networks  and being relatively conservative in our buying activity due to an acknowledgement that we are short-term overbought given the fantastic run off the December lows, we remain longer-term bullish and continue to seek out new opportunities in the market.</p><p>Looking ahead, we remind members that next week on Wednesday, February 13 at 11:30 a.m. ET, we will be hosting our monthly members-only call where we look forward to addressing your most pressing investing concerns. We will begin taking questions on Monday so as you go through this week's roundup please keep in mind those topics you would like us to address! For more information on how to watch/dial-in to our call, please see our Alert  . </p><p>Treasury yields ended the week lower while gold prices held up, largely unchanged, as investors took some risk off the table on fears of slowing global growth. The dollar rallied versus the euro as the European Commission cut its growth forecast for the Eurozone on Thursday to 1.3% in 2019, down from the prior forecast of 1.9%. Lastly, oil ended the week lower, pressured over concerns of slowing global growth.</p><p>We're in the heart of fourth-quarter earnings season! Within the portfolio we heard from Alphabet  , BP  , Viacom  , Disney  and Anadarko  . </p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet</emphasis><br/></p><p>On Monday, Alphabet reported a solid top and bottom line beat with its fourth quarter earnings results. Revenues of $39.276 billion (up 23% in constant currency year over year) topped the consensus of $38.904 billion, and earnings per share of $12.77 (up 32% year over year) beat the consensus of $10.86. Additionally, Ex-traffic acquisition cost (TAC) revenue of $31.84 billion beat the $31.3 billion consensus. Although much of the headline numbers were positive, investors took issue with operation margins, which declined 3 percentage points year over year to 21%, as operating income of $8.203 billion fell short of the $8.607 billion expectation. </p><p>By division, revenue in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google Properties</emphasis> (formerly labeled \"website\" -- in other words, the core business) increased 21.5% year over year to about $27 billion for a solid beat on the $26.75 billion consensus; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google Network Member</emphasis> properties revenue came in at $5.613 billion (up 12.5% year over year), in-line with the $5.557 billion expectation; revenue at <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google Other</emphasis>, which includes cloud services and other consumer businesses, was $6.487 billion (up 30.6% year over year) in the quarter against a $6.427 billion consensus; and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Other Bets</emphasis> , which covers businesses such as Waymo, Google Fiber, and Verily, reported an operating loss of $1.328 billion on $154 million of revenue. Even though total TAC was better than expected and paid clicks on Google Properties increased 66% year over year, investors didn't like how cost per click (a measure of ad prices) on Google Properties (declined 29% year over year. </p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BP</emphasis><br/></p><p>BP reported a strong top- and bottom-line beat with its fourth-quarter earnings results. Revenues of $76.885 billion exceeded the $62.61 billion consensus, while underlying replacement cost profit came in at $3.477 billion (+65% YoY), above consensus of $2.63 billion resulting in earnings of $1.04 per share. Underlying operating cash flows, which excludes post-tax Gulf of Mexico oil spill payments, were $7.1 billion. On the capital allocation front, BP announced a quarterly dividend of $0.615 per ADS (American depositary shares, the type of shares we own in the trust), expected to be paid on March 29, 2019. Additionally, the company repurchased 2 million ordinary shares in the quarter for a total cost of $16 million.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Viacom</emphasis><br/></p><p>On Tuesday, Viacom reported a mixed headline number with its fiscal first quarter earnings result. Revenues of $3.090 billion (up 1% year over year; 4% on constant currency) barely missed the consensus of $3.112 billion, and adjusted earnings per share of $1.12 (up 9% year over year; 13% on constant currency) exceeded estimates by $0.09. </p><p>At Filmed Entertainment, revenues increased by 14% year over year to $621 million (consensus $635.5 million), and the division posted a better than expected operating loss of $90 million. Paramount Pictures extended its streak to eight consecutive quarters of year over year adjusted operating income growth. At Media Networks, revenues declined 2% year over year to $2.498 billion (consensus $2.511 billion) and adjusted operating income was flat at $913 million. During the conference call, management provided an in-depth look on the Pluto TV acquisition, listing six key points on how the deal accelerates the company's overall strategy. As for guidance, management reiterated its full year 2019 guidance of total company revenue growth in the mid-single digits on a constant currency basis with growth at both domestic and international Media Networks as well as Filmed Entertainment. </p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Disney</emphasis><br/></p><p>Walt Disney Co. reported a solid top and bottom line beat with its fiscal first quarter earnings results. On the top line, sales of $15.303 billion outpaced expectations of $15.161 billion. On the bottom line, adjusted earnings per share of $1.86 (-36% YoY) breezed past expectations of $1.54 per share. Operating income was also better than expected. coming in at $3.655 billion versus $3.256 billion consensus.</p><p>Looking at Media Networks, sales of $5.92 billion (+7% YoY) came up short versus a $6.11 billion consensus. However, despite the segment revenue miss, segment operating income of $1.33 billion surpasses expectations of $1.075 billion as a 40% annual increase in Broadcasting operating income more than offset a 6% annual decline in Cable Networks operating income. At Parks, Experiences &amp; Consumer Products revenue of $6.824 (+5% YoY) edged out consensus of $6.819 billion while segment operating income of $3.655 billion blew past expectations of $3.256 billion. At Parks, Experiences &amp; Consumer Products revenue of $6.824 (+5% YoY) edged out consensus of $6.819 billion while segment operating income of $3.655 billion blew past expectations of $3.256 billion. Lastly, at Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) and International, sales of $918 million (+1% YoY) missed expectations of $979 million though we would note that results were impacted by an unfavorable 4% foreign currency impact. Additionally, while the segment is currently operating at a loss, results were better than expected coming at a loss $136 million versus expectations for a loss of $149 million. </p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Anadarko</emphasis><br/></p><p>After the closing bell on Tuesday, Anadarko Petroleum Corp. reported a disappointing top and bottom line miss with its fourth quarter earnings. Revenue of $3.35 billion (up 14.3% year over year) was shy of the $3.47 billion consensus, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.38 was well short of the $0.62 consensus. </p><p>Total production of 701,000 barrels of oil equivalent/d (BOE per day) was within management's previous guidance range of 674,000 to 728,000 BOE/d but was slightly below the 704,800 BOE/d FactSet expectation. As for pricing, Anadarko's average sales price per barrel of oil came in at $59.86, which is roughly 6% more than the same period in 2017. For Nat Gas, the average sale price per thousand cubic feet was $3.14, up 19% year over year. However, NGL was a drag on profits as the average sales price per barrel was $28.20, representing a decline of 20% year over year. Still, cash flow generation was sufficient to maintain management's shareholder return programs. There is still $1.25 billion remaining on the current buyback and $1.4 billion remaining on its debt retirement program. Lastly, even though the company is not entering 2019 with momentum, we remain encouraged with how management backed the 2019 outlook that was provided last November. </p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Economy</emphasis><br/></p><p>On Monday, the Commerce Department reported that new orders for manufactured goods (durable and nondurable) in November fell 0.6% to $499.2 billion. This followed a 2.1% decline in October and came up well short of expectations for a 0.3% monthly increase. As a reminder, this is a crucial reading as manufacturing is responsible for roughly 12% of the U.S. economy. Importantly, new orders of non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft (i.e., core capital goods) were down 0.6% in November, following a 0.5% advance in October and a 0.6% decline in September. The reading also missed expectations for a 0.1% monthly increase. Shipments for core capital goods also fell in November, pulling back 0.2%, missing expectations of a 0.1% monthly advance and coming off the heels of a 0.8% advance in October and a 0.3% drop in September.</p><p>Given the backwards looking nature of this November reading, we do not believe it to have had a significant impact on the week's action and view the data as serving to support the Fed's patient and cautious stance on further rate increases. While the U.S. economy is still expanding, it is clearly beginning to show cracks, no doubt resulting, at least in part, from the ongoing trade conflict with China.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that the non-manufacturing index (NMI), which tracks the service sector of the economy, fell 1.3 percentage points in January to 56.7%, missing expectations for a pullback to 57.1%, following December's 58.0% reading. The miss comes after last week's better than expected PMI report (  ), which came in at 56.6% vs. consensus of 54.0%. For perspective, over the past 12 months, the NMI has averaged 58.7% with a high of 60.8% and a low of 56.7%. See  for our full analysis. </p><p>On Thursday, the Department of Labor reported that initial jobless claims for the week ending February 2 were 234,000, a decrease of 19,000 from the previous week's unrevised level of 253,000. The reading came in 13,000 claims above expectations of 221,000. Importantly, the four-week moving average for claims (used as a gauge to offset volatility in the weekly numbers) was 224,750, an increase of 4,500 from the previous week's unrevised average of 220,250. The low rate of layoffs reflects a strengthening labor market as claims have remained below 300,000 -- the threshold typically used to categorize a healthy jobs market - for an incredible 205 consecutive weeks, the longest streak for weekly records dating back to 1967. The previous longest stretch ended in April 1970 and lasted for 161 weeks.

As a reminder, commodity prices and global growth expectations have been highly correlated as increased growth expectations lead to expectations higher crude demand in the future. Another factor impacting prices is the ongoing US/China trade dispute which has seen little progress and appears increasingly likely to intensify in the near-term as we rapidly approach the March deadline, which will see tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods rise to 25%, from 10% currently.</p><p>On the other side of the equation, working to support prices policies aimed at reducing the supply glut, including U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran, and OPEC led efforts to reduce output. </p><p>On the domestic front, on Wednesday, the U.S. Energy Information Agency (EIA), reported that in the week ending February 1, U.S. stockpiles (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) increased by 1.3 million barrels to 447.2 million barrels, a bullish reading versus analyst expectations for 2.2-million-barrel increase. Additionally, US production held steady at the record weekly high of 11.9 million bpd. Lastly, net imports decreased by 863,000 bpd as imports increased by 63,000 bpd, while exports increased by 926,000 bpd. See  for the full report.</p><p>Lastly, we note that the spread between WTI and Brent sits at roughly $9 per barrel. Recall, this is a key metric as the wider the spread, the more attractive US based crude (WTI) becomes to foreign buyers, though we note that strength in the dollar can offset this effect as foreign buyers convert their home currencies to the dollar.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stocks</emphasis><br/></p><p>In the portfolio this week, we  in Amgen  , buying back 25 of the 50 shares we had originally sold when the stock traded above the $200 level. </p><p>On the other hand, we  in PANW, locking in a gain following a very strong run from the mid-$160s.</p><p>Moving on to the broader market, we're in the heart of fourth-quarter earnings season and the results thus far have been relatively positive versus expectations with 70.0% of companies reporting a positive EPS surprise.

Per the report, the removal of such products resulted in a 20% to 25% hit to daily sales over the weekend. While we are calling this out as it is something we continue to monitor, we don't believe it to impact our overarching investment thesis as the company is already making moves to adjust to the new norm and we believe other aspects of the business remain unaffected for the time being, namely AWS and digital advertising growth.

Additionally, we believe profitability will continue to improve as AWS and advertising account for a larger portion of total sales as both these segments sport higher margins than the eCommerce operation. And while we believe the increasing share of revenue from these higher margin businesses will be key to driving profitability longer-term, we believe margins on ecommerce stand to improve as the company's infrastructure is further built out and economies of scale further kick in.

AI is what has made the company's Search, Video (YouTube) and targeted ad capabilities best-in-class and is the driving force behind the company's success in voice (Google Home) and autonomous driving (Waymo). Furthermore, we believe it is this AI expertise that will also make the company more prevalent in other industries, including healthcare via subsidiary Verily, as AI and machine learning continue to disrupt operations across industries. We believe Alphabet's willingness to invest in new areas, knowing most will fail, is a recipe for long-term success as while most \"  \" projects may fail, every once in a while, you end up with a Waymo, perhaps the division's, most successful graduate to date.

Another reason why we think the share price deserves a greater premium is because of management's emphasis on fee-based, or more recurring, revenue streams.

Furthermore, we value the company's international presence as it means a lessened exposure to North America, where new drilling activity remains limited.

Also on Monday,  that Apple may be at work developing technology that would allow for the entire screen to be Touch ID enabled. While this may seem unnecessary given that new devices now come face ID we see two reasons this addition may be useful; first, it simply provides for a Face ID alternative and second (to be clear we are speculating here), it could a be relatively seamless way of implementing two-factor authentication (two separate scans for the device to confirm the user and provide access). And while this may seem over the top, we believe it would make sense in scenarios involving health records and other sensitive data.

Services provide for a recurring revenue stream at higher margins, a factor that serves to reduce earnings volatility while allowing for a higher percentage of sales to fall to the bottom line, as a result, we believe that Services growth and the installed base, are much more important than how many devices the company can sell in a given 90-day period. In addition to improved profitability we also believe the transparent nature of this revenue stream will demand an expanded price-to-earnings multiple as segment sales grow. Furthermore, we believe that Apple's desire to push deeper into the healthcare arena will help make its devices invaluable as more life-changing features are added and the company works to democratize health records.

We believe the company's opportunities for upside rest with additional Libre uptake, the Alinity U.S. launch, and an expanded indication of the Mitraclip. We believe in CEO Miles White and the Abbott management team, who has a strong track record of integrating acquisitions and delivering double-digit earnings per share growth.

And while tariffs may pressure the supply chain, should they increase, we believe management is already taking steps to mitigate any potential margin pressure.

While companies may look to build out multi-cloud environments, Microsoft's Azure offering will be a prime choice thanks to the company's decision to provide the same \"stack\" used in the public cloud, to companies for their on-premise data centers. Additionally, we would note that hybrid environments are currently the preference for most companies because it allows them to maintain critical data in house while taking advantage of the agility and scalability provided by public clouds. Outside of the cloud opportunity, we maintain a positive view on the company's growing gaming business, which we believe is becoming an increasingly prominent factor in the Microsoft growth story as gaming becomes more mainstream, management works to convert its gaming revenue from one-time license purchase to a recurring subscription model and as technologies like augmented/virtual reality evolve. Finally, as it relates to LinkedIn and other subscription-based services such as O365 and various Dynamics products, we continue to value them highly for their recurring revenue streams, which we remind members, provides for greater transparency of future earnings.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Target Price</emphasis>: Reiterate $118;<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Rating: </emphasis>Two</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RISKS</emphasis>: Slowdown in IT spending, competition, cannibalization of on premises business by the cloud.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ACTIONS, ANALYSIS &amp; MORE</emphasis>:  ,  ,  ,  <br/></p><p><br/>Palo Alto Networks<br/></p><p>PANW; $224.62; 325 shares; 2.80%; Sector: Info.

We received several key earnings releases during the week, including Apple  , which had a positive impact on investor sentiment. Additionally, we received the all-important April U.S. nonfarm payroll numbers, which came in a tad light but benefited from a strong February revision and a move lower in the unemployment rate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Looking ahead, we continue to monitor what Jim Cramer calls the \"Three Ts\" -- Trump, Trade and Tariffs. These include ongoing U.S.-China trade negotiations, as well as President Donald Trump's decision (due May 12) on whether to continue abiding by the agreement designed to prohibit Iran from developing nuclear weapons.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields continue to bump up against the 3% mark, but have yet to hold above that psychologically important level. Gold ticked lower as the U.S. dollar strengthened relative to the euro. Lastly, oil pushed higher as it tried to take out the $70-per-barrel level.</p><p>First-quarter earnings season is also well underway, and results have so far been relatively positive vs. expectations. Within the portfolio, we heard not only from Apple, but also from Allergan  , Emerson Electric  , DowDuPont  and Magellan Midstream  .</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Allergan Earnings</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>AGN reported a first-quarter top- and bottom-line beats on Monday. Revenues rose 2.7% year over year to $3.67 billion, topping the consensus of $3.59 billion. Adjusted earnings per share of $3.74 (up 11.6% year over year) likewise exceeded the consensus of $3.35.</p><p>Management also raised full-year 2018 non-GAAP guidance to sales of $15.15 billion to $15.35 billion, and adjusted EPS to $15.65 to $16.25. But despite Allergan's strong results and raised guidance, shares came under pressure after CEO Brent Saunders provided a more cautious tone surrounding the company's potential breakup. After Jim's interview with Saunders on CNBC's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mad Money</emphasis>, we hold a more constructive tone to a possible breakup. We remain patient and hopeful that a larger announcement will occur down the road.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emerson Electric Results</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>EMR unveiled reported Tuesday that it beat analyst estimates on both the top and bottom lines of its 2018 fiscal-second-quarter results. Revenues of $4.25 billion (up 19% year over year) topped the consensus of $4.21 billion, and earnings per share of $0.76 (up 31% year over year) exceeded the consensus by $0.04.</p><p>In Automation Solutions, net sales of $2.77 billion beat expectations of $2.69 billion on strong demand for short-cycle repair and maintenance and a strong oil and gas market. At Commercial and Residential Solutions, sales missed vs. expectations due to softness in Climate Technologies. However, management expects demand to accelerate in 2018's second half. Lastly, management raised full-year EPS guidance to $3.10 to $3.20. The company also now expects full-year underlying sales to grow 7%, which represents the top end of previously communicated guidance.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple's Report</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>On Tuesday, Apple reported a top- and bottom-line beat with its fiscal second-quarter result. Revenues of $61.1 billion (up 15.5% year over year) topped the consensus of $60.98 billion, and earnings per share of $2.73 (up 30% year over year) exceeded consensus of $2.69.</p><p>The iPhone's unit sales of 52.2 million edged out what analysts were expecting, but total smartphone revenue of roughly $38 billion fell short of expectations. Offsetting this weakness was the company's Services segment, where revenue increased an impressive 31% year over year to $9.19 billion. In each of Apple's geographical segments, Services revenue grew a minimum of 25%. These strong results support our view that AAPL's fast-growing services business is the key to any pro-Apple thesis.</p><p>Chinese sales also increased by their largest rate in 10 quarters, which eased concerns that Apple products would be boycotted in the region. Lastly, the company announced that it would dip into its large cash pile to buy back $100 billion worth of stock.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DowDuPont's Release</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>DowDuPont beat analysts' top- and bottom-line estimates on first-quarter earnings Thursday. DWDP said revenues rose 5% year over year to $21.5 billion, which edged analysts' $21.42 billion consensus estimate. Adjusted earnings per share rose 7% from the same period last year to hit $1.12, beating the consensus by two cents.</p><p>In light of the noisy quarter in Agriculture, where some revenue will shift from the first to second quarter due to weather, it was a solid quarter for the company. For example, DowDuPont's Materials Science division's sales were $12.029 billion. Year over year, volumes increased 8%, local prices increased 5% and the company realized a 4% benefit from favorable currency rates.</p><p>In Specialty Products, sales were $5.597 billion. Year over year, volumes increased 3%, local price grew 2% and the division got a 4% gain from currency rates. DWDP said the division also enjoyed a 2% increase from \"portfolio actions/other.\" Lastly, the company achieved cost synergies from the 2017 Dow Chemical and DuPont merger faster than previously anticipated, while management remains on track with its timeline to eventually split DowDuPont into three.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Magellan Midstream Results</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>On Thursday, Magellan Midstream Partners reported a top- and bottom-line beat on its fiscal first-quarter results. On the top line, revenue of $678.78 million exceeded consensus of $675 million. On the bottom line, EPS adjusted to exclude mark-to-market commodity-related pricing adjustments and an unfavorable one-time pension correction came in at $1.05, surpassed analyst expectations of just $1.</p><p>Within Transportation &amp; Terminals (about 64% of total company sales), revenue of $431.9 million represented a 10% year-over-year gain, but missed analyst estimates of $441 million.</p><p>But in product sales (about 36% of total sales), revenue of $241.6 million (-1.64% YoY) easily beat out expectations of $218 million. Affiliate-management-fee revenue of $5.3 million also pushed past estimates of $4.4 million.</p><p>As for expansion projects, Magellan expects to spend roughly $950 million in 2018 and $425 million in 2019 to complete its current slate of construction. $100 million above prior guidance.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The U.S. Economy</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>The U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis reported Monday the month-over-month personal income rose 0.3% (or $47.8 billion) in March -- short of expectations of a 0.4% increase, but on par with February's reading. Personal disposable income also increased 0.3% in March, in line with February's rate.</p><p>Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased 0.4% (or $61.7 billion) month over month, also in line with expectations and an acceleration from February's flat reading. When adjusted for inflation, real PCE also increased by 0.4% monthly.</p><p>Notably, the PCE price index was flat in March, following a 0.2% increase in February. The Core PCE price index (which takes out food and energy to reduce month-to-month volatility) advanced 0.2% in March, in line with February's pace advance. More importantly, on a year-over-year basis, the core index is up 1.9%, in line with consensus following a 1.6% annual advance in February. Click <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/> for our full analysis.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Institute of Supply Management reported that the Purchasing Managers' Index decreased 2.0% in April to 57.3%, missing expectations of a pullback to 58.5%. For reference, the PMI has reached a high of 60.8% and a low of 55.5% over the 12 months ended April 30, averaging 58.4%.</p><p>The April reading follows March's 59.3% print and marks the 108 consecutive month of expansion in the overall U.S. economy and the 20<sup>th</sup> straight month of gains in U.S. manufacturing. In addition to the headline reading, the new orders index decreased 0.7% month over month to 61.2% (indicating a slower rate of growth). Production also contracted 3.8% to 57.2%, but prices for raw materials (an input for manufacturers) increased 1.2% to 79.3% (indicating growth at a faster pace). Lastly, the employment index declined 3.1% to 54.2%. Click <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/> for our full take.</p><p>On Wednesday, the ADP National Employment Report was released, indicating a 204,000 private-sector seasonally adjusted payroll increase for April, edging out expectations for 200,000 added jobs. However, offsetting the positive report, the organization downwardly revised March's reading to +228,000 from the +241,000 previously reported.</p><p>Within the goods-producing sector, the construction industry led the way, adding 27,000 jobs. This was followed by an increase of 10,000 jobs in the manufacturing industry and a gain of 7,000 jobs in natural resources/mining.</p><p>By business size, we saw gains across the board, with small businesses (one to 49 employees) adding 62,000 jobs, midsize businesses (50to 499 employees) adding 88,000 workers and large businesses (500+ employees) adding 54,000. See our full analysis <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>.</p><p>On Thursday, the Commerce Department reported that new orders for manufactured goods (durable and non-durable) increased in March for the seventh time in eight months, advancing 1.6% to $507.7 billion. The reading exceeded expectations of a 1.4% rise and came on the heels of a 1.6% increase in February. This is a crucial reading, as manufacturing is responsible for roughly 12% of the U.S. economy.</p><p>Shipments, which have increased in 15 of the last 16 months, gained another 0.4% to $502.8 billion in March, rising on the heels of a 0.2% February rise. Unfilled orders advanced for the sixth time in seven months, rose 0.8% to $1.1538 trillion following a 0.3% increase in February. Lastly, inventories, up in 16 of the last 17 months, added 0.3% last month to $677.3 billion after a 0.4% February increase.</p><p>Importantly, new orders of non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft (i.e., core capital goods) fell 0.4% in March. This follows a 1% increase in February, but a 0.3% pullback in January. Recall that capital goods aren't items sold to consumers, but are tangible goods used in manufacturing consumer goods. For this reason, the core-capital-goods level is a key metric that many consider a proxy for business investments. You can click <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/> for our full alert.</p><p>Also on Thursday, the Institute of Supply Management reported that the April Non-Manufacturing Index, which tracks the service sector of the economy, fell to 56.8%. That missed expectations of a pullback to only 58.1% from March's 58.8% reading.</p><p>This follows Monday's report on the manufacturing sector (see  ), which also missed expectations, coming in at 57.3% vs. 58.5% expected. For perspective, over the past 12 months, the NMI has averaged 57.6%, with a high of 59.9% and a low of 54.3%. Importantly, according to Anthony Nieves, chair of the Institute for Supply Management, \"the past relationship between the NMI and the overall economy indicates that the NMI for April (56.8%) corresponds to a 2.9% increase in real gross domestic product on an annualized basis.\" Click <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/> for our original analysis.</p><p>On Thursday, the U.S. Labor Department reported Thursday that initial jobless claims for the week ending April 28 were 211,000. That's +2,000 claims from the previous week's unrevised level of 209,000, but 14,000 below analysts' expectations of 225,000. (Claims-taking procedures in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico have yet to return to normal.)</p><p>Importantly, the four-week moving average for claims (used as a gauge to offset volatility in the weekly numbers) was 221,500, a decrease of 7,750 from last week's unrevised level of 229,250. That's the lowest four-week moving average dating back to March 3, 1973's 221,250.</p><p>The low layoff rate reflects a strengthening labor market, as claims have remained below 300,000 -- the threshold typically used to categorize a healthy job market - for an incredible 165 consecutive weeks. That's the longest streak dating back to 1967. The previous longest stretch ended in April 1970 after 161 weeks. For the official weekly release, see <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>.</p><p>Finally, on Friday, the Labor Department reported that the economy added 164,000 nonfarm jobs during April -- below expectations of 192,000 gains. Labor also downwardly revised March's reading to +324,000 from the +326,000 previously reported. However, the agency upwardly revised February's reading to +135,000 from the previous +103,000. With these revisions, job gains have now averaged 208,000 over the past three months.</p><p>Meanwhile, the U.S. unemployment rate fell to an 18-year low of 3.9% following six months at 4.1%. The latest reading is well below the Federal Reserve's 4.5% normal long-run rate.

Should Trump decide to reimpose sanctions on Iran, we could see an oil-price boost, as any reduction Iranian exports would further strain the global supply dynamic.</p><p>Compounding this are ongoing oil shortages in Venezuela and Angola. However, working against these dynamics is the strengthening dollar, which serves to make U.S. exports more expensive to foreign buyers.</p><p>On the domestic front, on Wednesday, the U.S.Energy Information Agency (EIA), reported that in the week ending April 27, U.S. stockpiles (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) increased by 6.2 million barrels, greatly missing expectations of a 739,000-barrel increase. Additionally, U.S. production increased by 33,000 barrels per day (bpd) to yet another weekly record at 10.619 million bpd.</p><p>Net imports increased by 263,000 bpd as imports increased by 80,000 bpd and exports declined by 183,000 bpd. Lastly, we note that the spread between West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude continues to hold at roughly $5 a barrel. Recall, this is a key metric, as the wider the spread, the more attractive U.S. WTI becomes to foreign buyers -- a factor compounded by the prolonged weakness in the dollar.

Regarding Textron, we see upside resulting from strength in the aerospace market and a recovery in the business-jet market. As for WestRock, we believe the rising adoption of e-commerce -- coupled with cost-input tailwinds -- will result in increased revenue and margin expansion.</p><p>We also added to our positions in PayPal  , 3M  , PepsiCo  , Emerson, DowDuPont and JPMorgan  , taking advantage of weakness to either lower our basis or (in the case of DowDuPont and PepsiCo) buy back shares originally sold at higher levels.</p><p>Additionally, we trimmed our stake in Nordstrom  , booking profits and freeing ourselves up to buy back the stock later on any material pullback. We also trimmed shares of Eli Lilly  following a nice post-earnings run for the shares.</p><p>Lastly, we took advantage of strength to close out our position in Magellan Midstream, in line with our \"Three\" rating on the stock. Although we believe MMP is the best among its peers, U.S. regulatory revisions to how much master limited partnerships can earn will make it much more difficult for them to maintain the distribution growth level that investors have become accustomed to. As a result, we think the market could apply a discount to the whole group.</p><p>See  to review our trade alerts in more detail.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stocks</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p>Moving on to the broader market, first-quarter earnings are underway and have so far been positive vs. expectations, with 79.5% of companies reporting a positive EPS surprise.

There were two small, company specific announcements this week, but neither were representative of why shares fell. on Wednesday, Japan granted national reimbursement for XIENCE Sierra, and on Thursday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the Advisor HD Grid Mapp Catheter. Our long-term thesis in Abbott relates to the robust amount of new medical devices that are new to launch and should contribute to strong organic sales growth in 2018. Included in this product list is the FreeStyle Libre, Alinity System, HeartMate 3, and the Confirm RX Insertable Cardiac Monitor. Furthermore, we expect Abbott's Established Pharmaceutical business to rebound two quarters from now that should help boost sales in the business. Lastly, the integrations of St. Jude Medical and Alere have been paying off for the company, and the company has a solid business in Nutrition. We reiterate our $65 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon  </emphasis>; $1,580.95; 100 shares; 6%; Sector: Information Technology</p><p>Shares of Amazon edged higher this week and outperformed the broader market. On Wednesday, it was reported that the company has begun offering retailers discounts on credit-card fees if they adopt the Amazon Pay service. Though this news is representative of Amazon's disruptive nature, as we wrote in our alert <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>, we do not believe they will lure merchants away from systems like PayPal. In other news, it was reported that Amazon has plans to offer new Whole Foods perks to Amazon Prime members. Amazon's commitment to its Flywheel via Prime subscriptions is one reason why the company has been and will continue to be so successful. Also, we remind members that Prime subscriptions will carry a new price tag of $119 per year, and the additional fees should directly improve the company's bottom line. Outside of subscriptions, the big profit boosters within the company is in Amazon Web Services and its advertising business. In the most recent print, AWS accelerated for the second quarter in a row, and Amazon's \"Advertising/other\" segment reached a record $8 billion annual run rate last quarter. To read more about last week's earnings report, please see our alert <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>. We reiterate our $1,850 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comcast  </emphasis>; $31.96; 2,400 shares; 2.91%; Sector: Consumer Discretionary</p><p>Shares edged higher this week thanks to a strong move on Friday into the weekend. We view shares as highly attractive at current levels for those that have either not initiated a position or are seeking to lower their cost basis as despite the stock weakness, company fundamentals remain solid thanks to a diverse revenue stream and sold free cash flows equal to roughly 100% of net income. Speaking to revenue diversity we cannot overstress the importance of this for a cable company in a world where \"cord cutting\" is on the rise; while this trend is occurring industry wide Comcast's X1 platform has proven \"stickier\" than others and its robust broadband offering has provided an offset for the cable weakness, a trend we believe will continue as subscribers increasingly move away from traditional Pay-TV to online streaming (and gaming) platforms that require high speed internet. Additionally, by offering several in-home services (plus Xfinity Mobile) Comcast can increase its average revenue per user by bundling its offerings. Lastly, with the weather improving we expect increased activity at the company's theme park locations. We reiterate our $45 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Darden Restaurant  </emphasis>; $92.83; 300 shares; 1.06%; Sector: Consumer Discretionary</p><p>Despite this week's move lower, we continue to see upside resulting from increased levels disposable income (resulting from wage inflation and tax reform) and improving weather conditions, two factors that we believe will prompt more family outings rather than ordering in or cooking at home. Helping to increase our conviction, we remind members that last week, we received positive results from both Chipotle Mexican Grill and Domino's Pizza and the March retail sales number indicated an uptick in sales at food services &amp; drinking places. We reiterate our $98 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DowDuPont  </emphasis>; $64.47; 1,375 shares; 3.36%; Sector: Chemicals</p><p>Shares of DowDuPont edged higher this week. On Thursday the company reported a very strong quarter and provided encouraging guidance that led us to upgrade our rating to a ONE as we bought shares <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">here</emphasis> (  ). Both Specialty Products and Materials Science produced strong sales and EBITDA growth, and the lagging nature of Agriculture was simply due to a season shift that will benefit the second quarter. The company also achieved faster than expected cost synergies, and we are optimistic that CEO Ed Breen will find opportunities to create additional synergies once each entity becomes more focused. To read more of our analysis from the quarter, please see our Alert here (  ). We reiterate our $85 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emerson Electric </emphasis><br/> ; $68.42; 1,100 shares; 2.85%; Sector: Industrials</p><p>Shares of Emerson Electric pushed higher this week and outperformed the broader market. The company reported its fiscal second quarter earnings on Tuesday, and it beat on both the top and bottom lines and raised full year earnings guidance. Furthermore, management expects full year underlying (organic) sales growth to come in at 7%, which was the top end of its previous range. CEO David Farr also gave an excellent conference call as he reiterated his conviction that they are not at the top of a business cycle, and this increased our confidence in our position. To read our analysis of the quarter and the highlights of the conference call, pleas see our alerts <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>. We reiterate our $80 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet </emphasis><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">; $1,051; 70 shares; 2.79%; Sector: Technology</emphasis><br/></p><p>Shares of Alphabet pushed higher this week and outperformed the broader market. On Monday, CNBC reported that the Google Cloud increased its share in the market by one percentage point to 6%. Despite the Google Cloud representing the lowest share out of the big 3 (AWS and Microsoft are the other two) we believe that there is plenty of opportunities to go around in this secular growing theme. We view Alphabet at its current levels as underappreciated because investors continue to sell the stock on fears of rising traffic acquisition costs and capital expenditures. Although these two trends have compressed margins, we believe they are for cause. Mobile advertisements are naturally associated with higher TAC, and this is just a price the company must pay because mobile ads have been a driver of Alphabet's impressive top line performance. Additionally, investors have shunned Alphabet's increased capital expenditures, and this is an opposite reaction to how other big tech companies have been viewed. We reiterate our $1300 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Goldman Sachs  </emphasis>; $234.94; 500 shares; 4.46%; Sector: Financials</p><p>Despite the prolonged weakness in shares, we continue to view the current environment, in which volatility has returned and interest rates are on the rise as highly favorable for Goldman Sachs. Speaking to volatility, we remind members that in the bank's most recent quarterly release, FICC (fixed income, currency and commodity) and Equity revenues increased 23% year over year and 38% year over year, respectively. As for rising rates and increased Fed activity, two factors we have increased confidence in following this week's Personal Spending report, which showed an acceleration of the core PCE price index to 1.9% YoY, slightly below the Fed's 2.0% target rate, we remind members of CFO, Marty Chavez's comments from the company's 4Q17 release that \"higher interest rates and more active central banks often correlate with higher client activity.\" We reiterate our $285 target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Honeywell</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>; $143.89; 850 shares; 4.64%; Sector: Industrials</p><p>Shares of Honeywell declined this week, though there was no company specific news that drove trading in either direction. One reason why we like this high-quality industrial is for its booming aerospace division that greatly exceeded expectations in the first quarter. Because organic growth was so strong (and part of this was due to a bounce back in business aviation), management increased its full year organic sales guidance well above previous indications. Also, the company's free cash flow performance is robust, and management is committed this year to using its funds on either merger and acquisition activity or a large buyback. Lastly, the company has an upcoming catalyst event through the spinoffs of its Transportation and Homes Business systems. We reiterate our $175 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Illinois Tool Works  </emphasis>; $145.47; 475 shares; 2.62%; Sector: Industrials</p><p>Shares bounced back this week on little news, in line with our belief that the post-earnings selloff had been somewhat overblown. We continue to like ITW and believe shares have begun to put in a bottom around the $140 level. As we noted last week, we view ITW to be a case of a broken stock, not a broken company and believe the post-earnings selloff to have been overdone, providing a buying opportunity, which is why we bought back shares following last week's release and doubled down the following day. Our positive outlook is due to a strong management that has successfully implemented the 80/20 business model, in which intense focus is placed on the 20% of products/customers responsible for 80% of sales/profits, and the company's significant revenue diversity, which we believe provides resilience despite weakness in any one or two end markets. We reiterate our $175 target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.  </emphasis>; $108.43; 700 shares; 2.88%; Sector: Financials</p><p>Despite weakness in the financials, we remain bullish on shares of JPM as we believe the stock to be disconnected from both company and macroeconomic fundamentals. Regarding firm fundamentals, we remind members that with its 1Q18 earnings release, the bank showed an improved efficiency ratio (operating expenses/revenue), a strong financial position with its CET1 ratio (which compares core equity capital to total risk-weighted assets) and a 4% annual increase in tangible book value compounded by a very strong 19% return on tangible common equity. As for the macroeconomic environment, we maintain that rising interest rates provide the ability to increase net interest margins (the spread between the banks cost of capital and what it charges to load out that capital) by generating higher returns on loans and the company's deposit base. Lastly, JPMorgan continues to maintain a \"fortress\" balance sheet that we believe deserves a premium given the increased difficulty of this year's Fed CCAR (\"stress\") test, something we believe may prove to be the next major catalyst allowing strong banks such as JPMorgan to shine and push higher. We reiterate our $130 target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kohl's  </emphasis>; $63.10; 1,000 shares; 2.39%; Sector: Consumer Discretionary</p><p>Shares pushed higher this week despite a slight miss on the March Personal Spending report. In addition to tax reform, investments in technology and an increase in disposable income leading higher levels of shopping activity, we have also suggested that the company's partnership with Amazon, in which select locations feature the Amazon Smart Home Experience and Amazon lockers, would result in increased foot traffic. Backing this view, analysts at Gordon Haskett noted this week that, \"based on the analysis, the KSS/AMZN partnership seems to be overwhelmingly accomplishing the goal of driving incremental traffic to Kohl's stores.\" According to the analyst, those stores with Amazon features have drawn in more customers and led to an 8.5% outperformance over other stores as customers coming in for Amazon-related reasons are indeed staying to look around and shop. We believe the success here could lead to further expansion of the partnership and thus increased same-store-sales, a key metric when analyzing retailers. We reiterate our $74 target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3M  </emphasis>; $199.36; 525 shares; 3.97%; Sector: Industrials</p><p>Following last week's selloff, shares of 3M stabilized and pushed higher. Helping shares find support was an upgrade to \"Outperform\" by analysts at RBC Capital. A large theme of the upgrade was based on 3M's levels representing an \"attractive entry point for one of the highest-quality Multi-Industry names.\" In the note, the analysts wrote, \"While 3M's 1Q18 operating miss and 2018 guidance cut contrasted unfavorably to the parade of beat and raises this earnings season, we heard no overly-concerning, incrementally new negatives that would justify this severe sell-off.\" This view echoes our analysis that we wrote in our alert <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>, and we reiterate our $250 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nucor  </emphasis>; $62.94; 800 shares; 1.91%; Sector: Industrials</p><p>With shares bouncing firmly off of the $60 level, we remain bullish on shares of Nucor, believing there to be a disconnect between the company (and industry fundamentals) and the stock. Backing this view, we remind members that during the company's most recent conference call, management called for earnings to \"increase significantly\" in the second quarter thanks to the recently implemented steel import tariffs designed to clamp down on dumping from overseas. Lastly, we remind members that while the company beat earnings on both the top and bottom lines in first quarter release, the tariffs were not signed into law until March, i.e. the real benefits are yet to come. We reiterate our $75 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PayPal  </emphasis>; $73.99; 1,200 shares; 3.37%; Sector: Technology</p><p>Despite this week's slight move lower thanks to news that Amazon would be looking to push deeper into the digital payments space (see <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>), we continue to like PayPal as it provides exposure to the red-hot eCommerce space (with core PayPal and Venmo seeing increased merchant adoption) and person-to-person payments without the need to choose a specific ecosystem (as core PayPal/Venmo is available on all major platforms, and online) or credit card provider such as Visa or Mastercard. Furthermore, with mobile payment volumes increasing 52% YoY and Venmo still in the initial stages of monetization we continue to see longer-term upside, especially as the company pushes into emerging markets where mobile adoption still has plenty of room to run and where many consumers prefer digital payment options that eliminate the need to carry cash. Lastly, there is management's push to increase services for the \"underbanked,\" a factor that serves to increase the company's total addressable market. We look forward to learning more on Saturday during our <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>, where we will be hosting a conversation with CEO Dan Schulman. We reiterate our $90 target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PepsiCo  </emphasis>; $98.99; 650 shares; 2.44%; Sector: Consumer Staples</p><p>We view the selling in PepsiCo, which has brought the stock down to nearly a 3.8% dividend yield and only 17x earnings to be overdone, which is why we used the weakness to increase our stake <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>, buying back shares that we originally sold much higher. Like our view on ITW and GS, we view this to be another case of a stock being disconnected from company fundamentals and attribute a good portion of the selling to the fact that the consumer packaged-goods group have recently fallen from favor. However, as we noted in our trade alert, we expect PEP to rebound as the group's pressures abate and believe the current risk/reward profile to be highly advantageous. We continue to believe that the Frito-Lay division provides for a strong offset to North American Beverage weakness and has been a key factor allowing the company to maintain its 2+% organic revenue growth profile. We reiterate our $130 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Raytheon  </emphasis>; $202.54; 400 shares; 3.07%; Sector: Industrials</p><p>Shares remain under pressure despite relatively positive earnings last week as the defense sector has fallen out of favor, however, have found strong support at just under $200 per share. And while we are itching to add to our position, we are remaining disciplined waiting for a move below our lowest buy of roughly $196 per share. Despite the weakness, we remain bullish on shares as defense spending is on the rise both at home and abroad. Furthermore, while some of the pressure may be a result of apparent peace talks with North Korea, turmoil in the middle east remains high and could heat up even further as we approach President Trump's deadline for a decision on the Iran deal. We reiterate our $232 target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Constellation Brands  </emphasis>; $221.28; 375 shares; 3.15%; Sector: Consumer Staples</p><p>Shares of Constellation Brands pulled back from recent highs and sharply declined this week. Sparking some of the selling was disappointing numbers by Molson Coors Brewing (TAP) who cited \"weak US Industry conditions.\" Though this hurt TAP, we believe that STZ's beers sales represent a different consumer base. Whereas TAP appeals to drinkers of more value-style beer, Constellation Brands uses a premiumization strategy for its beverages, and they have been highly successful in this strategy. Furthermore, Constellation is leveraged towards Hispanic-style beers, and with a heavy advertisement campaign into this Saturday's Cinco de Mayo underway, we expect big sales numbers from the holiday. Lastly, we think that Constellation's investment in Canopy Growth Corp. represents a play on the cannabis industry, and the company plans to rollout related products if it cannabis becomes fully legalized in the US. We reiterate our $247 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Textron  </emphasis>; $63; 600 shares; 1.43%; Sector: Industrials</p><p>Shares of Textron pushed higher this week and outperformed the broader market. With shares down roughly 5% from recent highs, we called this stock up from the bullpen on Wednesday. The key part of our thesis relates to the company's strong exposure to the aerospace market, and more specifically, the recovering business jet market. But Textron makes more than just business jets. The company has a strong helicopter business, they are the makers of specialized vehicles, and they also providing innovating solutions in defense. To read more from our initiation, please see our alert <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>. We reiterate our $72 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">United Healthcare Group  </emphasis>; $235.90; 200 shares; 1.79%; Sector: Healthcare</p><p>Despite this week's move lower, we continue to like shares of United Healthcare for its defensive nature and lack of China exposure. While we remain optimistic on the macroeconomic environment and believe job growth is working to increase the company's customer base as new employees register for benefit plans, we also like that should conditions weaken, health benefits are one of the last things to be cut as other discretionary purchases will be eliminated first. Furthermore, we continue to believe that the company has a competitive advantage in the space due to its ownership of both UnitedHealthcare (the benefits side) and Optum (the services side) allowing for improved efficiencies and a more in-depth understanding of both customer needs and the healthcare business in general. We reiterate our $260 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">WestRock  </emphasis>; $59.41; 750 shares; 1.69%; Sector: Materials</p><p>Shares of WestRock moved lower this week and underperformed the broader market. We pounced on the recent double-digit pullback on Friday as we initiated a position for the portfolio. As we wrote in our initiation <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>, we believe the company represents a play on e-commerce through the shipping boxes it produces. Furthermore, input costs are expected to decrease next quarter as the company is a beneficiary of lower recycling commodity prices. Lastly, the company has a visible catalyst in its upcoming acquisition of KapStone <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>. This deal will increase the company's footprint in the US, and will be immediately accretive to earnings. We reiterate our $75 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cimarex  </emphasis>; $97.31; 675 shares; 2.49%; Sector: Energy</p><p>Shares of Cimarex fell this week and underperformed the broader market. Shares continue to underperform despite rising crude prices due to a production mix that has less oil that what the market prefers. However, Cimarex is expected to become more levered towards oil in the back half of the year. Furthermore, we like management's return-based approach to production as this strategy has allowed Cimarex to remain profitable during times where the industry was challenged. Lastly, we will hear from the company next Tuesday after the closing bell. Current consensus is $564 million of revenue and $1.75 earnings per share. We reiterate our $150 price target.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Twos</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple  </emphasis>; $183.83; 450 shares; 3.14%; Sector: Technology</p><p>Shares of Apple greatly pushed higher this week and outperformed the broader market. On Tuesday the company reported its fiscal second quarter results, and the strong earnings washed away the analysts (us included) who feared the quarter would be weak. The concern into the print was that iPhone X sales would disappoint, however, Apple sold 52.2 million units which was better than expected. Also, the big talk of the quarter was the impressive revenue growth in Services-the key to our thesis. Apple's sales were also strong internationally, and we were greatly encouraged with China's 21% year over year revenue growth-the highest level of growth in 10 quarters from that region. The company announced a new shareholder friendly $100 billion share repurchase program. We view this massive buyback as a signal that management views the stock's recent woes as a long-term buying opportunity. Lastly, the stock got a boost on Friday when Warren Buffett said that Berkshire Hathaway  ,  bought 75 million shares of Apple in the first quarter. To read more of our analysis for the quarter, please see our alert <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Citigroup  </emphasis>; $67.94; 950 shares; 2.45%; Sector: Financials</p><p>Despite this week's move lower, we continue to like Citigroup and are keeping a close eye on shares as they continue to approach the banks tangible book value. Recall, on a price-to-tangible book value basis, Citigroup is the cheapest of the big banks. In addition to valuation, we like Citigroup as management continues to progress toward its 2020 earnings per share target of $9 and has already reached its 11% return on tangible common equity target, hitting 11.4% in the most recent quarter. Furthermore, we believe shares will continue to see support from management's initiative of returning $20 billion to shareholders this year and in 2019. Lastly, we continue to value the bank for its strong financial standing as the Fed has guided for this year's CCAR test to be materially more difficult than in the past. We reiterate our $80 target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Danaher  </emphasis>; $100.20; 950 shares; 3.61%; Sector: Life Sciences</p><p>Danaher stock dipped lower this week and underperformed verse the broader market. There was no news from the company this week, but on Monday, analysts from Credit Suisse released a report with takeaways from a recent visit to corporate headquarters. Overall, they remain bullish on Danaher, and they noted that M&amp;A could occur in the near term. It was reported last week that Danaher had approached GE's Life Sciences business (something we speculated could happen  could happen, and we think a deal for this strong unit at the cash strapped GE would be a win for Danaher. Outside of Life Sciences, we remain patient that DHR's Dental business will trough and stabilize, and the analysts at Credit Suisse said that management thinks pressure in distribution dynamics should abate in the second half the year. We reiterate our $114 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook  </emphasis>; $176.61; 475 shares; 3.18%; Sector: Technology</p><p>We continue to like shares of Facebook and believe management to be taking the correct steps so as to rebuild user trust, including this week's announcement at the company's F8 developers conference where CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the company had hired outside lawyers (that are well respected by congress) to monitor and clean up on any bias. Also, on the privacy front, management announced the \"Clear History\" feature, which will allow users to see information about the apps and websites they've interacted with, prevent the information from being stored with one's own account and remove identifying marks. That said, while the company will allow for the removal of identifiable data, it will still maintain and provide aggregated analytics to developers. We believe this to be a strong middle ground allowing for increased privacy while still allowing the Facebook platform to maintain online advertising dominance via targeted placements. Other announcements include the launch of FaceDate, the company's new dating platform and the launch of Oculus Go, the company's standalone virtual reality (VR) platform. Recall, in addition to improved security and increased video content, we believe the push into VR will be a strong catalyst for growth. The Oculus Go specifically stands to benefit from a relatively low entry price and the fact that it does not require any additional hardware, to factors that we believe differentiate it significantly from other VR platforms currently on the market. We reiterate our $220 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Eli Lilly  </emphasis>; $78.40; 1,000 shares; 2.97%; Sector: Healthcare</p><p>Shares of Eli Lilly fell this week and underperformed the broader market. We got ahead of the big decline this week on Monday as we sold shares and downgraded the stock to a TWO because we felt the recent rally was due for a pullback, and we wrote about this in our alert <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>. Despite this pressure this week, we believe that Eli Lilly's diabetes franchise is too underappreciated relative to the strength of Trulicity, which continues to gain market share. Furthermore, we like the company's optionality with its Elanco Animal Health business, and current commentary suggests that a spinoff is likely. This outcome carries more upside than what a straight asset sale has, and we reiterate our $93 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nordstrom  </emphasis>; $49.49; 1,800 shares; 3.38%; Sector: Consumer Discretionary</p><p>Despite our still positive outlook on shares, we decided to book profits this week as the stock had advanced over 10% in as many days and we felt we were being greedy by not trimming into such a move. Additionally, by trimming shares, we have increased our optionality moving forward and freed up space to buyback shares should they move lower on news unrelated to the company or stock. Despite the sale, we reiterate that we are longer-term bullish on shares as NYC Men's store is now open for business (with another location set to open next year) and EBIT as a percentage of sales is expected to improve thanks in part to significant technology and omnichannel investments. We reiterate our $60 target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft Corp.  </emphasis>; $95.16; 1,000 shares; 3.61%; Sector: Technology</p><p>Despite trending lower this week on little news, we remain bullish on MSFT as Azure continues to grow at a strong pace and stands to continue to benefit from the company's transition to cloud services. In addition to the cloud, which benefits from a competitive edge in the hybrid cloud space and the largest global footprint of public cloud providers, we also see upside resulting from the continued growth of LinkedIn and the mainstream adoption of gaming, which will benefit the company's Game Pass initiative and thus further feed cloud growth. We reiterate our $110 target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nvidia  </emphasis>; $239.06; 150 shares; 1.36%; Sector: Technology</p><p>We remain bullish on shares of NVDA due to the company's exposure to three strong secular trends including video gaming, the cloud (data centers), and autonomous driving. Additionally, while we reiterate that it is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">not</emphasis> a reason to buy <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">or </emphasis>sell the stock, Nvidia has also been benefiting from demand for cryptocurrency mining chips. Regarding video games, the largest portion of Nvidia's business, in addition to increased mainstream adoption, we see multi-year upside resulting from the rapid progress of virtual reality platforms and the coming era of augmented reality, two trends that will require intense graphic processing capabilities. We look forward to learning more next week when the company reports earnings on Thursday, after the closing bell, where we will be looking for revenue of $2.89 billion with earnings of $1.45 per share. We reiterate our $250 price target and will reassess following the release.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Schlumberger  </emphasis>; $68.79; 1,300 shares; 3.39%; Sector: Energy</p><p>We remain bullish on Schlumberger as management has guided for increased global E&amp;P production related investment activity (US companies included) in the near future due to a lack of investments in prior years, a factor that is now catching up to them. Additionally, with oil prices holding in the upper 60s, with the potential to go higher should the OPEC/Russia production cut be extended, or we see any supply chain disruptions (such as the one we are seeing in Venezuela) we believe E&amp;Ps could speedup investments so that production issues do not prevent them from taking advantage of the higher prices. On that note, we remind members that Saudi Arabia is highly motivated to see higher prices because it is both seeking to IPO its state-backed oil company, Saudi Aramco and needs to increase government revenue to support economic reform initiatives and the ongoing war in Yemen. We reiterate our $93 target.</p><p><br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Threes</emphasis><br/><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Allergan  </emphasis>; $149.30; 100 shares; 0.57% Sector: Healthcare</p><p>Allergan's shares fell sharply lower this week. On Monday, the company reported its first quarter earnings result, and the story was not about how Allergan beat expectations and raised full year guidance. Instead, the focus was on commentary about the potential of a breakup as CEO Brent Saunders provided a more patient and lukewarm tone. This immediately caused widespread selling which we are protected against due to our minuscule \"spec\" position. But after further digesting the commentary and the quarter, we are now under the impression that Allergan needs time to clean up its balance sheet with its improving cash flows in order to seriously consider a breakup. We reiterate our $200 price target.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSCJIM-14580372</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSCJIM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S86-P6C1-JCHV-V000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">420086</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8297\"/><timeReceived>7:58 PM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc.

As a reminder, we will be hosting our monthly members only call on Wednesday of next week at 11:30am and will begin taking questions on Monday. To see how to access the call, please read our Alert  .</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Treasury yields moved higher as investors moved out of bonds to kick off the new year. Gold prices also increased while the euro advance relative to the dollar. Lastly, oil trended higher as we've begun to see global supply and demand start to balance out and a geopolitical risk premium come back into play.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Third-quarter earnings are complete and were relatively positive vs. expectations. No portfolio companies reported this week.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Economy</emphasis><br/></p><p>On the economic front, markets were closed on Monday for New Year's day and there were little macroeconomic news released Tuesday, despite the markets getting off to a very strong start to start the year.</p><p>On Wednesday, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that the purchasing managers' index (PMI), which measures the economic environment within the manufacturing sector, advanced 1.5% in December to 59.7%, surpassing expectations of a flat monthly move from November's 58.2% reading. This marks the 103rd consecutive month of expansion in the overall economy and the 16th in the manufacturing sector. Furthermore, according to ISM Manufacturing Business Survey Committee Chair, Timothy R. Fiore, \"The past relationship between the PMI and the overall economy indicates that the average PMI for January through December (57.6%) corresponds to a 4.5% increase in real gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualized basis. In addition, if the PMI for December (59.7%) is annualized, it corresponds to a 5.2% increase in real GDP annually.\" See our alert  .</p><p>On Thursday, the ADP National Employment Report was released, indicating a 250,000 private-sector payroll increase for the month of December, and greatly exceeding expectations of 190,000 jobs added. This was the strongest monthly reading since March. However, it was slightly offset by a downward revision of November's reading to up 185,000 from up 190,000 previously reported. With this, 2017 private-sector payrolls as reported by ADP increased by 2.54 million, or roughly 212,000 jobs per month on average. See our alert  .</p><p>Also on Thursday, the Department of Labor reported that initial jobless claims for the week ending December 30 were 250,000, an increase of 3,000 claims above the previous week's upwardly revised level of 247,000 (revised up from 245,000) and 10,000 claims above expectations of 240,000 initial claims. Claims taking procedures in the Virgin Islands continue to be disrupted while procedures in Puerto Rico have yet to return to normal. Importantly, the four-week moving average for claims (used as a gauge to offset volatility in the weekly numbers) was 241,750, an increase of 3,500 from last week's upwardly revised level of 238,250 (revised up from 237,750). The low rate of layoffs reflects a strengthening labor market as claims have remained below 300,000 -- the threshold typically used to categorize a healthy jobs market - for an incredible 148 consecutive weeks, the longest streak since 1970. For the official weekly release, please see  .</p><p>On Friday, the Labor Department reported that the economy added 148,000 jobs during the month of December, below expectations of 190,000. In addition, employment figures were revised for the months of October and November. October's total nonfarm payroll employment decreased to 211,00 from 244,000, and November's number increased to 252,000 from 228,000. Between the two revisions, total jobs decreased by 9,000. Over the last three months, on average, nonfarm payrolls have increased by 203,666. Coming in at 4.1 %, unemployment was unchanged for the third straight month. This level remains the lowest the economy has seen since December 2000, and is below the Federal Reserve's normal long-run rate of 4.6%. The labor force participation rate (which accounts for the number of Americans looking for work or currently working) held constant at 62.7%, which is unchanged over the month and year. A different, broad measure of unemployment and underemployment, known as the U-6 -- which accounts for those working part-time because they are unable to fund full-time work -- was 8.1%. This represents a tick up from last month's reading of 8.0%. See our alert  .</p><p>Also on Friday, the Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reported that the December non-manufacturing index (NMI), which tracks the service sector of the economy, declined more than expected, falling from November's reading of 57.4% to 55.9%, below expectations of a rise to 57.6%. This follows Wednesday's report on the manufacturing sector, which beat expectations, coming in at 59.7% vs. expectations of 58.2%. See our alert  .</p><p>Lastly, he Commerce Department reported that new orders for manufactured goods advanced in November for the fifth time in six months, increasing 1.3% to $488.1 billion, after gaining 0.4% in October (revised up from the 0.1% decline previously reported). The reading exceeded expectations of a 1.1% monthly gain. This is a crucial reading, as manufacturing is responsible for roughly 12% of the U.S. economy.</p><p>Shipments, which have increased in 11 of the last 12 months, increased 1.2% to $491.2 billion on the heels of a 0.8% rise in October. Unfilled orders also advanced for the third consecutive month, ticking up 0.1% to $1.137 trillion after rising 0.1% in October. Lastly, inventories, up in 12 of the last 13 months, gained 0.4% last month, rising to $665.1 billion following a 0.3% increase in October.</p><p>Importantly, new orders of non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft (i.e., core capital goods) fell 0.2% in November. This follows a 0.8% increase in October. Recall that capital goods are not sold to consumers, rather they are tangible goods used in the manufacturing of consumer goods. For this reason, core capital goods is a key metric that many consider to be a proxy for business investments. See our alert  .</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oil</emphasis><br/></p><p>On the commodity front, oil sustained above the $60 level this week as the Forties pipeline in the North Sea and the Libyan pipeline responsible for transporting crude to the country's Es Sider port came back online. However, working to support oil prices are the ongoing production cuts by OPEC, which were previously extended to the end of this year, and anti-government rallies in Iran, which is the 3<sup>rd</sup> largest member of OPEC based on production and proven reserves (as of 2016). That said, while Iranian supply disruption fears are certainly on the minds of industry experts, Iranian industry and shipping sources have not reported any disruptions resulting from the protests. Geopolitical unrest is also something seen in Venezuela (OPEC's 6<sup>th</sup> largest member in terms of production and the largest in terms of proven reserves) and parts of Africa (six of OPEC's 14 members are from the African continent). Looking back to comments made by Schlumberger's (SLB) CEO Paal Kibsgaard on the company's third-quarter earnings call, it appears Kibsgaard's prediction for a return of a \"geopolitical risk premium,\" and a lessening of an \"oversupply discount\" are playing out as expected. This is a perfect example of why when Schlumberger's management speaks, investors listen.</p><p>Also working in favor of commodity prices is the frigid winter weather, which has increased demand for heating oil and natural gas, and an ongoing elevated level of demand internationally, namely from China. On that note, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported, in the week ending Dec. 29<sup>th</sup>, that domestic crude production rose by 28,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 9.78 million bpd. However, despite the rise in production, inventories (excluding the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, an emergency reserve held underground in Louisiana and Texas by the US Dept. of Energy) declined by 7.4 million barrels as weekly crude exports, increased by 265,000 bpd to 1.475 million bpd. While international demand is certainly a key factor raising export levels, we also note that the U.S. is benefiting in particular due to the ongoing spread between WTI and Brent, which is still hovering at roughly $6/barrel.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stocks</emphasis><br/></p><p>In the portfolio this week, we bulked up on our Honeywell  position, adding 100 shares on weakness following \"soft downgrade\" from analysts at RBC Capital Markets based on valuation. Despite this, we are not deterred, especially given management's history of \"UPOD\" -- under promising and over delivering. We believe that expanding margins across all key segments and exposure to strong industrial end markets like aero and defense set the company up for success this year on earnings. See out trade alert  .</p><p>Also, this week, we booked profits in Broadcom  , Nucor  , Apache  and DXC Technology  . Although we continue to believe in the Broadcom story for its iPhone chip production and its play on 5G wireless, we feel that given the strong move higher it was prudent to take profits and downgrading the shares to a Two based on current valuation. Regarding Nucor, we felt it sensible to book profits as the company's struggle to hit on earnings makes this stock always eligible for a pullback and much of the recent move is based on anticipation of the 232 investigations (clamping down on steel dumping from overseas) and President Trump's infrastructure plans. As for Apache, learning from our past missed opportunities, when Apache makes a run like it did this past week, it is important to sell a little bit into the rally as slow developments in the Alpine High have limited the stock's rise. With DXC, the stock is approaching our $100 price target and we decided to trim our stake based on valuation. However, we are leaving the lion's share of our position on the table as we believe that DXC still has upside, even above our target, should the stock hit on its upcoming catalysts.</p><p>See our AVGO trade  , Nucor and Apache trades  and our DXC trade  .</p><p>Lastly, we exited our position in XPO Logistics  with an excellent realized gain of over 28% that occurred in about a month and a half. We continue to believe that XPO Logistics remains an excellent play off the rise in e-commerce delivery. However, after shares spiked over 17% since the beginning of speculation that either Home Depot  or Amazon  will offer a bid, we have become more cautious in that earnings will no longer be the next catalyst for the stock. Instead, it may take a bid for shares to move another leg higher, and with ongoing silence about a potential deal from all the reported parties, we believe it was best to lock in this gain and raise some cash for the start of the year.</p><p>Moving on to the broader market, third-quarter earnings are complete and were largely in line with expectations, with 74.4% of companies reporting a positive EPS surprise. Total third-quarter earnings growth has increased roughly 7.8% year over year vs. expectations for an overall 7.73% increase throughout the season; of the 433 non-financials that reported, earnings growth is up 10.9%. Revenues are up 5.5%, in line with expectations throughout the season for a 5.5% increase; 74.4% of companies beat EPS expectations, 17.0% missed the mark and 8.6% were in line with consensus. On a year-over-year comparison basis, 73.6% beat the prior year's EPS results, 23.8% came up short and 2.2% were virtually in line. Information Tech, Financials and Consumer Staples have had the strongest performance vs. estimates, whereas Utilities and Telecom have posted the worst results in the S&amp;P 500 for the third quarter.</p><p>Next week, 7 companies in the S&amp;P 500 will report earnings.

Additionally, the most important news of the week came on Thursday, when Abbott announced that it had received Medicare approval for the Freestyle Libre, the company's continuous glucose monitoring system. With this, patients can be reimbursed up $250 per month for the device. While were anticipating approval at some point in the first half of 2018, the news comes earlier than expected and could ultimately result in an upside surprise to full-year sales and earnings. We reiterate our $61 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Activision Blizzard</emphasis><br/> ; $66.37; 1500 shares; 3.35%; Sector: Technology -- Shares started off the year on a strong note as the company closed out 2017 with the top two game franchises on consoles, with Call of Duty: WW2 (CoD) taking the top spot and Destiny 2 coming in second place. Furthermore, Destiny 2 was officially biggest PC launch in the company's history. With the release of these two top earners behind us, our focus turns to the official launch of the Overwatch League, with \"Stage 1\" set to begin next week, Wednesday January 10<sup>th</sup>. Recall, this has been a key factor in our investment thesis as we believe Activision will ultimately lead the way in eSports thanks largely to the league's strategic investors. Furthermore, going back to CoD and Destiny 2 for a moment, while the initial game sales are largely factored in, we continue to see upside as record buying will lead to additional sales throughout 2018 as gamers opt for downloadable content (DLC) and other add-on purchases. Longer-term, our optimism is reinforced thanks to the industry-wide shift to digital full-game downloads (not to be confused with downloadable content) as this will serve to further expand margins while decreasing the size of the secondhand market, forcing would be used game buyers to buy new. We reiterate our $68 target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Allergan</emphasis><br/> ; $172.29; 700 shares; 4.06%; Sector: Healthcare -- Shares bounced back this week following a bout of selling into the end of 2017 as investors sold stock to realize losses and offset taxable gains. Because of this dynamic, where the year's biggest losers see last minute selling into the year's end, we increased our stake last week, believing that any fundamental reason to sell the stock had already been accounted for and that shares we already view as too cheap had only gotten cheaper. In addition to our purchase, we upgraded Allergan to a One, as we believe that with 2017 now in the rearview mirro, shares will be able to gain traction as tax harvesting is no longer an issue. As we noted in our trade alert (  ), we believe little has changed in terms of company fundamentals since publishing our Sum-Of-The-Parts (SOTP) analysis (  ) and maintain that share price has simply become disconnected, at current levels, from the actual worth of the company itself. Shares caught a nice rally this week when the company announced its follow through on employee restructuring to cut down on costs. We look forward to hearing from CEO Brent Saunders when he presents at JP Morgan's annual Health Conference on Monday, Jan. 8 and are optimistic that he will be able to reasure investors that operations and outlook are strong while refocusing attention on the business itself and away from recent negative headlines and loss of Restasis exclusivity (a product we eliminated from our SOTP analysis). Lastly, we expressed our confidence in Botox during our  We reiterate our $242 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apple</emphasis><br/> ; $175; 700 shares; 4.13%; Sector: Technology -- Shares pushed higher this week, outperforming the overall market. We continue to see upside to shares as we believe iPhone X demand remains strong, particularly in China. Furthermore, as a result of this view, we believe Apple stands to benefit from a higher average selling price thanks both to the iPhone X's $1,000 starting price and the fact that base models for iPhone 8 are priced higher than comparable models of older iPhones. That said, while we realize that near-term the focus will be on iPhone sales, we maintain that the longer-term driver to shares is growth within the company's Services business. Recall, this segment benefits from an increased user base (regardless of which device users own) and brings with it a recurring, transparent revenue stream with higher margins that the overall business. The higher margins are key as this will aid in expanding overall company margins as it grows to become a larger portion of total revenue. We reiterate our $190 target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comcast </emphasis><br/> ; $41.04; 2000 shares; 2.77%; Sector: Consumer Discretionary -- Shares moved higher this week but underperformed the overall market. We continue to see upside to shares as Comcast stands to be a major beneficiary of tax reform. Recall, the company has traditionally been taxed at an effective rate of approximately 35%, making the new 21% rate significantly accretive to earnings moving forward. In addition to the new tax rate, Comcast will be able to further monetize user data due to the FCC's recent repeal of net neutrality. Furthermore, we believe the company's strong free cash flow generation and business diversity will allow it to weather any headwinds resulting from a shift in customer trends, most notably the move away from cable (i.e. cord cutting) to streaming services. However, that said, we note that the company's X1 platform has proven \"stickier\" than other cable offerings as it effectively combines the new with the old, allowing for seamless transition between traditional pay TV and OTT streaming. Additionally, the company's strong broadband offering allows it to offset cord cutting as higher-definition streaming and gaming content ultimately means an increased demand for high speed internet. We reiterate our $45 target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Danaher </emphasis><br/> ; $94.71; 1000 shares; 3.19%; Sector: Life Sciences -- Shares pushed higher this week, however, slightly underperformed the broader market. We continue to see upside to shares as previous acquisitions begin working their way into the core portfolio. As a reminder, these past acquisitions, including Pall and Cepheid bring with them higher growth rates than the overall business, making their successful integrations accretive to the company's growth rate overall. Furthermore, we believe issues that have plagued the company's dental division, namely end-market destocking has finally bottomed and as a result, we see upside as this division recovers in the new year. Because of these dynamics (a recovery in dental and an integration of past acquisitions) we remain confident that management will be able to attain their guidance of 3.5%-4.0% organic revenue growth this year. Additionally, with past acquisitions becoming fully integrated and the company able to tidy up its balance sheet, we believe we could see a resurgence of M&amp;A activity, something we believe will further aid shares in pushing higher this year. We reiterate our $104 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DowDuPont </emphasis><br/> ; $75.42; 1375 shares; 3.49%; Sector: Chemicals -- Shares of DowDuPont greatly traded higher this week and finally broke above the low $70s. As we discussed in Thursday's  , the stock has been \"stuck in the mud\" so to speak with its break-up storyline, and we believe that this eventual catalyst needs patience. We have great faith in CEO Ed Breen, who did a terrific job creating value at Tyco, and we expect the same for DowDuPont. Since Dow Chemical and DuPont joined forces, the merged entity DowDuPont has been re-aligning in preparation for three, or potentially four, spinoffs. The current plan is to split into an Agriculture, Specialty Products, and a Materials company, and through the whole process, the company will generate billions in synergies, and the eventual spun companies are expected to trade at different, yet higher multiples compared to the company as a whole. Lastly, to pay for our patience, the stock yields a solid 2% that we believe is more than adequate. We reiterate our $85 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">iShares MSCI EMU Index ETF</emphasis><br/> ; $45; 1000 shares; 1.52%; Sector: Europe -- With major European economic indicators firing on all cylinders this week, shares advanced, outperforming the S&amp;P 500. This is the only ETF in the portfolio and was chosen to fulfill our desire to increase overall portfolio exposure to both the European market and the euro currency. Recall, we gain currency exposure as this is an unhedged ETF (as opposed to the HEZU, a hedged version of the EZU). We decided a passively managed ETF would be the best way to achieve these dual goals without possibly being tied to a specific company or sector that may lag the overall recovery taking place in Europe. Additionally, we selected the EZU over other European based ETFs as it has minimal exposure to the U.K., a region that we decided to avoid given uncertainty resulting from Brexit. Lastly, despite the nice gain we've had since initiating the position, we reiterate our One rating as we believe shares can continue rising on the back of upbeat growth estimates out of the European Central Bank (ECB). As a reminder, in the ECB's final policy meeting of 2017 (in the second week of December), the bank increased eurozone economic growth estimates from 1.8% (originally forecast in September) to 2.83%. Given that this is an ETF encompassing over 200 companies, we will not have a price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook </emphasis><br/> ; $186.85; 1000 shares; 6.30%; Sector: Technology -- Facebook's shares got their groove back this week, and greatly outperformed the broader markets. On Wednesday Variety reported how Facebook, and some other tech names, have been gaining market share of advertising revenue from traditional content and media companies. A sign that Facebook is increasing its share in the market is a positive signal that the company's revenue growth likely will increase, especially as the company finds ways to improve the community experience. On Thursday, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that his challenge for 2018 is to fix Facebook's abuse issues. Last earnings call, he spoke about how important it was for Facebook to keep its members protected from abuse as he called the for the need of heavy investment. When we heard this, our memory of similar comments on investment immediately jumped in our minds, and despite the \"investment year\" label which is often a kiss of death, Facebook's shares increased about 53.3% for the year. We believe that investment and breakthroughs in artificial intelligence will lessen the amount of people needed for Facebook to monitor, and is why we are not too concerned about either costs or content. Looking ahead, we believe that Facebook will continue to increase its community audience, with the only thing likely to limit growth being perhaps the amount of people with internet access in the world. We expect to see content improvements this year through the company's investment in video, and even virtual reality, allowing Facebook to grow as a product. We reiterate our $195 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">First Data Corp</emphasis><br/> ; $17.4; 3500 shares; 2.05%; Sector: Technology -- After a strong rally on Friday, shares of First Data Corp ended the week higher and outperformed the broader market. On Friday, Credit Suisse labeled FDC \"the most interesting value paly in the payments space\", which in our view is likely because its de-leveraging story will ultimately allow the stock to participate in multiple expansion. The bullishness in FDC's stock is also present by analysts at Barclays, who said on Wednesday that the recent acquisitions of CardConnect and BluePay will help the company position itself as \"a key player in the integrated payments and eCommerce space\". Barclays also sees GBS North America growth to inflect moving through 2018 (despite a challenged fourth quarter and first half), which if successful, we believe will allow FDC to move its valuation in-line with its peer's. We reiterate our $21 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alphabet </emphasis><br/> ; $1110.29; 150 shares; 5.61%; Sector: Technology -- Shares of Alphabet rocked higher this week and broader outperformed the broader market. On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Alibaba's (BABA) is surpassing Google Chrome as the top browser in some fast-growing markets in Asia. Although a negative, we do not believe this hurts the fundamental story of the company. Later on this week, similar to what we said with Facebook above, Variety reported that Alphabet has been increasing its market share of advertising revenue. Advertising revenue is critical to the company's search revenue stream, but we believe that through investment in Alphabet's Google Other products, and Other bets, the company is becoming much more than a company that relies of search advertising. Also, The Information reported that Google Cloud is working on \"major\" upgrades to voice and video. The report said that the upgraded service is to position Google Cloud to compete with Microsoft's (MSFT) Skype. Also that day, Reuters reported that Google is exploring a possible sale of its U.S. restaurant review guide Zagat, which is really just a small non-core asset. On Friday, the company announced that it had made an investment in a Chinese e-sports streaming startup. Although the investment is small, the investment boosts the company's investment in Asian startups. Finally, on Friday, the company said in a blog post that \"we sold more than one Google Home device every second since Google Home Mini started shipping in October.\" This statement is a strong signal that the Google Other segment and its ecosystem of products is growing. As we mentioned above, while Alphabet's search revenue has been downright dominant, we believe that the company is becoming diversified beyond that. Investments in the cloud and AI has helped the company develop additional revenue streams, and we believe that the industry leading autonomous driving technology company Waymo is being heavily undervalued by the market. Lastly, we are also <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">raising our price target to $1200</emphasis> to reflect continued growth and optimism in the name.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Honeywell</emphasis><br/> ; $155.58; 500 shares; 2.62%; Sector: Industrials -- Although underperforming against the broader market for the week, shares of Honeywell finished higher on Friday. On Wednesday, analysts from RBC Capital Markets gave Honeywell a \"soft downgrade\", citing that the stock's 2017 run has tempered expectations for 2018. Opposite of our view, the analysts believe that the breakup catalyst is priced into shares, and they said that expectations have \"ratcheted\" higher after management provided conservative 2018 guidance. We further discussed Honeywell in our Daily Rundown  , and we took advantage of the weakness  to our position that day. In addition to the company's breakup, expanding margins and organic growth in key segments increases our conviction that Honeywell will extend its all-time highs. Also, with a clean balance sheet, we think there is a good chance that the company pursues a merger and acquisition opportunity to beef up the core assets that will remain post-breakup. We reiterate our $175 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Illinois Tool Works</emphasis><br/> ; $166.03; 550 shares; 3.08%; Sector: Industrials -- Shares of Illinois Tool Works dipped slightly this week. With shares trading at their all-time highs, we admit that we were not completely surprised to see a firm downgrade the stock on valuation. This came on Thursday when analysts at BMO Capital said that the stock \"has reached a tipping point for meaningfully better profitability.\" We contend that management's guidance of 8% to 10% EPS growth for the five-year period of 2018 to 2022 should support higher valuations. Additionally, management guided that free cash flow of 100+% of net income during the same period, and they expect the dividend payout ratio as a percentage of free cash flow will increase to 50% from 43% by 2020. Lastly, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">we are increasing our price target slightly to $178</emphasis>, which represents roughly 22.5x consensus 2019 earnings, and we feel is achievable based on management's guidance that did not include the benefits of tax cuts.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">JP Morgan Chase</emphasis><br/> ; $108.34; 200 shares; 0.73%; Sector: Financials -- Shares of JP Morgan traded higher this week, but underperformed compared to the broader market. Backed by confidence in the economy, the stock roared higher to begin the week, only to give up some gains Friday after a soft jobs report. Overall, it was a solid week for the stock that we will look to further build out when near our initial cost basis. We initiated a position in this financial last week because we believe that the rising interest rate environment and economic expansion will help the company deliver strong earnings per share growth. In fact, JP Morgan's earnings power is why we have this name rated a ONE, compared to Citigroup (C), which we feel is more value oriented. To re-read our initiation from last week, please see our Alert  . Lastly, next week is a major one for the company as CEO Jamie Dimon will be speaking on Tuesday, and the company will report fourth quarter earnings on Friday. We reiterate our $120 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Magellan Midstream Partners</emphasis><br/> ; $72.45; 1900 shares; 4.64%; Sector: Energy -- Shares climbed higher this week, but slightly underperformed verse the broader market, as oil maintained its move above the $60 level on the back of increased geopolitical tension. With WTI reaching its highest closing price level in roughly three years and the spread between WTI and Brent sustaining at roughly $6/barrel, we continue to see several reasons MMP benefits. First, higher WTI prices encourages upstream companies in the Permian to continue producing at record levels, leading to an increased need for midstream services to transport crude products to refineries, or ports for export. Second, because of the ongoing WTI-Brent spread, foreign countries will continue to demand WTI over Brent as it is roughly 10% cheaper at current levels. As a reminder, to take advantage of both of these dynamics (elevated production levels and increased demand abroad), MMP is building out two new pipelines, a marine storage facility in Pasadena, Texas and an Aframax dock in Houston (recall, Aframax ships can carry 500,000 to 700,000 barrels of crude). Additionally, while the company's cash backed distribution may become slightly less striking in a rising interest rate environment, we would argue that when added to the company's growth potential, MMP remains an attractive name for those looking for both energy exposure as well as income. We reiterate our $89 target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Microsoft </emphasis><br/> ; $88.19; 1100 shares; 3.27%; Sector: Technology -- Shares of Microsoft pushed higher this week and outperformed the broader market. On Wednesday, it was reported that the company and Amazon (AMZN) missed a deadline to integrate Cortana and Alexa. Previously, the companies said that the two digital assists integrated functionalities would be available in 2017, and on the missed deadline, a Microsoft spokesperson told Paul Thurrott (who reported the miss) that \"We'll have more to share soon.\" Also this week, after it was reported that Intel (INTC) chips have suffered a security flaw, Microsoft said that they expect to release a patch fixing the issue for Windows by next Tuesday. We continue to expect Microsoft shares to move higher due to growth in the cloud. With roughly $132 billion eligible for repatriation under the new tax cut rules, the company should have plenty of ammo to spend on either investment to beef up its offerings, or shareholder returns which are already compelling for a big tech company. We reiterate our $94 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Schlumberger</emphasis><br/> ; $73.6; 1500 shares; 3.72%; Sector: Energy -- Shares rallied this week as we've witnessed a number of CEO Paal Kibsgaard predictions (from the company's third-quarter earnings call) come to fruition. Recall when the company released earnings (see  ), Kibsgaard noted that in the past, oil prices have benefited from a \"geopolitical risk premium,\" a factor that was largely been replaced by an \"oversupply discount\" in 2017. However, with the supply/demand dynamic slowly coming into balance, and rising tensions in several oil-producing regions (now including Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran and Venezuela), Kibsgaard explained that we would likely see the risk premium return, which we clearly are given oils sustained move above the $60 level. In addition to this prediction, Kibsgaard also stated that OPEC would likely extend their production, something we also saw become a reality since the earnings release. Along with these two dynamics coming into play, we see further upside to shares due to Kibsgaard's third prediction from the call, when he noted that because of extraordinarily low investment levels into production capabilities of regions outside of North America, the Persian Gulf and Russia we would likely see a \"medium-term global supply challenge, and increasing the urgency for higher investment.\" We believe this dynamic will play out and lead to an increased demand for Schlumberger's services. Lastly, with President Trump discussing the possibility of opening of offshore drilling in California and Florida, we believe that Schlumberger would be in the immediate running for servicing these platforms. We reiterate our $93 target and note this is exactly why when Schlumberger management speaks, we listen.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Waste Management</emphasis><br/> ; $87.99; 950 shares; 2.82%; Sector: Industrials -- Shares of Waste Management increased this week, but slightly underperformed the broader markets. On Wednesday, the company received a favorable upgrade by analysts at Macquarie, raising their price target to $114 from $79 (note that price targets at other firms will often differ from our own). The analysts believe that the company will have \"a structurally higher free cash profile\". As members can  , the company increased its baseline FCF figure which in turn, lead to the 9.4% increase to the quarterly dividend and the $1.25 billion buyback program. Macquarie views this latest step change as not only sustainable, but also with room for improvement due to the benefits of tax reform. We discussed how Waste Management benefits from tax cuts in our Daily Rundown video  . One last point worth mentioning is that the additional benefits from the Hurricane Cleanup will boost Waste Management's revenues in either the fourth quarter, or the first quarter of 2018, representing a strong support for guidance. Lastly, while our current price target is $91, this value does not reflect our increased earnings expectations from tax cuts and we will likely raise estimates when management provides full year 2018 guidance.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">TWOS</emphasis><br/></p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Arconic </emphasis><br/> ; $29.61; 2000 shares; 2.00%; Sector: Industrials -- Shares of Arconic pushed higher this week and greatly outperformed the broader market. This week's rally was driven by a Wells Fargo analyst Outperform initiation on Thursday. The analyst gave the stock a $35 price target (note that price targets at other firms will often differ from our own), stating that the company's free cash flows will improve on moderated spending, and also margins in-line with peers should drive earnings growth. Higher costs hurt margins last quarter and caused a distinct pullback in the stock, and we believe that under the leadership of incoming CEO Chip Blankenship, Arconic will do a better job managing costs associated with the engine ramp. We reiterate our $31 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Apache </emphasis><br/> ; $46.39; 1600 shares; 2.50%; Sector: Energy -- Shares surged higher this week as oil sustained its move above the $60 level. With infrastructure continuing to be built at Alpine High and take away capacity being put in place to take crude out of the Permian for transport to refineries or for export to Mexico and abroad we believe the overarching picture of the U.S. oil industry is materially improving. Furthermore, while we have trimmed our position in recent weeks, we continue to see upside as the company has worked to reduce and all-in costs and stands to benefit from the WTI-Brent spread that has served to make WTI increasingly more attractive to foreign buyers. We reiterate our $60 target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Broadcom</emphasis><br/> ; $271.62; 200 shares; 1.83%; Sector: Electronics -- Shares pushed higher this week, outpacing the overall market. We continue to like AVGO as we believe iPhone X demand worries to be overblown (recall, Broadcom develops 8 chips in the new devices) and see multiple drivers for the name long-term. Within wireless we believe the pending upgrade of wireless networks will aid shares of AVGO as Broadcom creates radio frequency chips that will be necessary for mobile devices to connect to the new 5g networks. On the wired side, we believe an increasing demand for high speed data (largely because of increased demand for streaming services and online gaming) benefits Broadcom as the company has a number of offerings that address last-mile bottlenecks that occur when internet providers deliver service to end customers, solutions that will likely become more highly demanded as average internet speeds increase over time. Outside of these larger industry trends, we are keeping a close eye out for any updates regarding Broadcom's attempt at acquiring Qualcomm (QCOM) and will update members as we learn more, but we do note that the ongoing fight is will likely tie up shares in the interim. Long-term, however, we reiterate our $290 target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cimarex Energy</emphasis><br/> ; $127.82; 600 shares; 2.58%; Sector: Energy -- Shares pushed higher this week, in line with the move seen in commodity prices. With oil holding above the $60 level we believe XEC can continue climbing higher from current levels as Cimarex is the best operator in the Permian with the fastest growth. Further backing this belief is management's previous efforts to reduce costs via field-wide automation and a strict policy of operating within free cash flows, ensuring that the company will be able to continue generating strong cash flows even should oil prices pullback. We would also note that there has been a notable shift in domestic investor appetites, with a heavier focus being placed on a company's ability to operate within free cash flows, making Cimarex a strong option for those looking to U.S. increase energy exposure. Lastly, with the WTI-Brent spread holding at roughly $6/barrel, Cimarex stands to benefit as WTI remains the attractive choice for foreign buyers. We reiterate our $150 target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Citigroup </emphasis><br/> ; $75.41; 1050 shares; 2.67%; Sector: Financials -- Shares pushed higher this week however, underperformed the overall market. Our outlook on Citigroup remains unchanged as the bank stands to benefit from both the unwinding of the Fed's massive balance sheet, which will aid in raising long-term interest and a strengthening domestic economy which serves to back the Fed's desire of raising interest rates multiple times this year. On that note, while expectations vary, we expect the Fed will ultimately raise rates 3-4 times in 2018, barring any surprise readings on inflation, GDP or the job market. Furthermore, thanks to the banks strong international exposure, we see upside resulting from the global economic expansion, which, depending on the country, likely has more room to run compared to the U.S. Compounding these macroeconomic tailwinds, we believe shares will rise in 2018 as management progresses on their indicatives of attaining 11% return on tangible common equity and $9 earnings per share by 2020 while returning $20 billion to investors both this year and in 2019. We reiterate our $80 target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DXC Technology</emphasis><br/> ; $100.63; 800 shares; 2.71%; Sector: Tech Services -- Shares of DXC Technology greatly moved higher this week and outperformed the broader markets. With shares creeping towards our price target,  shares on Thursday. Boosting the stock this week was a favorable note from Barclays about IT Services. The firm listed \"upside to synergies, appreciation around its 30% capital return, further financial engineering, and possible line of sight toward organic revenue growth from a mix-shift\" as ways the stock can push higher. We believe that the upcoming spin of the US Public sector business represents a value creating opportunity, and in addition to cost synergies, growth in digital should benefit the company's overall numbers. We reiterate our $100 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Eli Lilly</emphasis><br/> ; $86.57; 1000 shares; 2.92%; Sector: Healthcare -- Shares of Eli Lilly traded higher this week, in-line with broader market. On Friday, the stock was upgraded by analysts at Argus. They believe that the \"new product launches, expanded indications for existing drugs, and potential regulatory approvals as catalysts for growth in 2018\". We also view the upcoming strategic decision on Eli Lilly's Elanco Animal Health business as a potential catalyst opportunity. Morgan Stanley discussed the value of Elanco on Friday, and we are in agreement that if the business is spun, it will trade at a discount to Zoetis (ZTS), but should still create value for shareholders. We see that decision by mid-2018, plus Eli Lilly's recently launched and pipeline growth story, as reasons to believe the stock can reach our $93 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">General Electric</emphasis><br/> ; $18.54; 2450 shares; 1.53%; Sector: Industrials -- Shares of General Electric got off to a hot start this week, increasing about 6.25% and outperforming the broader market. While we cannot ignore how disappointing 2017 was for the company and the stock, we believe that this week's move was driven by investors flooding back into the stock in a \"January\" effect type move, but more importantly, higher commodity prices. As we have explained before, we believe that through structural changes like the sale of Finance and purchase of Power and Baker HughesGE (BHGE), General Electric has transformed into an energy company \"in drag\". With higher commodity prices, the company's cash flows should improve and find some support. Although this week's rally has been a strong sign of encouragement, we want to see more transparency of the company's cash flows, something we expect CEO John Flannery to address next earnings call. We reiterate our $21 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">KeyCorp</emphasis><br/> ; $20.33; 2000 shares; 1.37%; Sector: Financials -- Shares trended higher this week, however, lagged the overall market as they have been met with resistance at the $21 level. Despite this, we believe shares will ultimately push higher as the macroeconomic environment continues to shift in favor of the financials. Recall longer-term rates stand to benefit from the unwinding of the Fed's balance sheet, while investors expect the Fed to raise shorter-term rates multiple times this year. From a firm-specific standpoint, we remind members that the bank expects to realize an additional $50 million in cost savings from the integration of First Niagara early this year. Furthermore, we see upside as operations become more efficient due to investments in enhanced digital offerings such as mobile banking and as the company looks to alter its revenue mix to include more stable, fee-based categories. Lastly, we believe that with the improving economy, the investment banking division will continue to strengthen and remind members that it has recently benefited from the acquisitions of Pacific Crest (technology expertise) and Cain Brothers (healthcare expertise). We reiterate our $21 target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nucor </emphasis><br/> ; $67.86; 1100 shares; 2.51%; Sector: Industrials -- Shares pushed higher this week, outperforming the overall market. We believe the recent rally in shares is a result of both the ongoing 232 investigation, which is expected to clamp down on steel imports from overseas and in anticipation of details on President Trump's infrastructure plan. Recall the 232 investigation is key as countries such as China have dumped significant amount of cheap steel in the U.S., undercutting domestic producers and pressuring margins. As for the infrastructure plan, simply put, increased infrastructure development will lead to a higher demand for steel products. Should both of these dynamics plat out as expected, Nucor stands to benefit as it will be able to expand margins while demand increases. That said, we have trimmed our position slightly on the recent strength as we note that the company's struggle to hit on earnings makes this stock always eligible for a pullback. We reiterate our $75 target. </p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NVIDIA </emphasis><br/> ; $215.4; 200 shares; 1.45%; Sector: Technology -- Shares surged this week as investors once again piled into this industry leadings GPU maker. While Tuesday's move can partially be attributed to a beaten down share price into the end of 2017 and a broad-based market rally on the first day of trading in 2018, Wednesday's strong move higher came on the back of a positive Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) report on Monday evening. According to the report, which members can view  , worldwide semiconductor sales hit an incredible $37.7 billion in monthly sales (the highest-ever) in November, representing a 21.5% jump from the same time last year and a 1.6% increase from October sales of $37.1 billion. The report further increases our conviction that the tech revolution is in full force and we maintain that Nvidia is at the forefront as its GPUs are needed for everything from gaming to data centers and artificial intelligence to tauons vehicles. Also this week, Nintendo announced that the Switch has become the fastest selling home-video game console in the U.S. of all time. The chips that make the Switch go are made by Nvidia, and this is one of many examples which prove that this company is more tied to Gaming, as well as the data center and artificial intelligence, compared to cryptocurrency. Lastly, CEO Jensen Huang will be the keynote speaker at the CES conference on Sunday. We expect his commentary to be in its typical visionary class, and we would not be surprised to see the stock move higher off the news. We reiterate our $220 price target.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NXP Semiconductors</emphasis><br/> ; $118.05; 550 shares; 2.19%; Sector: Technology --Shares remain unable to breakout meaningfully as result of Qualcomm's $110/share tender offer. We maintain that the current offer undervalues the company and reiterate that we will not tender shares at that price level. Further backing this view, analysts at RBC, referencing the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) report (mentioned above regarding NVDA) released earlier this week, noted that semiconductors tied to the automotive industry were showing stronger than normal demand, with year over year revenue growth of 16.5%, compared with normal seasonal growth of 11.5%. This is important as one of the reasons we believe it would be more beneficial for Qualcomm to raise its offer (rather than walk away completely) is that in addition to still being able to realize synergies, the company would gain increased exposure to the auto industry, which, as indicated above, is itself going through a technological revolution. Despite our belief that shares are worth more than what QCOM has offered, we reiterate our $110 target pending any updates from either Qulacomm or NXPI.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PepsiCo</emphasis><br/> ; $118.67; 500 shares; 2.00%; Sector: Consumer Staples -- Shares are once again meeting resistance at the $120 level. However, despite this, we maintain that shares will push higher in the new year as management addresses past missteps in shelf allocation and as the company once again returns 2% organic revenue growth. Additionally, we like PepsiCo over others in the beverage industry due to their meaningful investments into snacks via the Frito-Lay division as this segment has significantly aided in offsetting beverage industry pressures in the last year. Lastly, from a portfolio management perspective, we maintain that diversification is key and holding a staple such as PEP brings an added level of both diversity and stability to the overall portfolio. We reiterate our $120 target and our Two rating, which we will reevaluate once a return to 2% organic revenue growth has been confirmed by management.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TSCJIM-14439367</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSCJIM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RBV-5951-F00X-J1XT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">420086</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8635\"/><timeReceived>6:46 PM EDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 TheStreet.com, Inc.

And I am recording from Phnom Penh, Cambodia, where I have just set my alarm to wake up early enough to watch the Washington Nationals beat the Astros in the World Series. This podcast was recorded at...             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SUSAN DAVIS:                 1:04 p.m. on Friday, October 25.             </p><p>KAREN RIVERA:                 Things may have changed when you listen to this podcast. For example, I will no longer be waiting but instead celebrating the Nationals' victory. Have a great day. Enjoy the podcast, and thank you very much.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF THE BIGTOP ORCHESTRA'S \"TEETER BOARD: FOLIES BERGERE (MARCH AND TWO-STEP)\")                </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 That is dedication. I didn't know the Nationals had such loyal fans.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 Well, she was right about the last game, so let's hope she's right about the next one.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Go sports.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 (Laughter) Hey there. It's the NPR POLITICS PODCAST. I'm Susan Davis. I cover Congress.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 I'm Tim Mak. I also cover Congress.             </p><p>RYAN LUCAS:                 I'm Ryan Lucas. I cover the Justice Department.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 And I'm Domenico Montanaro, senior political editor and correspondent.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 So late last night, we found out that the Justice Department's review of the origins of the Russia probe has now become a criminal investigation. Ryan, what's going on?             </p><p>RYAN LUCAS:                 Well, that's a very good question. There are not a lot of details on this. We do not know when this change took place. We don't know what prompted it. We don't know what potential criminal wrongdoing investigators are looking into. Those are all very important questions.             </p><p>                But the fact that this is now a criminal investigation, what that means is that the team that is looking into the origins of the Russia investigation can impanel a grand jury. They can issue subpoenas to compel people to come in and testify and also to turn over documents. So those are important powers. And also, they could potentially bring criminal charges.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 So, Ryan, what were they originally looking at?             </p><p>RYAN LUCAS:                 So they were looking at the origins of the Russian investigation and to essentially determine whether U.S. intelligence agencies, including the FBI, the CIA, did anything wrong, abused their powers in the early stages of the Russia investigation and looking at ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 So this is not the first investigation to try and examine the origins of the Russia investigation. The inspector general at the Justice Department - right? - has looked into this. The Senate Intelligence Committee has been looking into this. And there's never been - so far it sounds like - any suggestion that there was criminal behavior based on other investigations.             </p><p>RYAN LUCAS:                 Well, we are waiting for the inspector general to issue a report. He has been looking for more than a year now into allegations of potential surveillance abuses of the Trump campaign during the election, looking into several other matters tied to the election as well. Republicans have put a lot of stock in that investigation. They are certainly waiting for that to come out.             </p><p>                And then you have the Senate Intelligence Committee, which has interviewed more than 200 people who were involved in drawing up the intelligence community's assessment of Russian interference in 2016. They have talked to basically everyone who is involved in doing that. And they came to the conclusion that the intelligence community's assessment was correct. They agreed with it. And importantly, they also didn't find anything that they flagged as raising concerns about how that investigation and what they were looking at was conducted.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 You know, the timing of this has raised a lot of eyebrows, too, right?             </p><p>RYAN LUCAS:                 Right.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 We are deep into now an impeachment inquiry and very likely an impeachment process that goes from the House over to the Senate. And so it almost seems like counterprogramming to a lot of the things that'll be coming out in the coming weeks and months as Democrats try to make the case that the president has done something wrong with regards to the Ukrainian government.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 And this is validating for the president to now be able to say I am right to be concerned about it; there's a criminal investigation going on.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Yep. It gives him fodder. You know, it's really been an obsession of his, this impeachment inquiry. He's going to continue to talk about it. And he's been looking for something, anything to kind of hang his hat on. And here you go.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 There is no - it's worth noting that there is no public evidence that there was wrongdoing at any point in the origins of the investigation into the - into President Trump or Russia or any of those matters. If there was some wrongdoing, the public is not aware of it.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 It's been a consistent suspicion, stated suspicion of the president, that there were players in the government out to get him, and that he is wanted to find out who those players were and that it was part of some broader conspiracy.             </p><p>RYAN LUCAS:                 Right. And I have spent a lot of time talking to members of the Senate Intelligence Committee who have looked at all of the evidence that has been gathered by U.S. intelligence agencies. They've looked at how that evidence was handled. They have interviewed the people involved. And nobody - Republican, Democrat - has said to me yes, I have significant concerns that authorities were abused, powers were abused, that U.S. intelligence agencies abused their power in any way, shape or form towards the Trump campaign.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 There is no timeline on investigations. But I would note that in politics, investigations on Capitol Hill or otherwise often carry on through an election cycle. And we don't know how long this investigation will go on. But it does stand to reason that this is now going to be a factor in the already highly politicized environment of the 2020 campaign, the Russia question and the impeachment investigation.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Right. And for Trump, he just needs something to be able to say, you know, here's something for the base to rally around, to - so that they can use it as fuel for 2020 and be able to say this is still part of the witch hunt, the hoax that came out of the Russia-Mueller probe, and that they're fighting back now.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 All right, we have to leave it there. Ryan, I know you have to go. Thanks so much.             </p><p>RYAN LUCAS:                 Thank you.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 All right, we're going to take a quick break. And when we get back, we're going to talk about Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on Capitol Hill this week.             </p><p>                All right, we're back. And we're going to talk about Facebook, but before we do that, we should note that Facebook is one of NPR's sponsors. And we are one of the news outlets in their news tab. And joined now by Asma Khalid. Hey, Asma.             </p><p>ASMA KHALID:                 Hey, Sue.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 So we're going to talk about the congressional hearing. But before we get to that, I just want to focus on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. Asma, he has made a lot of headlines in the 2020 presidential race already.             </p><p>ASMA KHALID:                 That's right. And part of that is because he's been in a pretty public spat with Elizabeth Warren, who's been running for president. She's one of the leading contenders at this point. Months back, she announced a plan to essentially break up big tech companies like Facebook. And obviously that doesn't sit well with him. She's also been pretty critical of the idea that Facebook doesn't have fact-checking in its ads that it has online. And to make this point recently, she actually put up a fake Facebook ad that said that Mark Zuckerberg supported Donald Trump for president to try to prove this point.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 So this issue of fact-checking political ads was very much the issue at hand on Capitol Hill this week, right, Tim?             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 That's right. Here's, for example, some tape from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez grilling Mark Zuckerberg.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ:                 Do you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of fact-checking on political advertisements?             </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:                 Well, Congresswoman, I think lying is bad. And I think if you were to run an ad that had a lie, that would be bad. That's different from it being - from it - in our position, the right thing to do to prevent your constituents or people in an election from seeing that you had lied.             </p><p>ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ:                 So we can - so you won't take down lies, or you will take down lies? I think this is just a pretty simple yes or no.             </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:                 Congresswoman...             </p><p>ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ:                 I'm not talking about spin, I'm talking about actual...             </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:                 Yes.             </p><p>ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ:                 ...Disinformation.             </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:                 In most cases - in a democracy...             </p><p>ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ:                 OK.             </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:                 I believe that people should be able to see for themselves what politicians that they may or may not vote for are saying...             </p><p>ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ:                 So you won't take them down.             </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:                 ...So they can judge their character for themselves.             </p><p>ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ:                 So you won't take - you may flag that it's wrong, but you won't take it down.             </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:                 Congresswoman, it's - it depends on the context that it shows up.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 How'd that go over, Tim?             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Well, not well. I mean, he was there supposedly to talk about Libra, which is this cryptocurrency that Facebook is hoping to launch. But, you know, members of Congress have a lot of reasons to be upset with Facebook and to question Mark Zuckerberg on a number of issues, most of which center around this idea that Facebook has gotten too powerful. I mean, they are grilling Mark Zuckerberg about whether politicians are permitted to lie in ads, whether Facebook as a platform is vulnerable to foreign interference and disinformation, and whether it's doing enough to stop discrimination in its advertising. All of these issues are coming at Mark Zuckerberg.             </p><p>                They're still trying to launch this cryptocurrency, by the way. They're trying to do all sorts of initiatives. But they're really finding this big challenge in all the different questions that members of Congress and their constituents have about whether Facebook is a societal net benefit and good.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 Domenico, it's so interesting because Facebook in politics started out as a bit of a golden child. The candidates and everybody wanted to play on the platform. And now it's a brand that seems to be getting it on all sides. Asma's talking about Elizabeth Warren, but I also know a lot of conservatives are questioning Facebook and algorithms and whether they feel like they're biased towards conservatives. It doesn't seem like Facebook has a lot of friends in politics right now.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Yeah, it's funny because Facebook actually was someplace that conservatives were actually able to kind of gather and mobilize. You know, in - back in 2010 during the Tea Party, for example, people weren't even paying attention to a lot of the groups that were popping up on Facebook that were really conservative groups that were able to mobilize and get people to go to a lot of these rallies that they were having.             </p><p>                But Zuckerberg here, the more he's out in public, you know, the more difficult it's been. I mean, he even said himself, quote, \"I get that I'm not the ideal messenger here.\" (Laughter) I mean, that is very difficult when you have somebody who is the point person who actually is taking it from all sides and doesn't appear to really have the facility to kind of be able to, you know, parry back with them in a way that makes a lot of sense for his business.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 Here's the thing; companies don't regulate themselves. Congress - what? - has to decide if it wants to try to regulate an industry. So is all the tough talk on Capitol Hill, is it just that? Is it just tough talk? Is there actually going to be any action to try to do things like regulate these tech companies?             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 The proposals that Congress has put forward won't fundamentally change the calculus of Facebook and its role in our society, right? So the proposals largely revolve around things like, oh, if someone buys an ad, we need to know who purchased that ad, transparency in advertising. But no serious proposals, no proposals which are likely to pass Congress, get to the fundamental question of Facebook's power and how it could be reformed, changed, controlled in some way.             </p><p>ASMA KHALID:                 And when you look at the Democratic candidates running for president, really the one who's been kind of the most vocal critic I would say has been Elizabeth Warren. And that's why we see her in this public spat with Mark Zuckerberg. In fact, there was leaked audio by The Verge where Mark Zuckerberg was talking about Senator Warren and kind of slamming the idea of her being president.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:                 Like Elizabeth Warren, who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies. You know, I mean, if she gets elected president, then I would - I would bet that we will have a legal challenge. And I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. So it's - so basically it's - and - so does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don't want to have to, you know, have a major lawsuit against our own government. I mean, that's not, like, the position that you want to be in when you're - you know, I mean, it's, like, we care about our country and want to work with our government to do good things. But look; at the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.             </p><p>ASMA KHALID:                 I mean, there's a reason why they're in this public spat. There's a reason why he would be concerned if she were to become the president of United States.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 And before we take a break, I want to talk about one more thing that happened on the Hill this week and probably something that would have gotten more attention if not for all the other scandals in our lives that we're covering. Democratic California congresswoman Katie Hill is now under an ethics investigation because she is accused in what is admittedly a very rancorous divorce proceeding from her husband of having an extramarital affair with a member of her congressional staff.             </p><p>                The House Ethics Committee announced on Wednesday that they would be investigating this. But the reason why it's so interesting to me is the only reason it's being investigated is because just last year, the House of Representatives changed the rules of the House to prohibit lawmakers from having sexual relationships with anyone on their congressional staff in response to the #MeToo movement. And it is kind of fascinating that the first lawmaker to trigger this new era of conduct rules is a female freshman lawmaker.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 And so, Sue, what's been the response so far from Congresswoman Hill about these allegations, and what has she acknowledged and denied?             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 She has said the allegation against her about the aide is completely untrue. She has talked openly that she is going through a divorce proceeding. I think it's fair to say divorces can get nasty and personal. There has been a lot of negative coverage of her in conservative media, to which she says she thinks this is part of a political smear campaign. It may well be. Ethics is going to clearly talk to her and this aide.             </p><p>                But it's also - you know, she's an elected member of the Democratic party leaderships. She's definitely someone who is seen as a rising star in the party. And it's also the kind of thing that Democrats don't really need right now, right? They're trying to bring forth an impeachment proceeding against the president. They're trying to look like the adult, responsible party. Generally speaking, when you start to have scandals in your own party, it kind of undermines your standing that, hey, we're the good guys.             </p><p>ASMA KHALID:                 So what are other Democrats saying? Because I recall she won a pretty competitive seat.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>ASMA KHALID:                 I mean, it is a competitive seat there in California.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 I mean, this is the challenge that they're going to have. Her seat will again be, in 2020, one of the top-tier races for control of the House, complicated by the fact that California expedited all of their filing deadlines because they moved up their presidential primary, and that kind of moved up filing deadlines down the board. Their filing deadline is December 6. That's, like, six weeks from now.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Isn't she also getting a little bit of backup, too, from kind of an odd source? I mean, I saw Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, who's a Republican - said that this ethics investigation was completely ridiculous and that people shouldn't be looking into personal lives. What's that all about?             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 Yes. He - may remember Matt Gaetz is SCIF-gate. He's the Florida Republican who led Republicans into storming the classified briefing room this week. You know, I think she does have some allies among lawmakers here. This was a rule change that actually made some people uncomfortable, that you would kind of govern this kind of conduct.             </p><p>                But if you remember - and we covered, I think, almost all of them on this podcast - nine members of Congress were forced out of office over their behavior in that #MeToo movement. I mean, it really was a problem on Capitol Hill. And these rule changes were meant to change the way the place operates. Clearly, the rules are working because when people do this behavior, they're now subject to ethics investigations. But it is creating some kind of uncomfortable conversations about what are the kind of things that we should be judging members of Congress on.             </p><p>                And I will say, in just sort of gender politics, we look at these things a little bit differently when it's a female engaging in this kind of behavior with a young staffer versus a male lawmaker. So it is a very interesting cultural debate on the Hill, and it could be a very interesting potential political problem for Democrats if they really want to hold onto the seat.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Yeah.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 All right, let's take another break. And when we get back, we'll talk about the things we just can't let go this week.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 And we're back. And it's time to end the show, like we always do, with Can't Let it Go - the part of the show where we talk about the thing from the week that we just can't stop thinking about, politics or otherwise. Domenico, what can't you let go this week?             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 What I can't let go of is Elijah Cummings' death and his funeral, which was taking place today, and people remembering his life. And there was a point that Bill Clinton made that sort of struck me about our current politics that didn't have anything to do with Trump, really, but had more to do with the idea that Cummings had friends who were Republicans.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 Lots of them.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>BILL CLINTON:                 He tried to treat everybody the way he wanted to be treated, the way he thought America should be treated.             </p><p>                            (APPLAUSE)                </p><p>BILL CLINTON:                 You know, you can't run a free society if you have to hate everybody you disagree with.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 And we saw earlier in the week, even Mark Meadows, the chairman of the Freedom Caucus - or former chairman of the Freedom Caucus, was crying about his death. That is not something I think most people would think is what would happen for somebody who is the head of the Oversight Committee, one of the committees that was, you know, really trying to hold the Trump administration's feet to the fire.             </p><p>                And the point that Bill Clinton was making was, we can't all cancel each other out - that, you know, what are you going to do, you know, if you can't talk to Republicans and you're a Democrat, if you're a Republican, you can't talk to Democrats - how are you going to have a society?

Find a friend this weekend who doesn't think exactly like you.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TIM MAK:                 You don't even have to talk about politics.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 You don't - you can just talk about anything.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Maybe don't talk about politics, actually.             </p><p>ASMA KHALID:                 There you have it.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 Asma, what can't you let go this week?             </p><p>ASMA KHALID:                 So you may recall that some time ago I mentioned that Pete Buttigieg, who is running for the presidency of the United States, was offered fashion advice by a fashion designer, Tom Ford.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Oh, yeah.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 I would take fashion advice from Tom Ford.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 So would I.             </p><p>ASMA KHALID:                 So apparently, Pete Buttigieg did not.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>ASMA KHALID:                 Tom Ford had advised him that his suits were kind of a little too baggy and tried to, like, you know, basically say that he could help. Anyhow, Pete Buttigieg didn't bite. But what I thought was kind of interesting is Pete Buttigieg recently dined with Anna Wintour and Michael Kors.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 Oh, the Vogue editor.             </p><p>ASMA KHALID:                 Yes.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 And another designer.             </p><p>ASMA KHALID:                 And another designer. And this time, apparently, he had a totally different verdict on his suit.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 Buttigieg definitely seems like a guy who does, like, the Jos. A. Bank three suits for $250 at the airport deal, you know?             </p><p>ASMA KHALID:                 Oh wow. I feel like...             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 I mean that as a compliment (laughter).             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 As an individual - our listeners cannot tell this, but as the individual in this studio wearing a gray hoodie, jeans and running shoes, I'm not going to be weighing in on anyone else's fashion.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 On any sartorial choices?             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 I mean, NPR reporters in general, you know, we don't have to be on TV all the time so we're not...             </p><p>ASMA KHALID:                 Nobody can tell.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 ...Exactly looking perfect.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 But politics is different than fashion, though, because there is this thing in politics, especially among men, that there's, like, a source of pride to look shabby, right?

Like, take out the thought process of what you wear. But especially with men, where it's like, oh, I wore my shoes through to the soles, or I wear cheap suits because I don't care about flashy things.             </p><p>ASMA KHALID:                 Yeah.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 Like, men are more - can more easily, like, pride themselves on lack of fashion as a virtue.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 That's a good post hoc rationalization of laziness.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 That's true.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Tim, you can do billionaire, don't care.

I mean, you could go back to BeBe and CeCe Winans. You can go to Kirk Franklin. And you have trap gospel. You have had rappers, for years, decades, doing gospel - nothing new.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"USE THIS GOSPEL\")                </p><p>KANYE WEST:                 (Singing) Use this gospel for protection.

But for this time, it's very different because the reason I can't let it go is I did not realize how much this song had become the anthem of the Washington Nationals baseball team.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Oh.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 Do y'all know about this?             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 No.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Yeah. I've heard a little bit about this, yes.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 That is lame.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 So this is now, like, the spirit song of the Washington Nationals, which are currently in the World Series against the Houston Astros. And this is a song that sort of became a slow burn in their fandom over one of their outfielders, Geraldo (ph) Parra. So when he joined the team back in May, he was kind of in a slump. And in July, he changed up his walkup song. So he changed it to \"Baby Shark\"...             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 You know...             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 ...As a nod to his kids. His kids love the song. It was kind of a hokey thing he did. When he changed his walkup song, things started to turn around. He got some hits at the game. The Nats started feeling good, so he decided to keep it as his song. And as the season went on and the team got better and better and closer to the playoffs, everyone has embraced it. The players on the team have embraced it to the point that when they get singles, doubles or triples, they either do the baby shark hand motion, which is like a small finger point or they do the clap motion for mommy shark, which is for a double, or they do the big, wide-arm clap for a triple.             </p><p>ASMA KHALID:                 I feel like Sue is quite an expert in \"Baby Shark\" lingo.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 Oh, I did...             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Well, we've got kids.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 I learned all about this this week, right? But then also, it's become - now when people got to bat, the whole stadiums will get up and sing \"Baby Shark.\" As they've been into the World Series this week, the National Symphony Orchestra performed \"Baby Shark\" at the...             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 ...Kennedy Center here in Washington, D.C.</p><p>TIM MAK:                 That's really cool.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 \"Baby Shark\" Halloween costumes have been a run in the Washington, D.C., area because a lot of people want to dress their kids as baby sharks for...             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 Oh, wow.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 It's very timely. But also the thing I think is very funny about it having come from a sports family, being married to a sports fanatic, usually, sports superstitions are kind of like male and sort of gross. Like, they get - men grow playoff beards like the Red Sox did or they wear the same socks. And this is like macho sports all, like, rallying around this, like...             </p><p>ASMA KHALID:                 This kid's theme song.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 ...Earworm - this kid's theme song that has totally rallied Nats nation.             </p><p>DOMENICO MONTANARO:                 I think there is some sports logic to this too. I mean, you get in your head, especially in baseball if you're missing a ball. I mean, we're talking about millimeters here, you know, where someone may be, you know, hitting a pop-up instead of a line drive. And maybe that - you know, the earworm of \"Baby Shark\" playing in his head just let him focus on the swing rather than thinking about, you know, how he might miss it.             </p><p>SUSAN DAVIS:                 All right.

It's the NPR POLITICS podcast here with our Weekly Wrap of the week's biggest political stories. Two of <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>closest allies were found guilty or pleaded guilty the same day as another Republican congressman was indicted. And Microsoft and Facebook and Twitter all announced attempts by foreign governments to influence American voters. I'm Scott Detrow. I cover Congress.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 I'm Sarah McCammon. I'm covering the White House.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 I'm Tim Mak, political reporter.             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 And I'm Ron Elving, editor correspondent.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 All right. There is clearly one moment this week that we need to start with. And I'm talking about one moment in specific because near-simultaneously in Virginia and in New York City, top, close aides, associates of <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>were either being found guilty or pleading guilty to serious crimes. And this really reshaped the political landscape and the legal landscape of the Mueller investigation. Paul Manafort, the former campaign chair, found guilty on eight counts after a lengthy trial. And then a surprise we weren't expecting - Michael Cohen, that longtime aide and fixer, saying he broke the law and saying that he did so with the knowledge and the direction of <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>Sarah, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is responding to both of these guys in - to put it mildly - very different ways. Let's start with how he's talking about Paul Manafort.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 Yeah. And again, Manafort was his campaign chairman. He came into the campaign the summer before the election. And Trump has done a couple of things. You know, remember, Manafort, again, was the one who was convicted on eight counts in his tax and bank fraud trial. And he did not cooperate with prosecutors. He did not cut a deal. He went to trial. And Trump has been praising him for that. He has expressed sympathy for Manafort. He said he felt badly for him and his family. He called him on Twitter a brave man. And he said specifically that he respects him for going to trial. He talked about this on Fox News this week.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\")                </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 And I would say what he did - some of the charges they threw against him every consultant, every lobbyist in Washington probably does.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Given the way that Trump has liberally and politically used pardons, have there been any indications so far that he would consider that with Manafort, given how much he's praising him this week?             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 He was asked about that in the interview - whether or not he might pardon Manafort. And he didn't commit one way or the other. Sarah Sanders, press secretary, was asked about that this week, too, in the White House press briefing, didn't commit one way or another. But, again, Trump has been very friendly and very complimentary toward Manafort in his tone. And he certainly hasn't ruled it out.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Tim, let's talk about the guy who, in Trump's mind, has flipped, Michael Cohen. How has Trump responded to Cohen this week?             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 So, basically, Donald Trump in that same interview with Fox tried to distance himself from Michael Cohen, even though Michael Cohen was, of course, the personal lawyer of Donald Trump, was a VP in the Trump Organization. Trump said, basically, they didn't really see each other all that often. And in that interview on Fox, he also contradicted Cohen, who said in court that Trump directed him to arrange the payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, the two women who say they had affairs with the president.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FOX &amp; FRIENDS\")                </p><p>AINSLEY EARHARDT:                 Did you know about the payments?             </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 Later on, I knew - later on. But you have to understand, Ainsley, what he did - and they weren't taken out of campaign finance. That's a big thing. That's a much bigger thing. Did they come out of the campaign? They didn't come out of the campaign. They came from me, and I....             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Let's take a moment and back up here because the way the White House has talked about Michael Cohen has changed a lot. So can we step back and just give a timeline of who said what when, when it comes to what exactly happened here?             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 His position now is that the money came from him, not the campaign, and that he knew about it after the fact. That's what he said most recently. Initially, Trump said he didn't know anything about this. Eventually, he said he knew but only after the fact through his lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Then, more recently, he's saying it didn't come from the campaign, so it can't be a campaign finance violation, which is not necessarily true. And he's also saying that campaign finance violations aren't that big of a deal. So he's sort of downplaying the whole idea of campaign finance violations.             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 Well, we probably should add that, even if the money came from him, ultimately, it went through a couple of creations of Michael Cohen's that made it an illegal campaign contribution. So the question then becomes, how much did the president know about those dummy corporations that were set up to make these payments? And was it all done, as Michael Cohen told the judge, at the president's direction, which makes the president, of course, a conspirator?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is not the first president to be in the middle of a scandal. He's not the first president to be in the middle of a legal scandal where he may or may not be being implicated by people in courtrooms. How is his response in line with or way different from previous presidents in this situation?             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 It's really hard to describe the difference because Donald Trump is so accustomed to getting into the media in so many different ways. He talks to rallies, as he did on Tuesday night after these two rather disturbing events in his universe. And he gives his version of the truth and then, sometimes, a different version of the truth a couple of days later. He puts out tweets, as we all know, that are sometimes contradictory to what his own personal and/or White House attorneys have said. So he is so much out there all the time that it really is hard to compare him to any previous figure in the White House.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 And just to have him publicly questioning - contradicting, essentially, you know, the duly decided verdict of a jury - to have him, as he did on Fox News, not only talk about, you know, going after those who flip, as he put it. But he said that maybe flipping should be made illegal. I mean, how unusual is it to essentially question the entire judicial process?             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 You really have to go back to Richard Nixon to find someone this at odds with the judicial process. Richard Nixon was also at odds with the legislative process because members of the Senate and eventually the House did go after him for his alleged violations of the law. And he was eventually named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the Watergate conspiracy, the cover-up of the Watergate burglary and a whole lot of other things. So that's really the comparison point that people are forced to go back to. Bill Clinton has some points of reference, as well. And he was impeached in the House - not removed from office by the Senate but impeached in the House - largely over the things he said in testifying to a grand jury.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 We could talk a lot more about these developments, but there's more criminal matters to talk about. So let's shift gears to a story that did not get much attention because of the time in the news cycle that it came out. And that was an indictment of California Republican Congressman Duncan Hunter for basically misusing campaign finances. Tim, can you fill us in on first of all, who Duncan Hunter is and what this indictment alleged.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 So Duncan Hunter - he's a Republican congressman from California in the San Diego area. And this all dropped in the middle of the Manafort decision and in the middle of what was happening with Cohen. But it is a wild story. I mean, I read the indictment, and it's just charge after charge after charge. And it's a really kind of compelling story.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And I don't even know what the most extravagant or eye-popping allegations are in terms of how he misspent campaign finance money because there was so much.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Yeah. I mean, so it's important to note that these are alleged crimes. He said he's innocent and the target of political prosecution. But the indictment itself is 48 pages. And you could read it as kind of, like, weekend reading. It is actually an interesting indictment. But the bottom line is that they converted more than a quarter-million dollars of campaign funds to pay for personal expenses. This is everything from electronics to vacations that they were taking twice a month, to clothing, to gifts for family members and friends, to concerts. They were essentially using campaign funds as a personal piggy bank.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And talking pretty bluntly with each other about how to mask this personal spending as legitimate campaign spending.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Yeah. There was one incident in the indictment in which he's talking to his wife. And his wife suggests, hey, why don't you buy shorts at this golf pro store? And we can say that it's actually golf balls for wounded warriors.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 Did he fall on hard times? Did he run out of funds - personal funds? Like, is there anything in the court documents that give us a window into his motivation?             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 What it really seems like is that they were living well beyond their means, that they were personally broke because they were spending very extravagantly. And you can see this over and over in the indictment, which, again, I encourage you to read because it's a really compelling read - is that they would go to zero on their checking accounts. They would have, like, $15 in their checking account. And then they would use their campaign credit card to buy dinner, groceries, whatever - go on vacation, go to Europe. It's just a fascinating story.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Hunter is denying all of this, is not resigning, is continuing to run for re-election. And, Ron, Duncan Hunter was the second member of the House to endorse the Trump campaign. The first member of the House to endorse the Trump campaign is Chris Collins from New York, who, just a few weeks ago - also indicted. He was indicted on insider trading charges. All of this, in addition to all of the Trump stuff we're talking about, has Democrats talking a lot about corruption, suddenly, on the campaign trail, talking about government reform. That's a message that worked well for them before.             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 Yes. In 2006, the Democrats had a couple - three things going for them. It was a midterm election for President George W. Bush. The Iraq war was dragging on, when people hadn't expected that. There were some soft spots in the economy. But the real thing that the Democrats kept emphasizing was that this Republican majority, which, at that time, had been running the House for 12 years and the Senate, as well, was a majority that had become corrupt and complacent and wasn't really representing the people anymore. Much of the corruption impression that was left was the result of lobbying scandals - people who had abused their relationships with members of Congress, taken them on long, expensive trips - things of that nature - for the benefit of their lobbying clients. And that included a guy named Jack Abramoff. That may ring some bells from some people. A couple of movies made about him, one with Kevin Spacey playing Jack Abramoff. So this has gotten a certain amount of notoriety, too. And with Paul Manafort bringing lobbyists back into a kind of special ill repute in recent days, that's another thing the Democrats can try to connect to.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So, Sarah, Democrats still think health care is the top issue to run on. Health care, the economy - they think that there is an argument about putting a check on the Trump administration that can resonate with voters. But they're talking about corruption more. How are Republicans responding to this idea that this is a lot of bad, criminal-type headlines - how are we going to deal with this?             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 In the press briefing this week, Sarah Sanders was asked about this and - at the White House. And she said this is something that Democrats are just going to try to do to try to make an issue because they - she said, they don't have a message. She said, it's a sad attempt by Democrats. It's the only message they have going into the midterms. It is certainly a message we're going to hear going into the midterms. I have been hearing privately, when I talked to some Republicans, some concern about where this all goes for the president and a sense that this will be an important issue for them, as well, in the midterms. Now, I don't know if that's a talking point - a political talking point to try to rally the base or if that's about genuine concern or both. But I would expect that we're going to hear some Republicans, as they campaign ahead of the midterms, telling their base, you've got to get out and vote for the president because, otherwise, this presidency may be at stake.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 The thing about this, though, is that there's a lot of news that you have to be following for this to stick, right? Like, we all follow this every day. And, sometimes, we get confused. Isn't the average voter not quite following the blow-by-blow of these trials and everything else?             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 I think that's certainly true. But when you have a midterm election, generally speaking, what everyone understands is that you're only going to get a fraction of the number of voters who come out for a presidential election. So it tends to be the harder-core people and the higher-information people, the higher-education people, the higher-income people who participate in a midterm. But when you get a special midterm, one where a big vote comes out larger than the usual midterm vote, that's usually persuadables, people who can switch if there's something that's energizing them. And that could be an unpopular war. It could be a big recession. Or it could be a big scandal story or the perception that things in Washington have gone haywire.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 So as you say, Ron, the electorate for this midterm election already is a little bit more engaged, a little bit more informed. And pollsters have told us that those are the very kinds of voters that pay attention to things like corruption scandals, which are complicated and nuanced. So it's possible that the voters we're going to see this fall will be paying more attention, maybe, than your average group of voters to something like this.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Yeah. Let's consider for a second exactly how complicated these corruption issues are. I mean, could you explain it on the back of a postcard? I mean, I got a text from a friend of mine who's - he's a law enforcement officer in West Virginia. And he said, look. I've read five or six stories about this. I still don't understand. Can you explain to me what is happening? And these are people who want to know and want to understand and are unable to really comprehend what the scandal is. And if they can't comprehend it on a gut-level that there is a lot of corruption out there, and here's A to B, then how are they going to make decisions about their voting behavior based on that information?             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 But that complexity, I think, lends itself to the president's tendency to sort of shoot from the hip, sort of speak to the gut rather than to the nuance and the detail. It makes it easier for the president to muddy the waters a little bit.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Well, you know, the early stages of the Watergate scandal were about campaign finance and very kind of in the weeds and boring. And what broke through for people was people hearing Nixon on tapes talking about the scheme or talking about his political opponents. That's what people understood on a gut level. And that made an impression in a way that may not have - that the campaign finance issue and getting into the weeds on that may not have been able to ever reach.             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 You're so right about the complexity of this issue. And then you have, of course, the comparison to a story with the emotional impact of the tragedy of Mollie Tibbetts, the young woman from Iowa who went missing a number of weeks. And now we have the arrest of a person who is accused in that case. And that person, officials say, came to the country illegally. And that has already been pounced on by the president of the United States, by many other Republicans who are all on the ballot in November. We want to talk about this. And that has such an emotional wallop, it's very difficult for a complicated scandal story to have the same impact.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 And, you know, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has said this himself in an Axios interview this week. That - he basically said it's good for Republicans if this Mollie Tibbetts story stays in the headlines because it reinforces the president's message.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Well, Sarah, you and I saw all throughout 2016 how <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>would repeatedly bring up onto stage family members of people who were killed by people in the country illegally. He's done that as president. That's something he likes to talk about. The question is, is that the type of thing that cuts through in some of these suburban districts, where the House is going to be played out? So last question on all of this. And this kind of gets into what we've been talking about. We've seen in so many different headlines over the last couple of years - it's a, really, major headline. It's a serious news story. Then 10 days later, a poll comes out. And nobody's mind is changed at all on <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>on the direction of the country, on the key polling questions that decide midterms. Any indication at this point that this is any different?             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 We don't know yet. But it has that potential because we have seen one poll result that, already, people are a little bit more confident about the Mueller investigation in general, that the approval for that has gone up by double digits since July. And that's pretty significant. If people are behind the Mueller investigation, that makes it all the more difficult for the president to resist it or to fire Mueller or to fire Jeff Sessions at the attorney general slot.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And those numbers have been getting closer and closer to 50-50 and more and more partisan over the past year.             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 That's right. But there is a big bump in recent weeks - and this is probably going to get a boost from the result of the Manafort trial - that will just continue next month as Manafort goes on trial for another set of charges in another federal courtroom, this time in Washington, D.C. And there could be a building sense of momentum, as there was - as Tim pointed out earlier with Watergate - as people came to learn more about it.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 The president says he doesn't get enough credit for good news. And one of the reasons why we can expect that these poll numbers are increasing for the president or at least not dropping due to some of these scandals is because of the strength of the American economy writ large. We're now in the longest bull market that we have on record. So the president will point to both economic growth and job numbers to say, hey, actually, putting all these scandals aside, getting away from some of this static, things are going pretty well in America.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 In fact, he was asked on Fox News about the prospect of impeachment. And he said, I don't think they can impeach somebody who's doing so well. It's not how the law works, but that is his mindset.             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 He said that the stock market would crash if he were impeached and that everybody would be poor.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 He did.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 All right. We are going to take a quick break. When we come back, Facebook and Microsoft and Twitter all announcing attempts by foreign governments to influence the midterm elections. The Democratic National Committee had a big headline, too, but that one's a little more complicated. We'll explain it all in a moment.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And we're back. Let's start with the news from Microsoft and Facebook and Twitter. Microsoft disrupted six fraudulent websites set up by Russian hackers. And Facebook shut down 652 Iranian-backed accounts linked to a disinformation campaign. Tim, walk us through this and the other tech world news because it seems just, like, every few hours, we are seeing more headlines about another thing that was found and stopped.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 It was a crazy week in the world of information warfare, which is what this really is, right?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 That we are entering this age where state actors are engaging in cyber operations. They're trying to penetrate various systems and embarrass public officials or spread disinformation. So here's what happened. With the Microsoft situation, what they did was they shut down these websites that were on the edge of attacking the International Republican Institute, the Hudson Institute and the U.S. Senate, basically trying to send emails to these folks using fraudulent websites to kind of take and steal passwords and information.             </p><p>                That's different from what happened with Facebook. Facebook shut down a campaign that looks like it was started in Iran, which did take part in some traditional cyberoperations but also spread disinformation targeted at U.S., British and Middle Eastern users on Facebook. Hundreds of thousands of people followed these accounts that were shut down by Facebook this week.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 What about Twitter?             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Twitter also shut down hundreds of accounts that were related to Iran. And separately and on top of it, Facebook shut down other Russian-linked accounts this week.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Wait. So I'm a little confused here. We've talked so much about Russia. But some of this news this week was about Iran trying to meddle in the elections.             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 They do have an interest in disrupting our democratic procedures because they accuse us of having meddled in their elections. And so this is their form of payback.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Yeah. The bottom line is that the Russian campaign in 2015, 2016 showed the world that this sort of thing can be done on the cheap and that you can create a lot of chaos. You can advance your interests forward for not a lot of money just by creating bot networks or spreading disinformation or using the power of the Internet in order to push your country's interests forward.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So all that is going on, and meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee, which was the original when it came to being co-opted by cyberattacks - a key part of the 2016 Russian attempts to influence the election was getting into the DNC system, stealing their emails, giving them to WikiLeaks and then WikiLeaks releasing them right on the eve of the convention and causing all this disruption. So, Tim, you and I were reporting this the last couple days. The DNC comes out and says, hey, we were being attacked again. We flagged it. We called the FBI. We stopped it. We are on it. And then the story took a little bit of a twist.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 So yeah, we found out that, actually, it was a big misunderstanding, that friendlies from the Michigan Democratic Party - or a specialist working with the Michigan Democratic Party - were actually trying to probe democratic systems for weaknesses that they could identify and fix.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And not just the systems. A central key part of this, the voter file - the national voter file - where the party keeps all the information on voters it's trying to reach out to. Pretty sensitive stuff.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 One big problem - they forgot to tell the DNC they were going to do it.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 So for all the talk about Russia trying to confuse and sow, you know, lack of trust in institutions, sometimes, our institutions can confuse themselves, it sounds like.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Which - the irony here is that Democrats have been trying to tell everybody for the last year how much more seriously they're taking all this. And they've said, look. We've even created fake attacks on ourself (ph) to try and learn how these attacks come from. But there's a difference between an internal decision to create a fake phishing attack and some outside group doing the same thing, not telling you, and then you realizing, are we under attack or not?             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Well, everyone is on red alert right now for cyber operations. And who could blame them? Just look at the other news of the week that we just talked about with Microsoft, Facebook, Twitter, everyone. All the big tech companies are lining up to say, we've disrupted this effort. We've disrupted that effort. So the DNC is really sensitive to possible attacks. And so if there's bad communication, this sort of thing is going to happen.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Tim, you said everybody's on red alert. Sarah, would you include the White House, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>as everybody on red alert when it comes to acknowledging the serious nature of these cyberattacks?             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 First of all, I think it's important to distinguish between <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>and the White House because those are not always the same message.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 That's a good point.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 The president, as we've been over a lot in recent weeks, has sent mixed messages about Russia, about - you know, he uses this term the Russia hoax a lot to refer to the Mueller investigation but sometimes seems to be referring to just the whole idea of Russian interference. He has, of course, come out and reaffirmed, yes, Russia interfered in the 2016 election. But bottom line - his messages have been confusing. At the same time, the message from the administration, from top Republicans and from top national security officials who work for the president has been consistent - that Russia did indeed interfere in the 2016 election and is continuing to try to do so.             </p><p>                Just a few weeks ago, I sat in a briefing with a bunch of top national security officials - CIA, NSA, FBI, et cetera - and they came out, kind of surprised all the reporters - we knew there was going to be a briefing. We didn't know what it was. And all of a sudden, all these top officials walk into the room. And they're there to tell us, again, that we affirm that this is happening, we are doing something about it. They outlined all their efforts to secure U.S. elections and combat interference. And they said, importantly, that the president had directed them to make this a top priority, which seemed at odds with some of the things he'd been saying just days before that.             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 The president has been at pains to cast doubt on any suggestion that the Russian interference in 2016 was a key element in his win, that it was supposedly on his behalf and that it played a role in his winning. That's what he really cares about. He does not, ultimately, need to - in some sense or another - facilitate the Russians continuing all this. So there's no reason for him not to have his officials shut it down at this point and resist it in every way that they can, as long as he can continue to say, there was no collusion between my campaign and the Russians in 2016.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Here's the thing, though - Tim, Congress, unlike the White House, is all on the same page that this is a serious threat. But they haven't seemed to act too quickly in terms of comprehensive ways to stop it, so we're left with this situation. All the people you mentioned flagging these problems were big, private companies.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 And here's the worrisome thing about it - is that we're relying on the altruism of big corporations, big tech companies deciding, hey, it's in our interest to come clean and say, there's a problem here, and we've found it, and we've ended it. And in many of these cases, they have to acknowledge, hey, they failed to prevent a campaign from developing in the first place. And so the incentives oftentimes push towards nondisclosure, that we are in the weird position and the awkward position of relying on the transparency of big tech firms to be honest with the public in ways they're not compelled to do, necessarily.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And at a point when, increasingly, our leaders and public opinion as a whole is a lot more cynical and skeptical of these big tech giants than we were just a few years ago.             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 It's a bitter pill for them to swallow to admit, as Tim says. It's also, ultimately, something they have pushed away to be seen as a media company making content decisions. They've always wanted to say, we're not that. We're just tech companies. We're just wonderful facilitators of all that stuff you love to do. We're not making any decisions that influence you in any way. We're just neutral tech companies. And let's face it - that's just not supportable anymore.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And even though, as we mentioned, this is a relatively bipartisan issue in Congress, if not the White House, their attempts to deal with this in a bill form have kind of stalled, haven't they?             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Right. Well, this week the Senate was supposed to mark up or consider what's called the Secure Elections Act. And what that would do is require backup paper ballots, post-election audits and notifications of states from the Department of Homeland Security if there was some sort of breach in their election system. But instead of what was planned, it does not appear that there was enough Republican support for this bill to move forward. And it's stalled. There's not going to be, in the foreseeable future, a vote to press this legislation forward.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I mean, but in fairness, it is a complicated problem. I mean, we saw that in the last few weeks when Twitter and Facebook tried to figure out what to do with someone like Alex Jones, who pushes fringe conspiracy theories, because when you make one declarative decision here, there's all sorts of ripple effects. And the technology's always changing.             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 Are they going to ban Alex Jones but then turn around and allow lots of other people who say outrageous things to be carried on all these social media? Because Alex Jones is not the only person out there being unreasonable, so who's going to make those judgments? And, of course, we've heard many people, among conservatives and other places, saying that, already, Facebook and Twitter are making way too many decisions of an editorial nature, and they are violating the free speech rights of the people they're shutting down.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 It is a tricky problem because we have, you know, in our Constitution - right? - we have protections for free speech, and we have limits on what government can restrict. But private companies have become so, so powerful and so technologically advanced that they have abilities to facilitate conversations and block conversations that they've really never had before in the same way. And I don't know that we have a robust theory collectively about how to regulate that and how much to limit that that's in line with our larger ideals as a democratic society that allows free speech.             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 And that can't be exploited by foreign enemies.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 Right.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 And when we talk about election security, what we're really talking about is how to protect the heart of our democracy. And that takes several forms. It's not just about election infrastructure and how we cast ballots. There's also disinformation and how to prevent folks from pretending to be people they're not or creating bot networks. There's also the hacking that could take place and whether or not Americans can feel secure about communicating privately. It's a super-complicated question with multiple angles. It's multi-jurisdictional. It requires private industry to cooperate with government and law enforcement. And there's not a simple solution to it. But I think the best solution that listeners can kind of lean on is to be more skeptical about the information they get and to verify the information they receive.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 All right. We're going to take a quick break. When we come back, the one thing we can't let go of this week.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 All right. We are back. And we are going to end the show like we do every week, by talking about the one thing we cannot let go of, politics or otherwise. Tim, why don't you get us started?             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 So in the coming weeks, there's going to be a pro-Trump rally in Washington, D.C., called the Mother of All Rallies. And I was taking a look at this, and I came across this genre of pro-Trump rap. And there's this song called \"Maga Like A Mofo.\"             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MAGA LIKE A MOFO\")                </p><p>JEREMY HERRELL:                 (Rapping) Now everybody want to MAGA like a mofo. But everybody wants to try to keep a low pro. We the people really got to go for broke, though, and MAGA, MAGA, MAGA, MAGA, like a mofo.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 This isn't good, but it's better than the Tea Party rap I remember hearing around 2010 for the first time.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Well, here's what I kind of wanted to go on a mini rant on.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 OK.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 It's like, you can't find good political music. And what I mean by that is not politically themed or that touches on politics matters. But, like, anything that ever touches on a politician....             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 ...Is just bad music.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 ...Is terrible.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 You think about, you know, the Obama Girl song in 2007, 2008...             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 That wasn't music.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 You think even about like - even really good artists, when they do political music, sound terrible. Like, Eminem had this anti-Trump freestyle that he shot, this music video....             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 Springsteen singing for John Kerry in 2004.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 That turned the whole election around.             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 Mmm hmm.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Marilyn Monroe singing for John F.

And if it is the mother of all rallies, then why do you insert the word mofo in - I just feel uncomfortable with that juxtaposition, but whatever.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 I don't think that song was made in reference specifically to the mother of all rallies.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 OK. But what it - what makes something the mother of all rallies - just big?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 We'll see.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 We'll see. They had one last year, and it was not very large.             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 It was the aunt of all rallies.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 What's the ant?             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 A-U-N-T.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 Aunt.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I think we need to hear some more of this song...             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 Yeah, more on this.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 ...To end this segment.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"MAGA LIKE A MOFO\")                </p><p>JEREMY HERRELL:                 (Laughter) Now everybody want to MAGA like a mofo. But everybody wants to try to keep a low pro. OK. We the people really got to go for broke, though, and MAGA, MAGA, MAGA, MAGA like a mofo.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Ron. Ron.             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 I'm trying to think of how to wrap this. But I can't let go of Foster Friess. But I will have to let go of calling him Governor Friess because he was not nominated to be governor in his primary this week in the state of Wyoming. Now, he is not a native of the state of Wyoming. But like a lot of other people with money, he has enjoyed going out to Wyoming and spending time. And he has been spending time there. And he has also been a candidate for the Republican nomination in a five-person field. And there were two reasons to think he might very well win this nomination. One was that he had spent well over a million dollars of his own money. Wall Street Journal says he's got 500 and some other millions of dollars. And he was endorsed by the president. In no uncertain terms, he said to the incredible people of the great state of Wyoming, go vote today for Foster Friess. He will be a fantastic governor - strong on crime, borders and Second Amendment, loves our military and our vets. He has my complete and total endorsement, which is no small matter because, as he was telling the crowd in West Virginia on Tuesday night just before the results came in in Wyoming, the president's record as an endorser is almost perfect. I mean, he has been a fantastic determiner of the result in Republican primaries this year.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And yet it didn't work out.             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 Came up short - came up short when it came to Foster Friess.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Well, every streak's got to end.             </p><p>                Sarah.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 So this week, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>at his rally in West Virginia made a point that he's made a lot about his trade policies - that even though there's been a lot of pushback from our trading partners and retaliation against his steel and aluminum tariffs, it's important for people, especially people like farmers, to wait and give his policies time to work because it's going to work out great. And in order to make this point, he used a bit of an unconventional metaphor.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 Sir, can you get this deal done immediately? I said it doesn't work that way. I don't want to go too fast. The deal's not going to be any good if we do that. We've got to take time. It's got to gestate, right? The word gestate, just like when you're cooking a chicken.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 Time - time - turkey for thanksgiving. My mother would say, oh, eight hours. I said, eight hours? She made the greatest turkey I've ever had.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 But yeah.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 He's not wrong.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 Yeah, yeah. But for the record, again, you know, gestate, as far as I know, is not a culinary term. This is a medical term. It usually refers to, you know, a growing fetus in the womb. But, I guess, I think what he was trying to say there is you just need to, you know - marination.             </p><p>TIM MAK:                 Marination...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 You know, as someone who takes the lead on cooking Thanksgiving dinner, he is not wrong. Especially - sometimes, I smoke the turkey. You've got to marinate. You've got to smoke it. And you can't - you know, you've got to let it do its thing. Wait enough time. You don't want to rush it, take it off early and have chewy Turkey.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 I just know a good friend of mine who is overdue with her first baby texted me the other night and said, I feel like I'm gestating like a turkey.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I will go last. I feel uniquely unqualified to have a Can't Let It Go this week because I was off for a long period of time and, by and large, avoided the Internet, both the news portion and the pop culture portion. So I will just say what I can't let go is how delightful it is to be back with all you guys on the podcast.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 Aww.             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 Aww.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 Welcome back.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Good to be back.             </p><p>RON ELVING:                 You're smoking more than just turkey over there.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 And congratulations.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Thank you.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 Big life moment.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I did smoke some ribs over this break. I let it - for eight hours....             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 Marinate.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 ...As the president said. And they were delicious.             </p><p>SARAH MCCAMMON:                 Not gestate.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 All right. That is it for this week. We will be back in your feed the next time there is political news. Before we go, I want to give one quick shoutout. This is the last week our amazing intern Libby Berry working with us. She has been a huge superstar...             </p><p>                            (APPLAUSE)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 ...Especially when it comes to fact-checking this podcast.

And we will preview the confirmation hearing for <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>Supreme Court nominee, <person><nameText>Brett Kavanaugh. </nameText></person>That happens next week. We'll also talk about <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>fight with Google's search algorithms. I'm Scott Detrow. I cover Congress.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 I'm Kelsey Snell. I also cover Congress.             </p><p>CARRIE JOHNSON:                 I'm Carrie Johnson, justice correspondent.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 And I'm Scott Horsley. I cover the White House.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 All right. So we are actually going to pick up exactly where we left off with the last podcast because we were talking about Don McGahn, his time in the White House, his role as White House counsel. But we didn't really get into one big part of McGahn's legacy, and that is the key role he has played in the <person><nameText>Trump administration's </nameText></person>aggressive push to get a whole lot of federal judges on the bench.             </p><p>CARRIE JOHNSON:                 Yeah. This is record material, Scott. Under Don McGahn's tenure as White House counsel, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has nominated and confirmed 26 federal appeals court judges and something like 33 district court judges. That is astounding. These are lifetime appointment jobs often going to people in their late 30s or 40s. These are people who could be on the bench for decades, and they're really a game changer when it comes to the federal judiciary.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 First of all, I have a question about the pace because it's been mentioned a lot of time that this is such a remarkable clip, and it's not like any other White House wouldn't love to get as many judges confirmed as possible. What is it about the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>that's been able to get this happening so fast? Is it just the circumstances of Republican control in the Senate, too?             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 Well, give credit where it's due. Starting in 2014, when Republicans took control of the Senate, they put a freeze on a lot of judicial vacancies. The last two years of the Obama administration - we remember how they refused to consider former President Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland. But they used similar tactics to preserve a lot of vacancies on the appeals courts and the district courts. So when Donald Trump came into office, he found a very large number of existing vacancies just waiting for him and Don McGahn to slot conservative judges into those posts.             </p><p>CARRIE JOHNSON:                 There's another thing going on here, which is that the Trump White House and the Senate, which Kelsey is going to talk more about, have prioritized confirming federal judges over executive branch nominees. Remember, there are still nominees for major agencies and departments that have not yet been confirmed because federal judges mean more to this White House and this Senate.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Yeah. And while McGahn is getting a lot of credit for this, I think another person who should be recognized here is Mitch McConnell. This is Mitch McConnell's plan that Mitch McConnell has been executing and has been planning for decades. This isn't - this is everything he's wanted from his career. And they - the people on his staff and Republicans in the Senate waste no time celebrating that and kind of tooting their own horns that they've been able to make this happen.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Carrie, there was some news this week with the latest batch of judges going forward. Can you explain what happened?             </p><p>CARRIE JOHNSON:                 Yeah. Remember that the Senate stayed in session in August, mostly to confirm federal judges. And this week, there was a deal between Senator Mitch McConnell and Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, to advance more judges. Some of these people were relatively noncontroversial - they were even people who may have been advanced by President Obama. But still, that's more lifetime appointees coming down the pike with many more vacancies to come.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 One part of the reason that this went quickly - at least this week - this batch of judges went quickly this week is that a number of senators wanted to go to the funeral for Senator John McCain, which was happening on Wednesday and Thursday of this week, in Arizona. And so there was more pressure on Schumer to make a deal so that they could leave and could be in attendance.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Which is another great example of, even when you're talking about lifetime appointments, votes that will matter for decades, timing and getting out of town is often a big indicator and factor when it comes to the Senate.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Yeah, particularly when they are judges, like Carrie mentioned, that are relatively noncontroversial. Though, I should say, this is still upsetting a lot of Democrats and people on the left who say it doesn't matter if they were noncontroversial, it doesn't - they say it doesn't matter who the judges were, they want Democrats to stop going along with this big McConnell plan to get a bunch of judges confirmed. They don't want Republicans to have this big stamp on the judiciary going forward.             </p><p>CARRIE JOHNSON:                 In fact, there was a big Twitter campaign about this earlier in the week where people like Dan Pfeiffer, who, of course, was an official in the Obama White House, tweeted something like, maybe I'm missing something, but this seems like a crazy thing for Democrats to agree to. And Rick Hasen, a law professor in California said, why does Senator Schumer go along with this? What could possibly be in it for him? So there's pressure coming from the grassroots left on it.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 One other thing to say about Don McGahn is he was Donald Trump's campaign lawyer. And during the campaign, he was one of the people urging the president to publish a list of potential Supreme Court nominees. Right after Antonin Scalia died in February of 2016, Donald Trump made public a list of very conservative judges that he would consider to fill that vacancy. That was Don McGahn's urging, and that was one of the ways that Donald Trump won favor from social conservatives, including evangelicals who otherwise might have been sort of skeptical of this thrice-married New York businessman without a real solid conservative political track record.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Before we turn to the Kavanaugh hearings, which are coming next week, Carrie, all these federal judges that have been appointed, are there any big-picture themes that are emerging in terms of the types of people or their backgrounds or their ideology?             </p><p>CARRIE JOHNSON:                 These are rock-solid conservatives. These are young people, mostly in their 40s who have a long, long time to serve on the federal bench. And they tend to be people who have been pre-approved in some way by conservative legal elite groups like the Federalist Society, the Heritage Foundation or others. Important to note, Scott, they're also far less diverse than President Obama's nominees - mostly white men, though not exclusively. Some more women have been coming down the pike. Some more Asian-Americans have been coming down the pike. But these are people who are unafraid, in large part, to stick their thumb in the eye of their own colleagues on the bench. I did a piece in the last couple of months about Jim Ho, a judge - a new judge appointed by Donald Trump on the Fifth Circuit who's already waded into very controversial campaign finance, gun and other social values issues.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And that brings us to <person><nameText>Brett Kavanaugh, </nameText></person><person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>nominee for the Supreme Court. His confirmation hearings begin next week. Before we talk about what we can expect at the hearing, Kelsey, can you take us through what it's been like in the Senate as <person><nameText>Brett Kavanaugh </nameText></person>has met with senators, as they've looked over information? What has been the trend over the past few months?             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Well, when this all started, they brought <person><nameText>Brett Kavanaugh </nameText></person>up to the Hill to start his meetings the day after <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>announced him from the White House. From there, he had a fairly steady clip of meetings with senators. But, as people will probably remember, they were all Republicans at the beginning. And up until just a few weeks ago, only Republicans were meeting with Kavanaugh. That's because Democrats were saying that they didn't want to meet with Kavanaugh until they had received documentation of his time working in the White House, and his time in other parts of public office.             </p><p>                So they wanted millions of pages of documents. And so far, they actually have only received a very small number of them through official channels. Most of the documents they've received have come through the Bush Library. And they have been - as Democrats have complained, been processed by staff at the Bush Library.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Carrie?             </p><p>CARRIE JOHNSON:                 Ironically enough, remember that Senator McConnell, this year, was trying to advise the White House not to pick somebody with a long paper trail because he worried that it would take forever to go through those documents and delay the confirmation process. Republicans wanted this pick on the bench in time for the term to start. And what happened is that there was actually a lowering of expectations, to the deep unrest of Democrats in the Senate and progressive groups outside the government. In fact, Don McGahn, the outgoing White House counsel, had a meeting with Senate Republicans in late July. And after that meeting, Senate Republicans suggested that they were going to go ahead with this process without those millions and millions of pages of documents.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Yeah. Democrats have been aghast about this. Like, there is no good way to explain how upset they are because they also are kind of helpless here. Democrats filed a Freedom of Information Act request to the National Archives for them to produce more of these documents more quickly, but they have not gotten much from that request. And they followed up by saying that they would consider filing a lawsuit if that request isn't fulfilled within 20 days, which falls right in the middle of Kavanaugh's hearings at the Senate Judiciary Committee.             </p><p>                But Democrats don't really have a lot of leverage here. They don't have enough votes to block him. They have had a hard time breaking through the noise and the atmosphere of Washington lately. And they have had a hard time reaching out to their own voters who, when they are polled, say that they don't rank the Supreme Court at the top of their list of issues. And it's just hard.             </p><p>CARRIE JOHNSON:                 You know, look at what's in the headlines today. We have North Carolina's voting maps up in the air. Today, the Justice Department weighed in on a major affirmative action case against Harvard. These are all major, major issues for Democrats. They don't seem to always understand that the people who rule on those things are federal judges and the Supreme Court.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 And we should say, the reason why Republicans are aware of that - Republican everyday voters - is because the Republican Party has spent decades laying the groundwork for their voters to understand that. It has been a major tenet of the voter education that Republicans do. They tie it very directly in ads and in paperwork and in their conversations with voters that you care about the Supreme Court because the issues you care about are decided there. Democrats just didn't do that.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 And Carrie's quite right. We all pay attention to the high-profile cases that make it to the Supreme Court, but most cases are decided at the lower federal court. So these district judges and appellate court judges carry an awful lot of weight as well, and they're going to be making those decisions for years, decades to come.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So what can we expect of these hearings next week?             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 We can expect that they will start with some opening statements on Tuesday. And then, either Tuesday or Wednesday, we'll get an opening statement from Kavanaugh himself, then before, senators get their chance to ask him questions. This could take the majority of the week. And I think the biggest fireworks will happen in the first or second round of questions, where Democrats are going to have - take that moment to make their mark. Even if they can't stop him, they are going to use this as an opportunity to hopefully reach out to the voters who they feel like haven't been hearing them as much and maybe see if - that there's a last-ditch effort to slow things down.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Carrie, it's interesting to take a look at where we are right now because when Anthony Kennedy retired, there was so much conversation about how he was the key swing vote on one of the most high-profile, emotional, consequential Supreme Court issues, and that's the issue of abortion rights. This was going to be the consequential battle for the swing seat. And here we are on the verge of the hearings, and it seems like it's almost a done deal. You have Republicans like Susan Collins indicating they'll likely support him. And you just haven't seen this big battle. Like, how did this shift?             </p><p>CARRIE JOHNSON:                 Yeah. <person><nameText>Brett Kavanaugh </nameText></person>actually met with Senator Susan Collins, who says abortion rights are an important issue for her. Kavanaugh told Collins that by - in his view, Roe v. Wade is settled law. What Senator Collins didn't seem to take a step further in, though, is that the Supreme Court doesn't have to follow precedent. The Supreme Court makes the precedent.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah.             </p><p>CARRIE JOHNSON:                 And <person><nameText>Brett Kavanaugh </nameText></person>could change his mind or evolve in some fashion or show himself on abortion rights in a way he has not yet as a federal appeals court judge. So not just abortion - affirmative action and a number of other issues. Guns - we're going to get some questions to <person><nameText>Brett Kavanaugh </nameText></person>on his approach to the Second Amendment and guns.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Gay rights.             </p><p>CARRIE JOHNSON:                 Not just gay rights but how the rights of people who are LGBTQ clash or conflict in some way with people who have firmly held religious beliefs. Remember, we had that cake case the last term of the court, and there are more of those challenges moving through the pipeline right now.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Kelsey, are there any key senators that we should keep our ears open for what sorts of questions they ask or how they approach these hearings?             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Well, I would be keeping my eye on people who we might see running for president in 2020.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I was thinking ears, as we're radio...             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 ...But, you know, both.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Yeah, OK.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 I'm keeping my eye out for what Senator Kamala Harris has to say. I'm keeping my eye out - gosh, I'm actually really interested to see what Dianne Feinstein - the top Democrat on the committee - has to say about this. She was notably one of the people who was originally refusing to meet with Kavanaugh. And she kind of broke the dam along with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer sending the message to Democrats said it was OK to start meeting with him. But then she came out of that meeting with a pretty strong statement criticizing him. So I will look forward to hearing what kind of questions she has for him because I think it will speak to the overall concerns of the Democratic Party.             </p><p>CARRIE JOHNSON:                 I'm going to be listening for two Democrats on the committee, Pat Leahy of Vermont and Dick Durbin of Illinois.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Yeah.             </p><p>CARRIE JOHNSON:                 They have already been on the record saying they believe <person><nameText>Brett Kavanaugh </nameText></person>misled them back in 2006 during his hearing to join the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals here in Washington. They think that Kavanaugh did not tell the complete truth about issues he touched - national security issues in the W. Bush White House, including surveillance, warrantless wiretapping and the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Speaking of 2020 there, you also have to remember that you also have Cory Booker is on that committee. And you have Amy Klobuchar - all names that are kind of floating around in the 2020 mix. It's going to be - I would expect that those will be a little bit explosive.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 All right. Well, we're going to take a quick break. Carrie, we are saying goodbye to you.             </p><p>CARRIE JOHNSON:                 Bye bye.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Bye. Thanks for coming in             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 You shall be missed.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And we will be in your feed a lot next week covering those hearings. NPR is also covering them live on your old-fashioned radio. So look for that next week in the podcast.             </p><p>                We're going to quick break right now. Be right back.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 We are back. We have traded Carrie Johnson for Phil Ewing and a player to be named later. Hello, Phil.             </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 Hi. Thanks for having me. And I'm looking forward to that prospect.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 (Laughter) So if it's Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>is feuding with someone or something on Twitter. This week, he has focused a lot of attention calling out Google and other social media platforms for what he says are unfair practices, specifically when it comes to the news they highlight in their algorithms. We're going to fact-check this. We're going to add some context. But first, let's hear what the president had to say in an Oval Office availability earlier this week.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 With respect to Google and Twitter and Facebook, there is a big difference. And, in fact, I hear that they're holding hearings in Congress over the next couple of weeks. And I think it's a very serious problem because they're really trying to silence a very large part of this country, and those people don't want to be silenced. It's not right. It's not fair. It may not be legal. But we'll see. We just want fairness.             </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PERSON:                 You think - you want to regulate them more? Is that what you're...             </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 We're just going to see. We're just going to see.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 This followed a series of tweets where the president claimed that Google's search results are rigged. What was he talking about?             </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 That's right. This has been a leitmotif for the president for his entire career in politics. They're out to get us. The system is rigged. And, this week, he extended it to the world of big tech. Trump is a very tech-savvy president - on the one hand, his use of Twitter - but he also doesn't use a computer. He's not the kind of guy who would sit down and type his name into a Google search box and be able to see what it has to say about him.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So Phil, what do we know about the claim versus the reality?             </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 Here's what Google said about these complaints by the president. The company said, searches on Google are not used to set a political agenda, and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology. The company also said this - we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment. So its response is just technically, scientifically, Google does not have a conservative bias. It doesn't have a bias one way or the other. If anything, according to the tech world - and according to Google - it's biased toward giving you whatever you want. And if, in fact, people in the White House are doing searches for Donald Trump and seeing a lot of negative coverage, that presumably reflects the amount of negative coverage as opposed to some kind of systemic problem by Google.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Kelsey, this is an interesting evolution because a lot of Republicans have for a long time felt that the media is biased. There's nothing new to that complaint. <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has taken it to much more extreme rhetoric. But now he's adding the way you find that news to that list of complaints as well.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Yeah, and it's been a fairly effective message among a lot of Republicans because they already had that feeling. And it's actually been a fairly effective fundraising tool as far as we can tell. This is popping up in some of the messaging the congressional campaigns are using to kind of tell people why it's important to get more Republicans elected.             </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 Conservatives across the board have picked up this theme as something that they think is a winning push to try to get behind - to complain about Facebook, to complain about Twitter, to complain about, in this case, Google. And, as we heard the president say in that clip, next week, there's two big hearings in Congress where the Senate Intelligence Committee and then the House Energy and Commerce Committee are going to focus on this specifically. And I expect that we're going to hear a whole lot more about this then.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 I think it's important to remember that things resonate typically with, you know, the greater public and voters when it - they seize on a kernel of something that that person already believes, and that this kind of conversation that the president's entering into - there was foundation laid there, and people already are - you know, have been expressing those feelings. We saw this on the campaign trail, at least for this past several years.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah. And, Scott, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>has been pretty blunt about the fact in the past that often, when he's railing on the media and its coverage, one thing he's trying to do is kind of insulate himself against any negative stories that would come out. It seems like this is along the same vein.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 It's interesting that he would include Twitter in that broadside, though, because he's obviously used that as a very effective vehicle for his own communication with his supporters.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah. He said at one point during the campaign that it was like owning the New York Times without all of the big financial losses in terms of just the platform that Twitter gives him. And, I mean, this podcast and almost every single podcast we do is a great example of how much he can can control the conversation through just tweeting stuff out at 6 in the morning.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 I think when the president first tweeted about this early in the week, it was easy to kind of dismiss it as the sort of thing that he sees something on Fox News and tweets about and then it's never heard from again. Reporters asked Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser, about it, and he seemed to be giving it the minimum oxygen he possibly could. But we do have Congress holding hearings next week. We have Senator Orrin Hatch writing to the Federal Trade Commission asking about this. So it's possible that this will have more of a half-life than some of the things the president tweets about.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah. And it's not like he's the first person to have one complaint or another about the big social media giants. We've seen, like, this remarkable shift over the last couple of years from them - Facebook, Twitter, other platforms, being these companies that every politician wants to suck up to in court to companies that people have a lot of concerns and criticism about and increased conversation about whether or not there's going to be any sort of broader regulation.             </p><p>                Phil, has that gone anywhere beyond, you know, stern talking-tos at high-profile hearings and toward some actual legislation?             </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 The short answer is no. But this so-called tech lash that you just described is definitely a bipartisan phenomenon. Democrats are very angry at big tech because of, among other things, the way it was used in 2016 by foreign influence mongers to wage this information campaign that distorted the information picture inside the United States with fake Facebook accounts, fake Twitter accounts, fake Reddit pages. There were all kinds of things that have since come to light.             </p><p>                And Republicans, as we've been talking about, and conservatives, are frustrated about what they call this bias or this unfairness in the way that their speech is handled. And so even though there's no bill, there's no actual legislation that these tech companies are trying to fight, they want to keep there from being one if, in fact, this so-called tech lash continues.             </p><p>                And so that's what they're going to tell Congress, that they can police themselves, that there is no bias and that everything is going to be fine because they ultimately want to be responsible for their own destinies, not regulators in Washington.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Those hearings will be happening next week. So I guess what I'm trying to say is we are going to have a whole lot of podcasts about hearings next week because we will recap those hearings, just like we'll be recapping the Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Hearing palooza next week on the NPR POLITICS Podcast. Tune in. Right now we're going to take a quick break, then we're going to come back with Can't Let It Go.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 We're back. We're going to get to Can't Let It Go in a moment. But, Scott, it was actually a big week for things happening on the trade front. Can you catch us up to speed?             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 That's right. And it could be a bigger week by the time you hear this. We are - as we record this, we are in the midst of furious negotiations between the U.S. and Canada. But earlier this week, the White House announced an agreement in principle with Mexico, the other partner in the North American Free Trade Agreement. So the question now is, will Canada join that pact and make it an updated North American Trade Agreement, or will it be some sort of just bilateral deal between the U.S. and its neighbor to the south?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And I guess, Scott, I should not be too surprised by this. But your Can't Let It Go has a little bit to do with trade this week?             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 Well, yes. On Monday, when the president announced this handshake deal with Mexico, he actually did it in front of the TV cameras and had Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on speakerphone.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 The president is on the phone. Enrique?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Or did he?             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 That was the plan.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 We've all been sitting in a conference room where you try to bring somebody in on speaker and they're just not there or there's some connectivity problems.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 Hello?             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 Happens even to the most powerful man in the country.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 Hello?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Hello?             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 It's sort of painful to watch. In fact, some folks have had some fun with this setting up along the \"Veep\" end credits...             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Oh, gosh.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 ...And splicing in various movie scenes of people on the telephone. The thing it reminded me of though, actually, is the scene from \"Dr. Strangelove\" when Peter Sellers is trying to talk to the Soviet president and calling out, Dimitri, Dimitri, just as Trump is calling out, Enrique, Enrique.             </p><p>PETER SELLERS:                 (As President Merkin Muffley) Hello? Hello? Hello, Dimitri. Listen. I can't hear too well. Do you suppose you could turn the music down just a little?             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 The bomb, Dimitri. The bomb.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"DR. STRANGELOVE\")                </p><p>PETER SELLERS:                 (As President Merkin Muffley) The bomb, Dimitri.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY AND PHILIP EWING:                 The hydrogen bomb.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF FILM, \"DR. STRANGELOVE\")                </p><p>PETER SELLERS:                 (As President Merkin Muffley) The hydrogen bomb.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 How long did that go before he hopped on the phone, though?             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 It felt like an eternity. It probably was only a few minutes.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>ENRIQUE PENA NIETO:                 (Through interpreter) <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>how are you? Good morning.             </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 Thank you, Enrique, and congratulations...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Kelsey, what can you not let go?             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 My Can't Let It Go is kind of like a perfect hybrid of things that, really, are my favorite things in the world - Congress, politics and indie rock.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Go on.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 All we're missing is baseball (laughter). My Can't Let It Go is the Texas GOP Twitter account going after Beto O'Rourke, the Democrat running for Senate in Texas. They tweeted a picture yesterday trying to kind of needle Beto O'Rourke into doing a debate with Senator Ted Cruz. And it was a picture of him and his band from - mid-'90s band called Foss, and it says, maybe Beto can't debate Cruz because he already has plans. And on the picture, it says, sorry, can't debate. We have a gig. Now...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 ...This kind of caught fire - not in the way they were expecting.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Wait. So their attack on him was that he used to be in a band?             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 He used to be in a band. He used to be cool in the '90s. (Laughter).             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Wasn't Ted Cruz, like, in the debate club?             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 He was. There are a lot of photos. There's a picture floating around of Ted Cruz in, like, mime costume.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Oh, no. (Laughter).             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 And, like, him, like, smoking a cigar in college and, like, rearranging a debate board. (Laughter). And it's kind of elevated Beto O'Rourke to this, like, national hero of, like, if they needed somebody, if Democrats needed somebody to be the cool guy of this election cycle, the Texas GOP kind of gave them that in this situation. You know, the funny thing about this band is it's this band that nobody's really ever heard of, called Foss. But the drummer from the band went on to be the frontman for two of my favorite bands in college, At The Drive-In and Mars Volta, who are kind of a really big part of the, like, post-hardcore indie scene.             </p><p>                And (laughter) I mean, it reaches out to a lot of people who may share that kind of thing. And you saw articles in Spin and in GQ and BuzzFeed. And the response that the Texas GOP had a little bit later was, based on the reaction to our tweets, we can confirm that Beto is in fact going to receive 100 percent of the vote from BuzzFeed contributors, out-of-state liberals and people who use the word rad. We feel very owned.             </p><p>                So (laughter)...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 (Laughter). OK.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 ...So I'm going to be thinking about the intersection of indie rock and politics for at least a few more days. (Laughter).             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Phil, what can you not let go?             </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 What I cannot let go is something to do with somebody that we pay very close attention to in my world, the national security beat, and more broadly in the public radio world, and that's Kim Kardashian.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 On August 25, she said this on Twitter. I'm just going to read this to you. (Reading) Who has listened to the \"Serial\" podcast? I'm on episode 4 now and dying to know what you guys think. Is he guilty or innocent?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Oh, no (laughter).             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 Oh.             </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 This is going to speak to some of our listeners. Maybe it will. Maybe it won't. And she followed up on August 26 by saying this. (Reading) OK. Wait. So still listening to the \"Serial\" podcast, but, so what - I'm four years late. I just heard about it. Any other good podcasts to listen to?             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 I think we have a suggestion for her (laughter).             </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 Now, Kim, if you're out there...             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 First of all, nobody spoil it for her.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 Kim, if you're out there, go to the podcast app and download the NPR POLITICS Podcast.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 You know, I think it's good that she, in that first tweet, basically summed up the entire concept of \"Serial.\"             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Did she finish it yet? She's going to be disappointed.             </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 We are waiting to see...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 And we're still waiting to see if he's guilty or innocent, too.             </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 We are waiting to see whether she will post another tweet to her 58.7 million followers about the \"Serial\" podcast.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Maybe she can use her skills in getting pardon attention to <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>(laughter) once she finishes \"Serial.\"             </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 There could be another episode of this podcast about another pardon by Kim Kardashian for the president.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Adnan, if you're listening.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I guess I can't make fun of her too much for that because I only watched the finale of \"Mad Men\" three days ago. And I was like, this is great. And people were like, yeah. It is.             </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 It was...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>PHILIP EWING:                 ...Years ago.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yes.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Scott, what can't you let go?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Well, I actually have to give major credit to our colleague covering Congress, Susan Davis, who's off this week and was giving us play-by-play updates of a very important news story happening right now. Of course, John McCain's funeral services are happening today. There's a funeral service in Arizona. Saturday, there will be a funeral service in the National Cathedral in Washington. But there's another very important funeral happening today, and that is the funeral of Aretha Franklin - famous, iconic, century-defining soul singer Aretha Franklin, who is going out on brand and in style in that, as Sue was pointing out in a, like, moment-by-moment screenshot blow to us...             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 (Laughter). We got at least seven, eight texts about this.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Aretha Franklin was laid out in her casket in, like, a beautiful, bright red dress, bright red heels and her legs, or...             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Ankles were crossed.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Her ankles were crossed, just posing in style. And not only that, apparently there were wardrobe changes over the course of the viewing.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Weren't they, like, custom Christian Louboutin heels?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Amazing.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I think they were. Got to go out in style.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THINK\")                </p><p>ARETHA FRANKLIN:                 (Singing) You better think, think about what you're trying to do to me. Think. Let your mind go. Let yourself be free.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Yeah. And our friends over at NPR Music put together a really great remembrance on Spotify, and you can go check that out.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"THINK\")                </p><p>ARETHA FRANKLIN:                 (Singing) Oh, freedom.

I cover Congress.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 I'm Kelsey Snell.

It's the NPR POLITICS PODCAST. I'm Scott Detrow. I cover politics. </p><p>ASMA KHALID: I'm Asma Khalid, political reporter. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: I'm Ayesha Rascoe. I cover the White House. </p><p>RON ELVING: And I'm Ron Elving, editor correspondent. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: And sadly, this is not our spin-off podcast where we talk about space the whole time. This is the NPR POLITICS weekly roundup. We are going to get into the politics. And today, we're going to talk about the 2020 candidates and criminal justice, plus a look at why the Federal Trade Commission slapped a $5 billion fine on Facebook. </p><p>But first - and I'm going to read this line exactly as our producer wrote it - I hear a low rumble on the line because, Asma, you're out on the campaign trail right now. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Is, like, the rumble a train? Is it a train? </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: It's... </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: I'm told it's a train. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: ...Interference from the aliens from Mars. That's what it is. </p><p>ASMA KHALID: It is probably, like, the air conditioning in this hotel room because I stepped out thinking it'd be quieter to be in the hotel room. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: OK. Where are you, though, for real? </p><p>ASMA KHALID: So I'm in Indianapolis. And I'm here because the National Urban League is having its conference here, and there are many, many candidates here to speak to people at the National Urban League. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: And the NAACP had an event earlier this week you were at. And at these two places, there's been a lot of conversation about policy, about criminal justice reform. But, Asma, there was some candidate-on-candidate sniping happening, too. </p><p>ASMA KHALID: There was. And what I will point out is that it wasn't happening on the main stage. So that is not what we heard from candidates as they were trying to address these audiences. I felt like, you know, thus far, what we've seen from them is when they're speaking to people, the focus is really on a common foe, which is the president - President Donald Trump. There was definitely some tussling between the candidates. </p><p>And I should give you a quick backstory - that this all began because Joe Biden, the former vice president, came out with a criminal justice plan earlier this week. And there are some candidates - specifically New Jersey Senator Cory Booker - who feels that that plan does not go far enough and that Biden has some explaining to do because he championed a problematic bill in the 1990s that he feels has led to the current situation that we're in around criminal justice. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Right. And that's why we're talking about this - not because we're getting into some beefing going on with the candidates - because it is about an issue that a lot of Democratic voters care about. It is an issue where there is a divide in the campaign. And it is an issue that candidates talk a lot about, partially for a strategic reason - because they are all trying to make a big appeal to black voters, who are such a key part of the electorate - in the primary, especially. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: What's in Biden's plan, and what is Booker saying - like, what is Booker saying about the plan that it didn't go far enough? Like, what is it not doing? </p><p>ASMA KHALID: So the overall goal of his plan is kind of akin to what we've heard from a number of other Democratic 2020 candidates, and that is to shift the focus from incarceration to rehabilitation. And Biden says that that's what we need to do. I mean, he explicitly focuses on the need to reduce racial disparities in the system. You know, there is a disagreement around the issue of marijuana in particular, but I would say it's - mostly, the disagreement comes down to a factor of tone. </p><p>Booker says - and he has explicitly said - that Biden basically was an architect of this failed system. And he believes that because Biden pushed for this 1994 crime bill that some folks say did accelerate the mass incarceration, specifically of African American men - that it sort of contributed to that situation. He feels like Biden needs to be extremely bold and offer these huge, transformative changes. And he also, you know, sort of is saying, like, look. This is coming about at a point in time when Biden is now running for president. Why did he not acknowledge that this bill and some things that he may have pushed for were problematic years ago? </p><p>RON ELVING: You know, Joe Biden back in those days, in the early 1990s, was the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Democratic Party was in control of the Senate at that time. And Joe Biden actually was in a position to largely fashion the 1994 crime bill. Not alone by any means - there was also a Clinton administration. And as a result, this issue was something of an albatross for Hillary Clinton several years ago when she was running for president because a lot of African Americans felt that she and her husband, Bill, had been pushing for a tough crime bill in an attempt to curry votes with white people, particularly conservative white people, not just in the South but all through the country. And Biden was part of that effort. And there was a sense of the Democrats feeling it was necessary to look tough on crime. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Ron, really quick, what was actually in the 1994 crime bill? </p><p>RON ELVING: There were tougher sentencing guidelines. There were lots of ways for the Democrats to prove they were down on criminals and down on crime and a way to not look like they were just the party of gun control. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Though gun control was also in the bill. </p><p>RON ELVING: That is correct. And that was also a big issue for them. And certainly, 25 years later, it's hurting them with certain communities. </p><p>ASMA KHALID: So can I ask you, Ron, a question? Because one of the things that we heard from Joe Biden when he spoke at the NAACP was a sense that times have changed and that there were African American leaders at the time in the '90s who said, like, look - there is an epidemic of violence in our communities - who supported him, he says, on this bill - and that, you know, he feels like times have changed, and they require sort of some looking at, what were the side effects of what this bill actually led to? But he insists that at the time, there were people within the African American community who did support him on this piece of legislation. </p><p>RON ELVING: No question. No question. They were all - there have always been people in the African American community who've said, we are the main victims of many of these crimes. It's our people who are being subjected to drugs, our people being subjected to violence. And we need tougher enforcement. So yes. There has always been that presence. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Jim Clyburn told Susan Davis that exact point about a month or so ago when she interviewed him. </p><p>RON ELVING: And Jim Clyburn is also of a generation that remembers very much what was going on with that legislation 25 years ago. But it has been a generational matter. In recent years, the younger African American community, I think, has had the attitude that their elders took the wrong approach here and that a lot came down on them. And they, in particular, were the people suffering the higher rates of incarceration and the lower rates of criminal justice in terms of fairness and equity. And they are the people who have largely driven the pushback. And this is coming to fruition now with Kamala Harris and with Joe - with Cory Booker being younger candidates who can look at Joe Biden and say, our generation of black people feels differently. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: And Cory Booker is trying to lead the way on this. And because it seems like now what they're saying is that there needs to be less focus on incarceration, on locking everyone up and throwing away the key because of the damage that that did to communities - and that now is the time to reverse some of that. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Yeah. And Booker was one of the key negotiators in the bill that President Trump signed last year, and he's made a lot of broad proposals. Among other things, he wants to offer broad clemency to thousands of nonviolent drug offenders in the system very early on - I think almost immediately into his presidency - using executive power. So he's out there with a lot of big, broad-scale changes to this. </p><p>ASMA KHALID: But I should point out, you know, look. This is sort of a fight that I think is going to be ongoing because after Booker made these comments about the vice president, Biden's campaign came out and pretty strongly disagreed. They did not like being called the architect of mass incarceration. They felt like that was an absurd attack and said that, basically, Biden has been fighting for criminal justice reform for a number of years and has been involved in this issue for a long time. </p><p>And what I will say is when I talked to people out in the crowd at the NAACP conference - and keep in mind this is a largely older crowd - there was a sense that some of these attacks feel unfair. There was one guy I talked to who specifically said, look. You know, the situation with drugs was really, really problematic, and I don't know that many of us would have made different decisions than what Joe Biden did at the time. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Let's talk about that a little more broadly - the politics behind all of this, Asma, because you have a new poll that came out from South Carolina this week showing that Joe Biden continues to hold a wide lead over Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, other candidates in that key early state. I thought it was notable that the two candidates that Joe Biden was taking some direct shots at this week - and again, it's ahead of a debate where they'll all be on the same stage - was Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. Like, what other positioning and strategic attacking did you see on this front this week? </p><p>ASMA KHALID: I mean, Scott, to your point, the intensity of these arguments speaks to the fact that it is essentially impossible for a Democrat to clinch the nomination without getting a substantial support from African American voters. And they all know that, which is why, you know, 10 candidates were speaking at the NAACP. I'm here now at the Urban League, where there are two days of candidate forums. And we've seen a number of candidates realize that there is no path to the nomination if they do not convince many, many African American voters that they are going to speak to issues that matter to them. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: All right. We're going to take a quick break, come back and talk about why the FTC is fining Facebook and what that means when it comes to the broader tension between the government and social media. First, though, Ayesha, Asma, we're going to say bye to you - but just for a little bit because you'll be back for Can't Let It Go. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: Yeah. </p><p>ASMA KHALID: Right. Talk to you later. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: See you soon. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)        </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: All right. We are back. Ron is still here. We've got Tim Mak in the studio now. Hi, Tim. </p><p>TIM MAK: Hey there. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: And we have a special guest, Aarti Shahani, who covers tech and Silicon Valley for NPR. Hey there. </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI: Hi. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Welcome to the podcast. </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI: Great to be here. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: So you're here because this week, the FTC fined Facebook $5 billion. Why did they do that? </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI: Yeah. So the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook - they had an agreement many years ago, OK? Back in 2011, they entered into a settlement. And in that settlement, Facebook said, hey, we're going to stop handing over users' data - all the stuff the users trust us with - to rando third parties without getting proper permission. And then they just didn't do that. They basically signed the dotted line. And as one FTC enforcer put it to me, before the ink was even dry, they were already breaking their promise. But then Cambridge Analytica happened. You might recall Cambridge Analytica - and this firm getting data on Facebook users and then arguably data mining it and using it for election-related purposes. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Right, for Ted Cruz and then Donald Trump's campaign. </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI: That's right. Yeah. So basically for political marketing. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Yeah. </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI: And the FTC then goes back. And it's been looking at Facebook, you know, for different reasons. It goes back, and it looks at what Facebook has been doing since that original promise it made. And it actually finds a bunch of violations to that promise, new violations, et cetera, et cetera. So basically, the agency, the regulator and the company came to an agreement that Facebook was going to pay the government $5 billion. That money goes to Treasury. And that would settle the matter. And that's where the conversation gets really interesting. Is the agreement that they came to with Facebook really changing the company? Or did Mark Zuckerberg just get away with an amazing gift? </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Aarti, is this FTC fine - is this the biggest concrete step taken yet, aside from uncomfortable hearings for Mark Zuckerberg (laughter)? </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI: It is definitely concrete. Money will be transferred from the company to the government. That will happen. And Mark Zuckerberg, who dropped out of Harvard, has a new regular homework assignment. On a quarterly basis, he has to submit a compliance report to the regulators, as well as to his board, to say, hey, this is what we're doing with user data. This is how we're respecting privacy. These are the terms that we're actually observing. So he can't claim not knowing he can't get off the hook that way. There's not another major tech CEO who has that kind of, you know, arguably embarrassing or certainly, you know, extra assignment from a regulator. So that's concrete. </p><p>TIM MAK: Let me ask you because it's hard for us to understand - $5 billion sounds like a lot of money. When you say that this is one of the biggest ever settlements that any company in America has been forced to make, can you give us some sense of how big that is in comparison to the power and size of Facebook itself? </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI: Yeah. I mean, like, in the last quarter - Facebook reported earnings yesterday, as well. I mean, the timing of this was also extraordinary - right? - because Facebook got to have this announcement about this very embarrassing and big settlement on the same day as the Mueller hearing. So talk about a gift, right? Like, the entire news ecosystem was eaten up in these hearings. They also reported earnings yesterday. So revenue was, I believe, 16.9 billion yesterday - 16.9 billion, so 5 billion - I mean, when they reported that they were expecting to pay a multibillion-dollar settlement - they actually first disclosed that in the first quarter of this year. </p><p>In response, after their earnings call, their stock price actually went up, OK? Usually, if a company's saying hey we're being fined billions of dollars, that's not great for the fundamentals of the company. But what investors were basically saying was, we have faith in your long-term prospects. And we don't believe that this government's action is challenging your fundamental health. We think you're going to keep growing - right? - growing is key here - and that you're strong. So, you know, the fact that the stock price responded positively tells you something about how big or really not big it is for Facebook. </p><p>TIM MAK: And that 16.9 billion is just for that last quarter. Is that right? </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI: That quarter, correct - that quarter. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Now, Tim, this comes in the midst of a really interesting timespan where the government, politicians in general have gone from embracing Silicon Valley as tight as they can, singing its praises, hanging out there all the time, raising money all the time to becoming increasingly, at least publicly, skeptical and critical of social media. </p><p>TIM MAK: So over the last 10 years and particularly during the Obama administration, Silicon Valley was kind of looked at a place where you could go and get clean money, noncontroversial money. It's not Wall Street money. It's not big oil money. It's these entrepreneurs based in California. And they can donate to your campaign. So there was a real friendliness between tech companies, Democrats and Republicans. And a lot of that changed in 2016. A lot of that changed after the Russian interference scandals. And this idea that big tech could be used not just to connect people but also to manipulate the news ecosystem in order to create and disseminate disinformation to really create problematic outcomes in our society - that wasn't something that a lot of people foresaw. </p><p>And now that that's happening, we're having a broader societal reckoning about it. The political establishment and radicals on both sides of the spectrum will say that big tech has gotten too powerful. They'll say it for different reasons. But it's not merely a political establishment view that big tech has gotten too much power, accrued too much ability to control various parts of our lives. </p><p>RON ELVING: And, Scott, this fascination with big tech is also a big issue for some of the presidential candidates, isn't it? </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: For sure, yeah. Elizabeth Warren has been front and center calling for a breakup of Amazon. She's called for a breakup of Facebook. Bernie Sanders has called for that, as well. Kamala Harris has said that she's interested in exploring that, as well. I mean, this is a - in one way or another, they have different nuances. But most of the Democrats running for president are all about using the federal government to try and scale back some of these companies' giant shares on the markets and the way that they can access so much consumer data at this point in time. </p><p>What's the Republican view of this world? And how has that evolved and why? </p><p>TIM MAK: Well, everyone from the president on down on the right - Republicans and conservatives, in particular - say that these companies have enormous power over how we receive information in the case of Google, over how our information ecosystem exists in the face of - in the case of Facebook, what kind of videos and information we get on YouTube. And they just fundamentally mistrust having a bunch of what they would term Silicon Valley progressives making these decisions about what sort of information we're provided. They have a real, deep skepticism. And while they must may disagree with progressives on why they're skeptical of big tech firms, they share that skepticism. Progressives, on the other hand - they're more concerned generally about monopoly power, about privacy. Can - are these firms getting too powerful as corporate entities? That's a totally different thing. But you have that rare bipartisan interest in investigating these big firms on Capitol Hill that you don't have on very many other topics. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: All right. Well, Aarti, Tim, thank you to both of you. </p><p>AARTI SHAHANI: Thank you. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: We're going to let you go, take a quick break and come back with Can't Let It go. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)        </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: And we're back. And now it is time to end the show, like we do every week, with Can't Let It Go, the part of the show where we talk about the things that we can't stop thinking about, politics or otherwise. Ron, you've been the constant steadiness of this podcast. You've been here all along, and I appreciate that. And we are joined again by Ayesha and Asma. Hey, guys. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: Hey. </p><p>ASMA KHALID: Hey there. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Ayesha, you are up first. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: Yes. So what I cannot let go of this week - you might have seen or heard this all over the Twitter and all over your podcasts and all over NPR this week. But the great Nina Totenberg did an interview with Ruth Bader Ginsburg. And she asked her this question. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED NPR BROADCAST)        </p><p>NINA TOTENBERG: When you get a cold or a hangnail, there's a substantial portion of the population - a large part of it female but men, too - who go into a complete panic. </p><p>RUTH BADER GINSBURG: Well, some are not panicked. Some - there was a senator - I think it was after the pancreatic cancer - who announced with great glee that I was going to be dead within six months. That senator, whose name I've forgotten, is now himself dead. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>RUTH BADER GINSBURG: And I am very much alive. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: You know, what can you say? I mean... </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Whose name I have forgotten. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: She forgot the name, but she didn't forget what he said. And I just think when you can brag on your longevity, I'm just impressed by that. And I also - I told my husband I felt like there was a sermon in there. I don't know if you ever - you know, if you go to church, and they're like, you know, my enemies were plotting on my downfall. </p><p>ASMA KHALID: (Laughter). </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: They wanted me out of here. But now they're gone, and I'm still here. Look at God. </p><p>ASMA KHALID: Still standing. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: Like, that's what I felt (laughter). </p><p>RON ELVING: Praise the Lord. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Felt a little vindictive for a sermon, though. I don't know. It was like, look who's dead. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: They say stuff like that in my church. </p><p>ASMA KHALID: It's like, underhanded prayers. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: Yeah, it's like, the enemies - they wanted me out, but now they gone. I'm still here. And then also in the words of 50 Cent, who - I don't know if you remember - he got shot, like, nine times. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: I do. He reminds us of that fact. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: (Laughing) This is the family version of what he said. But this is my favorite line from 50 cent. I heard some put money on my head. Go and get your refund. I ain't dead. That's my favorite line. There you go (laughter). </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Earning her Notorious RBG nickname this week. </p><p>RON ELVING: Absolutely, she could've paraphrased that. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Ron? </p><p>RON ELVING: Mine is a little bit more benign. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: (Laughter). </p><p>RON ELVING: And it... </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Does it include 50 Cent? </p><p>RON ELVING: It does come via my wife, who was particularly exercised about this reality this week. The price of a particular commodity has doubled in our world. And it's not oil. It's avocados. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: Wow. </p><p>RON ELVING: Avocados are up something like 91 percent from last summer. And you're asking yourself, all that guacamole? Well, yes, in a way, except the real culprit here appears to be the runaway popularity of avocado toast. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: Really? </p><p>RON ELVING: And don't tell me you don't know what I'm talking about because... </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: I am aware of avocado toast, Ron. </p><p>ASMA KHALID: We are millennials. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: Everyone always talks about. I've never had it. </p><p>RON ELVING: Yes, yes, yes. It is you people. You are doing this. You are completely... </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: You people. </p><p>RON ELVING: You people... </p><p>ASMA KHALID: The millennials' fault. I know. </p><p>RON ELVING: You millennials - you are running away with all the avocados and slicing them up on pieces of bread and making it impossible for guacamole lovers to afford their favorite snack. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: But can't you appreciate the taste of avocado toast if you like guacamole? </p><p>RON ELVING: I actually have it rather often - often... </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Oh. </p><p>                (CROSSTALK)        </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: You eat avocado toast more than any of us. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: ...Baby boomer. </p><p>RON ELVING: Did you know, by the way - did you know that it is actually extremely healthy to eat avocado toast, that it helps your body process all kinds of bad things out and that it... </p><p>ASMA KHALID: Is that really true? </p><p>RON ELVING: ...Lowers your cholesterol? </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: Oh, OK. </p><p>RON ELVING: So that's something all generations can appreciate. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: Now, that makes me feel so much better about - as I sit here with my Chipotle, my guacamole. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>ASMA KHALID: My entirely very fattening Chipotle meal. </p><p>RON ELVING: Be a little careful what you put in there. But let me just say avocado toast - big ups. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Thank you. This is a moment of generational coming together. </p><p>RON ELVING: I think it is. I think we're all one now. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Asma, what about you? </p><p>ASMA KHALID: OK. So what I cannot let go of this week is a very simple fact. That is that J-Lo turned 50 years old. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: I can't believe it. </p><p>ASMA KHALID: I know, right? </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: My gosh. </p><p>ASMA KHALID: OK, so I don't really have much more to add to this conversation... </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: (Laughter). </p><p>ASMA KHALID: ...Besides the fact that you all should just Google a picture of J-Lo and then guess her age. And I really don't think anybody would guess 50. She looks amazing. In fact, I would say she looks like she's, like - what? - 38, maybe? So one quick thing about J-Lo's skin care routine - because this has been written about in, like, fashion magazines because she looks so good. And there are two key pieces of advice that she has. One is don't drink caffeine. And another is to get eight hours of sleep. And I was like, yes, of course, whereas journalists could, of course, try (unintelligible). </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: I'm with her on one of those. </p><p>RON ELVING: Well-coordinated pieces of advice, really. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: Yeah. </p><p>RON ELVING: One helps the other. </p><p>ASMA KHALID: She has others, of course, you know, like drinking lots of water and whatnot. But those two in particular... </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: Yeah. I think she has more than that, but she does look amazing. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: All right. I will go last. And, you know, we've been doing these candidate interviews all summer. And we've been asking every candidate we talked to you - quick plug - we've talked to nine candidates - interviews in your feeds. We have been ending all the interviews asking the candidates what they cannot let go of. And this has actually, to me, been really revealing because you can tell who actually has things they really can't let go of. And you could tell who was like, let me scramble and get you something here. </p><p>                (LAUGHTER)        </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: I will not publicly clump them, but you can listen in and make that judgment for yourselves. But I will say our last interview with Julian Castro - he got into this more than any other candidate. And as the conversation continued, it was clear how much he'd thought about it. He was - started off by saying he was excited about the \"Top Gun 2\" trailer and was saying, you know, I've been thinking for a number of years about the plot. And we cut in and said - well, you can hear the episode. But basically, we teased out of him that he has actively thought through what the plot of a \"Top Gun\" sequel would be for years to, like, very specific points and, like, could possibly have written his own script. But one thing he said was like, I imagine that, you know, Tom Cruise's character gets drawn into a conflict with China. </p><p>Turns out, though, there is already a controversy about the new \"Top Gun\" movie. And it is the opposite of that. It is that the movie makers might have tried to appease China and that really important Chinese audience now. And that is the fact that there was a shot of Tom Cruise's character's - Maverick's jacket. And they had replaced a Taiwanese and Japanese flag that's a patch on the jacket from, like, its previous mission or whatever with generic shapes that kind of look like the Taiwan and Japanese flags. Out of concern - it is is being speculated out of concern of offending the Chinese government. </p><p>RON ELVING: Couldn't he get into some sort of conflict with the Iranians? Wouldn't that be more PC for the moment? </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: We don't know what the conflict of the plot is. But just it's clear that it is not the Julian Castro-envisioned plot of a fight with China. </p><p>RON ELVING: And what about Turkey? Don't we have some sort of beef with Turkey about F-35s that would be really timely? </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: I think the fact is, Ron, there's probably a lot of countries you could... </p><p>                (CROSSTALK)        </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: ...You could have a realistic plotline about right now. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: But they have to get that money from the... </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Yeah. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: ...As you said, very important Chinese market. So, you know, I guess they felt like they had to do what they had to do if that is the case, yeah. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF BERLIN SONG, \"TAKE MY BREATH AWAY\")        </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Regardless of what country we are fighting in this new movie, I know there are lots of people at NPR who are as excited as Julian Castro about this new movie coming out. I don't know if I'm among them 'cause I feel like every nostalgic remake or sequel in the last few years has been kind of disappointing. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: It's tough to do. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: But we can talk about that broader problem in a future Can't Let It Go. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TAKE MY BREATH AWAY\")        </p><p>BERLIN: (Singing) Take my breath away. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: All right. That is a wrap for today. We will be back as soon as there's news you need to know about. And a reminder - we are hitting the road. We have two live shows coming up - one in Boulder, Colo., on September 20 and another in Washington, D.C., on November 8. You can get your ticket by heading to nprpresents.org. I'm Scott Detrow. I cover Congress. </p><p>ASMA KHALID: I'm Asma Khalid, political reporter. </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE: I'm Ayesha Rascoe. I cover the White House. </p><p>RON ELVING: And I'm Ron Elving, editor correspondent. </p><p>SCOTT DETROW: Thank you for traveling this danger zone with us and listening to the NPR POLITICS PODCAST. </p><p>                (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"TAKE MY BREATH AWAY\")        </p><p>BERLIN: (Singing) Take my breath away, my love.

Franco, welcome to the NPR POLITICS PODCAST.             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 It is great to be here.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And welcome to NPR.             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 Thank you.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 We're so excited that you're here.             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 OK, so tell our audience a little bit about yourself.             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 Well, what can I say? I'm - I was born in New York, grew up in Atlanta. I got two great kids. I live here in Washington, D.C. I like to run a lot. And also, I've been covering the White House for the last two years, previously for McClatchy. I focused a lot on immigration and foreign policy. And now I'm here.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 So \"Star Trek\" or \"Star Wars\"?             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 Oh, that's a great question, but definitely \"Star Wars.\"             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 That is also the right answer. OK, you can be...             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 (Laughter) Lucky for you 'cause you'd never be asked back otherwise.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 You've passed the first test.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Franco, it is convenient that you are here this week on your first week because the news this week is all in your wheelhouse. Right now there are negotiations happening between the U.S. government and the Mexican government to try to avert tariffs from going into effect. Can you explain why we're here, how we got here, what's going on?             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 By tweet, of course. I mean, that is - isn't that how all the big announcements happen? You know, Trump used his favorite bullhorn, Twitter. And he announced that he was going to start imposing 5% tariffs on all Mexican imports. Those tariffs would gradually increase up to 25% to October. And the idea was they would continue until the - until Mexico stopped the flow of illegal immigration.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 So these tariffs that the president is proposing, the question was, what will they be tariffs on? The answer is absolutely everything and - everything that is traded with Mexico. This could be auto parts that passed across the border multiple times. It could be avocados. It could be tequila. It could be dishwashers. Literally everything would have a 5% tariff put on it if it comes into the United States. And then it only escalates from there.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Once a month - right? - it goes up 5%...             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 To 25% in October, yeah.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Mara, what do tariffs have to do with immigration?             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Well, if you had talked to economists or some Republicans in Congress, they say they have nothing to do with them - except, if you put tariffs on Mexico, maybe you'd increase the flow of illegal immigrants because it would hurt the economy.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 OK, well, that's not the president's goal.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 No, that's not the president's goal. He sees tariffs - he calls himself a tariff man. He sees tariffs as an all-purpose tool to punish anyone and use it as leverage to get them to do what he wants. He hasn't been successful up until now, but he's trying again. What - economists will tell you tariffs are a tax. They are not paid by Mexico. They are paid by American companies and consumers when they purchase Mexican products.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 So Mara landed on something that I heard from Republicans a lot, particularly Senate Republicans, and - that they - their interpretation of what's happening here is that the president sees tariffs as a thing that has worked for him in the past, particularly with China. They see - they think that he - that the president believes he was able to move forward and put pressure on China effectively using tariffs. And he's trying to recreate that to get completely unrelated outcomes from Mexico. The problem is they are also trying to get a trade deal with Mexico. And it is complicating things in a pretty dramatic way.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Yeah. And so Republicans in Congress, many of them - I mean, I guess they're a little bit divided. But there's a lot of not happiness coming out of the Republicans, particularly in the Senate.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Yeah, there was a weekly party lunch where some lawyers from the White House came and talked to Republicans about these tariffs. And I was told that not a single person stood up to say that they really liked the tariffs. And in fact, a bunch of Republicans went into the meeting saying that they were kind of with the president or that they understood why the president wanted to do this or why the president wanted to put - you know, put pressure on Mexico.             </p><p>                And those people who were kind of in the president's corner before the lunch came out completely silent or came out and were softening in their support for the president. There were a lot of people who came out and said this just simply isn't something that they can go along with.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 And, you know, when you talk to economic advisers of the president in the White House about all of these tariffs, they generally will say that their view of the American economy is it is so large and so strong right now that it can withstand whatever economic hit tariffs cause. But there is a limit to that.             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 I will say I was - I was very interested that Marco Rubio did come out in support of the tariffs. And it's fascinating because Marco Rubio, he's known as, like, the Latino whisperer. You know, he's kind of an unofficial adviser to President Trump on Latin American issues. And he gave out a series of tweets yesterday talking about how he is basically calling on his Republican colleagues and saying, hey, guys, what else are we going to do?             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 He is also interesting because he and, I would say, maybe a couple other people, like Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina, are a little bit of a bellwether of whether or not the Senate - Senate Republicans are going to tip in favor of something the president wants or away from it. And as long as Marco Rubio is going to stand with the president and Tim Scott is also standing with the president, it makes it hard to see how they're ever going to actually take a vote and stand up to the president.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 And they certainly don't have enough votes to override a veto if it came to that. But I have a question for Franco. What else are they going to do? That assumes that Mexico can turn off the spigot, can stop Central American migrants from coming, can stop the drugs from flowing. I mean, already the president has done the opposite of what some people have thought was a solution. Let's address the root causes in these countries like Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador that's causing people to leave. He's cut off a lot of that aid.             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 He has cut off a lot of that. And that's - you know, that's the issue that most foreign policy people will talk about. When I talk to foreign policy experts in those countries, in Central America, they will tell me, look, you are not going to stop our residents, our communities from going to the United States as long as they know there are jobs there, as long as they have family members who love them there and who want to reconnect and as long as there's still lack of jobs and options here in our countries.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 One question about this is why is this happening now? Why is President Trump so upset that he is taking this action, potentially, against Mexico. And part of it has to be what's been happening at the border. Just yesterday, Franco, we got some new numbers out of the Department of Homeland Security that show a pretty stunning number of migrants being taken into custody at the U.S. border.             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 Yeah, there's - 144,000 immigrants were apprehended at the border just in May. The administration is really calling this an emergency. Trump sees this as an emergency. And to be clear, this is the third month in a row that there has been more than 100,000 apprehensions at the border.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Well, yeah, and so you have a president who is frustrated or whatever - whatever you want to call it. He has not gotten the wall, though he did declare a national emergency. And he is working to get a wall that way. He has not been able to get Congress to do anything that he wants them to do. There was just a new proposal that was, like, laughed off stage.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Yeah, I mean, a couple of...             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 He shut down the government to get a wall and didn't get it.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Yeah, a couple of things that are happening that people might forget about that may relate in the president's mind when it comes to walls and immigration is that the House just passed a disaster aid bill that he wanted to have include money for a wall. That didn't happen. The leaders in the House and Senate are working on a deal to increase spending. They call it a spending caps deal.             </p><p>                That will likely, if Democrats are getting their way, not include money for a wall. And they have a spending negotiation coming where Democrats are already saying there won't be money for a while. So there is a lot of indication coming from Capitol Hill that he's not getting what he wants.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 OK, so he can't get what he wants from Congress. And so he's trying to get what he wants from Mexico.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 From Mexico, yeah.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And is he going to be able to get what he wants from Mexico?             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 That's the million-dollar question. Can he get what he wants from Mexico? Look...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And what does he want?             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 Well, what he wants are, you know, very specific things. He wants the Mexican government to enforce their immigration laws, to do more - what they do - he's saying that - he's arguing that the Mexican immigration laws are stronger than the United States laws. And they are very strong. He's also pointing out that the border with Guatemala, the Mexican border with Guatemala, is much shorter and easier to patrol. That's the Trump administration's position.             </p><p>                They also want the Mexican government to accept all of the asylum-seekers, to be, like, the third-party country where all the asylum-seekers sit or wait until their cases are heard in U.S. courts. And the Mexican government has already said that they're not going to do that. But the Mexican government does seem to be open to talks.             </p><p>                They - there's no question that the Trump administration has gotten the Mexican government's attention, hence why we're having these discussions. But, you know, what actually comes out today is a - is a big question. There's a huge deadline impending. And Trump says, you know, deal or tariffs.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 So Kelsey, the deadline, the real - you know, the beginning of tariffs is supposed to be Monday. Let's say there is no deal, and the president signs whatever he has to sign to make these tariffs start on Monday.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Yeah, as we were coming into the studio, Richard Neal, who's the Democrat in charge of the Ways and Means Committee in the House, he said that if the tariffs go into effect, that the House is going to start a process of voting to disapprove of those tariffs. Now, if they take that vote, then it will force the Senate to also take that vote. The real question now is, can they get a veto-proof majority in either the House or the Senate or both?             </p><p>                At this point, it does not look like they can get that in the House. And there are some Republicans in the Senate who are saying that theoretically, there are enough Republicans to oppose this president. But there have been theoretically enough Republicans to oppose the president on an issue many times before, and it has really never come to fruition.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Right. I mean, the chorus of opposition voices is getting louder, particularly on trade. But it never gets loud enough to sustain a veto override.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 I mean, because there are political consequences there. If Republicans vote to override a veto, they really worry about what that's going to do for them when they are up for reelection. Republicans in the House and the Senate are terrified of defying the president because they think that their voters will turn against them.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And they probably will. All right, we are going to leave it there for now. Franco, you survived your first time in the Thunderdome - I mean, the NPR POLITICS PODCAST.             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 I am so thankful to have been able to survive this. I just want to thank my...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 You didn't just survive. You thrived.             </p><p>FRANCO ORDO\u00d1EZ:                 I want to thank my family for their support for me attending this POLITICS.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 (Laughter) All right, we will have you back very soon. We're going to take a quick break. And when we return, Congress takes on the big tech companies.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And we are back. And Danielle Kurtzleben is here with us. Hello, Danielle.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Hey, Tam.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 So this week the four big tech companies - Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon - were put on notice. The Justice Department is reportedly taking up potential antitrust investigations with Apple and Google. And the Federal Trade Commission is looking into Facebook and Amazon. So that's, like, something.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Yeah, that's...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 That's a very big something. And it's not the only thing that's happening because at the same time, the House announced that they're going to start having hearings on antitrust and on these - on the big tech companies and what to do about it. They're kind of a nebulous set of hearings. We don't know who they're going to call or when they're going to happen. But they want to get started on trying to tackle this really big question that is - is much larger than just are the companies too big.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Well, so Nancy Pelosi - I think it was about a week ago - said something that I think sort of sums up the shift in - you know, these companies have had sort of an easy...             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 A free ride, you could say.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 ...An easy time.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Well, yeah.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Yeah, Pelosi was reacting to this video that made her appear drunk and that was actually retweeted by people close to the president. And she was quite upset about it because Facebook wouldn't take it down. And she said...             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>NANCY PELOSI:                 Facebook knows that this is false. They know that this is false. And yet they've decided to go (ph). Now, we have said all along, oh, poor Facebook; they were unwittingly exploited by the Russians. I think wittingly because right now, they're willing to put something on that they know to be false.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 She then said, I think they've proven by not taking down something they know is false that they were willing enablers of Russian interference in our election.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Pretty harsh.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Right. Wow. So all of that leads to this growing conversation in the political bloodstream about what, if anything, is going to be done about these very big, very powerful companies that have reach into all of our lives.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 It feels like it's a conversation about a conversation that they might have a conversation about right now because...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 ...Nobody seems to know...             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Well...             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 ...How to even start this.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Well...             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 ...But it's the beginning - oh.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 ...And also a couple decades too late.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Well, no, it's - but it's the beginning of a big debate about bigness.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 We threw out this word, antitrust. And there - everybody's talking about antitrust. Mara, what is it? Where does it come from? And how does it apply here?             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Antitrust is the body of law that says when a company or a corporation or a conspiring group of companies either get too big or they conspire too much and they set prices unfairly that prices go up, it hurts consumers because this one company is too big, has too much control.             </p><p>                The modern debate about antitrust is these companies are too big, but they're not raising prices. They're doing other things. They're invading our privacy. They're stealing our data. They're trafficking in misinformation. They're letting the Russians interfere in our elections - all sorts of other things.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Right, I...             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 So we are at the beginning of this debate about bigness. And lawmakers haven't even decided, are some of these companies like public utilities that need to be regulated? Or do they need to be broken up? We're at the very beginning of this.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Right. And it's not just about even - to even add on to that, it's not even just about privacy or prices or that sort of thing. Some of it is about information. Like, a couple of companies that have taken aim at Google are TripAdvisor and Yelp because what they are saying is that when I go in and look in Google and Google, good restaurants around the NPR building, what I'm not getting at the top is necessarily a Yelp review. What I'm getting are Google reviews or whatever.             </p><p>                So - and granted, the Yelp people aren't necessarily concerned that I, Danielle Kurtzleben, are getting the right information. They're concerned that their - their pages are not popping up. But the point here is that it's not just about Standard Oil owning 90% of the oil refineries here. This is about Google having its own review service and then potentially putting its own review service above everyone else's stuff.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 But information is their product.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Yes, absolutely.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 And information is money in this economy.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 And they're keeping other people's products off the shelf...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Totally.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 ...Just like old-fashioned monopolies used to do.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Right.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 And the same - by the same token, privacy is monetizable as well. Your information, what you do on the Internet, is money to these companies.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Yes.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 So it's not...             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 You are the product.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Right, and so it's not, in the same way - and this is part of the problem - right? - is Congress really doesn't know how to wrap its head around this. I did some interviews yesterday about kind of whether or not Congress is ready for all of this. And the thing I heard over and over and over again is there just really aren't tech experts on the Hill.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 There are a lot of reasons. I mean, one reason is it's hard to compete with the salaries of Silicon Valley and attract people to come work in Congress. Some of it is that they made cuts to the information systems. There used to be a part of Congress that advised members and staff on technology specifically. That's been done away with. But all of those things come together to create a situation where you have - the people who are making these major decisions for millions of people just don't really understand what they're talking about.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 And can I just put a...             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 And allow me to put the...             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Oh.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Allow me to put the cart before the horse here as well because let's say Congress can figure out - can get their tech experts and can figure out, OK, what is good behavior, what is bad behavior? You know, what - what has anyone done wrong, if anything, et cetera, et cetera. Then they have to figure out, what do you do about it? Because you have a few options.             </p><p>                You can regulate. You can break up a company. You can fine. The European - the European Union has fined Google more than once in the last few years. But opponents say it hasn't really changed Google's practices enough. So what exactly do you do? This just - like, we are so at the beginning of this. It's so hard to see how it turns out.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 And I just want to make a big plug for Kelsey's story yesterday, which was so great for many reasons. But one of them was that she played this famous cut of tape of Orrin Hatch, no longer in the Senate, old guy, you know, asking Mark Zuckerberg...             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>ORRIN HATCH:                 So how do you sustain a business model in which users don't pay for your service?             </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG:                 Senator, we run ads.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 And the thing that's so amazing about that moment was the obvious follow-up was, oh, you take all of this personal information from your users and monetize it and sell it to advertisers, which is exactly what they do. And until Congress gets...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 But you're saying that that follow-up didn't happen.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Yeah.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 But that's the thing, is that's what I kept hearing over and over yesterday, was that Congress doesn't know what they don't know. So they can't ask the right questions. And that puts them at a really - it makes it really hard to decide about the questions Danielle is raising if they don't even know where to start.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Danielle, you have been covering the Democrats running for president and many of their policy ideas. And some of them have policy ideas as relates to these very big tech companies.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Right, totally. And, I mean, the person that it is impossible to ignore on this is Elizabeth Warren because she has the biggest policy on this and the one that our listeners have probably heard the most about, which is her call to break up big tech companies. In it, she took aim - dead aim - at companies like Facebook. Amazon is a really big one.             </p><p>                You know, she tends to say things like, you know, there are two problems. One is that, you know, a company like Google has too much control over search. It's just too big in its market. But aside from that, she doesn't like that Amazon, for example, has its own selling platform but also can muscle out other people in selling its own products on that platform.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Making its own products.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Yeah.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Yes, exactly.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 So it's a vertical - it's a vertical problem as well as a horizontal problem.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Yes.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Google is a horizontal problem. Amazon is a vertical problem.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Right, which...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 OK, explain horizontal and vertical, please.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 So, like, from...             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Well, horizontal is you control the whole market for one thing. Vertical is where you're involved in every step of production and marketing, selling, you know...             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 You own the factory and the stores and the trains and the - everything, from beginning to end. So to give you a 30,000-foot view, yes, you have Elizabeth Warren with her plan, which really has set the stakes for the debate in a big way because then you have all the other candidates being asked, do you support this plan to break up big tech? Some people, like Bernie Sanders and Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard, have said yes, absolutely.             </p><p>                But then you have other candidates, including - from across the spectrum. You have Joe Biden. You have Kamala Harris. You have Pete Buttigieg. They may be open to breaking up big tech. They don't flat out say, yes, let's do that, but what they do say is, something is wrong; we - maybe we'll have to regulate. Like, there seems to be, at the very least, some pretty big consensus - at least among the top-tier candidates - of, all right, something is very amiss in this industry. We have to do something. Things are bad.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And this might be a fine point to say, that NPR is - receives sponsorship from many of these outlets that we just talked about (laughter).             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Yeah, and you know who else does? Every single member of Congress, basically. This is not - and it's - and a lot of these campaigns. And so this is a complicated situation. Tech companies donate a lot of money to politics.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 They are the Standard Oil of the modern era - and the railroads, and...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And they employ a lot of people, too.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 In a lot of districts and in a lot of states. I mean, it is - it's a big part of - as somebody said to me over and over yesterday, it is a part of the American fabric right now.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 All right, we will probably be talking about this more in the months and weeks ahead. But we're going to take a quick break right now. And when we get back, it's time for Can't Let It Go.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And we're back. And we're going to end the show like we do every week, with Can't Let It Go. That's the part of the show where we talk about the things we cannot stop thinking about, politics or otherwise. Mara.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 My can't-let-it-go this week is I've been working on a piece about the progressive primary, the intramural battle between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in the Democratic primary. And last night on Fox, on \"Tucker Carlson\" - he's an opinion host who is famously anti-immigration anti-identity politics - he had this long commentary about Elizabeth Warren.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT\")                </p><p>TUCKER CARLSON:                 \"We can navigate the changes ahead if we embrace economic patriotism and make American workers our highest priority rather than continuing to cater to the interests of companies and people with no allegiance to America,\" end quote. Now, let's say you regularly vote Republican. Ask yourself, what part of the statement you just heard did you disagree with? Was there a single word that seemed wrong to you? Probably not - here's the depressing part. Nobody you voted for said that or would ever say it.             </p><p>                Republicans in Congress can't promise to protect American industries. They wouldn't dare to do that. It might violate some principle of Austrian economics. It might make the Koch brothers mad. It might alienate the libertarian ideologues who to this day fund most Republican campaigns. So no, a Republican did not say that, sadly. Instead, the words you just heard are from - and brace yourself, here - Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. It's true. She sounds like Donald Trump at his best.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 I have two takeaways from this. No. 1, sounds like Donald Trump at his best - I interpret that as, sounds like the Donald Trump we were really hoping to see but didn't, the guy who sounded like an economic populist on the campaign but since he's been in office has governed like a pro-plutocrat Republican. The other takeaway is maybe Elizabeth Warren made a mistake when she decided not to go on Fox.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 She's - her policies are extremely well thought-out, her political tactics sometimes too clever by half. Maybe she missed an opportunity.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 You know, it makes me think of the times when people would make jokes about how Rand Paul had gone so far to the right that he was coming back around to the left.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Yes.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 And it's that same kind of idea.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 That the ideological...             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Yes.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 ...Circle, it connects.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Well, populism - left, right - left-wing populism and right-wing populism overlap when it comes to economics.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 It's an interesting Venn diagram.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump were the closest on economics in 2016 - not anymore.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Now, on the other hand, though - maybe she missed an opportunity by not going on Fox. On the other hand, it doesn't seem to have scared a Fox opinion host away from praising her. And she just got representation on Fox's air. So it all worked out.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Yes, but just think what she could have done with Fox's audience...             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Oh, sure, totally. Yeah.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 ...If she'd gone on, yeah.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Danielle, what can't you let go of?             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 I can't let go of a vintage public radio clip that...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Oh, my.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 I happened to be chatting with Bob Mondello, our movie critic, this last week. And I don't know how we got on this topic. But he was like, there's an interview you have to hear. It is from, I believe, the early '80s. It is - maybe it's mid-'80s. It is Lynn Neary, one of our arts correspondents, interviewing Leon Redbone, the musician.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Leon Redbone recently died.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Who just died.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 ...Who recently died. Maybe this is how this came up. Now...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 ...What's interesting about - (laughter) I apologize. What's interesting about this is, like, you know when you guys are doing an interview with someone and you're thinking to yourself the whole time, this is not going to work on the radio? Like, the person - just the way they talk, it's slow, or it's one-word answers, that sort of thing.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 That feeling of dread while it's happening? Yeah.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 So I talked to Lynn about this. And she was like, yeah, that's the feeling I got during this interview. So here is the first clip of her talking to Leon Redbone.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)                </p><p>LYNN NEARY:                 Do you have a good time up there, doing that?             </p><p>LEON REDBONE:                 No, I never have a good time.             </p><p>LYNN NEARY:                 You never have a good time?             </p><p>LEON REDBONE:                 No, no, but I try.             </p><p>LYNN NEARY:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 So he gives these sorts of answers throughout this. This is, like, an eight-ish-minute, nine-minute thing.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Wait. So they put this on the air like this?             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 OK, so here's the thing. So I - so the reason that I brought this in is that it gets very surreal and meta because what they did was Lynn brought the tape back and said, you know, this - this isn't going to work. So they interspersed it with voiceovers of Lynn Neary. And they gave the voiceovers this weird reverb sort of thing.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 So where she's talking about, I was just thinking - like, she's talking about the thoughts that were going through her head, like, this wasn't going well. So here's - here's her asking him a different question.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)                </p><p>LYNN NEARY:                 But the music that you play, I get the feeling that you really genuinely love that kind of music. Is that right?             </p><p>                I knew it was a dumb question, but I had to get him going.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)                </p><p>LEON REDBONE:                 What else is there?             </p><p>LYNN NEARY:                 Did you grow up listening to that music?             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 It's just - (laughter).             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)                </p><p>LEON REDBONE:                 I listened to nothing else but.             </p><p>LYNN NEARY:                 Something people can sing along with.             </p><p>LEON REDBONE:                 Mmm-hmm.             </p><p>LYNN NEARY:                 Mmm-hmm. The man was definitely getting the better of me. Maybe it was the sunglasses. Anyway, eventually I managed to get a few glimpses...             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 I just...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 You know, this...             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 That is so worth pulling out of the archives. I mean, that is priceless.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 You know, this reminds me of the Gay Talese profile of \"Frank Sinatra Has A Cold.\"             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Oh, yeah.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 I don't know if you've ever read that.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Yes, yeah.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Where Frank Sinatra doesn't show up, and it's one of the - you learn it in journalism school. It's one of the most famous profiles of new journalism. And it's kind of - it changed the way people thought about talking about a celebrity who just doesn't want to play ball.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Yeah. So this is Lynn Neary snatching interview victory from the jaws of interview defeat.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 You know, you get the feeling that we maybe are not at NPR at the right time.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 You know, like, that there was a better time when we could have self-dialogue on the air. (Laughter).             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 I'm going to demand reverb for all the rest of my radio interviews (laughter).             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 And eight minutes for every story.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Oh, yeah.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Well, I already do that, and no one says yes. So anyway, that's my can't-let-it-go. What about you, Tam?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Oh, so what I cannot let go of is - it's sort of related to something that we keep talking about on this podcast, which is unidentified flying objects...             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Of course, it's important.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 ...UFOs. So there was something that showed up on the Doppler radar in San Diego County recently that was not a cloud. It was not. It turns out it was ladybugs.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 What?             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 I love this so much.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Not a cloud in the sky.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 How big does something have to be to get on the Doppler radar?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Well, according to the LA Times here, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service San Diego said that the ladybug bloom appears to be about 80 miles by 80 miles.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 We should clarify, this is many ladybugs, not just an 80-mile ladybug.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 It's a cloud. Yes. Yes, it was a cloud of ladybugs spread throughout the sky, flying at between 5,000 and 9,000 feet, with the most concentrated mass about 10 miles wide.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Oh, it's so cool.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Whoa, that's...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Yeah.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Does this happen every year?             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 No, this was just a freak non-meteorological situation.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 So if one ladybug is good luck, what is 80 miles of ladybug?             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 I mean, what I was saying to Tam...             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 That's a really good question.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 I was - I was tweeting this at Tam like, it's not a UFO. Maybe it's alien mind control of the ladybug.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 All right, Kelsey.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 (Laughter). Well, my can't-let-it-go is not just a can't-let-it-go for this week but I think kind of a lifetime can't-let-it-go. And it's Dolly Parton.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 She had a - (laughter).             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Of course.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 A worthy lifetime can't-let-it-go.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 There are so many reasons to love Dolly Parton. \"Jolene\" is a fantastic song. She gives out millions of free books to kids all over the country for free. But this week, she did an interview with The New York Times, a Q&amp;A, where she was talking about new expansion of Dollywood. But a couple of things really stood out to me.             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 Dollywood being her amusement park.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Yes, her amusement park. And the things that stood out to me is they asked her if she had good travel skincare tips. And she said her skincare tip is that she cleans her face in the morning because you never know if you're going to wreck the bus. You never know if you're going to be somewhere in a hotel where there's going to be a fire. So I leave my makeup on at night and clean my face in the morning.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Super weird.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 So hold on...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 That is a violation of everything we've ever been told.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 So if I have to go running out of my burning hotel at 3 a.m., the idea is at least I...             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 You'll be made up.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 OK, just checking. (Laughter).             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 She probably does not want to be photographed without her makeup on.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Sure, I just...             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 Well, it gets better because they ask her if she's ever been on any of the rides at Dollywood. She says she doesn't ride the rides, in part because she gets motion sickness, which I can understand. But she's also really worried about losing her wig or her shoes. And she says, I don't like to get messed up. I'm going to have some handsome man mess me up. I don't want a ride doing it.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Nice.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 She also says that her favorite snacks are potted meat and Tabasco sauce. (Laughter).             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Wow.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 All in all, it's a really good Q&amp;A. Dolly Parton.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Dolly Parton is an A-plus person.             </p><p>KELSEY SNELL:                 So good.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"JOLENE\")                </p><p>DOLLY PARTON:                 (Singing) Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene...             </p><p>TAMARA KEITH:                 All right, that is a wrap for today. We will be back as soon as there's political news you need to know about. But before we go, a quick reminder that we've been hitting the road, heading to Iowa and New Hampshire to interview the Democratic candidates running for president. In your podcast feeds already, you'll find conversations with Senator Cory Booker, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. And this weekend, Scott is going to interview a couple more candidates. Next week I have one. So join us on the campaign trail by seeking out those episodes.             </p><p>                I'm Tamara Keith.

This podcast was recorded at...             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SCOTT DETROW:                 5:06 Eastern on Thursday, October 25.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ERIN BUDDE:                 Things may have changed by the time you hear this. All right, here's the show.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                            (SOUNDBITE OF THE BIG TOP ORCHESTRA'S \"TEETER BOARD: FOLIES BERGERE (MARCH AND TWO-STEP)\"                </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SCOTT DETROW:                 Hey, there. It's the NPR POLITICS podcast here with our weekly roundup. More suspected pipe bombs were discovered today, this time addressed to former Vice President Joe Biden and actor <person><nameText>Robert De Niro. </nameText></person>The story continues to have huge political implications. We're also going to talk about health care. It remains the top issue on Democrats' minds. And in the closing weeks of the campaign, Republicans have been pushing back hard. We'll talk about that.             </p><p>                I'm Scott Detrow. I cover Congress.             </p><p>PHIL EWING:                 I'm Phil Ewing, national security editor.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 And I'm Mara Liasson, national political correspondent.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So Phil, in our podcast yesterday, we were talking about six packages. We knew that they'd been sent to former President Obama, former Secretary of State <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton, </nameText></person>former CIA Director <person><nameText>John Brennan </nameText></person>through CNN, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, former Attorney General Eric Holder and Democratic donor George Soros. There are new details as of this morning.             </p><p>PHIL EWING:                 That's right. Now we have 10 total suspicious packages against eight total targets - so those six that you just mentioned plus the former vice president Joe Biden and the actor <person><nameText>Robert De Niro. </nameText></person>Our listeners will remember him from \"Raging Bull\" and \"Analyze This\" and the \"Fockers\" movies and so forth and so on. And...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 \"Taxi Driver\" feels on point for this story.             </p><p>PHIL EWING:                 \"Taxi Driver\" was also a movie that De Niro was in. There was...             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 And a big Trump critic.             </p><p>PHIL EWING:                 A very big critic of Trump.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 More to the point, yes.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 More to the point, a profane Trump critic.             </p><p>PHIL EWING:                 That is so. Those suspicious packages were discovered on Thursday morning in Delaware at mail facilities there and outside a building in Tribeca in New York City used by De Niro's companies. You know, it's a really interesting story. The guy who found this package that was addressed to De Niro received it and then later saw on TV some of these pictures of the ones that arrived at CNN on Wednesday. And he recognized the one as being similar to the one that he had received earlier, and that's what put him on his guard. He was able to use his contacts with the NYPD to call the bomb squad.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Phil, are all of these packages similar? Or - we haven't heard that much about the Maxine Waters packages. Are they also same manila envelope, same kind of address format?             </p><p>PHIL EWING:                 According to investigators, that's one thing that has unified all these devices. They found the first couple of ones - the first one went to George Soros' house outside of New York City - and it was these manila Bubble Wrap envelopes that had typewritten addresses, had typewritten return address to Debbie Wasserman Schultz's office down in Florida - she's the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee - and a number of postage stamps on them.             </p><p>                Our Miles Parks was talking to former investigators and specialists today who said one of the signs, actually, of a potential suspicious device in the mail is having too much postage because alleged bombers think, I don't want the postmen to hold this up. I'm going to put more postage on this than it needs. And some of these have been canceled, indicating they traveled through the mail systems. And some of them have not, suggesting they might have been delivered by a courier or hand-delivered. But yes, we understand that all of them look alike, which is helping investigators.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And given the fact that these packages did not explode, I assume there's a lot of immediate leads for the FBI - you know, tracking information and things like that, security at any sort of post office they may have been dropped off at. Do we know what they're looking at? Have they figured out anything in the last 24 hours?             </p><p>PHIL EWING:                 What they've figured out, they are not saying. So there have been a couple of briefings. Our correspondents - our colleagues Ryan Lucas and Carrie Johnson and Miles Parks have been doing a lot of reporting on this. But investigators are not tipping their hand very much about where this stands. One thing we do know is the package that went on Monday to George Soros' residence was protectively destroyed by a bomb squad there. And so investigators have been able to take material from that containment unit they used and begin to analyze it since they now have versions of the devices before the explosion and after the explosion. And that can help them conclude some things about what it contains.             </p><p>                One other thing that we know for sure is that powder that has been in some of these things is not biological. So if there were concerns that this might be another installment of the anthrax attacks from 2001, that is not the case.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 So Phil, do investigators think this is all of it, or do they think there might be more packages out there?             </p><p>PHIL EWING:                 The FBI has been saying all along they cannot rule out the idea that there may be more of these moving through the mail. You know, you've seen over the past week that these kind of have been arriving in tranches as, you know, the way a package will go from the local post office to the depot facility to a truck to another one and then eventually be delivered. So we may get another day or more worth of these arrivals or discoveries. And they've also said that they haven't found any since the three that were found Thursday morning. So no one knows right now what that adds up to except that they're not prepared to say that this discovery phase is complete at this point.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So let's shift gears a little bit. When we taped yesterday, we mentioned that President Trump was on his way to a campaign event in Wisconsin. And the big question was, how would he handle this given how divisive he usually is at these events? You know, what would he say given that these alleged pipe bombs have all been sent to people that he regularly criticizes at rallies like this? So let's take a listen to how President Trump started out the rally.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 We want all sides to come together in peace and harmony. We can do it.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 A few minutes later, though...             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 The language of moral condemnation and destructive routine, these are arguments and disagreements that have to stop. No one should carelessly compare political opponents to historical villains, which is done often. It's done all the time - got to stop.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Mara, he seems to be pointing out something that...             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 He doesn't like being called Hitler.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Who would?             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Who would? So moral condemnation is bad and somehow connected, maybe, to these attacks. But he went on to show, as he often does, that he's very aware of his performance and his behavior. He's a guy who likes to read the stage directions. So it's always very meta.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 The Democrats are for higher taxes, more regulation...             </p><p>                            (BOOING)                </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 ...And more top-down government control.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 So he went into his usual riff about how Democrats are socialists. But he wanted the audience to understand that he was really dialing it back because of this incident.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 And by the way, do you see how nice I'm behaving tonight? This is like...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 Have you ever seen this? We're all behaving very well.             </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PEOPLE:                 Yeah.             </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 And hopefully, we can keep it that way. Right?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 That reminds me of the final weeks of 2016 when he was very on script for several days in a row - no controversies. And at one point he said onstage, steady, Donald; keep it together, Donald; be cool, Donald.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And then a little bit after that, he did what he often does - though the tones were a little more muted - and that was cast blame on the media.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 The media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone and to stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stories - have to do it.             </p><p>                            (CHEERING)                </p><p>DONALD TRUMP:                 Have to do it.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And then this morning on Twitter, he criticized the media in much more blunt terms, as he usually does - so curious what both of you think happens over the next few days because President Trump clearly thinks the best way to energize Republican voters is to go after Democrats hard.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Really hard. And he was depriving himself of what he considers to be his most effective tools, in that rally last night. You know, he seemed to be suggesting that the media brought these attacks on themselves because they are negative about him. He seemed to be saying it was their fault. When he says they also have a responsibility, what I thought of - oh, in addition to who? He certainly doesn't want to take responsibility for himself.             </p><p>                But I think the big question for me is, what does he do going forward? He clearly has decided that it's important to dial it back. And does he feel that that is going to hurt his effort to get his base energized in the 10 days he's got left? Is he going to chafe at that? We don't know.             </p><p>PHIL EWING:                 A lot of this depends on where this story goes because, in some of these cases in the past, the FBI has arrested somebody very quickly. In fact, we - our Ryan Lucas covered a package bombing case where the FBI got the guy within 24 hours. If we have a suspect like this and this kind of closes up and goes away, depending on the outcome of that story, Trump could go back to his old form because this could be resolved. But if that person is political in one direction or another, clearly, that's going to affect the way the president, the way Democrats respond.             </p><p>                Or if this goes away because it takes the FBI years to catch somebody, that could also affect the way the rest of this campaign runs. You know, it took them years to catch the Unabomber, took them years to try to investigate the anthrax attacks in 2001. And if this story drops out of the news not because it's resolved but because it goes into a quiet period of investigation, that will inform the way the president, Democrats and everyone else in the United States conducts themselves ahead of these elections.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Right. And it also matters - are we going to have more pipe bombs, and who are they going to be addressed to? All of the recipients of these packages share something in common. They're all targets of the president. They've been critical of him. This seems to be a real act of political partisan terrorism.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 A lot of this is out of President Trump's control, out of any other politician's control. And when you talk about, how could this affect the midterms? - it's hard to tell. But we know one way is that this is two days in a row now where all of the news coverage focused on this event and it didn't focus on...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW AND MARA LIASSON:                 ...The caravan...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 ...Or many other things.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Yeah.             </p><p>PHIL EWING:                 Scott is exactly right about this story taking everything over.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 That's a really good point.             </p><p>PHIL EWING:                 It also took over the fact that financial markets did a total nosedive on Wednesday. The big indices - the Dow Jones, the S&amp;P 500 - erased all of their gains in the year 2018. Now, does that matter to most people in the real economy? Maybe it does, and maybe it doesn't. But the shorthand that Americans use to identify the health of the economy in the United States are those headline-level indices. And with those out of the news, the argument that might be happening between the political partisans who are running for these November midterm elections about Trump's claims about the economy has been taken away because we're talking about the tone and the rhetoric and - should we cool things off, and whose fault is it? - which means that is helpful to the president. It means his economic message can continue to be an economic message in a way that it might not otherwise been able to have.             </p><p>MARA LIASSON:                 Yeah, although his economic message has already faded way into the background because he chose the culture war issues as the thing that was going to work for him - immigration, race. And he really hasn't been relying on the economy as much. He tried to revive the idea of the tax cuts - 'cause the original ones got very unpopular - with this idea that we're going to have a new 10 percent middle-class tax cut.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 He's also been pushing back on Democratic criticisms of Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And that is something that we are going to talk about next with Scott Horsley and Danielle Kurtzleben. But before we end this conversation, Phil, anything else we should be looking for in the coming days when it comes to the investigation?             </p><p>PHIL EWING:                 The short answer is more of these suspicious packages. If this turns into a long-term story, that's going to be potentially problematic from a political perspective. And the other big, important thing here is none of these have gone off. These have not injured or killed anyone. Ideally, that will continue to be the case. But if this turns from a story that no one knows about whether or not it's a hoax into something that actually has taken a human life or injured somebody, that's also going to change the conversation about the political tone in the United States in a very big way.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 All right. Phil Ewing and Mara Liasson, thanks to both of you.             </p><p>PHIL EWING:                 Thank you.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 We're going to take a quick break. And we will be right back with Danielle and Scott to talk health care.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And we are back. And we've got Danielle Kurtzleben and Scott Horsley here. Hey, guys.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Hey.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 Hi.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So let's take a few minutes here to talk about health care because, all year, we've been talking about how Democrats see health care as their best issue with voters, which is so striking because from 2010 on, after Obamacare passed, Democrats were really on defense when it came to health care. And they lost a lot of seats because of it. Now things have turned in a lot of different ways. Democrats talk a lot about health care. They think it's working. And Republicans seem to think so, as well, because Republicans have really played a lot of defense on health care lately, specifically when it comes to whether or not they voted to repeal, get rid of pre-existing condition coverage. So let's start with this. How are people feeling about the state of health care right now?             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 I would say concerned - bare minimum. But if you're a Democrat, you're much more worried. I mean, one thing we do know - I can tell you from both being on the trail and from polling data is that both Republicans and Democrats are worried about the health care system, worried about access, worried about costs. But Democrats are much more worried. And this is reflected in what voters tell you, and it's reflected in ads. Democrats have just been running more health care ads throughout the entire midterm cycle than Republicans have.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD MONTAGE)                </p><p>ANTONIO DELGADO:                 I'm determined to fight for affordable, accessible health care, not take it away.             </p><p>HEIDI HEITKAMP:                 Like 300,000 North Dakotans, Denise has a pre-existing condition. That used to mean no health insurance.             </p><p>JOE MANCHIN:                 Now the threat is Patrick Morrisey's lawsuit to take away health care from people with pre-existing conditions.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 And what Democrats are targeting is the assault that Republicans have waged over the last two years on the Affordable Care Act. Republicans, of course, campaigned saying they wanted to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. They weren't able to do that thanks to John McCain's thumbs-down in the Senate. But the Trump administration has been steadily whittling away at the Affordable Care Act for the last going on two years.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And it's worth pausing for a moment and walking through all the different ways the Trump administration and Republicans of Congress have tried to undermine the Affordable Care Act or have tried to replace the Affordable Care Act - because a lot of the ads come down to, you voted to do this. And Republicans are responding, no, I didn't. So let's start with actions taken by the Trump administration. Scott, what are some of the biggest things that President Trump has done on his own to affect the Affordable Care Act?             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 They have offered up a variety of alternative insurance plans - mostly sort of skimpier plans that would be cheaper and might appeal to younger, healthier people but could also have the effect of raising prices for older, sicker people. They have done away with the marketing budget to try to encourage enrollment in the Affordable Care Act's health care marketplaces. They have ended subsidies for insurance companies, which has had the effect of driving up premiums on the ACA marketplaces. And then Congress, as part of their tax overhaul, did away with the tax penalty for people who don't have insurance. So all this has sort of been an attack on the ACA insurance marketplace, which, despite all that, has proven to be pretty resilient. Sign-ups have stayed pretty level since before the Trump administration came in. And the most recent census data says we still have about 91 percent of the American public covered by health insurance.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Danielle, of course, most of 2017 was focused on Republican attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare. They ultimately failed. But what should we know about what was in those bills, how the House bill that passed and how the Senate bill that didn't pass because of John McCain would have changed Obamacare?             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 One of the biggest things that's most salient in this election cycle is what that bill - what those bills would have done to pre-existing conditions. This is what Democrats are attacking Republicans on in so many of these ads, saying that Representative So-And-So voted for the Obamacare repeal-and-replace bill. That bill would have done away with your protections for pre-existing conditions.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And, Scott, Republicans running for re-election are defending themselves from these attacks in an interesting way, basically saying, how dare you insinuate I don't care about people with pre-existing conditions?             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 That's right. But it's interesting that Republicans are on the defensive here. This is really the mirror image of what we've seen in the past few election cycles, when Republicans were on the attack, going after the Affordable Care Act, promising to repeal Obamacare. And Democrats were largely staying quiet. They knew that the Affordable Care Act wasn't terribly popular at that point. Now we have voters saying while they might not love Obamacare writ large, they do like various provisions of it. And you've got Democrats running about half their ads defending those provisions, putting the GOP on the defensive.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 When you look at television ads - when you compare pro-Democrat to pro-Republican - that were put out this year, pro-Democratic ads - yes, like Scott said, more than half of them have been about health care. This is according to the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracks these things. Here's how emboldened Democrats feel this year. That's compared to from 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016 - in those years, roughly 7 to 10 percent of Democratic ads were about health care. Democrats did not want to touch health care during that time. Now this year, they are all about it.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 At the same time, we have a group of Republican attorneys general who have gone to court in Texas to try to strike down the Affordable Care Act. Two of those state attorneys general happen to be running for Senate, one in Missouri and one in West Virginia. Josh Hawley, the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri, has been running ads saying, oh, I definitely would protect people with pre-existing medical conditions, even though he's gone to court to unwind exactly that protection in the Affordable Care Act.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF POLITICAL AD, \"DRIVEN\")                </p><p>JOSH HAWLEY:                 Earlier this year, we learned our oldest has a rare, chronic disease - a pre-existing condition. We know what that's like. I'm Josh Hawley. I support forcing insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So what is at the basis of all of this focus on health care? I mean, do people care more about health care now than they did two years ago or four years ago?             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 One is that Obamacare is somewhat more popular now than it was back during a lot of the Obama administration. If you look at polling data from, say, 2014 and 2015 Obamacare was generally seen net unfavorably - more people seeing it unfavorably than favorably. That flipped right around the time that Donald Trump took office. Right around January 2017, you started seeing people about evenly split or more likely than not to say - to see it favorably.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And is there a partisan breakdown in that? Is it more Democrat or Republican support?             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 I mean, Democrats definitely do support Obamacare more than Republicans. Absolutely. But when you look at individual provisions like, for example, pre-existing conditions like we've been talking about, those sorts of things are very popular. Things like that, protecting people up until they're 26, letting them stay on their parents' insurance - people love those. The problem is when you look at the individual mandate, which is sort of the glue that helped keep Obamacare together, that is something that's unpopular. And so that was at the core of a lot of Republican attacks on Obamacare during that whole time.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 But, Scott, something you always pointed out when we talked about this during repeal efforts is that those two things have to go with each other to work, right? If you're going to make insurance companies cover all the stuff that's expensive, you need to make people buy insurance.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 That's the economic argument, even if the political argument would be, let's keep all the popular stuff and get rid of the stuff that people don't like.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So we're talking about this with less than two weeks to go before the midterms. As much as we can predict the future, what would it mean if the House is in Democratic control versus Republican control when it comes to bills being passed that deal with health care?             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 If Democrats were to win, say, the House and Republicans were to keep control of the Senate, then Democrats would at least be able to prevent the Republicans from making another run at repealing the Affordable Care Act. They might also be able to use their oversight powers to discourage the administration from chipping away at the Affordable Care Act, although the White House would still have considerable leverage to make administrative changes in the law. Now, Democrats - some Democrats on the left have been calling to go further than the Affordable Care Act and pass something like \"Medicare-for-all,\" which Bernie Sanders has championed. If they were to control just one chamber, of course, they wouldn't be able to do that, but they might be able to make some noise about it.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 This is where I want to jump in and also point out what Republicans are saying about health care this year, which is it's not just playing defense. It's not just pushing back on Democratic ads. I mean, one-third of Republican ads are about health care. It's less than Democrats, but it's still sizable. And what they're doing aside from playing defense is also attacking Democrats on \"Medicare-for-all,\" saying, you know, my opponent so-and-so is just too liberal. She wants to - or he wants to - take away your Medicare as you know it, take away your health care as you know it. If you like your employer-sponsored health care, so-and-so is going to get rid of it if they vote for \"Medicare-for-all.\" And you can see that shaping the health care discussion not just this year but for years to come as more Democrats back that.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 There's a lot of fear mongering going on there. We saw, for example, the president wrote an op-ed for USA Today, was widely criticized for factual inaccuracies. In fact, USA Today itself had to run a fact check the following day. But it has long been a successful gambit for either party to play on the fears of Medicare recipients - that the other party might try to go after your Medicare - in particular because older people are very regular voters.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And if Republicans keep control, can we expect more attempts to repeal Obamacare? Or do you think the current climate the way this has played politically this cycle would keep them from trying to do that?             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 I mean, you can certainly imagine that there would be more attempts. But then again, I mean, there's also - given how fearful so many Americans have been about health care during this cycle, especially about things like pre-existing conditions I wonder - and I'm just guessing here because who knows? - I wonder if they might be a bit ginger about the specific provisions they might be attacking, like pre-existing conditions.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 I think there are definitely some Republican activists who will want to finish the job now that John McCain has been replaced in the Senate by a more reliable vote for the Republican agenda. But Danielle is right. There will also certainly be some wariness, given the backlash they've gotten already.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And if Republicans gain some seats in the Senate, three Republicans wouldn't be able to stop a repeal effort, like they did this year. All right. We're going to take a quick break. And when we come back, Can't Let It Go.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And we are back. And we're going to end the show like we do every single week - by talking about the one thing we cannot let go of, politics or otherwise. Danielle, you are up first.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 All right. I want to talk about a poll.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Ooh.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 I know. But I promise it will be interesting. Or at least it's interesting to me, and that's all that matters.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Can't Let It Go is off the rails already.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Everybody strap in. All right. So this is a new study from a few political scientists at Georgetown. It is about the institutions in America that people have trust in.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Oh, snap.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Yes. So we've talked on this podcast before about how Americans' trust in government at all sorts of other things is declining. So what these people did was they gave Americans a big, long list of 20 different institutions - military, business, religion, banks, et cetera. So they did this. And they said, OK, Democrats, Republicans, rank these to say who you trust most and who you trust least. All right. So from one to 20, one being they trust them the most to 20 being they trust them the least, where do you think, for example, Democrats might put colleges and universities.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 Pretty high.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yeah. One, two.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Yeah. Two - No. 2. Yeah, very good. I mean, some of - so these fall along partisan lines kind of. You know, for - similarly, Republicans - where do you think they put military?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 One.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Yes, they put military at one. But here's what's interesting. And saw people on Twitter freaking out about this. Amazon, among Democrats - where do you think they put it?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Ooh.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 Alexa, where do they put Amazon?             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 Ten.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Seventeen.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 One.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 One. Oh, so it's - OK.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Likewise, where do you think Republicans...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I thought this was some sort of, like, trick question.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 No, no, no, no. No trick. Where do you think Republicans put Amazon?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Probably lower because of Jeff Bezos.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 They put it at three. I'll just give that to you.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Oh.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 Wow. So is, like, Amazon the highest - you know, across the board, is Amazon, like, the most-trusted institution in America right now?             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Amazon and the military, I suppose, because Amazon is one for Democrats, three for Republicans. The military is one for Republicans, three for Democrats. But I got to say, like, that's surprising. And that's the takeaway that everybody on Twitter was freaking out about. But looking at this, I thought to myself, wait a minute. Like, it's kind of apples and oranges, right? Like, if I say I trust Amazon more than the federal government, like, has one job, and it's sending me my giant thing of trash bags in two days. At least in my life, that's its job, as opposed to the government, which I expect to, you know, do complex business regulations and administer health care for elderly America - all of that. You know, it's like, yes, here's my coffee cup. I trust my coffee cup more than the federal government. And that's not a knock on the federal government.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 Secure the border with one click.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Oh, my God (laughter).             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Not making \"Jack Ryan\" remakes for us.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 So anyway...             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Come on, federal government. It is interesting to me how, like, Facebook has taken a big hit, right?             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Yes.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 But, like, all the big tech companies have just as much personal information about you - Amazon maybe even more so.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 That's also true.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 But it seems like we're cool with Amazon having it. We're OK with Google having it. But we have second thoughts about Facebook having it.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 True.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 Well, because Amazon sends you your giant bag of trash bags. And Facebook uses it to send the digital equivalent of a giant bag of trash.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Facebook - 17 for Democrats and 19 for Republicans.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I guessed 17 for Amazon.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Seeing inane updates from people you went to high school with I guess is just a thing that, you know, people don't love anymore.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Scott Horsley, you are No. 1 on my most trusted people on the NPR Politics desk. So...             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Hey.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 Hey, the Scotts have to stick together, Danielle.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 That's fair.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 Well, my Can't Let It Go is also poll adjacent, and it comes from a tweet from Ezra Klein over at Vox. He was writing about the uncertainty associated with various pre-election polls and how forecasters like Nate Silver at FiveThirtyEight have been warning people not to put too much stock in those forecasts, a lesson you'd think we would've all learned pretty well back in 2016. Silver has been stressing that if polls are off by just 2 or 3 percent one way or the other, which is within the margin of error, it could have huge consequences for control of the House and the Senate. And he was just urging people not to put too much weight on those forecasts.             </p><p>                So here's what Ezra Klein wrote. (Reading) I've come to think election forecasts are like Q-tips. You buy Q-tips, and the box is covered in warnings to keep them out of your ears. But the whole industry is based on people jamming them in their ears.             </p><p>                Now, I don't know a whole lot about polling uncertainty, but I do know Q-tips. And what this reminds me of was this segment that our friends over at Planet Money did a while back with a writer from Ezra's old Wonkblog outfit who had documented what may be the most widely ignored warning of all time. Take a listen.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED BROADCAST)                </p><p>ROBERT SMITH:                 Roberto Ferdman is a reporter for Wonkblog at The Washington Post. He does not use Q-tips anymore, until I asked him to.             </p><p>                OK, you have Q-tips with you?             </p><p>ROBERTO FERDMAN:                 I do.             </p><p>ROBERT SMITH:                 Let's put them inside the ear canal.             </p><p>ROBERTO FERDMAN:                 Oh, my God.             </p><p>ROBERT SMITH:                 (Laughter) It's, like, amazing.             </p><p>ROBERTO FERDMAN:                 It feels so good (laughter).             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 So if this podcast is not enough aural stimulation for you, check out Episode 683 of Planet Money.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Putting a Q-tip in your ears one of the most relaxing things you can do. It's so relaxing.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 What?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Yes.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 I see it as a necessity.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 The comments of Scott Detrow are not representative of National Public Radio or its underwriters.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Do go on.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 OK. Well - no, no, no. I've said too much, apparently.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 I want to pick your brain.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 No, it's just like somebody who's reading those FiveThirtyEight polls to stroke their political nerve endings. You're going against the documented warnings right there on the box.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I've said too much.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Oh, my God.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 OK, Scott, other than your Q-tip, what can't you let go of this week?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 OK. My Can't Let It Go is actually perpetual for the last month. I have spent a lot of time thinking about it and contemplating it - and making me very happy. And that is the Philadelphia Flyers' new mascot, Gritty.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Yes.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 I love Gritty. I love everything about Gritty. I've loved Gritty from day one. If you somehow don't know Gritty he is the new mascot unveiled by the Flyers who seemed to take a page from their cousins across town - well not across town - down the parking lot, the Philadelphia Phillies, who have the Philly Phanatic, who's this lovable Muppet-looking guy who kind of wiggles his torso and shoots hot dogs at people. And he's great.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Doesn't he have kind of a megaphone-ish sort of apparatus for a mouth?             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 His nose. Yeah, yeah.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 Nose, yeah.             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 So Gritty looks like that but like - I don't know the polite way to say it. He has a crazy beard. He has googly eyes. He looks like he's coming to kill you.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 And in fact, within a day of Gritty's rollout to the world he threatened to kill the mascot of the Pittsburgh Penguins.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 He fell on his butt, like, four or five times the first time he was on the ice. And he has just gone uphill from there. I love Gritty. Several other people on her desk love Gritty. And in fact, my fellow congressional reporter Kelsey Snell was in southern New Jersey in the Philadelphia suburbs for a story last week and took time out of her reporting to try and find some sort of Gritty gear or Gritty bobblehead or something to put on our desk. And here's the thing. Gritty has caught the world by storm - so much so that the Flyers did not have merchandise ready.             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 Oh. Call Amazon.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 What do you trust more, Gritty or Amazon?             </p><p>SCOTT HORSLEY:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>SCOTT DETROW:                 Gritty. I trust Gritty.             </p><p>DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN:                 OK, yeah, yeah. I like it.

You May Have the Basis for an REA or a Claim, November 8, 2019, Michelle Litteken In recent years, tariffs have been imposed on an array of goods, ranging from electronics to solar panels to industrial equipment. For companies bidding on contracts now, the tariffs may not be a concern, as the tariffs can be factored into the pricing proposal.However, for government contractors performing contracts that were awarded before the tariffs were imposed, the tariffs may result in increased and unanticipated costs. Those increased costs may provide the basis for a request for equitable adjustment (REA) or a claim under the Contract Disputes Act. </p><p>[Read More[5]]2019 GAO Bid Protest Annual Report: Number of Protests Filed Drops by 16%, November 8, 2019, Michelle Litteken The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently issued itsannual report to Congress[6], which provides data concerning protest filings for Fiscal Year (FY) 2019. GAO's annual report confirms a sharp decrease in the number of protests filed.Notably, 2,198 protests were filed in FY 2019\u2014a 16% decrease from FY 2018; however, the effectiveness rate of protests in FY 2019 was 44%, which was consistent with the effectiveness rate in FY 2018.

This is a simple guide for calculating your company's size, with supporting resources from SBA.

Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen and Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim delivered remarks at the PCSF Press Conference, where Deputy Attorney General Rosen commented that PCSF will 'target bid-rigging and other antitrust crimes that can cost American taxpayers billions of dollars each year by undermining the federal government's processes for purchasing goods and services.' Assistant Attorney General Delrahim then introduced the U.S. Attorney partners and Inspector General partners of the Procurement Collusion Strike Force. Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen's full remarks can be read here[12], Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim's full remarks can be read here[13], and the DOJ's official press release regarding the formation of the new Procurement Collusion Strike Force can be read here[14].Contractor Suspensions and Debarments Report Government Executive reported that the number of contractor suspensions and debarments in fiscal year (FY)2018 was nearly double that of 2009, when an interagency committee started formally tracking them, but federal agencies are also increasingly relying on alternative measures to resolve disputes. In FY 2018, agencies surveyed by theInteragency Suspension and Debarment Committee[15]reported 480 suspensions (temporary exclusions when an investigation is ongoing), 1,542 proposed debarments, and 1,334 debarments (exclusions for a set period of time after an investigation or legal proceedings against a contractor), according to the committee's annual report[16]. However, since FY 2014, the number of suspensions and debarments has been decreasing.

Vendors will also have the opportunity to participate in SHARKSEER, a program formerly run by the National Security Agency that uses artificial intelligence to defend Pentagon networks against zero-day exploits. DISA also releaseda spreadsheet[20]detailing hundreds of other contracts the agency plans to solicit and bid in the coming years, many of which officials expect to award in FY 2020.

The rule proposes to eliminate the requirement that 8(a) Participants seeking to be awarded an 8(a) contract as a joint venture submit the joint venture to SBA for review and approval prior to contract award, revise several 8(a) BD program regulations to reduce unnecessary or excessive burdens on 8(a) Participants, and clarify other related regulatory provisions to eliminate confusion among small businesses and procuring activities. In addition, except for orders and Blanket Purchase Agreements issued under the General Services Administration's Federal Supply Schedule Program, the rule proposes to require a business concern to recertify its size and/or socioeconomic status for all set-aside orders under unrestricted multiple award contracts (MAC) The rule also proposes to require a business concern to recertify its socioeconomic status for all set-aside orders where the required socioeconomic status for the order differs from that of the underlying set-aside MAC contract (e.g., HUBZone set-aside order against a small business set-aside MAC). Finally, except for orders or Blanket Purchase Agreements issued under any Federal Supply Schedule contract, the rule also allows for size and/or socioeconomic protests at the order-level for set-aside orders issued against unrestricted MACs, or for set-aside orders based on a different socioeconomic status from the underlying set-aside MAC. Comments to the proposed rule must be received on or before January 17, 2020. Read the published version here[46]. PilieroMazza's highlights are available here[47].Overview, Impact, and Relationship of SBA's OIG with Congress The Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports that Congress created offices of inspector general (OIG) to assist in its oversight of the executive branch. OIGs provide independent, nonpartisan analysis, conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, to identify and recommend ways to limit waste, fraud, and abuse in federal programs and enhance program and operational efficiency and effectiveness. OIGs' activities supplement and complement those of the GAO, which serves a similar, though not identical, role in assisting congressional oversight of the executive branch. Together, OIGs and GAO provide Congress with information and analysis needed to conduct effective oversight and, in the process, help Congress maintain its balance of power with the presidency. The SBA OIG was created under authority of the Inspector General Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-452, as amended). Its three primary statutory purposes are to conduct and supervise audits and investigations of the SBA's programs and operations; recommend policies designed to promote the economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of the SBA's programs and operations and to prevent and detect fraud and abuse; and keep both the SBA Administrator and Congress 'fully and currently informed about problems and deficiencies relating to the administration of such programs and operations and the necessity for and progress of corrective action.'CRS examined the SBA OIG's statutory authorities; reporting requirements; funding; staffing and organizational structure; and recent activities. It also examined the SBA OIG's impact on monetary savings, SBA programs and operations, and legislation affecting the agency.

This is Sam's Aunt Betty. This week on the show, NPR White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe and Washington Post senior tech policy reporter Tony Romm. All right. Let's start the show.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                            (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IZZO [H.O.V.A.]\")                </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UNIDENTIFIED SINGERS:                 (Singing) H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JAY-Z:                 Welcome, ladies and gentlemen...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Hey, y'all. From NPR, I'm Sam Sanders. IT'S BEEN A MINUTE. Happy weekend to my listeners and to my guests. They're both in D.C. this week - Ayesha Rascoe, White House reporter at NPR, who just ran into studio after a TV hit...             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 ...'Cause I saw you on TV a few minutes ago...             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 (Laughter) Yeah.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 ...And friend of the show Tony Romm, tech reporter at The Washington Post - senior tech policy reporter.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 That's a commentary on my age.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 So we're joined in studio today by one of my favorite rappers of all time. His name is Jay-Z. He's in the news this week.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yeah.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 This song is one of his best - \"Izzo.\"             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 I agree.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IZZO (H.O.V.A.)\")                </p><p>JAY-Z:                 (Rapping) H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A. For sheezy, my neezy, keep my arms so breezy...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Doesn't it take you back?             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 It does.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Oh, man. I feel old.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Like, this is, like, my era. Right?             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Yeah, it is.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Oh, yeah.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Quite right.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 This is my era.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 But anyways, Jay-Z is in the news this week because he announced the strangest of partnerships. Him and his company Roc Nation are partnering with the NFL.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Right.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 The league is going to use Jay-Z's company, Roc Nation, to advise on entertainment, including helping pick acts for the Super Bowl halftime show. And Jay-Z will work on \"social justice initiatives\" - quote-unquote.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yeah.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Did this catch y'all off-guard?             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Well, for a lot of reasons, including - don't the lyrics of the album that he did with Beyonce have a line about how he doesn't need a Super Bowl?             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yeah.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah. So he's talked publicly before about not liking the politics of the NFL...             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Right.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 ...And refusing to play the halftime show for the Super Bowl. So he has had an antagonistic relationship with them for years, especially over the way that they treated players like Colin Kaepernick taking a knee before football games. He was on Kaepernick's side. He's worn Kaepernick jerseys. And so this partnership announced this week made everyone scratch their head because Colin Kaepernick is still not back in the league.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yeah. And I - you know, I'm always careful about, like, saying celebrities have to get involved in this or speak out on this issue. I feel like, you know, they're celebrities. Like, that's not necessary. But he inserted himself into this issue.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Exactly.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 And now you're...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 You're on that side.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 You're on that side.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Right.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 So...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 And there was a really interesting - this is more of a speculative story. And NBC - NBC Sports had this thing about how they wondered if this was the precursor for Jay-Z trying to own a team.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Oh.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Which I looked...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 He has enough money. Just buy the team (laughter).             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Well, apparently, he kind of doesn't.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Oh.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yeah, yeah.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Apparently, you need much more than he actually has. And then there's this added thing about the NFL, where you - I think you need permission of the owners. And so one way...             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Usually.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Oh.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yeah, usually.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 It is so weird to me. In large part, also, like, the cynical part of me thinks that this gives the NFL cover because they've had an antagonistic relationship with a lot of black celebrities, like Rihanna and Cardi B, who said they would not play the Super Bowl halftime show. But Jay-Z, whatever the case, I still like your body of work.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Me, too.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 I think I've spent a lot of time with every Jay-Z album - except for that one he did with Beyonce.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Oh, really?             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 (Whispering) It wasn't good. It wasn't.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 I liked that album.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 You didn't like it? (Laughter).             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 I did.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 What? The last one?             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, \"IZZO (H.O.V.A.)\")                </p><p>JAY-Z:                 (Rapping) For shizzle, my nizzle, used to dribble down in VA. H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A. That's the anthem. Get'cha damn hands up. H to the Izz-O, V to the Izz-A...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Anyway, we're going to have to get to the news-news.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 We're going to start the show as we do every week, asking my panelists to describe their week of news in only three words. Ayesha, you cover the White House. And I want you to talk about your three words, which have to do with the way that the Trump White House is dealing with this crazy, crazy week in the economy.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yes. So my three words - and I went back and forth on this, but I landed on mind your business...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 OK. OK.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 ...Because that is what they are trying - they're trying to mind - right now the Trump administration is trying to mind the business of this country. And they, for a long time, were also kind of saying they were going to deal with the U.S., and everybody else could mind their business.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah, yeah.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 But we're going to deal with us.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 But the issue...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 It was very America first for a while.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 America first.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 But the issue, of course, is the U.S. is connected to the rest of the world. And you can't...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Economy is global.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 (Laughter) You can't just deal with the U.S. and not with everybody else. So we've had - it's been a rocky week.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 So you had some good news. Consumer spending, retail sales are still strong. So that came out, and that was good. But then you have manufacturing output is down. That's an issue. And then you had Germany's economy shrink.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 And...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Negative growth in Germany, falling growth in China...             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yeah.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 ...Lingering questions over how the trade war is playing out.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yeah.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 And then there was one day this week, Ayesha, we saw the Dow lose 800 points...             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yes.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 ...In one day.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yes - because of the crazy inverted yield curve.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Which you've got to just...             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 ...Sidebar and have you explain to us for a second.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 OK. So I - before my life here at NPR, I did - I was a business journalist at Reuters. So I covered markets...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 I didn't know it was business. OK.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Usually, when you buy bonds, or government, basically, debt - you're loaning them money - long-term, you expect to get a higher incentive, higher yield because you're locking in your money for a long time. So like...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 ...10-year Treasury notes, you're...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 ...Locking in your money for a long time. But this week, the yield on the 10-year Treasury notes was less than on the two-year Treasury notes. So basically - I'll take this from Scott Horsley, our chief...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 OK.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 ...Economic (laughter)...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 ...Correspondent. He said that usually, it's a smiley face. But then, when it's inverted, it's a frowny face, and then everyone's frowning.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 That I get. That I get.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yes. Yes. Yes. So the thing is, though, this frowny face - people say it's a predictor of a coming recession.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yes.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 And so my question for you, Ayesha - you know, we could go deeper into the economics of all of this, but I'm really interested - and this is for you both - about how Trump reacts to this news so far. We have seen him be a president who loves to do this sometimes antagonistic song and dance back and forth with the markets. He'll put a tariff on Mexico, put a tariff on China and see how it plays out. But like, this news was so troubling to some folks this week, I wonder - does his strategy change? Can he keep playing this economic game of chicken?             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 And you saw the U.S. pull back a little bit this week, where they said...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 ...They were going to put all these tariffs on imports from China, and they were supposed start on September 1. But for some of those - the most important that would affect consumers, like laptops and things like that - they put those off until December 15. So they're already responding a bit.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 But what President Trump is doing is he's blaming a lot of people. So he's blaming the Fed. He was blaming the media yesterday, basically saying that we're talking up a recession and that we want to crash the economy.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 We don't have that much power.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Tony, do you?             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 I mean, my Twitter account reaches some people, I guess...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 ...But not 62 million.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah, yeah.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 You know, so it's like this is - what he does is he kind of looks for people to blame. But he's also - the other thing that he does is he says everything's going great. I think we'll get a great deal or something soon because everything's going great; the talks are going great.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Jokes aside, I mean...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah?             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 ...We've seen inverted yield curves lead to recessions before. That's documented in lots of economic literature. We haven't seen somebody tweet through a recession.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 If the worst does happen - and again, this is so speculative - you do have to wonder what would happen if we tweeted our way through an economic crisis...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Oh, my goodness.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 ...And what that would mean for the pace of recovery and for the conversations that have to happen around the globe to right the economic ship.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 And like - and you know, like you said, it's not clear that there's going to be a recession. And...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Or when it would happen even if it does.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Or when it would happen.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 But this administration hasn't really shown the ability to really think with one mind and speak with one voice when it comes to anything.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>                You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR, the show where we catch up on the week that was. I'm Sam Sanders here with two guests this week - Tony Romm, senior policy reporter at The Washington Post, and Ayesha Roscoe, White House reporter at NPR, who has, like, 17 jobs...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 ...Jumping on TV, jumping on podcasts, doing it all.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Tony, do you have three words?             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 I have many words, but I'll keep it to three.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 (Laughter) OK.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 I'm actually going to cheat a little bit, so don't yell me.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 OK.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 My three words are IRL \"Minority Report,\" which technically I only think is, like, five.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 We'll let it go - well, 'cause...             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 We're going to call IRL one.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 It's, like, one word, yeah.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 ...IRL is like its own word, yes. IRL \"Minority Report.\"             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Is that the Steven Spielberg movie?             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 It is the movie.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yes.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 And I'm using that as a funny way of referring to the conversations that the White House has been having with tech companies over the issue of gun control. So remember - in the movie, what essentially happens is that there are these three brainy people who can kind of predict crimes before they happen. Right? And so...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 And like, arrest people before they commit crimes.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 And arrest people before they can commit them. And so no, the White House is not trying to make brainy people who can predict crimes. But they are asking the question - are there things that we can do to more proactively keep an eye on social media so that we can see shootings or shooters before they occur?             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah. And so this came in the aftermath of two mass shootings in Dayton and El Paso. And the whole country is saying someone's got to do something.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Right. And particularly with El Paso, it was the latest incident in which a shooting had some relationship to online hate speech. In this case, we believe that the shooter - the alleged shooter had posted this anti-Hispanic manifesto to 8chan, which is an anonymous web forum, minutes before the attack took place. That set the stage for this White House meeting that happened last Friday, where major representatives from companies like Facebook, Google and Twitter sat down with top White House officials - but not the president - to talk about what they could do to create a technological solution to this.             </p><p>                So on one hand, I think a lot of folks walked away from that thinking, this is a good conversation that has to happen given the issues and the pervasive trouble of online hate. On the other hand, people were like, why weren't we talking about guns?             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah. Well - and also, just to take it back to that Tom Cruise movie, part of the whole plot of the film is when this predictive stuff goes too far. Like...             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Right.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yeah.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 ...When I saw these headlines, part of me got a little worried about privacy concerns and - what is the right stuff to go after; will they ever get the wrong person? Like, as a citizen, how scared should I feel about, possibly, these big tech platforms partnering with the federal government...             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Right             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 ...To see what I'm writing and posting and predict what I'm going to do?             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Right. You know, we should caution at the outset here that this is brainstorming right now. Right?             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 OK.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 There's no technology that exists that can do this kind of thing, at least at the scale that the government would want it. And the White House was very clear that they didn't think that they should necessarily own some system to do the surveillance but that a conversation needed to happen.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Got you.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Now, all of that said, the tech companies in attendance raised some of the very points that you did - this concern about, you know, what would happen if they caught an image that, you know, was white supremacy but actually it was a parody or something...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 ...And it flagged that person as a potential shooter when, in fact, they weren't? What about the privacy concerns this creates when you're keeping an eye on what people are saying and doing, even things that they may have gone to try to post but ultimately didn't?             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 And so I think the concern is theoretical, but it's a very important high-level one. It's - once, again, we find ourselves with this debate over privacy versus security.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah. Kind of feels like the conversation we had, Ayesha, many years ago after the Twin Towers fell over the Patriot Act.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yeah.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 And that was a moment in which we gave up some civil liberties to protect ourselves from international terrorism. Now is the conversation how much do we give up to fight domestic terrorism?             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 And I think, too, when you look at this is - how much of this goes against free speech? Should you be allowed to say these things?             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 I do wonder - what could the police do? So as long as you're not threatening someone but you're just saying hateful things on the Internet, can - like, who...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah. Can they - yeah.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 I mean, hate speech is not against the law.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 We would like to think it is, but hate speech is permitted under the First Amendment. It's not permitted under the policies that Facebook and Google and Twitter have in place on their sites. They can take that stuff down, and they do. But there's this concern that the Web has created this really disgusting conversation and that it's served as a conduit for radicalization.             </p><p>                And so the other thing that I heard in the course of reporting - and this came mostly from Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill - it's this feeling that if the White House wants to start to fix the problem, it has to start with the president and his own here. The criticisms were that - the things that he says about immigrants and other minorities and just the - generally the language that he uses and the tone of the things that he's saying.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 And the picking the fights all the time.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Picking the fights - creates this incivility online that creates this space for people to say and do the things that could lead to violence and other kinds of troubles. Now...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 ...We can debate whether that's actually the case, but Democratic lawmakers said that's why they were most perturbed that Trump wasn't there at this meeting.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah. What, right now, are tech companies doing in terms of monitoring some of this intense hate speech? And what would change if they began to implement some of this \"Minority Report\" precog stuff?             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Right.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Right. I mean, right now all of these companies have policies in place that outlaw things like white supremacy. They have thousands of people on staff who review the content as it's posted. And they have powerful artificial intelligence tools that's supposed to stop that stuff in real time. But there's this concern that that's simply not enough. Regulators around the world still see these sites as major conduits for things like white supremacy. And they point to sites like YouTube, for example, where you're just queued up with videos that look similar to the things that you've already watched. And so if you've already watched something that has a conspiracy theory or a hoax in it, you're likely to see more of that stuff.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 So there's this concern that there are these biases. There are these troubles built into the platforms themselves.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 You know, going back to this idea of a similar conversation happening around the Patriot Act and how much liberty we wanted to give up for that protection, is there, like, a big lesson that you can see out of that that might affect how this plays out?             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Right. Well, we need to have smart conversations about how the technology works. And just, I guess, lastly here, like, this isn't just theoretical. There are literal contracts out there on federal government contracting websites because law enforcement agencies are looking to do this work in real time. They would...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 They want to do it.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 ...Love to have these capabilities.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 And perhaps it's the case that they should be able to do this sort of thing. But we have to...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 ...Have a conversation about whether those trade-offs - privacy versus security - are worth it.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")                </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. Coming up, we're going to talk about whether or not the Internet has changed the way you talk or the way you write. The linguist Gretchen McCulloch says yes, it has for all of us, even the grammar purists. That's after the break. I'm Sam Sanders. We'll be right back.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")                </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 We're back.

I love it so much. Oh, my goodness. Anyway, so glad you both are here. I have a question for you both. Tony...             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Uh-oh.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 ...Ayesha, do you use periods in your text messages?             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 I do.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Only when I'm pissed at somebody.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 No, I...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 See. It's a thing.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 I don't.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 I do. I use, like, punctuation and stuff.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 I don't use punctuation.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 I use punctuation.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 I use line breaks 'cause for whatever reason - I'm not sure how it happened - I think that when I'm sending a text message, if I send a period, it means that I'm angry.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Right.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Oh, really?             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Right.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Right.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 See...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 This is a thing that the youths have gotten into these days - the fear of punctuation.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yeah. And I think that's why they would always be able to tell that I'm not a youth.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 So anyways, this shift in the use or nonuse of the period - it's been well-documented. And people not using periods on our smartphones - an author named Gretchen McCulloch argues that that is just one of the ways that the Internet and smartphones themselves are totally changing language and the way that we use language. She has a whole new book out just about this. It is called \"Because Internet: Understanding The New Rules Of Language.\"             </p><p>                And so she argues in the book, basically, that the era of Internet has given us this abundance of normal people using language very informally all over the place. And Gretchen says that's a big thing because it moves us away from the way that we usually learn language, which is a really formalized system, you know, through school, in textbooks, et cetera. She says that we have moved away from that formality that we've usually had around language in the past.             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 What I think is really interesting about Internet language is that you do have historical precedents for informal writing before the Internet. You have things like diaries and postcards. But they're really limited, and you don't have distribution for them. So the fact...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 ...That our informal writing can influence each other, can go back and forth. And we don't always think about it, but in speech, we have formal and informal varieties, as well. You know, you're a radio host. But presumably, you don't go home and talk to your dog like this.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 I don't. I sing to her.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 You know, like, this isn't how you talk to your friends in the pub.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 So the idea that writing should only be formal is actually this kind of anomaly when you look at this broader picture of what speech can be.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 In all of your research on the Internet and language for this book, what was the one new - I don't know - linguistic development or word or phrase or whatever that you found that was a new thing caused by Internet that, like, you love the most?             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 I really love how the Internet has given us ways to express irony in writing. And there's a whole bunch of them, you know? There's the tilde at the beginning of a word. Like, that's so - such a good idea. And you could put the tilde at the beginning there. There's asking a question without a question mark to indicate that it's a rhetorical question or that it's kind of ironic or deadpan. There's putting sparkles around stuff...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 ...Which could indicate enthusiasm. But if it's in a context where you really can't be enthusiastic, it's got to indicate something else. And maybe that's irony. And what's interesting is that there is literally, like, 500 years of philosophical proposals being like, yeah, guys. It'd be really nice if we had a way of indicating sarcasm in writing. It'd be nice if we had irony punctuation. You know, Rousseau had a proposal. Like...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Really?             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 Yeah.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 Jean-Jacques Rousseau's like, we need a (speaking French).             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 There were people proposing backwards question marks, upside-down exclamation marks, all sorts of stuff. And there's literally, like, at least one a century and sometimes more. And all the philosophers are in agreement. This would be a really good idea. And none of them get off the ground.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 And the Internet did it.             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 And the Internet did it. Like, what a success story. Rousseau couldn't do it.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Thank you, Internet.             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 The Internet did. Look at that.             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 Rousseau couldn't make it happen, but the Internet did.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 If there were a person who was cryogenically frozen before the Internet and the smartphone came into existence and then you brought them back right now today...             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 Yeah.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 ...What would be the biggest part of our language that they would notice had shifted because of those two things?             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 I mean, I think some of the obvious things that they would notice had shifted would be the addition of things like emoji and emoticons and GIFs and, like, adding in the visual ornamentation side or the body back into language because we have a body when we communicate face to face. We use our hands. We use our gestures. We use our facial expressions. We modulate our tone of voice. We haven't traditionally done that so much in writing because formal writing, just like formal speaking, is very disembodied. Maybe you have a graph.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 That's all the illustration you get - so this really obvious thing. But I think if they dug a little bit deeper and looked at the text messages themselves, they might be reminded of kind of early modernist poets like E.E. Cummings and people who are trying to represent a stream of consciousness of how people are actually thinking but in terms of writing. There are literary precursors to this.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Oh, yeah. Yeah. One of the critiques that you'll hear from grammar purists, from language purists that I hear as someone who talks on the radio is how that informal writing, that stream of consciousness writing and that style has shifted and moved into spaces that should be classically more formal. I remember one time on this show, probably a year ago, I was laughing about a joke one of my panelists made. And before I knew it, instead of laughing, I literally said out loud, LOLOLOLOL.             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 And I was like, I didn't even know I was going to do it. And it just happened. But I was like, oh, maybe there is some credence to this claim that the informality of Internet speak is actually becoming pervasive everywhere. And maybe that's a bad thing. Have you found that the informality of the Internet and how we speak there has invaded more formal spaces in a bad way?             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 I mean, language changes. Like...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 ...Life changes. It wouldn't...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 Life wouldn't be alive if it wasn't changing. When something stops changing, it's dead.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 So...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 ...You know, congratulations. English is still alive because English is still pissing some people off.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yes. Yeah.             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 You know, if you want to kill English and embalm it like a dinosaur, like, you can do that and stop it changing. But as long as it's in the minds of living people, it's going to keep changing because living people don't just stay static when you stop paying attention to them.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah, yeah. An idea that's been present in not just this book but in some other writing of yours is that the people who change language the most, who move language forward the most are usually young women, like teenaged girls. And you say that this has been a thing for a while. It goes all the way back to, like, the age of Shakespeare. Unpack that. And why them?             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 (Laughter) Yeah. So socio-linguists have this acronym which is, if you want to study the most conservative users of a particular language, you want to study what are called NORMS, which is nonmobile, older, rural males because they're going to provide your oldest snapshot.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Really?             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 Yeah, because...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 OK.             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 ...If you're mobile you're exposed to a lot of people. You're more likely to change your language because you're exposed to more. People in urban centers are also exposed to more different varieties of language because you come into contact with more people, and you have more potential to be exposed to stuff. And there seems to be something about the gender. And linguists are still figuring out exactly what because the gender is probably a proxy variable for something. But it's just not quite clear what that is, you know? Some people think maybe women have more extended social networks. Some people think it's - women are still more likely to be primary caregivers for children. So even if men do develop something, maybe they're not going to pass it on as quickly. But it seems to show up in a lot of different studies, in a lot of different areas that women tend to be on the leading edge of linguistic change. And, of course, that shows up in sexism about, you know, criticizing women's voices, as well.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Oh, yeah. That's a whole 'nother chat.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 You know, you are obviously a booster of an ever-evolving English language. But there are going to be a lot of grammar purists, a lot of English purists hearing this. And they might be shaking their heads at our entire conversation. Any advice for them as they try to possibly open their hearts to navigate this new world of language? - one piece of advice.             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 You don't have to be angry. You can let that go...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 ...And the world will still be fine.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yes.             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 You don't have an obligation to be the moral standard of preserving something that was really just a bunch of, like, stuffy, old guys in the first place. You can be happy with language. You can be a fan of language and enjoy watching language change. And it's just a more enjoyable way of living.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 I like that. This is a very unironic, unsarcastic thank-you, Gretchen.             </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 Thank you so much for having me.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")                </p><p>GRETCHEN MCCULLOCH:                 All right. Thanks again to Gretchen McCulloch, linguist and author of the new book \"Because Internet.\" Back here in studio with Tony Romm, tech policy reporter for The Washington Post, and Ayesha Rascoe, White House reporter for NPR. Do y'all think, overall, the Internet has been good or bad for Language - capital L?             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 I agree with Gretchen that I think it's great the way that it has expanded, the way you can respond to things...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 ...On Twitter and in text messages. GIFs, in and of themselves, are...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 That's a new language.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 It's a new language. It can convey a - it can convey something that just saying something in words would not - right?             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Like, reading something would not.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 You can see something with a GIF, and you understand...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 ...Exactly what they're saying.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah. I think all of this abundance of new Internet language and GIFs and memes, it expands the emotional range...             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Right.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 ...Of how we can type. And I love that. Like, I've seen these videos of these kids that are, like, preverbal, 1 or 2 years old, just learning how to talk. But they can text their parents and friends with emoji.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 (Laughter). Yeah.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 That's really cool.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 It's funny. At the end of your conversation, you asked her - like, why are people so angry about this?             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Like, why do people just get so lit? And I get a lot of that in email. Like, people will see from my tweets or whatever - or if I dare to use a more colloquial phrasing or approach to something in a story, I'll get this message being like, why would The Washington Post...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 ...Like ever dare to like write this way?             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 And I was trying to think about, like - why do I think that happens? And I think it's because people see it as a form of laziness rather than appreciating it for, like, the emotional range that you get by speaking or writing that way. They just presume you're doing it because you don't know English. You don't know how to speak it or write it properly, and you just don't care to learn, which I think is very, very far from the truth.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 On that note, LOL.

It's going to be fine.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")                </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 We're back. You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR, the show where we catch up on the week that was. I'm Sam Sanders, your host here with two guests - Ayesha Rascoe, White House reporter at NPR, and Tony Romm, senior tech policy reporter at The Washington Post. Time for my favorite game - Who Said That.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF ATLANTA\")                </p><p>KANDI BURRUSS:                 Who had been saying that?             </p><p>PORSHA WILLIAMS:                 Who said that?             </p><p>KENYA MOORE:                 Who said that?             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 All right. Y'all know how this works. This game, Who Said That, is quite simple. I share three quotes from the week. You got to guess who said it or what story I'm talking about. No buzzers - just yell it out. The winner, per usual, gets absolutely nothing but bragging rights.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Y'all ready?             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yeah.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Every time I do this, I make a fool of myself - every time (laughter).             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 It's so crazy to me to see how this game plays out because...             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Right.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 ...Like, I'm asking my panelists to talk about heavy, intense, deeply reported news stories of the week, and they can just do it.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Right.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 And then we get to the quiz show about randomness, and they're like, I don't know.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 I don't know, y'all. It's amazing every week. Anyway, first quote is \"we just had to put the egg in front of one of them, and he knew just what to do.\" You don't have to say who said it. But what story involved eggs this week and it was very heartwarming? It involved parenting.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Eggs?             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Eggs - parenting and eggs.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 I cooked some eggs this week. I didn't kill anybody, so that's heatwarming.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Eggs - with the eggs?             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Y'all didn't see this? Just...             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Oh, oh, oh. It's the penguins.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yes.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF VICTORY TUNE)                </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 It's the penguins.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yes. It's the penguins. So this week at Zoo Berlin, two male penguins have adopted an egg.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Aw.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 And they're caring for it together. Within weeks of arriving at this zoo, Maximilian Jaeger, who's a spokesperson for Zoo Berlin - he said it was clear that these two male penguins wanted to start a family. And so now they're doing it. And I'm just like give me that Hallmark commercial. It's just so beautiful.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Wait. How did the penguins find love before I did?             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 I'm just bitter.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 So apparently there are a lot of same-sex couples at zoos all over the world...             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 I heard that.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 ...That are just like adopting eggs and doing the damn thing.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 That's what I've been doing wrong? I'm not at the zoo?             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 I'm going to regret all of this later.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Right? All right, Tony. You have 1 point. Time for the next quote - this one is so fun. Just tell me what I'm talking about.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 OK.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 The quote is, \"currently, the street sign posts are empty. The Department of Public Works is waiting for the song's popularity to fade before replacing the signs again.\"             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 \"Old Town Road.\"             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yes.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF VICTORY TUNE)                </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 I got one. Yay.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 So \"Old Town Road\" by Lil Nas X, who we stan - it recently became the longest No. 1-running song in Billboard history, like 18 weeks atop of the charts, probably 19 at this point. IDK. But in the town of Wellesley, Mass., because of the song's popularity, people have been stealing the street sign of an actual Old Town Road.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 It reminds me of that story in Colorado where people kept stealing the 420 mile marker.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 And so like, The New York Times wrote about it. And so now it's 419.9.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Oh, my God.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yeah.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 I love it. I love it. That's kind of amazing. So there's an actual road called Old Town Road in Wellesley, Mass. People keep taking the street sign. And now the town says it cost 280 bucks to replace this sign every time...             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 What?             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 What?             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 ...So we're just going to stop doing it.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yeah, that's a lot of money.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Right.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 So now Old Town Road is just a road.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                 </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 It's kind of sad.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 You can't take no horses there.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yeah. All right. This game is tied, y'all.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 I know.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Oh.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Oh, my goodness.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 I know. I know. Last quote for all the marbles. And this story is bananas. The quote is, \"hard seltzers ran so we could fly.\" Who said that?             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Oh, man. I did see this.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 It's that, like, Four Loko thing.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yes.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Right.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Oh, my goodness. And they're making a seltzer. What type of madness?             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 So Four Loko, who was a big deal when I was in college because they had - they made really strong alcoholic drinks with caffeine. Now they're back at it again. They are releasing a Four Loko seltzer, which is 14% alcohol.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                 </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Excuse me.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yes. So they said it has a razz flavor...             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Ew.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 ...Which I guess is raspberry? It's spelled R-A-Z-Z. It's so weird. Anyways - so Four Loko was planning to release an alcoholic seltzer in 2020 because hard seltzers are ascendant with the young folks, the biggest of them right now being White Claw.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Yeah, can I ask you guys a question? When did the hard seltzer thing happen? I feel like it just showed up.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 (Whispering) I don't know, but I like it.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Really?             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 I like it.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 You like it? You like seltzers?             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 I was at a wedding last week, and I had so much - White Claws. I was just, give it to me - because you feel less guilty about it.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Why?             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 I don't know. I don't know.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 (Laughing) So I don't get seltzer water. And the hard seltzers - so that's with the alcohol?             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 It's with alcohol, so it's like 5% alcohol.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 So it's just a vodka tonic.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yes, basically.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 OK.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 So seltzers are ascendant. There's also going to be hard seltzers from PBR and Natty Light.             </p><p>                I'll rock with the seltzer. But I will say - anyone consuming Four Loko products, we must not forget when they launched the original Four Loko many years ago, which contained caffeine, guarana and taurine, it caused hospitalizations at colleges around the country according to Eater magazine.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yeah, I remember that. That's bad.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Be careful, kids.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Yeah, I remember that.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 You seem like you remember it.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Oh, man. So it seems like Ayesha Rascoe won the game.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Oh, my goodness. Thank you so much. I win so little, so thank you so much.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 You both are winners in my heart and our listeners' heart. That concludes Who Said That.             </p><p>                All right. Now it's time to end the show as we always do. Each Friday, we ask you, our listeners, to share with us the best things that have happened to you all week. We encourage folks to brag. Brent, hit the tape.             </p><p>JAY:                 This is Jay (ph) from Asheville, N.C. The best thing that happened to me this week was that I returned home from a successful brain surgery at Duke Hospital. It is really an amazing new lease on life. I feel great.             </p><p>BEN ROTHMAN:                 Hi, Sam. This is Ben Rothman from Oakland, Calif. And the best part of my week is that I won the world championship of croquet in Southwick, England.             </p><p>SHAHAB:                 My wife and I just celebrated 18 years of marriage.             </p><p>REBECCA:                 My boyfriend surprised me and asked me to marry him.             </p><p>ELLEN:                 I finally made a life goal of getting to Alaska.             </p><p>FRAN:                 Hi, Sam.

I'm a birth doula from El Paso, Texas. So after tragedy struck our community this past weekend, I had the privilege of attending a dear friend and client of mine as she gave birth to her second baby boy. And this just served as a reminder that even in the darkest moments in our community, love will always prevail. So welcome to the world, baby Cruz (ph). Thanks.             </p><p>BEN ROTHMAN:                 Thank you.             </p><p>REBECCA:                 Love your show.             </p><p>JAY:                 Bye-bye.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Welcome to the world, baby Cruz.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Aw.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yeah.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Also, shout-out to the I-quit-my-job lady.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Sometimes you got to have that energy, though. Like, I quit - that was the best part of my week.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Literally. She delivered that with some Four Loko energy. She really did. Oh, man - thanks to all the folks you heard there - Jay, Ben, Shahab (ph), Rebecca (ph), Ellen (ph), Fran (ph), Maddie (ph), Taylor (ph) and Rachel (ph), Lety (ph) in El Paso. And also, I don't think I've ever heard from a world championship croquet winner, so shout-out.             </p><p>                Thanks to all of those who share their best things with us every week. We listen to every single one of them even if we can't play them all on the show, but keep them coming. Really, keep them coming. We've got to say goodbye to y'all. We're going to go out on Mr. Shawn Carter himself - Jay-Z. I still don't know. Do I want to see a Jay-Z Super Bowl halftime show?             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 No.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 After this, it's going to be...             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 It's going to be weird.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 It's going to be weird. It's going to be weird if he did it now. But Beyonce - all day, every day.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Oh, bring her back. Bring her back.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 Take the electric grid down again.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Yes.             </p><p>AYESHA RASCOE:                 Yes, all day.             </p><p>TONY ROMM:                 I'm here for it.             </p><p>SAM SANDERS:                 Literally.

I'm Isabel. I'm 4 years old. Elise is my mom. This week on the show, Washington Post tech culture reporter Nitasha Tiku and Farhad Manjoo, opinion columnist for The New York Times. All right. Let's start the show.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                            (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")                </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ELISE HU:                 Hey, y'all. I'm Elise Hu, in for Sam Sanders. IT'S BEEN A MINUTE. We're coming to you this week from NPR member station KQED in San Francisco. And I'm joined by our guests this week that were introduced by my 4-year-old - Nitasha Tiku, tech culture reporter at The Washington Post. Hey, Nitasha.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NITASHA TIKU:                 Hey. Thanks for having me.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 It's good to see you in real life.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 I know.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 We've talked...             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 After years.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 ...A lot before.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Yeah.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Exactly. And Farhad Manjoo, an opinion columnist at a little newspaper you might know called The New York Times. Hey, Farhad.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Hey. Good to be here.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Do y'all know who we're listening to?             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF BILLIE EILISH SONG, \"BAD GUY\")                </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Yes.

Do you know why she's in the news?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 No.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 She's going to do the \"James Bond\" theme song?             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 That's right.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Really?             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 The 18-year-old...             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Yeah.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 ...Has been chosen to create the theme song for \"No Time To Die,\" the next Daniel Craig \"James Bond\" flick. She calls it a huge honor. What do you think of the choice?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 I didn't really know this was a huge honor. Like, I didn't...             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 ...Know that Bond theme song was, like, a prize up for grabs. But it, you know - her sort of style does seem to fit with - if I were to pick an artist who would be James Bond-y, she seems kind of James Bond-y.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Yeah. I think maybe the James Bond franchise is angling for, like, TikToks. Billie Eilish is...             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Oh (laughter).             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 ...Really popular on TikTok. So, you know, maybe by honor, it's also, like, a good financial incentive for everyone.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah. Marketing.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Daniel Craig has said this is his last \"Bond.\" He's been doing it since \"Casino Royale\" in 2006, when Billie Eilish was 4 years old.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Wow.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Wild.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")                </p><p>ELISE HU:                 OK. Let's get into the news. Each week, we ask our guests to describe some news from the week in three words. This week, because we're here in San Francisco, y'all have some news and tech intersections, I presume, for your three words. Nitasha, you go first.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 OK. My three words are stuck in neutral, which I think describes the way that, like, kind of intractable social and political topics in Silicon Valley, we often, end, up reverting back to square one. So I think of it as like a regressive tendency. And it really came into focus for me recently when I was working on this profile of this top Google public policy executive named Ross LaJeunesse. And he alleges that he was pushed out of the company last year for demanding that Google make stronger commitments to prioritizing human rights, which is something that he thought was necessary when he learned about Project Dragonfly. I don't know if you guys are - well....             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 The Chinese search engine.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 ...I know Farhad is. Yeah.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Yeah.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Exactly - the censored Android search app which would link your phone numbers to your searches - obviously, a huge concern in China. And Ross had been working for Google for 11 years. But the really interesting thing about him is that he was Google's man in China in 2010. Well, just to back up a little bit...             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Yeah. Remind us why...             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Yeah.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 ...Google had to take a stance about its China policy anyway.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 So they first launched a censored search engine in 2006. And, you know, the argument at the time was that Google would be able to make the society more open. They would be candid about what was being censored. And, of course, that's not what happened.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 China don't play that.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Yeah. You know, the government was emboldened. They asked for more takedowns. And then Google discovered that there was a really sophisticated cyberattack originating in China to look at the Gmail accounts - to hack the Gmail accounts of dissidents and human rights activists. And that...             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 And that could have been at the behest of the state or the state doing it.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 That is what is implied between the lines. You know, when I went back to 2010 and I'm reading the arguments about like, oh, you know, we didn't know that this was going to, you know, fall out this way, I guess we have a new responsibility, and it felt like a decade later, you know, the same debate is happening. And rather than have a conversation about like, OK, obviously, you know, Google just turned into a trillion-dollar company...             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Right.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 ...You know, we're a trillion-dollar company. We are financially incentivized to go into countries with weak rule of law. Let us put in measures of accountability, some external oversight, like, look at U.N. standards - commit to those publicly. It's like back to square one of like, well, is censored search results in China a good thing? And I just noticed this tendency.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 They're just having the same argument.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Yeah.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah. I read Ross's Medium post just sort of like telling why he left Google...             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Yeah.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 ...And sort of arguing that it had changed. And I thought it was really interesting because, I mean, I think a lot of people have documented this huge change within Google, where it used to be kind of this freewheeling internal culture. And it really kind of became the template for, I think, all tech companies since then. Like, you know, Uber is sort of Google-ish. And Facebook is kind of run in that way. But now, you know, you and others have documented how Google is just sort of changing. They have this big kind of anti-union push in the company. They've fired organizers. They've fired sort of internal activists. It seems like a different kind of company. And also it seems like you can't raise these things - these concerns within Google the way you may have once been able to.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 It's rather wild to me that we rely - like, as a society, we rely on these giant companies to be benevolent because for so long, it's just like, well, Google hasn't really acted poorly, so they can just continue to run things. And we will trust or give them this inherent trust that they can run our massive systems and have a huge lever on society without complaint. But that sort of raises the issue of whether there should be more responsible parties.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Yeah, exactly.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 And where do you come down on that?             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Yeah. Well, I think that, you know, the China question is fascinating because that's actually, I think, where the myth of, like, this conscientious tech worker who's going to step in if anybody crosses the line came into play. And you just can't rely on the personal, you know, morality or politics of any individual executive. You know, that was like - in that case, it was Sergey Brin, Google's co-founder. But as we've seen, you know, that Larry and Sergey are sort of pushed out of Google. And so I think having those - like, they don't want anyone in the room who's going to seriously question them. I think we've seen that across the board with the push for self-regulation from every tech company. But, you know, the time is way past nigh to...             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 So does that mean it's time for external regulation?             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 I feel like with external regulation that's, like, step 10, and we don't even have, like, basic transparency right now into the decisions that they're making.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah, although I think - you know, we're seeing this push for regulation that's really coming from Washington and activists and other companies. I really wonder if consumers really care at all. I don't think it's been sort of a politically resonant issue. And the companies are doing really well. Like, the market doesn't seem to think that they're going to be in for any kind of regulation at this point, you know? I think that kind of getting to a place where the public and regulators and the companies can, you know, put really effective controls on these companies - I - it seems a long way off to me.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR, the show where we catch up on the week that was. I'm Elise Hu in for Sam Sanders here this week at NPR member station KQED with Nitasha Tiku, tech culture reporter at The Washington Post and Farhad Manjoo, opinion columnist at The New York Times.             </p><p>                Farhad, you're up. What are your three words?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Unlock your iPhone, question mark. Does that count?             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Question mark - yeah. No, that's perfect. Say more.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 There's been this fight between law enforcement and tech companies about encryption, about how law enforcement, how the courts can get access to your data on your devices. And the fight has really been between Apple and the FBI. And it kind of came about again last week when Attorney General Bill Barr criticized Apple for not doing enough, he said, to get them inside the phone of the shooter at the naval base in Pensacola, Fla., last year. And the FBI wants to get inside the phone, and Apple has ways for them to get into sort of cloud data. But the phone itself, all the data on it is encrypted. And you need some kind of Face ID or fingerprint or code to get inside, and law enforcement can't get inside.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 But neither can Apple, right?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Neither can Apple.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Apple claims that it can't get inside.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Right. So the way Apple has designed these phones is, you know, they say, out of a respect for privacy. If you don't have a legal way to get into the phone, you can't. The data is encrypted, and Apple says it doesn't have a way to get inside. The fight then really becomes, like, whether Apple should build some way for law enforcement to access the data on your phone. This is kind of a reprise of a battle they had in 2016, when the FBI at the time was wanting Apple to open the phone of the terrorist in San Bernardino, Calif.</p><p>ELISE HU:                 OK.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 And there was a sort of a big legal fight, and at the last minute, the FBI dropped its fight before there was going to sort of be any kind of real courtroom action. And they went to a third-party cybersecurity company that, you know, got them inside the iPhone. But that route, according to the FBI, is sort of drying up. Like, Apple patches...             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Is patching it.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 ...The security flaws in its phones, and so there's sort of less vulnerable to kind of other ways to get into the phone. So, I mean, this is a fight that I think is going to be with us for a while because there's this kind of fundamental question of, should we let law enforcement get in our phones? You know, if they have a legal way...             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Well, in the name of public safety is law enforcement's or the government's argument, right?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah. I mean, but there's a - I think there are a lot of other considerations here. You know, we were talking about other governments. If Apple builds a way for the FBI to get inside your phone, that same way could be used if, you know, the government of Saudi Arabia orders it to get inside someone's phone or China or someone else. You know, Apple has to obey the laws wherever it operates, and so their argument is that it makes everyone less safe if you have some kind of backdoor into the iPhone. And I think it's just going to be a battle that we have, you know, over the next decade or more to figure out, like, what is the line there between, you know, when law enforcement can get inside a phone and, you know, not just phones - kind of all of our digital devices now.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 What's different about the stakes now in 2020 and with this administration versus the last time you...             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 I mean, it's - in some ways, the fight is the same, but all the context has changed. So, you know, Tim Cook has been really one of the best friends of the Trump administration. In the various different rounds of tariffs imposed on China, Apple got waivers and got exempted from a number of them because, you know, Tim Cook has sort of played the game well. And I think that it's going to be more difficult for kind of Apple to navigate this, especially because Trump is just much more aggressive than the Obama administration was about this question.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Nitasha, what have you observed as you've watched this latest round of this privacy versus public safety battle?             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Well, what Farhad was saying about the context changing, I think that's so key, you know? Like, the hypothetical authoritarian regime abusing this back door just is, you know, in the headlines.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Like, you don't really have to stretch your imagination at all.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 I mean, we at The New York Times have been doing this yearlong project on privacy. And we have, you know, seen in that project, in - kind of in a number of other reporting that there is just so much data that the tech industry collects on people that - and it's so hard to avoid, you know? Even if you don't use Facebook, even if you don't have any - you know, a smart home device, there's so much that these companies can get about you in a very, very intimate way and know, you know, essentially, everything about you more than, like, any close family member knows about you.             </p><p>                And this raises the stakes for, you know, the security of personnel around the world, the security of, like, you know, your family, your safety. And it just makes it very - a much more kind of high-stakes battle because, you know, you get inside the data on somebody's phone, you really know everything about them.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 And there's a real chilling effect to feeling as if you're surveilled or just knowing that you are surveilled, right? I was based in Asia. And so China comes up as an example a lot. A lot of times, reporters would return to their homes, and there would be policemen in their homes just rummaging through drawers, not to take anything - you know, they're not thieves - but just to make you aware that you were being watched. And so there is a chilling effect to that, whether you are a regular person, a journalist who's supposed to be a check on power or the power itself. So in light of all of this, what do you think we should be doing, collectively, to better stand up for our values?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 I mean, the thing that I would say is, like, my biggest takeaway from kind of thinking about privacy over the last year is that I am much more cautious about adopting technology - or I think people should be more cautious about adopting new technology. I think one of the things that we should all do is just sort of slow down. Like, I'm really worried about cameras everywhere. Like, there's been this huge discussion about this company - this doorbell camera company called Ring...             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Right.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 ...Which Amazon owns, which Amazon bought, you know, relatively recently, you know, was a huge success. Every - lots of people are installing these doorbell cameras because it makes sense to - you know, it seems like a convenient technology. Someone rings your doorbell, you know, at home or you want to see who it is. And you can just look at your phone and see who's at your door. But the company is creating this weird, like, neighborhood watch program and allowing law enforcement to look at your camera.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 They, like, subsidized it so that law enforcement could get access to your camera. And people are putting them in their, like, children's room, you know, using them as, like, a baby monitor.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 And the security has various flaws in it, you know. People have hacked these cameras. And you hack a home security camera, and, suddenly, you know everything about those people. And I think what was interesting is that people just rushed to buy these cameras - like, the company did really well - without considering the implications of, like, are we creating a neighborhood surveillance device that is going to profile everyone who comes on our street? Like, that could easily happen. I mean, it's sort of - there are parts of it that are happening already. And no one really had this discussion.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Yeah, consider the implications before you adopt.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Got it.             </p><p>                All right. Time for a break. When we come back, imagine an issue of Vogue magazine without any photos - why the magazine's Italian version went illustration-only for its latest issue after the break. You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. I'm Elise Hu. We'll be right back.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")                </p><p>ELISE HU:                 We're back. You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR, the show where we catch up on the week that was. I'm Elise Hu in for Sam Sanders here this week at NPR member station KQED with Nitasha Tiku, tech culture reporter at The Washington Post. Hey, Nitasha.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Hey.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 And Farhad Manjoo, columnist at The New York Times. What is up?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Hey.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 So have you heard about the best feel-good story of last weekend? Diego the giant tortoise.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Oh, yeah, the tortoise that had sex a lot.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 (Laughter) Did you hear this, Nitasha?             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 No, I didn't.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 So Diego the giant tortoise - I love this story so much. He was sent from the San Diego Zoo down to the Galapagos Islands as part of a breeding program about 40 years ago because there were only something - some very small number of tortoises left on the island of Espanola. And after his campaign of sexual promiscuity, there are now 2,000 tortoises - 40%...             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Oh, my god (laughter).             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Wow.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 ...Believed to have been fathered by Diego. But, yeah, Diego is now retiring.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 So is he going back to LA?             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 He's 100 - (laughter). He's 100 years old.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Wait, seriously?             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 And he's fathered...             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Wow.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Yeah.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Yeah. They live past 100, right? Yeah.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 He's 100. He's fathered like 800 babies. He's done his work (laughter).             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 I feel like we have a lot to learn from the Galapagos because did you guys remember a few years ago, there was this story about a romance between two of the tortoises where they would give each other tomatoes, and they had like decades-long love affair, but then just, like, decided they didn't want anything to do...             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Oh, wow.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 ...With each other?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Maybe it was Diego.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 (Laughter).             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Honestly, I don't think so.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 (Unintelligible).             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 But I'll send you the link.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Next week...             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Yeah.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 ...In our tortoise chronicles.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")                </p><p>ELISE HU:                 So something intentionally different graced the pages of Vogue magazine's Italian edition this month - not radical fashion but a radical idea. Editors put out the magazine without any glossy photographs. The entire edition is made up of illustrations - something not seen in Vogue's pages since the early 20th century. Vogue Italia came out with several different covers for its January issue, each cover by a different artist.             </p><p>                These artists don't typically illustrate fashion, so the result is rather striking. One includes a painting of a woman with a long stretched neck and curves in pink and brown. Another by a MozambiqueAmerican painter depicts a bloody mosquito hovering near the drawing of a model.             </p><p>                To talk about this issue, the magazine's creative director, Ferdinando Verderi, joined me from Milan. He said this decision to go photo free isn't just about art or design. It's about sustainability, starting with what it takes to create a photo shoot.             </p><p>FERDINANDO VERDERI:                 The photo shoot, which is what everything is made of today in editorial world, is often - especially at this level - a very complex production. There are tons of flights involved. Clothes ship internationally, up to 10 people flying from all over the world to one location and a very huge display of effort that obviously, in the conversation on sustainability, translate into waste, pollution and carbon footprint.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 We don't think about what's so wasteful, I guess, about a magazine's production until you list things out like this.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Well, nor do we. You start looking at your own day to day, and you realize that before speaking about broader topics that you can hardly affect, you better start looking into what you can affect. And I think for us, it was really like the provocation to ourselves. Like, can a magazine be great or better if we drastically challenge the way it's produced?             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Well, what do you think? What is your reaction to how it turned out as a creative director? And then...             </p><p>FERDINANDO VERDERI:                 Well, obviously, I am partial to this question because I've actually been trying to introduce illustration - or the language since my very first issues a few months ago. I'm new here, a few months in. And I have sort of a lot of heart for illustration and drawing as a medium that connects to the original of Vogue.             </p><p>                I'm very pleased with the reception from the public, which has been incredible. And that sort of the main goal for me to see how a visual language that would be replaced, like photography of the main language of fashion. You can attract so much interest and emotions, and also very pleased about how the idea came across.             </p><p>                And obviously, this is not just an artist shoot. It's an issue that has a very strong point. I tried to demonstrate it in a lighthearted and positive way, trying to propose what could be a very old solution to a new problem. 'Cause obviously, illustration precedes this all.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 In this magazine, you're highlighting the cost of production for fashion spreads. But...             </p><p>FERDINANDO VERDERI:                 Yes.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 ...The production of a fashion spread or a fashion shoot a small compared to the environmental impact of the clothing industry writ large.             </p><p>FERDINANDO VERDERI:                 Yes, yeah.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 So how are you thinking about the industry in which you work in light of how much it costs in emissions just to produce and manufacture and ship clothing? And then this clothing, obviously, changes styles every season.             </p><p>FERDINANDO VERDERI:                 It's a big conversation. What we did is started from the inside, that we just wanted to look at what we can to affect our day to day and inspire other publications to look into the way we operate. I'm sure that fashion, being a creative industry at heart, will find a solution that has some beauty in it. But it is definitely not an easy one. There is obviously like an inherent conflict between selling clothes and the fact that clothes are often the cause of production processes that pollute. It's hard to imagine the future. But there are still lots of interest and opportunities to make a difference.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 I want to ask a little bit about Italy because the whole world watched...             </p><p>FERDINANDO VERDERI:                 Yes.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 ...As so much of Venice flooded this winter. And Venice has always been a city at risk as sea levels rise because of climate change. So I wonder, did the way climate change became so visible in Venice affect your thinking or affect the editor-in-chief's thinking about this issue, and if so, how?             </p><p>FERDINANDO VERDERI:                 I didn't say yet that the savings that are byproducts of this new production went to a foundation in Venice that is related to the conservation of art and the beauty of the city. And...             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 So the proceeds go back to Venice?             </p><p>FERDINANDO VERDERI:                 The savings that resulted from this streamlined production process, which is the one of illustrations versus photography...             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Oh, right - the savings. OK.             </p><p>FERDINANDO VERDERI:                 Yeah, exactly - went there. And we are dedicating an issue in February partially to this huge problem that Venice is facing. And it is something that is close to us because we are obviously geographically close and culturally very close, but it's symbolic of a broader issue, obviously, that affects so many parts of the world. So Venice and its tight connection to sea level and to nature is, for us, a symbol for, obviously, a global issue.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 You mentioned that the reaction to this issue has been exceedingly positive. You also mentioned that you wanted this to spark a conversation, a larger conversation about the industry. Has it?             </p><p>FERDINANDO VERDERI:                 I think it has, and I think it has received praise and criticism. The criticism is that - well, you're doing an issue, and then you're going back to doing it normal. Yes, I mean, this is part of the idea. I think this is not the solution, but it is a publication, an experiment to show how creativity, which is one of the Vogue values - creativity is the most relevant powerful force that we are dealing with in this case, and we use that as sort of like a vehicle for change. So I think that the conversation have been achieved. In fact, your talking to us is proof of it. I don't think it's a conversation about Italian Vogue. I think it's a conversation about fashion opening to potentially different ways of thinking about itself.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF FLEVANS' \"FLICKER\")                </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Thanks again to Ferdinando Verderi, creative director at Vogue Italia. Time for a break - when we come back, a test of how closely you followed some lighter news of the week in our news quiz, Who Said That? I'm Elise Hu, and you're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF MUSIC)                </p><p>ELISE HU:                 We're back. You're listening to IT'S BEEN A MINUTE from NPR, the show where we catch up on the week that was. I'm Elise Hu in for Sam Sanders here this week at NPR member station KQED with Nitasha Tiku, tech culture reporter at The Washington Post. Hey, Nitasha.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Hey, Elise.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Also Farhad Manjoo, columnist at The New York Times - hey, Farhad.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Hey.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 OK, don't get nervous. It's my favorite time of the week - time for Who Said That?             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"THE REAL HOUSEWIVES OF ATLANTA\")                </p><p>KANDI BURRUSS:                 Who had been saying that?             </p><p>PORSHA WILLIAMS:                 Who said that?             </p><p>KENYA MOORE:                 Who said that?             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 It's a simple game. I'll share a quote from the week. You guess who said it. You don't have to name the person who gave the quote if you can at least identify the story I'm referring to. Best two out of three wins - wait for it - nothing but, you know, the prize of victory.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Right.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 So first one - this should be easy - \"congratulations to those men.\" Y'all are staring at me with blank faces.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Congratulations to those men. I have no idea. It sounds like something Trump tweeted, but...             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Yeah.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF BUZZER)                </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 It's got to be...             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 No, it's far from it.

She was announcing the Oscar nominees on Monday morning. And that line - let's hear the tape...             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>ISSA RAE:                 Martin Scorsese, Todd Phillips, Sam Mendes, Quentin Tarantino, Bong Joon-ho.             </p><p>JOHN CHO:                 Nice.             </p><p>ISSA RAE:                 I did it.

The academy failed to acknowledge female filmmakers yet again. OK, so one point for Farhad. One to nothing - this is your opportunity, Nitasha.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 OK.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Quote number two - \"this is Times Square 42nd Street, where New Yorkers go to relax.\"             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 That seems like a candidate who doesn't know anything about New York.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 I think I should have done that...             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Bill de Blasio.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF BUZZER)                </p><p>ELISE HU:                 No, it was sarcastic.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah (laughter).             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Along with his bagel comments - oh.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 It was delivered sarcastically, and I feel like I should have either delivered it more sarcastically or in a more announcer-y (ph) voice. Does that help?             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Do you want a hint?             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Yes, please.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yes.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 OK.

I don't know anything about the New York subway, but she's doing the announcements.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Yeah. For the next week or so on select trains...             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 ...New Yorkers will hear Golden Globe winner Awkwafina announcing stops on the subway.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 That is actually a high honor.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Do you want to hear a little tape of it?             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Yes, please.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 OK.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>AWKWAFINA:                 This is Times Square 42nd Street, where New Yorkers go to relax.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>AWKWAFINA:                 This is Grand Central-42nd Street.

Well, it's sponsored content. The announcements are running right up until the premiere of her new show \"Nora From Queens\" on Comedy Central.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Oh, wow. I didn't know that that was available for sponcon.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 It hasn't been, right? Historically, I've never heard anyone else.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 It's the continued selling-out of New York.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Woo-hoo.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Yeah.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 We're nothing if not capitalist in New York. All right. So, Nitasha, I don't know how you come back.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Oh, my God. I can't.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 But maybe just for your own pride, you should try to get quote No. 3.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Yeah. (Laughter) I will try. I've been trying.             </p><p>                            (LAUGHTER)                </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Stop not trying.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Please try now.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 I'm not not trying.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 OK. Quote No. 3 - \"I think I've met Mr. Hudson's absurdity with my own absurdity.\" This is written down, so nobody - I don't have tape for this. \"I think I've met Mr. Hudson's absurdity with my own absurdity. It involves a court motion and a divorce.\"             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Divorce?             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 Yeah.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Kate Hudson, Rock Hudson (laughter).             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 OK. If you don't think you're going to get it, I'll just tell you. That's Kansas man David Ostrom. He's a divorced guy who filed a motion for a trial by combat with his ex-wife's lawyer...             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Oh, my God.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 ...Mr. Hudson (laughter)...             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Wow.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 ...Featuring the finest Japanese swords he can source or forge in the next 12 weeks.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Wow.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 Is this a legal option that is open to people?             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 The court has not yet ruled.             </p><p>NITASHA TIKU:                 OK. Also, I like that the sword has to be forged anew, you know. He can't get a preexisting sword.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 All right. Congratulations, Farhad.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 Thank you.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 You won nothing.             </p><p>FARHAD MANJOO:                 I will savor it.             </p><p>ELISE HU:                 (Laughter) Congrats all the same.

Let's listen to a few.             </p><p>KYLIE:                 This is Kylie (ph) from Atlanta, Ga. And the best part of my week is that I randomly started writing my 8-year-old daughter little notes on a pad of paper and leaving them right where she eats her cereal in the morning. And then she'll write back and leave it right by the coffee. And I've been reading it right before I go to work. And it's been the best part of my week.             </p><p>LAUREN:                 This is Lauren (ph) from Dallas, Texas. And the best part of my week was that I finally, after almost three years of saving, signed a mortgage for a condo.             </p><p>APRIL:                 The best part of my week was I just passed my nursing Ph.D. qualifying exams.             </p><p>JOSEPH:                 The best part of my week was talking to my brother after he got promoted, and so happy about that.             </p><p>CLINT:                 This is Clint (ph).             </p><p>KATIE:                 And Katie (ph).             </p><p>CLINT:                 And the best part of our week was bringing our son Benjamin (ph) home from the hospital.             </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PERSON:                 The best thing to happen to me this week was that I made the decision to go to Israel for a 10-month teaching fellowship, where I'll be helping to teach students English. I'm really excited and nervous at the same time. But I can't wait to go on an adventure and learn about a new country and place to call home.             </p><p>EMMETT:                 This is Emmett (ph), calling from Lincoln, Vt., and I'm lying in bed, 6 a.m. Best thing that happened to me this week is that my 15-month-old daughter has just slept through the night for the first time ever. And my wife has just slept through the night for the first time ever.             </p><p>KYLIE:                 Thanks for everything you do.             </p><p>KATIE:                 Thanks.             </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PERSON:                 Thanks.

Between attending an SEIU California Democratic Delegate breakfast on Saturday morning and addressing convention goers later that afternoon, he will headline a fundraiser in Oakland hosted, in part, by Uber executive Chelsea Kohler, the rideshare company\u2019s director of product communications.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is a dissonant move for a candidate who fewer than three weeks ago voiced his support for striking Uber drivers demanding an end to pay cuts and a drivers\u2019 bill of rights ahead of the ridesharing company\u2019s initial public offering on Wall Street.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m standing in solidarity with @_drivers_united and all those striking across the country today for livable wages, more job security, and regulated fares,\u201d Buttigieg tweeted on May 8, the day of the international rideshare strike.\u201cWe must raise the labor standards in this country.\u201d</p><p>Buttigieg\u2019s presence at the fundraiser illustrates the fraught position he occupies as one of the most tech-friendly candidates in a primary campaign where candidates are trying to demonstrate their pro-worker bona fides. He has deep ties to Silicon Valley heavyweights and even went to college with tech titans such as Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes, who has long supported Buttigieg\u2019s political career. Yet Buttigieg is also a ubiquitous presence alongside striking workers at picket lines. In April, he backed workers employed by the Stop &amp; Shop grocery chain in Malden, Mass., and recently cut a video supporting McDonald\u2019s employees\u2019 fight for a $15 minimum wage and a union.</p><p>Buttigieg\u2019s support for striking Uber drivers seemed to echo those past efforts. Among other demands, the Drivers\u2019 Bill of Rights would include Uber and Lyft\u2019s \u201crecognition of our independent, driver-led organization, to negotiate on behalf of drivers.\u201d On his policy page, Buttigieg advocates for a \u201cnew Wagner Act to support the role of organized labor and defend the right of workers to organize.\u201d</p><p>\u201cOur nation\u2019s middle class was built by organized labor, and rising attacks on labor have led to the middle class becoming more and more vulnerable,\u201d according to the page. Buttigieg also says he supports a $15 minimum wage.</p><p>But Buttigieg also hasn\u2019t gone quite as far as his fellow nominees in coming down hard on Silicon Valley, chiefly Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), who has proposed breaking up tech giants such as Google. At a New HampshireCNN town hall in April, Buttigieg said that antitrust law \"as we know it has begun to hit its limits with regulating big tech companies. It\u2019s not designed to handle some of these tech companies where there\u2019s actually no price at all. The product is made free, or at least it\u2019s free on its face. We\u2019ve learned in part because of the way our data are used by these companies that nothing is actually free.\u201d</p><p>Chris Meagher, Buttigieg\u2019s national press secretary, declined to comment. But an organizer with the Los Angeles-based drivers\u2019 association told The Daily Beast that the candidate\u2019s decision to fundraise with an Uber executive was untenable with his support for the contracted drivers.</p><p>\u201cWe appreciate Pete Buttigieg\u2019s support, and this is an instance where there are two clearly opposing sides and he must pick one,\u201d emailed Brian Dolber. \u201cPassenger fares either go to the hardworking drivers or the multi-billion dollar companies\u2014and right now Uber/Lyft are regularly taking 50%+ of what the passenger pays while countless drivers are homeless or living in poverty. Standing with drivers, means standing against the executives who have been ruthlessly slashing driver pay year after year.\u201d</p><p>Other tech executives will be at the Saturday fundraiser for the South Bend Mayor, including Chris Cox, Facebook\u2019s former chief product officer; Scott Kohler, Google\u2019s corporate counsel; and Clay Bavor, Google\u2019s vice president of virtual and augmented reality. Tickets for the event run from $25 to $2,800.</p><p>Dolber, who is also an assistant professor of communication at California State University San Marcos, said the fault line exposed in this case could be a harbinger of what\u2019s to come for the Democrats in 2020.</p><p>\u201cWorker movements and popular criticism of Silicon Valley suggest that the Democratic Party's long standing connections to Big Tech may prove to be a problem for their base,\u201d Dolber said. \u201cPolitical candidates will have to reconsider a strategy that triangulates between impoverished workers and billionaire bosses. The conversation around the gig economy and inequality, as well as algorithmic management, surveillance, and automation is shifting the political terrain.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYBST-2232977862</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYBST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W9V-B711-DY0W-42Y1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464369</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"811\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Beast</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 31, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But this year's trade disputes and slowing growth havebeen the major topics here in Davos, the World Economic Forum so far.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So is the rise of populism and what some are calling deglobalizationshaking the world order. Also, breaking with traditions, some majorfigures are missing from the meeting this year.  With Brexit battlesat home, British Prime Minister Theresa May isn't here, and the yellowvests protests keeping the French president busy as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The U.S. government shutdown meant the White House didn't send adelegation, but U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did speak byteleconference and he praised political disruptions, saying he felt itwas a force for good.</p><p>But one of the leaders who did make the trip to Davos was Brazil's newpresident. Jair Bolsonaro delivered the message that his country wasopen for business.</p><p>Well, in the coming hours, we expect to hear from the GermanChancellor Angela Merkel, the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,amongst others.</p><p>But this year, for the first time, the organizers here at the WorldEconomic Forum have named six people under the age of 30 as co-chairsof the meeting. It makes sense. Young people are the people who aregoing to be most impacted by all of the things that are being talkedabout here in Davos, climate change, the rise of A.I. and automation,long running conflicts, for example.</p><p>And when UNICEF, the global body tasked with promoting the rights ofyoungsters asked young people what they want world leaders andbusiness tycoons to focus on, they were clear, we want better jobs,more access to education and more than half believe business leaderscould do more to help young people succeed.</p><p>Well, UNICEF executive director, Henrietta Fore, joining me now. Theyoungsters have spoken.  Our business leaders pay anything more thanlip service to their demands, Henrietta?</p><p>HENRIETTA FORE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, UNICEF:  I think it's starting andhaving this Davos session on young people and on globalization,they're really starting to pick up the idea that young people need abetter education, they need to think about what kinds of jobs andskills they need for the future and that we need to help train themand give them internships and apprenticeships.</p><p>It's their time. They say we're 25 percent of the world but we're 100percent of your future. And they're right.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And when I said they pay more than lip service and you --this isn't your first visit to the Davos meeting. We met here lastyear. I think you were newly installed in the job at that time.</p><p>Are you feeling more or less optimistic about the prospects foryoungsters around the world? I mean, I live in a region where morethan 60 percent of people are under the age of 30, unemployment veryhigh across the Middle East region, and sort of optimism pretty low.</p><p>FORE:  Yes. Well, you know, on the one hand there is a whole group ofcountries that are quite optimistic about their young people and theirimbalance. For many, though, this demographic dividend, this enormouspopulation surge is really overwhelming them. It's overwhelming all oftheir capacities in schools and institutions.</p><p>So, it's mixed. But this is the 30th anniversary of the Convention onthe Rights of the Child. So, we're optimistic at UNICEF that this isthe time when everyone is going to advocate.</p><p>And we've just launched this new initiative, Becky, GenerationUnlimited and that's for young people between the ages of 10 and 24.We want the world to stand up for this age group to try to give them achance a future in life.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Generation Unlimited, mark that one, viewers. Last year,this time, we discussed the plight of children in conflict.  In Syria,for example, four million kids have been born since the start of thecivil war. And that means they have only known war in their entirelives, same with twice (ph) to kids in Yemen or places like SouthSudan or the Rohingya children, for example.</p><p>Apart from appealing for funds and more support, what can anorganization like yours do here at Davos to make a difference?</p><p>FORE:  Well, we hope that we're going to be able to continue thosefunds. We work in humanitarian sessions. So, for instance, educationin Syria and in Yemen, half the schools are closed and these youngpeople need to get back into school.</p><p>[03:05:07] So, if you've been a child in Syria you may have been bornduring the war, you've only known war, it's been going on for eightyears. And so, many of the students have to catch up.  So, they're inone room school houses. We have an accelerated program for children tocatch up.So, businesses here can help by funding, but also giving us onlineeducation so that we can do it in every language with every communityno matter how remote the community. But they can help in education andnutrition, in health, in protection, water and sanitation. Water is anenormous need, clean water, you know that.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So many of the issues that you and I have discussed in thepast conflict, inequality, poverty being discussed here I have to sayalongside issues like climate change, for example, the environment.Just how difficult is it to embed these issues within the minds ofthose -- at a meeting like this who really can make a difference.</p><p>Let's be -- let's be really honest. I mean, you're here once again. Iknow it's important. You need political will from government. You needthat funding support. But this private sector up here, and you justalluded to some of the things that can be done. But you know, are they-- are they paying more than lip service? I'm going to ram thisquestion home until I get you. I'm not suggesting you're not beinghonest. I'm just saying, are they doing more than just paying lipservice?</p><p>FORE:  Well, they could do so much more. This is care about doing theright thing now. They care about the sustainable development goals.They have purpose. They have a mission. But have they really thoughtthrough how their businesses, their new innovations could help thehumanitarian world or all of these young children around the world?They have not yet thoroughly thought about that.</p><p>So, we're trying to catch every business we can, every foundation wecan. We need innovations in our world. We're doing things the sameway. When I was in Syria, we were in the bombed-out area in east Douma-- in Douma in east Ghouta, and when you walk through there, it's notlivable. The apartment buildings are coming down. We had big vats ofwater that are clean water that you can go to get clean water forcooking for your family.</p><p>Our business is thinking about how their supply chains and how theirproducts and services could be used in these situations. We have 300emergencies a year.</p><p>So, to your point, could we use more help? We surely could. We needthe commitment of every CEO here. We do. But we need them to look attheir basic business so that it's sustainable so they want to do ityear after year after year because the world needs a lot of help.</p><p>ANDERSON:  I know you don't come here thinking, well, let's hope weachieve something. You come here with a defined mission. What is thetakeaway that you -- that you will be pleased with Friday afternoonwhen you leave this mountain top in Switzerland? What are you lookingto take away?</p><p>FORE:  So, if they would all commit to stand up for young people,commit to Generation Unlimited, that would be tremendous. We've gothumanitarian appeals coming out. For UNICEF, we are in theneighborhood of $3.8 billion a year, half funded. So, if they can helpus with products and services and funding volunteers, that would begreat.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Henrietta, let's hope they're listening. Thank you.</p><p>FORE:  Thank you, Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Henrietta Fore with us today.</p><p>Well, a lot more from Davos in the day to come. We got a number ofheadlining leaders here. It's a busy day. There are some -- notableabsentees this year. And we've been discussing those, not leastTheresa May, Emmanuel Macron and the U.S. president, but there's anawful lot on the agenda. We'll be across it for you. Stay with us.Back to you for the time being.</p><p>STOUT:  Yes. And Becky, thank you for that very important conversationon empowering children around the world, and as you said, has beenmore than just lip service. It's got to be real.</p><p>Now we're monitoring another confrontation in the works in Washington,D.C. U.S. President Donald Trump, he is moving ahead with plans forhis State of the Union speech, but it's unclear at this moment exactlywhere he will deliver it.</p><p>And the Republicans and the Democrats they will vote on dueling plansto reopen the government. Neither is expected to pass.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Jim Acosta has more.</p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  It's a question theWhite House is struggling to answer exactly where will President Trumpdeliver his State of the Union address in just one week.</p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  There are many wayshe can deliver the State of the Union address. I'm not going to getahead of anything he would announce.</p><p>ACOSTA:  Even though House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on thepresident to delay his address to Congress scheduled for next Tuesday,the White House sent a letter to the House sergeant at arms requestinga planning session as if the speech was still on the calendar,writing, \"Given that we lost valuable time over the past week my teamwould like to reschedule the walk-through for this Monday, if at allpossible.\"</p><p>[03:10:12] The White House has even considered the possibility ofholding a rally outside of Washington if both sides can't reach anagreement. The brinkmanship is escalating as Senate leaders bickerover rival plans to reopen the government and all seem dead onarrival.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, (R) MAJORITY LEADER, KENTUCKY:  The opportunityto end all of this is stating us right in the face. That's why we'llvote on this legislation on the Senate floor this week.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) MINORITY LEADER, NEW YORK:  The Americanpeople know that President Trump is responsible for the shutdown. Andnow they have learned that Leader McConnell is a co-conspirator in theshutdown.</p><p>ACOSTA:  Meanwhile, some of the federal employees actually dealingwith the impact of the shutdown like FBI agents are warning real worldconsequences may be looming.</p><p>TOM O'CONNOR, PRESIDENT, FBI AGENTS ASSOCIATION:  The failure to fundthe FBI undermines essential FBI operations such as those designatedto combat crimes against children, drug and gang crimes and terrorism.</p><p>ACOSTA:  With the shutdown now more than a month long, Secretary ofState Mike Pompeo told the World Economic Forum in Davos that he hopesthe standoff will be over soon, even though there appears to be no endin sight.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When is the shutdown over?</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE:  We all hope that itwill end fairly quickly. I hope that we get this one resolved inrelatively shorter order.</p><p>ACOSTA:  A new book written by a West Wing insider painting a pictureof White House dysfunction even when the government is open. In hisbook \"Team of Vipers\" former White House aide, Cliff Sims, describes asituation that is out of control, including one moment when Mr. Trumplashed out at former House Speaker Paul Ryan for criticizing thepresident's handling of the white supremacist violence inCharlottesville.</p><p>According to the book, the president claimed he had helped the speakerin the past, saying, quote, \"You are out there dying like a dog, Paul.Like a dog.\"</p><p>The book appears to be the kind of leaking the president has blastedin the past like when he tweeted last year, \"leakers are traitors andcowards and we will find out who they are.\"</p><p>One White House official who isn't offering much information thesedays is White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders who hasn't hold abriefing in more than a month. The president says he's behind thatdecision, tweeting, \"The reasons Sarah Sanders does not go to thepodium much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely andinaccurately, in particular, certain members of the press. I told hernot to bother. The word gets out anyway. Most who never us fairlyenhance the term fake news.\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The last we checked there has not been one heldthis year, Hogan. Is there any plan to start that back up again or seeSarah Sanders back at the podium?</p><p>GIDLEY:  She's going to come back when she finds a reason to do thatbecause so often it's so funny. Because the media often tell us thatwhen Sarah Sanders stands right behind me at this podium why can't wehear from the president.</p><p>ACOSTA:  The last time the White House held a press briefing was onDecember 18th, more than a month ago and before the governmentshutdown began. That means that White House Press Secretary SarahSanders has not answered one question from the podium while how thisgovernment shutdown is affecting millions of Americans across thecountry.</p><p>Jim Acosta, CNN, the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STOUT:  Covington Catholic high school will reopen later on Wednesdaywith a police presence around the school. The Kentucky high school hasbeen the focus of controversy after video of students at the March forLife in Washington went viral. Teenagers wearing Make America GreatAgain hats were seen encountering a Native American elder, NathanPhillips.</p><p>The students were widely condemned for mocking Phillips. A videoshowing different angles raised questions about what actuallyhappened. A student in the video says he was not disrespectful.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICK SANDMANN, TEEN IN VIDEO:  As far as standing there, I have everyright to do so. In hindsight, I wish we could have walk away.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT:  Now President Trump publicly sided with the students. PressSecretary Sarah Sanders says that the administration has reached outto express support for them, and says if the president invites them tothe White House it will be after the shutdown ends.</p><p>Now Venezuela is getting ready for more demonstrations againstPresident Nicolas Maduro. The protest come hours after U.S. VicePresident Mike Pence stir the pot in a Twitter video promising supportfor the people of Venezuela who are raising their voices for freedom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Nicolas Maduro isa dictator with no legitimate claim to power. He's never won thepresidency in a free and fair election and he's maintained his grip ofpower by imprisoning anyone who dares to oppose him.</p><p>The United States joins with all freedom loving nations in recognizingthe National Assembly as the last vestige of democracy in yourcountry, for it's the only body elected by you, the people.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICOLAS MADURO, PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA (through translator):  Neverbefore has an official for the highest level come out in the name ofhis government. He spoke on behalf of the President of the UnitedStates to say that in Venezuela the opposition must overture thegovernment.</p><p>[03:15:01] That is why I have decided and given the order to thechancellor of the public that we initiate a total absolute revision ofthe relations with the government of the United States of America. Andin the next hours, we will take political diplomatic and defensedecisions of national sovereignty in defense of the constitution, indefense of Venezuelan democracy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT:  Nicolas Maduro there. And we will be monitoring protest actionin Venezuela later today.</p><p>You're watching Newsroom. And up next we'll be going back to Davos forthe World Economic Forum. David Attenborough's message for leadersabout climate change coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Davos it is sub-zero cold and every one here talking globalwarming. So how does that add up? Well, the big thing to know is thatthis climate and there's weather.</p><p>Climate, the average conditions over a really long time, decades,centuries, millennia even. Whereas, weather more of what's going onright now. So, like a hot summer's day doesn't make a hot year. A lotof snow doesn't freeze climate equations.</p><p>Plus, extreme weather like gigantic snowstorms can also be linked to achanging climate. And that explains why the world can still be gettingwarmer as a whole while we still see a lot of freezing events aroundit.</p><p>Well, some leaders heading towards more pro-business approach, andperhaps stepping away from protecting the planet. Brazil's newpresident, Jair Bolsonaro, delivered a message that his country isopen for business. But critics worry he could be a disaster for theenvironment and the Amazon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAIR BOLSONARO, PRESIDENT OF BRAZIL (through translator):  Brazil'seconomy is still relatively close to foreign trades. And to changethat situation is one of my administration's major commitments. Youcan be sure that by the end of my term in office our economic team ledby Minister of Finance, Paulo Guedes, will position Brazil in theranking of the 50 best countries in the world to do business.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[03:19:56] ANDERSON:  Well, my next guest says the Davos elite and I'massuming she's alluding to the presidents there are still pretendingwe have time to fix the climate crisis. We don't, she says, period.</p><p>Greenpeace International executive director, Jennifer Morgan joiningme now. I mean, Jair Bolsonaro heavily criticized by your own agencyfor the potential damage he will do to the Amazon and the environmentwith some of his policies.</p><p>But ultimately, Jennifer, you couldn't be here with a more attentiveaudience this year.</p><p>JENNIFER MORGAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL:  Yes.</p><p>ANDERSON:  I mean, you know, so David Attenborough speaking to justhow important it is that humans begin to think about, you know, whatis going on. It's now or never, right?</p><p>MORGAN:  Absolutely. I mean in the World Economic Forum's own globalrisk report has identified climate changes again year after year. Butagain, climate change, the top risk. We have the world scientist inOctober, saying, if we don't change course immediately --</p><p>ANDERSON:  Yes.</p><p>MORGAN:  -- we will see an increase of temperature and cataclysmic.We're in an emergency situation right now.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And you've said make no mistake, we are in a climateemergency and that's emergency must dominate. This isn't though thefirst time that we've heard these calls here. The voices, though,certainly louder this time. How do we, you, and everybody, how do weconvert words into actions at this point?</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, I think there's a number of different ways. One is justfor people for leaders to -- well, read the IPCC report andinternalize what this actually means, right? The other is for them tolisten to the 15-year-olds.</p><p>You know, yesterday, we actually had Greta Thunberg at the event whereSir David Attenborough was speaking come in and ask leaders here,corporate leaders to pledge, to promise her that they will stay belowor do everything they can stay below 1.5 degrees.</p><p>ANDERSON:  A member of consent in the room?</p><p>MORGAN:  It was a spatter of applause, right, she's coming here.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Yes.</p><p>MORGAN:  Actually, she's on her way from Sweden by train and she said,you know, I don't believe any for one minute you're going to do it,but prove me wrong, right? So -- and then there's a whole other sideof this equation, which is from a business perspective of Davos arethe opportunities that are here actually and you heard that from amajor Indian company.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, let's talk about some of those because return oninvestment is clearly what the guys and the women who are -- whoemployed by businesses to come up this hill and negotiate deals. It'sabout returns on investments, so talk to us about the opportunities ofthe environment.</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, I think there are two sides here. One is theopportunity. So renewable energy costs have gone, you know, they'redramatically lower that it's cheaper to go renewable than fossil fuelright now, even if you don't count in all of the cost.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Only just, but yes.</p><p>MORGAN:  Yes, only just, but if you don't count in all of the healthcosts also of air pollution and coal. So, you see the opportunitiesthat are -- that are there.</p><p>You see also the costs in supply chains, right, of the climate impactswhich often get forgotten. So, I just, you know, in the U.S., forexample, 40 percent of small businesses don't get reopened afterthere's extreme weather event, after there's an extreme hurricane,that type of things. So, you need to be looking at both of thosethings.</p><p>If you look at, for example, mobility right now, right, who is goingto be making the first the big market win on electric vehicles thatneed to be powered by hundred percent renewables.</p><p>So, it's all over the place, but the missing piece for my perspectiveis the political leadership which also needs to come from thecorporates because they may say things here but go back home to theparliament, and who's really pushing a high carbon price? Who'spushing a hundred percent renewables?</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, who is doing well? Let's name and shame. Who is doingwell at present and who needs to do better?</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, I think who's doing well on the renewable side ofthings, you know, actually, China has been doing quite well on therenewables, meeting their targets here and there. India is moving onsolar in a very big way. Costa Rica is going carbon neutral, small butactually very important. You know, if you look at their mobilityconcepts how they are going to be doing electric buses, how theirwhole electricity grid.</p><p>ANDERSON:  True.</p><p>MORGAN:  Those are ones that you can listen to.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So, back in an envelope wish list, if you and I, and I willsay now you're invited onto the show this time next year --</p><p>MORGAN:  I'm ready here.</p><p>ANDERSON:  -- from end 2020. What do you want to be telling me thatwas that you feel was successful in 2019? What are the key missionsthis year and what do you want to achieve?</p><p>MORGAN:  So, number one is a phaseout of coal in Germany by 2030, andthat will be decided this Friday, if not next week, and ChancellorMerkel is here and she should be signaling that. So next year, she cancome and say we're phasing out coal by 2030, we're doing it and adjustway on good just transition.[03:24:57] And Europe will have signaled it's going to increase itsambition under the Paris agreement. That means they're going to raisetheir target, right? And that means that they will have moved towardsa coal phase out. So, we need those coal phases out but Germany isnumber one really right now.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Are you basically treading water on the states until DonaldTrump isn't elected again.</p><p>MORGAN:  Absolutely not.</p><p>ANDERSON:  I'm not suggesting he won't be elected for a moment.</p><p>MORGAN:  Absolutely not. No. There's a green new deal proposal that iscoming forward also from youth actually in the U.S., which is makingits way through the House of Representatives. So, hopefully, that nextyear that will be making its way forward that's going to --</p><p>ANDERSON:  Got it.</p><p>MORGAN:  -- takes the scale into account. So, there are some bigthings. There's a summit in September by the U.N. secretary-general, Iwant to see leaders coming and announcing they're going to do more andthe numbers. I want to see the numbers.</p><p>ANDERSON:  There's some big asks in all of that. Jennifer, thank you.Good luck here.</p><p>MORGAN:  Thank you.</p><p>ANDERSON:  It's Wednesday morning in Davos, day two. Some big talk isnot least, Angela Merkel today. Let's see what she says about some ofthe key issues. It's not just, Kristie, this year about globalizationversus deglobalization, about whether as Pompeo suggested, do wereally want economic growth. Is that mission target going forward?</p><p>This year, much talk, much talk about climate change, about theenvironment, about innovation, about inequality, poverty, comfort, andhave that all fits in this message is that there is no world goingforward if we don't insure that we get on with some of those issuesthat we've been talking about for years. Kristie?</p><p>STOUT:  Absolutely, Becky. And as your guest, Jennifer Morgan, justtold you, all those issues so important, but you got to have thepolitical leadership and the will to deliver it.</p><p>Becky, thank you so much. We'll check in with you soon.</p><p>Now, all eyes on Moscow in just a few hours when Russian and Turkishleaders will meet to discuss what happens next in Syria. VladimirPutin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan are set to focus on Ankara's proposedsecurity zone in northern Syria.</p><p>And even though the Kremlin supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assadwhile Turkey has backed the rebels fighting its forces, Moscow says itcan play fair.Well, let's get straight to Moscow. CNN's Matthew Chance is standingby. Matthew, these two leaders are -- and they have been on oppositesides of the conflict. So, as they hold these talks today, what kindof common ground are they going to reach?</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Ithink, Kristie, it's more of a question of what compromise these twofigures that have a great deal of sort of measure political respectfor each other. In fact, they got quite a good personal relationshipwhich underpins their abilities to compromise.</p><p>What kind of compromise are they going to be able to reach on thisissue? You're rightly point out that one of -- one of Turkey'soverriding strategic objectives in Syria is to establish, you know, asafe haven or to deprive its Turkish rebels domestically of safehavens in that part of northern Syria. It wants to stage a fullincursion into northern Syria to establish sort of security zones Isupposed they would call them.</p><p>The Russians are keen for their ally, the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, to reassert government control over all those areas. And so,you know, it's a diplomatic dance between these two figures to seewhat sort of compromise they can reach.</p><p>The Russians have been very adept I think at drawing Turkey into anacceptance of its position that Bashar al-Assad is going to be stayingas the president of Syria. But in order to achieve that they had to inthe past make certain compromises allowing Turkey to stage limitedinsurgents into various areas in northern Syria. And we may able tosee something similar to that (ph) as a result of these talks.</p><p>STOUT:  Got it. And that shock announcement from Donald Trump that theU.S. is withdrawing in Syria. Is that adding a sense of urgency forthese leaders to reach a compromise?</p><p>CHANCE:  I think it is because it's being seen as a big opportunity bythe Turks to go in full on and really establish a big security zone inthat part of northern -- northern Syria. And so, they're really sortof chomping at the bit to get in there to do that.</p><p>And the Russians are obviously very keen for their ally, Bashar al-Assad, to move his forces into that area as well. And so, some kind ofcompromise is going to have to be worked out. But it's a very riskygame, of course. We're talking about too massive militaries, hugemilitary force on the ground.</p><p>And one of the things that's driving their constant meetings andconstant discussions about compromise is the reluctance of these twocountries to get into a full-on military confrontation with eachother.</p><p>STOUT:  All right. Matthew Chance reporting live from Moscow. Thankyou very much -- very much for joining us.</p><p>You've been watching CNN Newsroom coming to you live from Hong Kong.We'll hit you with the headlines right after this short break.</p><p>[03:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STOUT:  Welcome back, I'm Kristie Lu Stout.  Let's give you an updateon the tops stories this hour.  The U.S. Vice President Mike Pence isencouraging anti-government protesters in Venezuela ahead of a plannedmass demonstration.  He called President Nicolas Maduro a dictatorwith no legitimate claim to power.  Mr. Maduro says he wants a totalrevision of relation with the U.S.</p><p>U.S. President Trump is still planning to deliver his State of theUnion Address from the Capital as scheduled.  That despite HouseSpeaker Nancy Pelosi suggesting he move the speech because of theongoing government shutdown.  Hundreds of thousands of governmentemployees will miss a second paycheck this week.</p><p>Police had resume searching for Cardiff's City new star recruit,Emiliano Sala.  He has been missing since his plane vanished midflightover the English Channel on Monday.  Sala was flying from France toCardiff for his English Premiere League debut.  French authorities saythey still have no news of the missing plane.</p><p>Let's take things over to our Becky Anderson.  She is standing by forus at Davos, side of the World Economic Fund, Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And welcome back to what is a chilly morning here in Davos,this year's World Economic Forum.  We are expecting to hear fromleaders like the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Japan's PrimeMinister Shinzo Abe later on then, we are also expecting to hear from-- not expected to hear -- he is here with me, John Defterios, herewith me right now.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  That will be a problem, I wasn't speaking at this point,right?</p><p>ANDERSON:  Not quite yet actually (ph) yet.  John, Angela Merkel andShinzo Abe, amongst the number of world leaders who will be speakinghere today.  It's a busy day two.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes.  I would recall it a primetime World Economic Forum.This is the core day, needless to say.  Let's start with AngelaMerkel.  She's going to be leaving office soon, right?  She hassomebody coming in to replace her as the party chief.  She doesn'tlike this idea of a U.K. exit from the European Union and she's sosensitive about her legacy.</p><p>Becky, I think she's going to make a push to say, it's not too late tonegotiate.  She said it a week ago, but I think she's going tocomeback in and say for the greater good of the European Union and forthe future of Britain, let's try to work something out, at leastsomething that's not a shock to the system.  She has to worry abouther growth, 1.5 percent in 2018, was the worst in five years.</p><p>Does Shinzo Abe weigh in to the U.S.-China debate, I think, is the bigquestion here.  China is a huge exporter so as Japan and clearlycertain that he'll come out and say, look, this is not good for theglobal economy, even though he is somewhat of an ally, Shinzo Abe, ofDonald Trump.</p><p>[03:35:03] Interesting, I think that we have the Ethiopian primeminister as emerging market side (ph) fascinated by the fact that thegrowing about 10 percent, transition of power after the death of theprevious leader, a huge market in east Africa, one that is verycentral to the plans of the Middle East as well, they invest in to themarket.</p><p>And I think the keynote in terms of news coverage today is the vicepresident of China, Wang Qishan.  He is a powerful player there.  Twoyears ago Xi Jinping was saying let's not retreat from globalization,but try to solve it.  Donald Trump came with a different message lastyear, banging the drums, we may had a stalemate, they are going tohave to find a solution.</p><p>One source I spoke to yesterday was suggesting we can see it in thenext couple of months.  May not be what Donald Trump's looking for,but Donald Trump will say, I fought the good fight and I got what Iwanted for the United States.  It's hurting global markets.  It'shurting the global economy.</p><p>ANDERSON:  It is.  You're absolutely right.  These trade wars havebeen front and center since the appointment of Donald Trump back in2016 and 2017, when he was inaugurated.  We spoke earlier to onecommentator here who said, he thought the year 2018 was a year thathad -- to a certain extent was less affected by the trade wars than hethinks 2019 will be.  But we've already seen this global marketsrallying off the back of these issues, aren't we?</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  We have.  I tell you, as one observer told me thismorning, it's colder in Davos this year, but it is a lot quieterwithout Donald Trump around.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Yes.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  He was blowing the trumpets and saying I'm doing thegreatest things, regulation reform, cutting taxes, the stock marketsrallying.  If he actually came to Davos in 2019, what would be hisnarrative?  I'm fighting the good fight, shut the government down,fighting a good fight.  I'm still fighting with China --</p><p>ANDERSON:  And this markets full recovery, he will say.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes.  No, but he clearly has to find a solution becausethis takes a year to work its way through.  The tariffs are now inplace.  It's hurting U.S. farmers.  He's having to pay to subsidizethe U.S. farmers.  He still has the threat hitting the European Unioncar manufacturers, don't forget, still has that threat with Germany.So he's has threats all around and his impulsiveness is what I thinkreally rattles the Davos community, if you will.</p><p>The CEOs likes the idea of tax reform, who doesn't, if you are aleading company like this.  It is almost like a dividend payment, butthey don't want to see the tension 12 months on.</p><p>ANDERSON:  I know.DEFTERIOS:  Becky, this is a reality.</p><p>ANDERSON:  There is an emerging narrative from the progressiveDemocrats in this space and says none of this is working for the manon the street saying, we're going to do something about it should theywin in 2020.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes.</p><p>ANDERSON:  It's a very different America, I think.  John for thetiming, thank you very much, indeed.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  All right.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Democracy succeeded in Tunisia.  But eight years after theArab Spring, there is frustration and anger.  We are going to hearfrom the head of Tunisia's government after this very short break.Stay with us.</p><p>[03:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, back in 2011, the uprising in Tunisia led to thepresident's ousting and a push for democracy.  It's the Arab Spring'seight anniversary.  Protest in Tunisia's spread to Egypt, Libya, Syriaand Yemen.  But there's now growing anger over Tunisia's economicdecline in as some see it.</p><p>Joining me now is the head of the government of Tunisia, YouseffChahed.  Now, walk down memory lane, sir, if you will.  Nearly adecade since the Jasmine Revolution.  Are you confident there has beenenough fundamental change in the factors that pushed Tunisians on tothe streets because we are seeing and back on the streets at present?</p><p>YOUSEFF CHAHED, HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT OF TUNISIA:  The short answeris yes.  The wrong answer is that, of course.  This is a democracy.You don't have a democracy that is born every year in the world.  So,it takes time and Tunisia is not living alone.</p><p>We're living in a geopolitical situation.  We are also threatened byall what's happened in the world, like those stories, groups, ISIS, AlQaeda.  We're attack three times in 2015, because we are Democratic.</p><p>So answering your question, I am confident, having people in thestreets, demonstrating this is because Tunisia's democracy and they'refree to do that.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And there's be much support over the years of Tunisia and ademocracy, which is very unusual in the Middle East and North Africanregion.  So, many compliments in that way that things have gone, butthe IMF and other institutional -- or international leaders pushingyou to cut government spending and to implement reforms in order tobring in more investment and create jobs.</p><p>Are you going to roll back on any of these IMF plans, these austerityplans?  Because at present there are concerns, and if you don't, itwill be an explosion on the street.CHAHED:  I don't think -- I think of course, we know -- we need tounderstand why we arrive at this point because, as I mentionedyesterday in the session, there is a cost for having a democracy.  Wefight for having freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom ofpress.  So this is the cost.</p><p>During the last few years, the economy was suffered -- was sufferingso -- now when we arrived, the situation was very difficult.Macroeconomics deficit were weak (ph).  We arrived at 2016, there wasseven person deficit -- public deficit.  So, now we reduce it to 4.9in 2018 and we aim to have 3.9 next year.</p><p>Growth was less than 1 percent in 2016.  Now, we are talking about 3percent.  Of course, there's still some difficulties, but this is thelearning curve to have democracy.  You need to pay cost and weconsider that this costs and that we still can manage it.  And westill can -- I mean, most difficulty we can manage that.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So, what you're telling me is that despite the concernsfrom Rached Ghannouchi, for example, who is the leader of the ModernIslamist Party, concerned that there will an explosion in Tunisia.You're saying that you will stick to what the IMF has embedded for youas far as austerity plans consent, no worrying back.</p><p>CHAHED:  We are not doing that because IMF said we have to do that.We're doing that because we're concern and we are responsible for ourcountry.  We are responsible to have -- to stabile deficit.  We areresponsible of having -- to boost growth.  So, we are doing thosereforms not because IMF -- we are member of IMF, and we have a goodcooperation with IMF, but we are not doing that under the pressure ofIMF.  We discussed with IMF.  We explained some local specificities(ph).  We can do that.  We can do that.</p><p>Tunisia is a specific case.  This is a unique case in the region witha democracy in the Arab-Muslim world.  So, I think we are reallyconvinced about doing that, about reducing deficit, about creatingmore jobs, about having the most sustainable model for Tunisia withrenewable energy, with digitization.  So all those reforms, we arereally committed for those reform and we will do this reform.</p><p>ANDERSON:  What are you going to do for the man in the street?  Howare going to satisfy them, the man on the street, to support thesereforms?  I know it is not easy.  I mean, it wasn't easy in the U.K.under John Osborn, back in 2010 and after the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>You know, austerity is tough.  How are you going to convince the manon the street that this is worth the pain because it was only eightyears ago that we saw Tunisia and so many other countries around theregion explode?</p><p>[03:45:12] CHAHED:  So, by discussing, by explaining.  Today, thedialogue is free Tunisia.  We have free press or we can explain.  Thepolitical class needs to play strong role explaining those reforms,explaining how important are those reforms.  Also, we need to have akind of safety net for those vulnerable people that can probably --</p><p>ANDERSON:  You have that?</p><p>CHAHED:  Yes.  We are trying -- with IMF, we try to have that toexplain that loose reform can be difficult for certain vulnerablepeople.  So we need to address specifically those people having --giving them social protection, giving them social -- I mean, coveringtheir social needs.  So this is important and this is among ourdiscussion with IMF.</p><p>ANDERSON:  The investors have been wary for some time about investingin Tunisia.  You're optimistic about 2019 in a word?</p><p>CHAHED:  Yes, yes.  I mean, we're trying to create an enablingenvironment.  If you see doing business with simply Tunisia, we owneight spots and we think -- we think we're about -- among the fifthcountries in African and the Arabic world in terms of competitiveness.So, of course, I'm optimist.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Good luck.</p><p>CHAHED:  Thank you.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Thank you, sir, and thanks for joining us.  We are livefrom Davos.  After this short break with a fact check on Donald Trumpand the Russia investigation.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Donald Trump has made more than 8,000 false or misleadingclaims since he became the U.S. president two years ago.  Well, thatis at least according to the \"Washington Post\" fact checker database.He frequently slams and belittles the Russia investigation.</p><p>But CNN's Tom Foreman reports the facts don't support necessarily whatPresident Trump is saying.  Have a listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It is one great hoax.This is a hoax.  Witch-hunt.</p><p>TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Among all the president claims aboutthe Russia probe, none has been so unwavering as the idea that it's apartisan plot to take him down.</p><p>TRUMP:  It's a witch-hunt that is a disgrace.</p><p>FOREMAN:  But the facts say otherwise.  He's assertion of RobertMueller and his team are angry Democrats, not an ounce of proof, eventhough some contributed to Democrats in the past.  Trump's notion thatno one on his team did anything wrong, refuted by charges against andguilty pleas from five of his associates.</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE:  I don't believe Mr. Muellerwould be involved in the witch-hunt.</p><p>FOREMAN:  Even his Attorney General nominee is weighing in.BARR:  I believe the Russians interfered or attempted to interferewith the election and I think we have to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>FOREMAN:  Another claim, Trump had no business with Russia during thecampaign.</p><p>TRUMP:  I have nothing to do with Russia, folks, OK.  I'll give you awritten statement.</p><p>I know nothing about Russian, I know -- I know about Russia, but Iknow nothing about the inner workings of Russia.  I don't deal withthem.</p><p>FOREMAN:  He's former Attorney Michael Cohen, heading to jail andcooperating with the Mueller investigation says contrary to earlierdenials plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow were still in the works deepinto the election.</p><p>RUDY GUILIANI, ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP:  He's telling theprosecutors what they want to hear.</p><p>FOREMAN:  Though Trump's current attorney, Rudy Giuliani, continues totry and muddy the water.</p><p>[03:50:03] GUILIANI:  There's no business there.</p><p>JAKE TAPPER, CNN CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  I don't deal thereis what the president said.</p><p>GUILIANI:  He said I'm not doing business in Russia.</p><p>TAPPER:  He said, I don't deal there.</p><p>GUILIANI:  I don't -- I don't have any -- he doesn't.</p><p>FOREMAN:  Another claimed.  Trump's team was not coordinating withRussians.</p><p>TRUMP:  there has been no collusion.  Absolutely no collusion.</p><p>FOREMAN:  It's now known 16 Trump associates had contact with Russiansduring the campaign or transition, including at that now infamousmeeting in Trump Tower involving Donald Trump Jr. in which he had beenpromised dirt on Hillary Clinton.  Proof of course collusion?  No.Communication?  Absolutely.</p><p>And Trump has repeatedly said, maybe the Russians weren't eveninvolve.  He has raise doubts time and again about the whole idea thatRussia interfered in the election, even standing next to the Russianpresident as he did so.</p><p>TRUMP:  I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I willtell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in hisdenial today.</p><p>FOREMAN:  But of course, all the major U.S. intelligence agencies saythe evidence points squarely and overwhelmingly at Russia.</p><p>These are just half a dozen of examples of what the Washington Postsays or hundreds of times the president misstated, misled, or flat-outlied about the Russian investigation.</p><p>Tom Foreman, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Let's do more in this show, we're here in Davos, I'm withthe Wired editor-in-chief, that's a magazine called Wired, he's notwired himself.  Nicholas Thompson is in the house.  It's cold over theyear.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>In an era of Donald Trump, just for my benefit and the benefit of theviewers, let's just define the difference between misinformation anddisinformation, if you will.</p><p>NICHOLAS THOMPSON, EDITOR IN CHIEF, WIRED:  It's tricky boundary, butI would say, misinformation is information that somebody didn't intendto mislead.  It is put something wrong on the Internet.  And the waysocial networks work, a lot of times that gets rather amplified.</p><p>Disinformation is when somebody goes on and says I'm going to confusethem, I want to disrupt democracy.  I want to put something genuinelywrong and I'm going to do it with malicious intent.</p><p>ANDERSON:  How much disinformation is around these days?</p><p>THOMPSON:  An awful lot because the people have seen that it can bequite effective the way the platform worked, the way our minds work,you can put misleading malevolent information on the Internet and itwill spread and it will mislead people.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So, what is Big Tech doing about that?  Because he seemedtrouble at present, isn't it?</p><p>THOMPSON:  It's -- well, it's a deep trouble in lots of ways atpresent, but there have been extraordinary efforts to try to stop thisand certainly in United States --</p><p>ANDERSON:  Is it a little too late?</p><p>THOMPSON:  Too little too late for 2016.  There is incredibledisinformation.  And of course, we are living in the consequences ofthat.  But if you look the 2018 election, things are on a lot better.We don't know for sure because you never can quite tell what'shappened.  The question now is the capacity for this information hasgone with artificial intelligence, the ability to create images thatlook like anybody or sound like anybody.</p><p>So as we head into 2020, what can we do not have this problem getworse?  And then of course, in elections around the world, what can bedone now to prevent it?  ANDERSON:  A lot of focus here on climate change.  Some say that weare decades behind the curve. Is Big Tech the next crisis that wellare not talk -- I know you said, you know, back in the day in 2016, wewere sideswiped by what was going on, by this disinformation.  You say2018, it looks that we are doing better.  And by 2020, you know, willwe have move to -- let me just give you our views of, you know,something to think about here.</p><p>Amazon will soon know when you need light bulbs right before theyburned out.  YouTube knows how to keep you staring at the screen longpause when in your interest stuff.  An advertiser in the future mightknow your sexual preferences before they are clear to you.</p><p>THOMPSON:  Yes, that's true.  I mean, the amount of data that wegenerate that the companies have and the capacity they have to usethat data and understand us is mind-boggling.  And that's one of thereasons people care so much about privacy right now because when youthink about the data that could be given off.</p><p>But when you think about the future, the world is cracking apart.Democracy is faltering right now.  Technology is for the role in thefraction of democracy and the question is, many of these companieswere designed to promote democracy.  So can they help bring the worldback together then?</p><p>ANDERSON:  We're they?  We're they really, we were told they designedto promote democracy --</p><p>THOMPSON:  Certainly many of the people who work there cared deeplyabout the idea that technology would help promote democracy, wouldmake the world, you know, more open and connected.</p><p>ANDERSON:  But are they connected?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>THOMPSON:  That is a very good question.  I think there are structuraldecisions made at the beginning that set companies in the wrongdirection, but I absolutely believe there is a deep strain of idealismin Silicon Valley, which is why there is a real reckoning right now.</p><p>ANDERSON:  To that point and I know that one of the sessions that youwill be part of here will be a session about human rights andtechnology.</p><p>[03:55:05] THOMPSON:  Yes.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Just what's the can see (ph) of your argument or narrativeabout human rights and whether technology is a good or bad things forour rights going forward?</p><p>THOMPSON:  Technology should be a very good thing.  It should be thingthat, you know, enables people who don't have voices to have voicesthat allows people who have been imprisoned unjustly to organizecampaigns to get out.  But what we've also seen is because ofmisinformation and disinformation that can have the opposite effect.One of the most interesting questions for me, since I'll be discussingit on today is that the structure of the Internet was initiallydesigned to give people anonymity, right?  So that you could reporthuman rights abuses.  But because the structure allows your anonymity,that makes disinformation and misinformation and abuse of dissidentsmuch easier.  So it's a structural decision made when the Internet iscreated that ultimately has kind of the opposite effect.</p><p>And so one of the things that technology is doing now is trying tolook the way the Internet works, the way the platforms were concerned,what did we do wrong that help put us in the world where it now andcan we fix it?

But this year's trade disputes and slowing growth havebeen the major topics here in Davos, the World Economic Forum so far.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So is the rise of populism and what some are calling deglobalizationshaking the world order. Also, breaking with traditions, some majorfigures are missing from the meeting this year.  With Brexit battlesat home, British Prime Minister Theresa May isn't here, and the yellowvests protests keeping the French president busy as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The U.S. government shutdown meant the White House didn't send adelegation, but U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did speak byteleconference and he praised political disruptions, saying he felt itwas a force for good.</p><p>But one of the leaders who did make the trip to Davos was Brazil's newpresident. Jair Bolsonaro delivered the message that his country wasopen for business.</p><p>Well, in the coming hours, we expect to hear from the GermanChancellor Angela Merkel, the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,amongst others.</p><p>But this year, for the first time, the organizers here at the WorldEconomic Forum have named six people under the age of 30 as co-chairsof the meeting. It makes sense. Young people are the people who aregoing to be most impacted by all of the things that are being talkedabout here in Davos, climate change, the rise of A.I. and automation,long running conflicts, for example.</p><p>And when UNICEF, the global body tasked with promoting the rights ofyoungsters asked young people what they want world leaders andbusiness tycoons to focus on, they were clear, we want better jobs,more access to education and more than half believe business leaderscould do more to help young people succeed.</p><p>Well, UNICEF executive director, Henrietta Fore, joining me now. Theyoungsters have spoken.  Our business leaders pay anything more thanlip service to their demands, Henrietta?</p><p>HENRIETTA FORE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, UNICEF:  I think it's starting andhaving this Davos session on young people and on globalization,they're really starting to pick up the idea that young people need abetter education, they need to think about what kinds of jobs andskills they need for the future and that we need to help train themand give them internships and apprenticeships.</p><p>It's their time. They say we're 25 percent of the world but we're 100percent of your future. And they're right.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And when I said they pay more than lip service and you --this isn't your first visit to the Davos meeting. We met here lastyear. I think you were newly installed in the job at that time.</p><p>Are you feeling more or less optimistic about the prospects foryoungsters around the world? I mean, I live in a region where morethan 60 percent of people are under the age of 30, unemployment veryhigh across the Middle East region, and sort of optimism pretty low.</p><p>FORE:  Yes. Well, you know, on the one hand there is a whole group ofcountries that are quite optimistic about their young people and theirimbalance. For many, though, this demographic dividend, this enormouspopulation surge is really overwhelming them. It's overwhelming all oftheir capacities in schools and institutions.</p><p>So, it's mixed. But this is the 30th anniversary of the Convention onthe Rights of the Child. So, we're optimistic at UNICEF that this isthe time when everyone is going to advocate.</p><p>And we've just launched this new initiative, Becky, GenerationUnlimited and that's for young people between the ages of 10 and 24.We want the world to stand up for this age group to try to give them achance a future in life.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Generation Unlimited, mark that one, viewers. Last year,this time, we discussed the plight of children in conflict.  In Syria,for example, four million kids have been born since the start of thecivil war. And that means they have only known war in their entirelives, same with twice (ph) to kids in Yemen or places like SouthSudan or the Rohingya children, for example.</p><p>Apart from appealing for funds and more support, what can anorganization like yours do here at Davos to make a difference?</p><p>FORE:  Well, we hope that we're going to be able to continue thosefunds. We work in humanitarian sessions. So, for instance, educationin Syria and in Yemen, half the schools are closed and these youngpeople need to get back into school.</p><p>[03:05:07] So, if you've been a child in Syria you may have been bornduring the war, you've only known war, it's been going on for eightyears. And so, many of the students have to catch up.  So, they're inone room school houses. We have an accelerated program for children tocatch up.So, businesses here can help by funding, but also giving us onlineeducation so that we can do it in every language with every communityno matter how remote the community. But they can help in education andnutrition, in health, in protection, water and sanitation. Water is anenormous need, clean water, you know that.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So many of the issues that you and I have discussed in thepast conflict, inequality, poverty being discussed here I have to sayalongside issues like climate change, for example, the environment.Just how difficult is it to embed these issues within the minds ofthose -- at a meeting like this who really can make a difference.</p><p>Let's be -- let's be really honest. I mean, you're here once again. Iknow it's important. You need political will from government. You needthat funding support. But this private sector up here, and you justalluded to some of the things that can be done. But you know, are they-- are they paying more than lip service? I'm going to ram thisquestion home until I get you. I'm not suggesting you're not beinghonest. I'm just saying, are they doing more than just paying lipservice?</p><p>FORE:  Well, they could do so much more. This is care about doing theright thing now. They care about the sustainable development goals.They have purpose. They have a mission. But have they really thoughtthrough how their businesses, their new innovations could help thehumanitarian world or all of these young children around the world?They have not yet thoroughly thought about that.</p><p>So, we're trying to catch every business we can, every foundation wecan. We need innovations in our world. We're doing things the sameway. When I was in Syria, we were in the bombed-out area in east Douma-- in Douma in east Ghouta, and when you walk through there, it's notlivable. The apartment buildings are coming down. We had big vats ofwater that are clean water that you can go to get clean water forcooking for your family.</p><p>Our business is thinking about how their supply chains and how theirproducts and services could be used in these situations. We have 300emergencies a year.</p><p>So, to your point, could we use more help? We surely could. We needthe commitment of every CEO here. We do. But we need them to look attheir basic business so that it's sustainable so they want to do ityear after year after year because the world needs a lot of help.</p><p>ANDERSON:  I know you don't come here thinking, well, let's hope weachieve something. You come here with a defined mission. What is thetakeaway that you -- that you will be pleased with Friday afternoonwhen you leave this mountain top in Switzerland? What are you lookingto take away?</p><p>FORE:  So, if they would all commit to stand up for young people,commit to Generation Unlimited, that would be tremendous. We've gothumanitarian appeals coming out. For UNICEF, we are in theneighborhood of $3.8 billion a year, half funded. So, if they can helpus with products and services and funding volunteers, that would begreat.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Henrietta, let's hope they're listening. Thank you.</p><p>FORE:  Thank you, Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Henrietta Fore with us today.</p><p>Well, a lot more from Davos in the day to come. We got a number ofheadlining leaders here. It's a busy day. There are some -- notableabsentees this year. And we've been discussing those, not leastTheresa May, Emmanuel Macron and the U.S. president, but there's anawful lot on the agenda. We'll be across it for you. Stay with us.Back to you for the time being.</p><p>STOUT:  Yes. And Becky, thank you for that very important conversationon empowering children around the world, and as you said, has beenmore than just lip service. It's got to be real.</p><p>Now we're monitoring another confrontation in the works in Washington,D.C. U.S. President Donald Trump, he is moving ahead with plans forhis State of the Union speech, but it's unclear at this moment exactlywhere he will deliver it.</p><p>And the Republicans and the Democrats they will vote on dueling plansto reopen the government. Neither is expected to pass.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Jim Acosta has more.</p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  It's a question theWhite House is struggling to answer exactly where will President Trumpdeliver his State of the Union address in just one week.</p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  There are many wayshe can deliver the State of the Union address. I'm not going to getahead of anything he would announce.</p><p>ACOSTA:  Even though House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on thepresident to delay his address to Congress scheduled for next Tuesday,the White House sent a letter to the House sergeant at arms requestinga planning session as if the speech was still on the calendar,writing, \"Given that we lost valuable time over the past week my teamwould like to reschedule the walk-through for this Monday, if at allpossible.\"</p><p>[03:10:12] The White House has even considered the possibility ofholding a rally outside of Washington if both sides can't reach anagreement. The brinkmanship is escalating as Senate leaders bickerover rival plans to reopen the government and all seem dead onarrival.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, (R) MAJORITY LEADER, KENTUCKY:  The opportunityto end all of this is stating us right in the face. That's why we'llvote on this legislation on the Senate floor this week.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) MINORITY LEADER, NEW YORK:  The Americanpeople know that President Trump is responsible for the shutdown. Andnow they have learned that Leader McConnell is a co-conspirator in theshutdown.</p><p>ACOSTA:  Meanwhile, some of the federal employees actually dealingwith the impact of the shutdown like FBI agents are warning real worldconsequences may be looming.</p><p>TOM O'CONNOR, PRESIDENT, FBI AGENTS ASSOCIATION:  The failure to fundthe FBI undermines essential FBI operations such as those designatedto combat crimes against children, drug and gang crimes and terrorism.</p><p>ACOSTA:  With the shutdown now more than a month long, Secretary ofState Mike Pompeo told the World Economic Forum in Davos that he hopesthe standoff will be over soon, even though there appears to be no endin sight.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When is the shutdown over?</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE:  We all hope that itwill end fairly quickly. I hope that we get this one resolved inrelatively shorter order.</p><p>ACOSTA:  A new book written by a West Wing insider painting a pictureof White House dysfunction even when the government is open. In hisbook \"Team of Vipers\" former White House aide, Cliff Sims, describes asituation that is out of control, including one moment when Mr. Trumplashed out at former House Speaker Paul Ryan for criticizing thepresident's handling of the white supremacist violence inCharlottesville.</p><p>According to the book, the president claimed he had helped the speakerin the past, saying, quote, \"You are out there dying like a dog, Paul.Like a dog.\"</p><p>The book appears to be the kind of leaking the president has blastedin the past like when he tweeted last year, \"leakers are traitors andcowards and we will find out who they are.\"</p><p>One White House official who isn't offering much information thesedays is White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders who hasn't hold abriefing in more than a month. The president says he's behind thatdecision, tweeting, \"The reasons Sarah Sanders does not go to thepodium much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely andinaccurately, in particular, certain members of the press. I told hernot to bother. The word gets out anyway. Most who never us fairlyenhance the term fake news.\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The last we checked there has not been one heldthis year, Hogan. Is there any plan to start that back up again or seeSarah Sanders back at the podium?</p><p>GIDLEY:  She's going to come back when she finds a reason to do thatbecause so often it's so funny. Because the media often tell us thatwhen Sarah Sanders stands right behind me at this podium why can't wehear from the president.</p><p>ACOSTA:  The last time the White House held a press briefing was onDecember 18th, more than a month ago and before the governmentshutdown began. That means that White House Press Secretary SarahSanders has not answered one question from the podium while how thisgovernment shutdown is affecting millions of Americans across thecountry.</p><p>Jim Acosta, CNN, the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STOUT:  Covington Catholic high school will reopen later on Wednesdaywith a police presence around the school.

In hindsight, I wish we could have walk away.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT:  Now President Trump publicly sided with the students. PressSecretary Sarah Sanders says that the administration has reached outto express support for them, and says if the president invites them tothe White House it will be after the shutdown ends.</p><p>Now Venezuela is getting ready for more demonstrations againstPresident Nicolas Maduro. The protest come hours after U.S. VicePresident Mike Pence stir the pot in a Twitter video promising supportfor the people of Venezuela who are raising their voices for freedom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Nicolas Maduro isa dictator with no legitimate claim to power. He's never won thepresidency in a free and fair election and he's maintained his grip ofpower by imprisoning anyone who dares to oppose him.</p><p>The United States joins with all freedom loving nations in recognizingthe National Assembly as the last vestige of democracy in yourcountry, for it's the only body elected by you, the people.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICOLAS MADURO, PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA (through translator):  Neverbefore has an official for the highest level come out in the name ofhis government. He spoke on behalf of the President of the UnitedStates to say that in Venezuela the opposition must overture thegovernment.</p><p>[03:15:01] That is why I have decided and given the order to thechancellor of the public that we initiate a total absolute revision ofthe relations with the government of the United States of America.

And we will be monitoring protest actionin Venezuela later today.</p><p>You're watching Newsroom. And up next we'll be going back to Davos forthe World Economic Forum. David Attenborough's message for leadersabout climate change coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Davos it is sub-zero cold and every one here talking globalwarming. So how does that add up? Well, the big thing to know is thatthis climate and there's weather.</p><p>Climate, the average conditions over a really long time, decades,centuries, millennia even. Whereas, weather more of what's going onright now. So, like a hot summer's day doesn't make a hot year. A lotof snow doesn't freeze climate equations.</p><p>Plus, extreme weather like gigantic snowstorms can also be linked to achanging climate. And that explains why the world can still be gettingwarmer as a whole while we still see a lot of freezing events aroundit.</p><p>Well, some leaders heading towards more pro-business approach, andperhaps stepping away from protecting the planet. Brazil's newpresident, Jair Bolsonaro, delivered a message that his country isopen for business. But critics worry he could be a disaster for theenvironment and the Amazon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAIR BOLSONARO, PRESIDENT OF BRAZIL (through translator):  Brazil'seconomy is still relatively close to foreign trades. And to changethat situation is one of my administration's major commitments. Youcan be sure that by the end of my term in office our economic team ledby Minister of Finance, Paulo Guedes, will position Brazil in theranking of the 50 best countries in the world to do business.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[03:19:56] ANDERSON:  Well, my next guest says the Davos elite and I'massuming she's alluding to the presidents there are still pretendingwe have time to fix the climate crisis. We don't, she says, period.</p><p>Greenpeace International executive director, Jennifer Morgan joiningme now. I mean, Jair Bolsonaro heavily criticized by your own agencyfor the potential damage he will do to the Amazon and the environmentwith some of his policies.</p><p>But ultimately, Jennifer, you couldn't be here with a more attentiveaudience this year.</p><p>JENNIFER MORGAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL:  Yes.</p><p>ANDERSON:  I mean, you know, so David Attenborough speaking to justhow important it is that humans begin to think about, you know, whatis going on. It's now or never, right?</p><p>MORGAN:  Absolutely. I mean in the World Economic Forum's own globalrisk report has identified climate changes again year after year. Butagain, climate change, the top risk. We have the world scientist inOctober, saying, if we don't change course immediately --</p><p>ANDERSON:  Yes.</p><p>MORGAN:  -- we will see an increase of temperature and cataclysmic.We're in an emergency situation right now.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And you've said make no mistake, we are in a climateemergency and that's emergency must dominate. This isn't though thefirst time that we've heard these calls here. The voices, though,certainly louder this time. How do we, you, and everybody, how do weconvert words into actions at this point?</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, I think there's a number of different ways. One is justfor people for leaders to -- well, read the IPCC report andinternalize what this actually means, right? The other is for them tolisten to the 15-year-olds.</p><p>You know, yesterday, we actually had Greta Thunberg at the event whereSir David Attenborough was speaking come in and ask leaders here,corporate leaders to pledge, to promise her that they will stay belowor do everything they can stay below 1.5 degrees.</p><p>ANDERSON:  A member of consent in the room?</p><p>MORGAN:  It was a spatter of applause, right, she's coming here.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Yes.</p><p>MORGAN:  Actually, she's on her way from Sweden by train and she said,you know, I don't believe any for one minute you're going to do it,but prove me wrong, right? So -- and then there's a whole other sideof this equation, which is from a business perspective of Davos arethe opportunities that are here actually and you heard that from amajor Indian company.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, let's talk about some of those because return oninvestment is clearly what the guys and the women who are -- whoemployed by businesses to come up this hill and negotiate deals. It'sabout returns on investments, so talk to us about the opportunities ofthe environment.</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, I think there are two sides here. One is theopportunity. So renewable energy costs have gone, you know, they'redramatically lower that it's cheaper to go renewable than fossil fuelright now, even if you don't count in all of the cost.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Only just, but yes.</p><p>MORGAN:  Yes, only just, but if you don't count in all of the healthcosts also of air pollution and coal. So, you see the opportunitiesthat are -- that are there.</p><p>You see also the costs in supply chains, right, of the climate impactswhich often get forgotten. So, I just, you know, in the U.S., forexample, 40 percent of small businesses don't get reopened afterthere's extreme weather event, after there's an extreme hurricane,that type of things. So, you need to be looking at both of thosethings.</p><p>If you look at, for example, mobility right now, right, who is goingto be making the first the big market win on electric vehicles thatneed to be powered by hundred percent renewables.</p><p>So, it's all over the place, but the missing piece for my perspectiveis the political leadership which also needs to come from thecorporates because they may say things here but go back home to theparliament, and who's really pushing a high carbon price? Who'spushing a hundred percent renewables?</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, who is doing well? Let's name and shame. Who is doingwell at present and who needs to do better?</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, I think who's doing well on the renewable side ofthings, you know, actually, China has been doing quite well on therenewables, meeting their targets here and there. India is moving onsolar in a very big way. Costa Rica is going carbon neutral, small butactually very important. You know, if you look at their mobilityconcepts how they are going to be doing electric buses, how theirwhole electricity grid.</p><p>ANDERSON:  True.</p><p>MORGAN:  Those are ones that you can listen to.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So, back in an envelope wish list, if you and I, and I willsay now you're invited onto the show this time next year --</p><p>MORGAN:  I'm ready here.</p><p>ANDERSON:  -- from end 2020. What do you want to be telling me thatwas that you feel was successful in 2019? What are the key missionsthis year and what do you want to achieve?</p><p>MORGAN:  So, number one is a phaseout of coal in Germany by 2030, andthat will be decided this Friday, if not next week, and ChancellorMerkel is here and she should be signaling that. So next year, she cancome and say we're phasing out coal by 2030, we're doing it and adjustway on good just transition.[03:24:57] And Europe will have signaled it's going to increase itsambition under the Paris agreement. That means they're going to raisetheir target, right? And that means that they will have moved towardsa coal phase out. So, we need those coal phases out but Germany isnumber one really right now.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Are you basically treading water on the states until DonaldTrump isn't elected again.</p><p>MORGAN:  Absolutely not.</p><p>ANDERSON:  I'm not suggesting he won't be elected for a moment.</p><p>MORGAN:  Absolutely not. No. There's a green new deal proposal that iscoming forward also from youth actually in the U.S., which is makingits way through the House of Representatives. So, hopefully, that nextyear that will be making its way forward that's going to --</p><p>ANDERSON:  Got it.</p><p>MORGAN:  -- takes the scale into account. So, there are some bigthings. There's a summit in September by the U.N. secretary-general, Iwant to see leaders coming and announcing they're going to do more andthe numbers. I want to see the numbers.</p><p>ANDERSON:  There's some big asks in all of that. Jennifer, thank you.Good luck here.</p><p>MORGAN:  Thank you.</p><p>ANDERSON:  It's Wednesday morning in Davos, day two. Some big talk isnot least, Angela Merkel today. Let's see what she says about some ofthe key issues. It's not just, Kristie, this year about globalizationversus deglobalization, about whether as Pompeo suggested, do wereally want economic growth. Is that mission target going forward?</p><p>This year, much talk, much talk about climate change, about theenvironment, about innovation, about inequality, poverty, comfort, andhave that all fits in this message is that there is no world goingforward if we don't insure that we get on with some of those issuesthat we've been talking about for years. Kristie?</p><p>STOUT:  Absolutely, Becky. And as your guest, Jennifer Morgan, justtold you, all those issues so important, but you got to have thepolitical leadership and the will to deliver it.</p><p>Becky, thank you so much. We'll check in with you soon.</p><p>Now, all eyes on Moscow in just a few hours when Russian and Turkishleaders will meet to discuss what happens next in Syria. VladimirPutin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan are set to focus on Ankara's proposedsecurity zone in northern Syria.</p><p>And even though the Kremlin supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assadwhile Turkey has backed the rebels fighting its forces, Moscow says itcan play fair.Well, let's get straight to Moscow. CNN's Matthew Chance is standingby. Matthew, these two leaders are -- and they have been on oppositesides of the conflict. So, as they hold these talks today, what kindof common ground are they going to reach?</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Ithink, Kristie, it's more of a question of what compromise these twofigures that have a great deal of sort of measure political respectfor each other. In fact, they got quite a good personal relationshipwhich underpins their abilities to compromise.</p><p>What kind of compromise are they going to be able to reach on thisissue? You're rightly point out that one of -- one of Turkey'soverriding strategic objectives in Syria is to establish, you know, asafe haven or to deprive its Turkish rebels domestically of safehavens in that part of northern Syria. It wants to stage a fullincursion into northern Syria to establish sort of security zones Isupposed they would call them.</p><p>The Russians are keen for their ally, the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, to reassert government control over all those areas. And so,you know, it's a diplomatic dance between these two figures to seewhat sort of compromise they can reach.</p><p>The Russians have been very adept I think at drawing Turkey into anacceptance of its position that Bashar al-Assad is going to be stayingas the president of Syria. But in order to achieve that they had to inthe past make certain compromises allowing Turkey to stage limitedinsurgents into various areas in northern Syria. And we may able tosee something similar to that (ph) as a result of these talks.</p><p>STOUT:  Got it. And that shock announcement from Donald Trump that theU.S. is withdrawing in Syria. Is that adding a sense of urgency forthese leaders to reach a compromise?</p><p>CHANCE:  I think it is because it's being seen as a big opportunity bythe Turks to go in full on and really establish a big security zone inthat part of northern -- northern Syria. And so, they're really sortof chomping at the bit to get in there to do that.</p><p>And the Russians are obviously very keen for their ally, Bashar al-Assad, to move his forces into that area as well. And so, some kind ofcompromise is going to have to be worked out. But it's a very riskygame, of course. We're talking about too massive militaries, hugemilitary force on the ground.</p><p>And one of the things that's driving their constant meetings andconstant discussions about compromise is the reluctance of these twocountries to get into a full-on military confrontation with eachother.</p><p>STOUT:  All right. Matthew Chance reporting live from Moscow. Thankyou very much -- very much for joining us.</p><p>You've been watching CNN Newsroom coming to you live from Hong Kong.We'll hit you with the headlines right after this short break.</p><p>[03:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STOUT:  Welcome back, I'm Kristie Lu Stout.  Let's give you an updateon the tops stories this hour.  The U.S. Vice President Mike Pence isencouraging anti-government protesters in Venezuela ahead of a plannedmass demonstration.  He called President Nicolas Maduro a dictatorwith no legitimate claim to power.  Mr. Maduro says he wants a totalrevision of relation with the U.S.</p><p>U.S. President Trump is still planning to deliver his State of theUnion Address from the Capital as scheduled.  That despite HouseSpeaker Nancy Pelosi suggesting he move the speech because of theongoing government shutdown.  Hundreds of thousands of governmentemployees will miss a second paycheck this week.</p><p>Police had resume searching for Cardiff's City new star recruit,Emiliano Sala.  He has been missing since his plane vanished midflightover the English Channel on Monday.  Sala was flying from France toCardiff for his English Premiere League debut.  French authorities saythey still have no news of the missing plane.</p><p>Let's take things over to our Becky Anderson.  She is standing by forus at Davos, side of the World Economic Fund, Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And welcome back to what is a chilly morning here in Davos,this year's World Economic Forum.  We are expecting to hear fromleaders like the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Japan's PrimeMinister Shinzo Abe later on then, we are also expecting to hear from-- not expected to hear -- he is here with me, John Defterios, herewith me right now.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  That will be a problem, I wasn't speaking at this point,right?</p><p>ANDERSON:  Not quite yet actually (ph) yet.  John, Angela Merkel andShinzo Abe, amongst the number of world leaders who will be speakinghere today.  It's a busy day two.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes.  I would recall it a primetime World Economic Forum.This is the core day, needless to say.  Let's start with AngelaMerkel.  She's going to be leaving office soon, right?  She hassomebody coming in to replace her as the party chief.  She doesn'tlike this idea of a U.K. exit from the European Union and she's sosensitive about her legacy.</p><p>Becky, I think she's going to make a push to say, it's not too late tonegotiate.  She said it a week ago, but I think she's going tocomeback in and say for the greater good of the European Union and forthe future of Britain, let's try to work something out, at leastsomething that's not a shock to the system.  She has to worry abouther growth, 1.5 percent in 2018, was the worst in five years.</p><p>Does Shinzo Abe weigh in to the U.S.-China debate, I think, is the bigquestion here.  China is a huge exporter so as Japan and clearlycertain that he'll come out and say, look, this is not good for theglobal economy, even though he is somewhat of an ally, Shinzo Abe, ofDonald Trump.</p><p>[03:35:03] Interesting, I think that we have the Ethiopian primeminister as emerging market side (ph) fascinated by the fact that thegrowing about 10 percent, transition of power after the death of theprevious leader, a huge market in east Africa, one that is verycentral to the plans of the Middle East as well, they invest in to themarket.</p><p>And I think the keynote in terms of news coverage today is the vicepresident of China, Wang Qishan.  He is a powerful player there.  Twoyears ago Xi Jinping was saying let's not retreat from globalization,but try to solve it.  Donald Trump came with a different message lastyear, banging the drums, we may had a stalemate, they are going tohave to find a solution.</p><p>One source I spoke to yesterday was suggesting we can see it in thenext couple of months.  May not be what Donald Trump's looking for,but Donald Trump will say, I fought the good fight and I got what Iwanted for the United States.  It's hurting global markets.  It'shurting the global economy.</p><p>ANDERSON:  It is.  You're absolutely right.  These trade wars havebeen front and center since the appointment of Donald Trump back in2016 and 2017, when he was inaugurated.  We spoke earlier to onecommentator here who said, he thought the year 2018 was a year thathad -- to a certain extent was less affected by the trade wars than hethinks 2019 will be.  But we've already seen this global marketsrallying off the back of these issues, aren't we?</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  We have.  I tell you, as one observer told me thismorning, it's colder in Davos this year, but it is a lot quieterwithout Donald Trump around.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Yes.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  He was blowing the trumpets and saying I'm doing thegreatest things, regulation reform, cutting taxes, the stock marketsrallying.  If he actually came to Davos in 2019, what would be hisnarrative?  I'm fighting the good fight, shut the government down,fighting a good fight.  I'm still fighting with China --</p><p>ANDERSON:  And this markets full recovery, he will say.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes.  No, but he clearly has to find a solution becausethis takes a year to work its way through.  The tariffs are now inplace.  It's hurting U.S. farmers.  He's having to pay to subsidizethe U.S. farmers.  He still has the threat hitting the European Unioncar manufacturers, don't forget, still has that threat with Germany.So he's has threats all around and his impulsiveness is what I thinkreally rattles the Davos community, if you will.</p><p>The CEOs likes the idea of tax reform, who doesn't, if you are aleading company like this.  It is almost like a dividend payment, butthey don't want to see the tension 12 months on.</p><p>ANDERSON:  I know.DEFTERIOS:  Becky, this is a reality.</p><p>ANDERSON:  There is an emerging narrative from the progressiveDemocrats in this space and says none of this is working for the manon the street saying, we're going to do something about it should theywin in 2020.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes.</p><p>ANDERSON:  It's a very different America, I think.  John for thetiming, thank you very much, indeed.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  All right.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Democracy succeeded in Tunisia.  But eight years after theArab Spring, there is frustration and anger.  We are going to hearfrom the head of Tunisia's government after this very short break.Stay with us.</p><p>[03:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, back in 2011, the uprising in Tunisia led to thepresident's ousting and a push for democracy.  It's the Arab Spring'seight anniversary.  Protest in Tunisia's spread to Egypt, Libya, Syriaand Yemen.  But there's now growing anger over Tunisia's economicdecline in as some see it.</p><p>Joining me now is the head of the government of Tunisia, YouseffChahed.  Now, walk down memory lane, sir, if you will.  Nearly adecade since the Jasmine Revolution.  Are you confident there has beenenough fundamental change in the factors that pushed Tunisians on tothe streets because we are seeing and back on the streets at present?</p><p>YOUSEFF CHAHED, HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT OF TUNISIA:  The short answeris yes.  The wrong answer is that, of course.  This is a democracy.You don't have a democracy that is born every year in the world.  So,it takes time and Tunisia is not living alone.</p><p>We're living in a geopolitical situation.  We are also threatened byall what's happened in the world, like those stories, groups, ISIS, AlQaeda.  We're attack three times in 2015, because we are Democratic.</p><p>So answering your question, I am confident, having people in thestreets, demonstrating this is because Tunisia's democracy and they'refree to do that.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And there's be much support over the years of Tunisia and ademocracy, which is very unusual in the Middle East and North Africanregion.  So, many compliments in that way that things have gone, butthe IMF and other institutional -- or international leaders pushingyou to cut government spending and to implement reforms in order tobring in more investment and create jobs.</p><p>Are you going to roll back on any of these IMF plans, these austerityplans?  Because at present there are concerns, and if you don't, itwill be an explosion on the street.CHAHED:  I don't think -- I think of course, we know -- we need tounderstand why we arrive at this point because, as I mentionedyesterday in the session, there is a cost for having a democracy.  Wefight for having freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom ofpress.  So this is the cost.</p><p>During the last few years, the economy was suffered -- was sufferingso -- now when we arrived, the situation was very difficult.Macroeconomics deficit were weak (ph).  We arrived at 2016, there wasseven person deficit -- public deficit.  So, now we reduce it to 4.9in 2018 and we aim to have 3.9 next year.</p><p>Growth was less than 1 percent in 2016.  Now, we are talking about 3percent.  Of course, there's still some difficulties, but this is thelearning curve to have democracy.  You need to pay cost and weconsider that this costs and that we still can manage it.  And westill can -- I mean, most difficulty we can manage that.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So, what you're telling me is that despite the concernsfrom Rached Ghannouchi, for example, who is the leader of the ModernIslamist Party, concerned that there will an explosion in Tunisia.You're saying that you will stick to what the IMF has embedded for youas far as austerity plans consent, no worrying back.</p><p>CHAHED:  We are not doing that because IMF said we have to do that.We're doing that because we're concern and we are responsible for ourcountry.  We are responsible to have -- to stabile deficit.  We areresponsible of having -- to boost growth.  So, we are doing thosereforms not because IMF -- we are member of IMF, and we have a goodcooperation with IMF, but we are not doing that under the pressure ofIMF.  We discussed with IMF.  We explained some local specificities(ph).  We can do that.  We can do that.</p><p>Tunisia is a specific case.  This is a unique case in the region witha democracy in the Arab-Muslim world.  So, I think we are reallyconvinced about doing that, about reducing deficit, about creatingmore jobs, about having the most sustainable model for Tunisia withrenewable energy, with digitization.  So all those reforms, we arereally committed for those reform and we will do this reform.</p><p>ANDERSON:  What are you going to do for the man in the street?  Howare going to satisfy them, the man on the street, to support thesereforms?  I know it is not easy.  I mean, it wasn't easy in the U.K.under John Osborn, back in 2010 and after the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>You know, austerity is tough.  How are you going to convince the manon the street that this is worth the pain because it was only eightyears ago that we saw Tunisia and so many other countries around theregion explode?</p><p>[03:45:12] CHAHED:  So, by discussing, by explaining.  Today, thedialogue is free Tunisia.  We have free press or we can explain.  Thepolitical class needs to play strong role explaining those reforms,explaining how important are those reforms.  Also, we need to have akind of safety net for those vulnerable people that can probably --</p><p>ANDERSON:  You have that?</p><p>CHAHED:  Yes.  We are trying -- with IMF, we try to have that toexplain that loose reform can be difficult for certain vulnerablepeople.  So we need to address specifically those people having --giving them social protection, giving them social -- I mean, coveringtheir social needs.  So this is important and this is among ourdiscussion with IMF.</p><p>ANDERSON:  The investors have been wary for some time about investingin Tunisia.  You're optimistic about 2019 in a word?</p><p>CHAHED:  Yes, yes.  I mean, we're trying to create an enablingenvironment.  If you see doing business with simply Tunisia, we owneight spots and we think -- we think we're about -- among the fifthcountries in African and the Arabic world in terms of competitiveness.So, of course, I'm optimist.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Good luck.</p><p>CHAHED:  Thank you.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Thank you, sir, and thanks for joining us.  We are livefrom Davos.  After this short break with a fact check on Donald Trumpand the Russia investigation.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Donald Trump has made more than 8,000 false or misleadingclaims since he became the U.S. president two years ago.  Well, thatis at least according to the \"Washington Post\" fact checker database.He frequently slams and belittles the Russia investigation.</p><p>But CNN's Tom Foreman reports the facts don't support necessarily whatPresident Trump is saying.  Have a listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It is one great hoax.This is a hoax.  Witch-hunt.</p><p>TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Among all the president claims aboutthe Russia probe, none has been so unwavering as the idea that it's apartisan plot to take him down.</p><p>TRUMP:  It's a witch-hunt that is a disgrace.</p><p>FOREMAN:  But the facts say otherwise.  He's assertion of RobertMueller and his team are angry Democrats, not an ounce of proof, eventhough some contributed to Democrats in the past.  Trump's notion thatno one on his team did anything wrong, refuted by charges against andguilty pleas from five of his associates.</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE:  I don't believe Mr. Muellerwould be involved in the witch-hunt.</p><p>FOREMAN:  Even his Attorney General nominee is weighing in.BARR:  I believe the Russians interfered or attempted to interferewith the election and I think we have to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>FOREMAN:  Another claim, Trump had no business with Russia during thecampaign.</p><p>TRUMP:  I have nothing to do with Russia, folks, OK.  I'll give you awritten statement.</p><p>I know nothing about Russian, I know -- I know about Russia, but Iknow nothing about the inner workings of Russia.  I don't deal withthem.</p><p>FOREMAN:  He's former Attorney Michael Cohen, heading to jail andcooperating with the Mueller investigation says contrary to earlierdenials plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow were still in the works deepinto the election.</p><p>RUDY GUILIANI, ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP:  He's telling theprosecutors what they want to hear.</p><p>FOREMAN:  Though Trump's current attorney, Rudy Giuliani, continues totry and muddy the water.</p><p>[03:50:03] GUILIANI:  There's no business there.</p><p>JAKE TAPPER, CNN CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  I don't deal thereis what the president said.</p><p>GUILIANI:  He said I'm not doing business in Russia.</p><p>TAPPER:  He said, I don't deal there.</p><p>GUILIANI:  I don't -- I don't have any -- he doesn't.</p><p>FOREMAN:  Another claimed.  Trump's team was not coordinating withRussians.</p><p>TRUMP:  there has been no collusion.  Absolutely no collusion.</p><p>FOREMAN:  It's now known 16 Trump associates had contact with Russiansduring the campaign or transition, including at that now infamousmeeting in Trump Tower involving Donald Trump Jr. in which he had beenpromised dirt on Hillary Clinton.  Proof of course collusion?  No.Communication?  Absolutely.</p><p>And Trump has repeatedly said, maybe the Russians weren't eveninvolve.  He has raise doubts time and again about the whole idea thatRussia interfered in the election, even standing next to the Russianpresident as he did so.</p><p>TRUMP:  I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I willtell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in hisdenial today.</p><p>FOREMAN:  But of course, all the major U.S. intelligence agencies saythe evidence points squarely and overwhelmingly at Russia.</p><p>These are just half a dozen of examples of what the Washington Postsays or hundreds of times the president misstated, misled, or flat-outlied about the Russian investigation.</p><p>Tom Foreman, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Let's do more in this show, we're here in Davos, I'm withthe Wired editor-in-chief, that's a magazine called Wired, he's notwired himself.  Nicholas Thompson is in the house.  It's cold over theyear.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>In an era of Donald Trump, just for my benefit and the benefit of theviewers, let's just define the difference between misinformation anddisinformation, if you will.</p><p>NICHOLAS THOMPSON, EDITOR IN CHIEF, WIRED:  It's tricky boundary, butI would say, misinformation is information that somebody didn't intendto mislead.  It is put something wrong on the Internet.  And the waysocial networks work, a lot of times that gets rather amplified.</p><p>Disinformation is when somebody goes on and says I'm going to confusethem, I want to disrupt democracy.  I want to put something genuinelywrong and I'm going to do it with malicious intent.</p><p>ANDERSON:  How much disinformation is around these days?</p><p>THOMPSON:  An awful lot because the people have seen that it can bequite effective the way the platform worked, the way our minds work,you can put misleading malevolent information on the Internet and itwill spread and it will mislead people.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So, what is Big Tech doing about that?  Because he seemedtrouble at present, isn't it?</p><p>THOMPSON:  It's -- well, it's a deep trouble in lots of ways atpresent, but there have been extraordinary efforts to try to stop thisand certainly in United States --</p><p>ANDERSON:  Is it a little too late?</p><p>THOMPSON:  Too little too late for 2016.  There is incredibledisinformation.  And of course, we are living in the consequences ofthat.  But if you look the 2018 election, things are on a lot better.We don't know for sure because you never can quite tell what'shappened.  The question now is the capacity for this information hasgone with artificial intelligence, the ability to create images thatlook like anybody or sound like anybody.</p><p>So as we head into 2020, what can we do not have this problem getworse?  And then of course, in elections around the world, what can bedone now to prevent it?  ANDERSON:  A lot of focus here on climate change.  Some say that weare decades behind the curve. Is Big Tech the next crisis that wellare not talk -- I know you said, you know, back in the day in 2016, wewere sideswiped by what was going on, by this disinformation.  You say2018, it looks that we are doing better.  And by 2020, you know, willwe have move to -- let me just give you our views of, you know,something to think about here.</p><p>Amazon will soon know when you need light bulbs right before theyburned out.  YouTube knows how to keep you staring at the screen longpause when in your interest stuff.  An advertiser in the future mightknow your sexual preferences before they are clear to you.</p><p>THOMPSON:  Yes, that's true.  I mean, the amount of data that wegenerate that the companies have and the capacity they have to usethat data and understand us is mind-boggling.  And that's one of thereasons people care so much about privacy right now because when youthink about the data that could be given off.</p><p>But when you think about the future, the world is cracking apart.Democracy is faltering right now.  Technology is for the role in thefraction of democracy and the question is, many of these companieswere designed to promote democracy.  So can they help bring the worldback together then?</p><p>ANDERSON:  We're they?  We're they really, we were told they designedto promote democracy --</p><p>THOMPSON:  Certainly many of the people who work there cared deeplyabout the idea that technology would help promote democracy, wouldmake the world, you know, more open and connected.</p><p>ANDERSON:  But are they connected?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>THOMPSON:  That is a very good question.  I think there are structuraldecisions made at the beginning that set companies in the wrongdirection, but I absolutely believe there is a deep strain of idealismin Silicon Valley, which is why there is a real reckoning right now.</p><p>ANDERSON:  To that point and I know that one of the sessions that youwill be part of here will be a session about human rights andtechnology.</p><p>[03:55:05] THOMPSON:  Yes.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Just what's the can see (ph) of your argument or narrativeabout human rights and whether technology is a good or bad things forour rights going forward?</p><p>THOMPSON:  Technology should be a very good thing.  It should be thingthat, you know, enables people who don't have voices to have voicesthat allows people who have been imprisoned unjustly to organizecampaigns to get out.  But what we've also seen is because ofmisinformation and disinformation that can have the opposite effect.One of the most interesting questions for me, since I'll be discussingit on today is that the structure of the Internet was initiallydesigned to give people anonymity, right?  So that you could reporthuman rights abuses.  But because the structure allows your anonymity,that makes disinformation and misinformation and abuse of dissidentsmuch easier.  So it's a structural decision made when the Internet iscreated that ultimately has kind of the opposite effect.</p><p>And so one of the things that technology is doing now is trying tolook the way the Internet works, the way the platforms were concerned,what did we do wrong that help put us in the world where it now andcan we fix it?  And can we fix it while still making lots of money,which is a separate platform?</p><p>ANDERSON:  So I put this to you then, you're invited on this show thistime next year, beginning of 2020, what will have been achieve for thegood of you and me, and the rest of our viewers by this time nextyear?</p><p>THOMPSON:  My hope, is that the companies that put many more peoplelooking for disinformation and most importantly that they've changethe structure of the algorithms at a deep level so they don't rewarddisinformation and misinformation the way they do it now.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Is it a return on investment if they do that?  Is there anincentive to --</p><p>THOMPSON:  Short-term negative returns on investment.  You lose money,right?  The algorithm are set up to optimize money right now.  Butlook at the reputational damage that has been done, because of thelast couple of years.  So in the long run we would be all better offand they might even make more money.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Nick Thompson in the house, viewers, thank you for that,sir.</p><p>THOMPSON:  See you next year.</p><p>ANDERSON:  You will.

But this year's trade disputes and slowing growth havebeen the major topics here in Davos, the World Economic Forum so far.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So is the rise of populism and what some are calling deglobalizationshaking the world order. Also, breaking with traditions, some majorfigures are missing from the meeting this year.  With Brexit battlesat home, British Prime Minister Theresa May isn't here, and the yellowvests protests keeping the French president busy as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The U.S. government shutdown meant the White House didn't send adelegation, but U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did speak byteleconference and he praised political disruptions, saying he felt itwas a force for good.</p><p>But one of the leaders who did make the trip to Davos was Brazil's newpresident. Jair Bolsonaro delivered the message that his country wasopen for business.</p><p>Well, in the coming hours, we expect to hear from the GermanChancellor Angela Merkel, the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,amongst others.</p><p>But this year, for the first time, the organizers here at the WorldEconomic Forum have named six people under the age of 30 as co-chairsof the meeting. It makes sense. Young people are the people who aregoing to be most impacted by all of the things that are being talkedabout here in Davos, climate change, the rise of A.I. and automation,long running conflicts, for example.</p><p>And when UNICEF, the global body tasked with promoting the rights ofyoungsters asked young people what they want world leaders andbusiness tycoons to focus on, they were clear, we want better jobs,more access to education and more than half believe business leaderscould do more to help young people succeed.</p><p>Well, UNICEF executive director, Henrietta Fore, joining me now. Theyoungsters have spoken.  Our business leaders pay anything more thanlip service to their demands, Henrietta?</p><p>HENRIETTA FORE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, UNICEF:  I think it's starting andhaving this Davos session on young people and on globalization,they're really starting to pick up the idea that young people need abetter education, they need to think about what kinds of jobs andskills they need for the future and that we need to help train themand give them internships and apprenticeships.</p><p>It's their time. They say we're 25 percent of the world but we're 100percent of your future. And they're right.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And when I said they pay more than lip service and you --this isn't your first visit to the Davos meeting. We met here lastyear. I think you were newly installed in the job at that time.</p><p>Are you feeling more or less optimistic about the prospects foryoungsters around the world? I mean, I live in a region where morethan 60 percent of people are under the age of 30, unemployment veryhigh across the Middle East region, and sort of optimism pretty low.</p><p>FORE:  Yes. Well, you know, on the one hand there is a whole group ofcountries that are quite optimistic about their young people and theirimbalance. For many, though, this demographic dividend, this enormouspopulation surge is really overwhelming them. It's overwhelming all oftheir capacities in schools and institutions.</p><p>So, it's mixed. But this is the 30th anniversary of the Convention onthe Rights of the Child. So, we're optimistic at UNICEF that this isthe time when everyone is going to advocate.</p><p>And we've just launched this new initiative, Becky, GenerationUnlimited and that's for young people between the ages of 10 and 24.We want the world to stand up for this age group to try to give them achance a future in life.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Generation Unlimited, mark that one, viewers. Last year,this time, we discussed the plight of children in conflict.  In Syria,for example, four million kids have been born since the start of thecivil war. And that means they have only known war in their entirelives, same with twice (ph) to kids in Yemen or places like SouthSudan or the Rohingya children, for example.</p><p>Apart from appealing for funds and more support, what can anorganization like yours do here at Davos to make a difference?</p><p>FORE:  Well, we hope that we're going to be able to continue thosefunds. We work in humanitarian sessions. So, for instance, educationin Syria and in Yemen, half the schools are closed and these youngpeople need to get back into school.</p><p>[03:05:07] So, if you've been a child in Syria you may have been bornduring the war, you've only known war, it's been going on for eightyears. And so, many of the students have to catch up.  So, they're inone room school houses. We have an accelerated program for children tocatch up.So, businesses here can help by funding, but also giving us onlineeducation so that we can do it in every language with every communityno matter how remote the community. But they can help in education andnutrition, in health, in protection, water and sanitation. Water is anenormous need, clean water, you know that.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So many of the issues that you and I have discussed in thepast conflict, inequality, poverty being discussed here I have to sayalongside issues like climate change, for example, the environment.Just how difficult is it to embed these issues within the minds ofthose -- at a meeting like this who really can make a difference.</p><p>Let's be -- let's be really honest. I mean, you're here once again. Iknow it's important. You need political will from government. You needthat funding support. But this private sector up here, and you justalluded to some of the things that can be done. But you know, are they-- are they paying more than lip service? I'm going to ram thisquestion home until I get you. I'm not suggesting you're not beinghonest. I'm just saying, are they doing more than just paying lipservice?</p><p>FORE:  Well, they could do so much more. This is care about doing theright thing now. They care about the sustainable development goals.They have purpose. They have a mission. But have they really thoughtthrough how their businesses, their new innovations could help thehumanitarian world or all of these young children around the world?They have not yet thoroughly thought about that.</p><p>So, we're trying to catch every business we can, every foundation wecan. We need innovations in our world. We're doing things the sameway. When I was in Syria, we were in the bombed-out area in east Douma-- in Douma in east Ghouta, and when you walk through there, it's notlivable. The apartment buildings are coming down. We had big vats ofwater that are clean water that you can go to get clean water forcooking for your family.</p><p>Our business is thinking about how their supply chains and how theirproducts and services could be used in these situations. We have 300emergencies a year.</p><p>So, to your point, could we use more help? We surely could. We needthe commitment of every CEO here. We do. But we need them to look attheir basic business so that it's sustainable so they want to do ityear after year after year because the world needs a lot of help.</p><p>ANDERSON:  I know you don't come here thinking, well, let's hope weachieve something. You come here with a defined mission. What is thetakeaway that you -- that you will be pleased with Friday afternoonwhen you leave this mountain top in Switzerland? What are you lookingto take away?</p><p>FORE:  So, if they would all commit to stand up for young people,commit to Generation Unlimited, that would be tremendous. We've gothumanitarian appeals coming out. For UNICEF, we are in theneighborhood of $3.8 billion a year, half funded. So, if they can helpus with products and services and funding volunteers, that would begreat.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Henrietta, let's hope they're listening. Thank you.</p><p>FORE:  Thank you, Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Henrietta Fore with us today.</p><p>Well, a lot more from Davos in the day to come. We got a number ofheadlining leaders here. It's a busy day. There are some -- notableabsentees this year. And we've been discussing those, not leastTheresa May, Emmanuel Macron and the U.S. president, but there's anawful lot on the agenda. We'll be across it for you. Stay with us.Back to you for the time being.</p><p>STOUT:  Yes. And Becky, thank you for that very important conversationon empowering children around the world, and as you said, has beenmore than just lip service. It's got to be real.</p><p>Now we're monitoring another confrontation in the works in Washington,D.C. U.S. President Donald Trump, he is moving ahead with plans forhis State of the Union speech, but it's unclear at this moment exactlywhere he will deliver it.</p><p>And the Republicans and the Democrats they will vote on dueling plansto reopen the government. Neither is expected to pass.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Jim Acosta has more.</p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  It's a question theWhite House is struggling to answer exactly where will President Trumpdeliver his State of the Union address in just one week.</p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  There are many wayshe can deliver the State of the Union address. I'm not going to getahead of anything he would announce.</p><p>ACOSTA:  Even though House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on thepresident to delay his address to Congress scheduled for next Tuesday,the White House sent a letter to the House sergeant at arms requestinga planning session as if the speech was still on the calendar,writing, \"Given that we lost valuable time over the past week my teamwould like to reschedule the walk-through for this Monday, if at allpossible.\"</p><p>[03:10:12] The White House has even considered the possibility ofholding a rally outside of Washington if both sides can't reach anagreement. The brinkmanship is escalating as Senate leaders bickerover rival plans to reopen the government and all seem dead onarrival.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, (R) MAJORITY LEADER, KENTUCKY:  The opportunityto end all of this is stating us right in the face. That's why we'llvote on this legislation on the Senate floor this week.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) MINORITY LEADER, NEW YORK:  The Americanpeople know that President Trump is responsible for the shutdown. Andnow they have learned that Leader McConnell is a co-conspirator in theshutdown.</p><p>ACOSTA:  Meanwhile, some of the federal employees actually dealingwith the impact of the shutdown like FBI agents are warning real worldconsequences may be looming.</p><p>TOM O'CONNOR, PRESIDENT, FBI AGENTS ASSOCIATION:  The failure to fundthe FBI undermines essential FBI operations such as those designatedto combat crimes against children, drug and gang crimes and terrorism.</p><p>ACOSTA:  With the shutdown now more than a month long, Secretary ofState Mike Pompeo told the World Economic Forum in Davos that he hopesthe standoff will be over soon, even though there appears to be no endin sight.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When is the shutdown over?</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE:  We all hope that itwill end fairly quickly. I hope that we get this one resolved inrelatively shorter order.</p><p>ACOSTA:  A new book written by a West Wing insider painting a pictureof White House dysfunction even when the government is open. In hisbook \"Team of Vipers\" former White House aide, Cliff Sims, describes asituation that is out of control, including one moment when Mr. Trumplashed out at former House Speaker Paul Ryan for criticizing thepresident's handling of the white supremacist violence inCharlottesville.</p><p>According to the book, the president claimed he had helped the speakerin the past, saying, quote, \"You are out there dying like a dog, Paul.Like a dog.\"</p><p>The book appears to be the kind of leaking the president has blastedin the past like when he tweeted last year, \"leakers are traitors andcowards and we will find out who they are.\"</p><p>One White House official who isn't offering much information thesedays is White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders who hasn't hold abriefing in more than a month. The president says he's behind thatdecision, tweeting, \"The reasons Sarah Sanders does not go to thepodium much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely andinaccurately, in particular, certain members of the press. I told hernot to bother. The word gets out anyway. Most who never us fairlyenhance the term fake news.\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The last we checked there has not been one heldthis year, Hogan. Is there any plan to start that back up again or seeSarah Sanders back at the podium?</p><p>GIDLEY:  She's going to come back when she finds a reason to do thatbecause so often it's so funny. Because the media often tell us thatwhen Sarah Sanders stands right behind me at this podium why can't wehear from the president.</p><p>ACOSTA:  The last time the White House held a press briefing was onDecember 18th, more than a month ago and before the governmentshutdown began. That means that White House Press Secretary SarahSanders has not answered one question from the podium while how thisgovernment shutdown is affecting millions of Americans across thecountry.</p><p>Jim Acosta, CNN, the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STOUT:  Covington Catholic high school will reopen later on Wednesdaywith a police presence around the school. The Kentucky high school hasbeen the focus of controversy after video of students at the March forLife in Washington went viral. Teenagers wearing Make America GreatAgain hats were seen encountering a Native American elder, NathanPhillips.</p><p>The students were widely condemned for mocking Phillips.

A student in the video says he was not disrespectful.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICK SANDMANN, TEEN IN VIDEO:  As far as standing there, I have everyright to do so. In hindsight, I wish we could have walk away.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT:  Now President Trump publicly sided with the students. PressSecretary Sarah Sanders says that the administration has reached outto express support for them, and says if the president invites them tothe White House it will be after the shutdown ends.</p><p>Now Venezuela is getting ready for more demonstrations againstPresident Nicolas Maduro. The protest come hours after U.S. VicePresident Mike Pence stir the pot in a Twitter video promising supportfor the people of Venezuela who are raising their voices for freedom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Nicolas Maduro isa dictator with no legitimate claim to power. He's never won thepresidency in a free and fair election and he's maintained his grip ofpower by imprisoning anyone who dares to oppose him.</p><p>The United States joins with all freedom loving nations in recognizingthe National Assembly as the last vestige of democracy in yourcountry, for it's the only body elected by you, the people.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICOLAS MADURO, PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA (through translator):  Neverbefore has an official for the highest level come out in the name ofhis government. He spoke on behalf of the President of the UnitedStates to say that in Venezuela the opposition must overture thegovernment.</p><p>[03:15:01] That is why I have decided and given the order to thechancellor of the public that we initiate a total absolute revision ofthe relations with the government of the United States of America. Andin the next hours, we will take political diplomatic and defensedecisions of national sovereignty in defense of the constitution, indefense of Venezuelan democracy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT:  Nicolas Maduro there. And we will be monitoring protest actionin Venezuela later today.</p><p>You're watching Newsroom. And up next we'll be going back to Davos forthe World Economic Forum. David Attenborough's message for leadersabout climate change coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Davos it is sub-zero cold and every one here talking globalwarming. So how does that add up? Well, the big thing to know is thatthis climate and there's weather.</p><p>Climate, the average conditions over a really long time, decades,centuries, millennia even. Whereas, weather more of what's going onright now. So, like a hot summer's day doesn't make a hot year. A lotof snow doesn't freeze climate equations.</p><p>Plus, extreme weather like gigantic snowstorms can also be linked to achanging climate. And that explains why the world can still be gettingwarmer as a whole while we still see a lot of freezing events aroundit.</p><p>Well, some leaders heading towards more pro-business approach, andperhaps stepping away from protecting the planet. Brazil's newpresident, Jair Bolsonaro, delivered a message that his country isopen for business. But critics worry he could be a disaster for theenvironment and the Amazon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAIR BOLSONARO, PRESIDENT OF BRAZIL (through translator):  Brazil'seconomy is still relatively close to foreign trades. And to changethat situation is one of my administration's major commitments. Youcan be sure that by the end of my term in office our economic team ledby Minister of Finance, Paulo Guedes, will position Brazil in theranking of the 50 best countries in the world to do business.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[03:19:56] ANDERSON:  Well, my next guest says the Davos elite and I'massuming she's alluding to the presidents there are still pretendingwe have time to fix the climate crisis. We don't, she says, period.</p><p>Greenpeace International executive director, Jennifer Morgan joiningme now. I mean, Jair Bolsonaro heavily criticized by your own agencyfor the potential damage he will do to the Amazon and the environmentwith some of his policies.</p><p>But ultimately, Jennifer, you couldn't be here with a more attentiveaudience this year.</p><p>JENNIFER MORGAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL:  Yes.</p><p>ANDERSON:  I mean, you know, so David Attenborough speaking to justhow important it is that humans begin to think about, you know, whatis going on. It's now or never, right?</p><p>MORGAN:  Absolutely. I mean in the World Economic Forum's own globalrisk report has identified climate changes again year after year. Butagain, climate change, the top risk. We have the world scientist inOctober, saying, if we don't change course immediately --</p><p>ANDERSON:  Yes.</p><p>MORGAN:  -- we will see an increase of temperature and cataclysmic.We're in an emergency situation right now.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And you've said make no mistake, we are in a climateemergency and that's emergency must dominate. This isn't though thefirst time that we've heard these calls here. The voices, though,certainly louder this time. How do we, you, and everybody, how do weconvert words into actions at this point?</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, I think there's a number of different ways. One is justfor people for leaders to -- well, read the IPCC report andinternalize what this actually means, right? The other is for them tolisten to the 15-year-olds.</p><p>You know, yesterday, we actually had Greta Thunberg at the event whereSir David Attenborough was speaking come in and ask leaders here,corporate leaders to pledge, to promise her that they will stay belowor do everything they can stay below 1.5 degrees.</p><p>ANDERSON:  A member of consent in the room?</p><p>MORGAN:  It was a spatter of applause, right, she's coming here.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Yes.</p><p>MORGAN:  Actually, she's on her way from Sweden by train and she said,you know, I don't believe any for one minute you're going to do it,but prove me wrong, right? So -- and then there's a whole other sideof this equation, which is from a business perspective of Davos arethe opportunities that are here actually and you heard that from amajor Indian company.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, let's talk about some of those because return oninvestment is clearly what the guys and the women who are -- whoemployed by businesses to come up this hill and negotiate deals. It'sabout returns on investments, so talk to us about the opportunities ofthe environment.</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, I think there are two sides here. One is theopportunity. So renewable energy costs have gone, you know, they'redramatically lower that it's cheaper to go renewable than fossil fuelright now, even if you don't count in all of the cost.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Only just, but yes.</p><p>MORGAN:  Yes, only just, but if you don't count in all of the healthcosts also of air pollution and coal. So, you see the opportunitiesthat are -- that are there.</p><p>You see also the costs in supply chains, right, of the climate impactswhich often get forgotten. So, I just, you know, in the U.S., forexample, 40 percent of small businesses don't get reopened afterthere's extreme weather event, after there's an extreme hurricane,that type of things. So, you need to be looking at both of thosethings.</p><p>If you look at, for example, mobility right now, right, who is goingto be making the first the big market win on electric vehicles thatneed to be powered by hundred percent renewables.</p><p>So, it's all over the place, but the missing piece for my perspectiveis the political leadership which also needs to come from thecorporates because they may say things here but go back home to theparliament, and who's really pushing a high carbon price? Who'spushing a hundred percent renewables?</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, who is doing well? Let's name and shame. Who is doingwell at present and who needs to do better?</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, I think who's doing well on the renewable side ofthings, you know, actually, China has been doing quite well on therenewables, meeting their targets here and there. India is moving onsolar in a very big way. Costa Rica is going carbon neutral, small butactually very important. You know, if you look at their mobilityconcepts how they are going to be doing electric buses, how theirwhole electricity grid.</p><p>ANDERSON:  True.</p><p>MORGAN:  Those are ones that you can listen to.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So, back in an envelope wish list, if you and I, and I willsay now you're invited onto the show this time next year --</p><p>MORGAN:  I'm ready here.</p><p>ANDERSON:  -- from end 2020. What do you want to be telling me thatwas that you feel was successful in 2019? What are the key missionsthis year and what do you want to achieve?</p><p>MORGAN:  So, number one is a phaseout of coal in Germany by 2030, andthat will be decided this Friday, if not next week, and ChancellorMerkel is here and she should be signaling that. So next year, she cancome and say we're phasing out coal by 2030, we're doing it and adjustway on good just transition.[03:24:57] And Europe will have signaled it's going to increase itsambition under the Paris agreement. That means they're going to raisetheir target, right? And that means that they will have moved towardsa coal phase out. So, we need those coal phases out but Germany isnumber one really right now.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Are you basically treading water on the states until DonaldTrump isn't elected again.</p><p>MORGAN:  Absolutely not.</p><p>ANDERSON:  I'm not suggesting he won't be elected for a moment.</p><p>MORGAN:  Absolutely not. No. There's a green new deal proposal that iscoming forward also from youth actually in the U.S., which is makingits way through the House of Representatives. So, hopefully, that nextyear that will be making its way forward that's going to --</p><p>ANDERSON:  Got it.</p><p>MORGAN:  -- takes the scale into account. So, there are some bigthings. There's a summit in September by the U.N. secretary-general, Iwant to see leaders coming and announcing they're going to do more andthe numbers. I want to see the numbers.</p><p>ANDERSON:  There's some big asks in all of that. Jennifer, thank you.Good luck here.</p><p>MORGAN:  Thank you.</p><p>ANDERSON:  It's Wednesday morning in Davos, day two. Some big talk isnot least, Angela Merkel today. Let's see what she says about some ofthe key issues. It's not just, Kristie, this year about globalizationversus deglobalization, about whether as Pompeo suggested, do wereally want economic growth. Is that mission target going forward?</p><p>This year, much talk, much talk about climate change, about theenvironment, about innovation, about inequality, poverty, comfort, andhave that all fits in this message is that there is no world goingforward if we don't insure that we get on with some of those issuesthat we've been talking about for years. Kristie?</p><p>STOUT:  Absolutely, Becky. And as your guest, Jennifer Morgan, justtold you, all those issues so important, but you got to have thepolitical leadership and the will to deliver it.</p><p>Becky, thank you so much. We'll check in with you soon.</p><p>Now, all eyes on Moscow in just a few hours when Russian and Turkishleaders will meet to discuss what happens next in Syria. VladimirPutin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan are set to focus on Ankara's proposedsecurity zone in northern Syria.</p><p>And even though the Kremlin supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assadwhile Turkey has backed the rebels fighting its forces, Moscow says itcan play fair.Well, let's get straight to Moscow. CNN's Matthew Chance is standingby. Matthew, these two leaders are -- and they have been on oppositesides of the conflict. So, as they hold these talks today, what kindof common ground are they going to reach?</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Ithink, Kristie, it's more of a question of what compromise these twofigures that have a great deal of sort of measure political respectfor each other. In fact, they got quite a good personal relationshipwhich underpins their abilities to compromise.</p><p>What kind of compromise are they going to be able to reach on thisissue? You're rightly point out that one of -- one of Turkey'soverriding strategic objectives in Syria is to establish, you know, asafe haven or to deprive its Turkish rebels domestically of safehavens in that part of northern Syria. It wants to stage a fullincursion into northern Syria to establish sort of security zones Isupposed they would call them.</p><p>The Russians are keen for their ally, the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, to reassert government control over all those areas. And so,you know, it's a diplomatic dance between these two figures to seewhat sort of compromise they can reach.</p><p>The Russians have been very adept I think at drawing Turkey into anacceptance of its position that Bashar al-Assad is going to be stayingas the president of Syria. But in order to achieve that they had to inthe past make certain compromises allowing Turkey to stage limitedinsurgents into various areas in northern Syria. And we may able tosee something similar to that (ph) as a result of these talks.</p><p>STOUT:  Got it. And that shock announcement from Donald Trump that theU.S. is withdrawing in Syria. Is that adding a sense of urgency forthese leaders to reach a compromise?</p><p>CHANCE:  I think it is because it's being seen as a big opportunity bythe Turks to go in full on and really establish a big security zone inthat part of northern -- northern Syria. And so, they're really sortof chomping at the bit to get in there to do that.</p><p>And the Russians are obviously very keen for their ally, Bashar al-Assad, to move his forces into that area as well. And so, some kind ofcompromise is going to have to be worked out. But it's a very riskygame, of course. We're talking about too massive militaries, hugemilitary force on the ground.</p><p>And one of the things that's driving their constant meetings andconstant discussions about compromise is the reluctance of these twocountries to get into a full-on military confrontation with eachother.</p><p>STOUT:  All right. Matthew Chance reporting live from Moscow. Thankyou very much -- very much for joining us.</p><p>You've been watching CNN Newsroom coming to you live from Hong Kong.We'll hit you with the headlines right after this short break.</p><p>[03:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STOUT:  Welcome back, I'm Kristie Lu Stout.  Let's give you an updateon the tops stories this hour.  The U.S. Vice President Mike Pence isencouraging anti-government protesters in Venezuela ahead of a plannedmass demonstration.  He called President Nicolas Maduro a dictatorwith no legitimate claim to power.  Mr. Maduro says he wants a totalrevision of relation with the U.S.</p><p>U.S. President Trump is still planning to deliver his State of theUnion Address from the Capital as scheduled.  That despite HouseSpeaker Nancy Pelosi suggesting he move the speech because of theongoing government shutdown.  Hundreds of thousands of governmentemployees will miss a second paycheck this week.</p><p>Police had resume searching for Cardiff's City new star recruit,Emiliano Sala.  He has been missing since his plane vanished midflightover the English Channel on Monday.  Sala was flying from France toCardiff for his English Premiere League debut.  French authorities saythey still have no news of the missing plane.</p><p>Let's take things over to our Becky Anderson.  She is standing by forus at Davos, side of the World Economic Fund, Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And welcome back to what is a chilly morning here in Davos,this year's World Economic Forum.  We are expecting to hear fromleaders like the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Japan's PrimeMinister Shinzo Abe later on then, we are also expecting to hear from-- not expected to hear -- he is here with me, John Defterios, herewith me right now.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  That will be a problem, I wasn't speaking at this point,right?</p><p>ANDERSON:  Not quite yet actually (ph) yet.  John, Angela Merkel andShinzo Abe, amongst the number of world leaders who will be speakinghere today.  It's a busy day two.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes.  I would recall it a primetime World Economic Forum.This is the core day, needless to say.  Let's start with AngelaMerkel.  She's going to be leaving office soon, right?  She hassomebody coming in to replace her as the party chief.  She doesn'tlike this idea of a U.K. exit from the European Union and she's sosensitive about her legacy.</p><p>Becky, I think she's going to make a push to say, it's not too late tonegotiate.  She said it a week ago, but I think she's going tocomeback in and say for the greater good of the European Union and forthe future of Britain, let's try to work something out, at leastsomething that's not a shock to the system.  She has to worry abouther growth, 1.5 percent in 2018, was the worst in five years.</p><p>Does Shinzo Abe weigh in to the U.S.-China debate, I think, is the bigquestion here.  China is a huge exporter so as Japan and clearlycertain that he'll come out and say, look, this is not good for theglobal economy, even though he is somewhat of an ally, Shinzo Abe, ofDonald Trump.</p><p>[03:35:03] Interesting, I think that we have the Ethiopian primeminister as emerging market side (ph) fascinated by the fact that thegrowing about 10 percent, transition of power after the death of theprevious leader, a huge market in east Africa, one that is verycentral to the plans of the Middle East as well, they invest in to themarket.</p><p>And I think the keynote in terms of news coverage today is the vicepresident of China, Wang Qishan.  He is a powerful player there.  Twoyears ago Xi Jinping was saying let's not retreat from globalization,but try to solve it.  Donald Trump came with a different message lastyear, banging the drums, we may had a stalemate, they are going tohave to find a solution.</p><p>One source I spoke to yesterday was suggesting we can see it in thenext couple of months.  May not be what Donald Trump's looking for,but Donald Trump will say, I fought the good fight and I got what Iwanted for the United States.  It's hurting global markets.  It'shurting the global economy.</p><p>ANDERSON:  It is.  You're absolutely right.  These trade wars havebeen front and center since the appointment of Donald Trump back in2016 and 2017, when he was inaugurated.  We spoke earlier to onecommentator here who said, he thought the year 2018 was a year thathad -- to a certain extent was less affected by the trade wars than hethinks 2019 will be.  But we've already seen this global marketsrallying off the back of these issues, aren't we?</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  We have.  I tell you, as one observer told me thismorning, it's colder in Davos this year, but it is a lot quieterwithout Donald Trump around.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Yes.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  He was blowing the trumpets and saying I'm doing thegreatest things, regulation reform, cutting taxes, the stock marketsrallying.  If he actually came to Davos in 2019, what would be hisnarrative?  I'm fighting the good fight, shut the government down,fighting a good fight.  I'm still fighting with China --</p><p>ANDERSON:  And this markets full recovery, he will say.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes.  No, but he clearly has to find a solution becausethis takes a year to work its way through.  The tariffs are now inplace.  It's hurting U.S. farmers.  He's having to pay to subsidizethe U.S. farmers.  He still has the threat hitting the European Unioncar manufacturers, don't forget, still has that threat with Germany.So he's has threats all around and his impulsiveness is what I thinkreally rattles the Davos community, if you will.</p><p>The CEOs likes the idea of tax reform, who doesn't, if you are aleading company like this.  It is almost like a dividend payment, butthey don't want to see the tension 12 months on.</p><p>ANDERSON:  I know.DEFTERIOS:  Becky, this is a reality.</p><p>ANDERSON:  There is an emerging narrative from the progressiveDemocrats in this space and says none of this is working for the manon the street saying, we're going to do something about it should theywin in 2020.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes.</p><p>ANDERSON:  It's a very different America, I think.  John for thetiming, thank you very much, indeed.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  All right.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Democracy succeeded in Tunisia.  But eight years after theArab Spring, there is frustration and anger.  We are going to hearfrom the head of Tunisia's government after this very short break.Stay with us.</p><p>[03:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, back in 2011, the uprising in Tunisia led to thepresident's ousting and a push for democracy.  It's the Arab Spring'seight anniversary.  Protest in Tunisia's spread to Egypt, Libya, Syriaand Yemen.  But there's now growing anger over Tunisia's economicdecline in as some see it.</p><p>Joining me now is the head of the government of Tunisia, YouseffChahed.  Now, walk down memory lane, sir, if you will.  Nearly adecade since the Jasmine Revolution.  Are you confident there has beenenough fundamental change in the factors that pushed Tunisians on tothe streets because we are seeing and back on the streets at present?</p><p>YOUSEFF CHAHED, HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT OF TUNISIA:  The short answeris yes.  The wrong answer is that, of course.  This is a democracy.You don't have a democracy that is born every year in the world.  So,it takes time and Tunisia is not living alone.</p><p>We're living in a geopolitical situation.  We are also threatened byall what's happened in the world, like those stories, groups, ISIS, AlQaeda.  We're attack three times in 2015, because we are Democratic.</p><p>So answering your question, I am confident, having people in thestreets, demonstrating this is because Tunisia's democracy and they'refree to do that.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And there's be much support over the years of Tunisia and ademocracy, which is very unusual in the Middle East and North Africanregion.  So, many compliments in that way that things have gone, butthe IMF and other institutional -- or international leaders pushingyou to cut government spending and to implement reforms in order tobring in more investment and create jobs.</p><p>Are you going to roll back on any of these IMF plans, these austerityplans?  Because at present there are concerns, and if you don't, itwill be an explosion on the street.CHAHED:  I don't think -- I think of course, we know -- we need tounderstand why we arrive at this point because, as I mentionedyesterday in the session, there is a cost for having a democracy.  Wefight for having freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom ofpress.  So this is the cost.</p><p>During the last few years, the economy was suffered -- was sufferingso -- now when we arrived, the situation was very difficult.Macroeconomics deficit were weak (ph).  We arrived at 2016, there wasseven person deficit -- public deficit.  So, now we reduce it to 4.9in 2018 and we aim to have 3.9 next year.</p><p>Growth was less than 1 percent in 2016.  Now, we are talking about 3percent.  Of course, there's still some difficulties, but this is thelearning curve to have democracy.  You need to pay cost and weconsider that this costs and that we still can manage it.  And westill can -- I mean, most difficulty we can manage that.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So, what you're telling me is that despite the concernsfrom Rached Ghannouchi, for example, who is the leader of the ModernIslamist Party, concerned that there will an explosion in Tunisia.You're saying that you will stick to what the IMF has embedded for youas far as austerity plans consent, no worrying back.</p><p>CHAHED:  We are not doing that because IMF said we have to do that.We're doing that because we're concern and we are responsible for ourcountry.  We are responsible to have -- to stabile deficit.  We areresponsible of having -- to boost growth.  So, we are doing thosereforms not because IMF -- we are member of IMF, and we have a goodcooperation with IMF, but we are not doing that under the pressure ofIMF.  We discussed with IMF.  We explained some local specificities(ph).  We can do that.  We can do that.</p><p>Tunisia is a specific case.  This is a unique case in the region witha democracy in the Arab-Muslim world.  So, I think we are reallyconvinced about doing that, about reducing deficit, about creatingmore jobs, about having the most sustainable model for Tunisia withrenewable energy, with digitization.  So all those reforms, we arereally committed for those reform and we will do this reform.</p><p>ANDERSON:  What are you going to do for the man in the street?  Howare going to satisfy them, the man on the street, to support thesereforms?  I know it is not easy.  I mean, it wasn't easy in the U.K.under John Osborn, back in 2010 and after the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>You know, austerity is tough.  How are you going to convince the manon the street that this is worth the pain because it was only eightyears ago that we saw Tunisia and so many other countries around theregion explode?</p><p>[03:45:12] CHAHED:  So, by discussing, by explaining.  Today, thedialogue is free Tunisia.  We have free press or we can explain.  Thepolitical class needs to play strong role explaining those reforms,explaining how important are those reforms.  Also, we need to have akind of safety net for those vulnerable people that can probably --</p><p>ANDERSON:  You have that?</p><p>CHAHED:  Yes.  We are trying -- with IMF, we try to have that toexplain that loose reform can be difficult for certain vulnerablepeople.  So we need to address specifically those people having --giving them social protection, giving them social -- I mean, coveringtheir social needs.  So this is important and this is among ourdiscussion with IMF.</p><p>ANDERSON:  The investors have been wary for some time about investingin Tunisia.  You're optimistic about 2019 in a word?</p><p>CHAHED:  Yes, yes.  I mean, we're trying to create an enablingenvironment.  If you see doing business with simply Tunisia, we owneight spots and we think -- we think we're about -- among the fifthcountries in African and the Arabic world in terms of competitiveness.So, of course, I'm optimist.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Good luck.</p><p>CHAHED:  Thank you.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Thank you, sir, and thanks for joining us.  We are livefrom Davos.  After this short break with a fact check on Donald Trumpand the Russia investigation.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Donald Trump has made more than 8,000 false or misleadingclaims since he became the U.S. president two years ago.  Well, thatis at least according to the \"Washington Post\" fact checker database.He frequently slams and belittles the Russia investigation.</p><p>But CNN's Tom Foreman reports the facts don't support necessarily whatPresident Trump is saying.  Have a listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It is one great hoax.This is a hoax.  Witch-hunt.</p><p>TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Among all the president claims aboutthe Russia probe, none has been so unwavering as the idea that it's apartisan plot to take him down.</p><p>TRUMP:  It's a witch-hunt that is a disgrace.</p><p>FOREMAN:  But the facts say otherwise.  He's assertion of RobertMueller and his team are angry Democrats, not an ounce of proof, eventhough some contributed to Democrats in the past.  Trump's notion thatno one on his team did anything wrong, refuted by charges against andguilty pleas from five of his associates.</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE:  I don't believe Mr. Muellerwould be involved in the witch-hunt.</p><p>FOREMAN:  Even his Attorney General nominee is weighing in.BARR:  I believe the Russians interfered or attempted to interferewith the election and I think we have to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>FOREMAN:  Another claim, Trump had no business with Russia during thecampaign.</p><p>TRUMP:  I have nothing to do with Russia, folks, OK.  I'll give you awritten statement.</p><p>I know nothing about Russian, I know -- I know about Russia, but Iknow nothing about the inner workings of Russia.  I don't deal withthem.</p><p>FOREMAN:  He's former Attorney Michael Cohen, heading to jail andcooperating with the Mueller investigation says contrary to earlierdenials plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow were still in the works deepinto the election.</p><p>RUDY GUILIANI, ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP:  He's telling theprosecutors what they want to hear.</p><p>FOREMAN:  Though Trump's current attorney, Rudy Giuliani, continues totry and muddy the water.</p><p>[03:50:03] GUILIANI:  There's no business there.</p><p>JAKE TAPPER, CNN CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  I don't deal thereis what the president said.</p><p>GUILIANI:  He said I'm not doing business in Russia.</p><p>TAPPER:  He said, I don't deal there.</p><p>GUILIANI:  I don't -- I don't have any -- he doesn't.</p><p>FOREMAN:  Another claimed.  Trump's team was not coordinating withRussians.</p><p>TRUMP:  there has been no collusion.  Absolutely no collusion.</p><p>FOREMAN:  It's now known 16 Trump associates had contact with Russiansduring the campaign or transition, including at that now infamousmeeting in Trump Tower involving Donald Trump Jr. in which he had beenpromised dirt on Hillary Clinton.  Proof of course collusion?  No.Communication?  Absolutely.</p><p>And Trump has repeatedly said, maybe the Russians weren't eveninvolve.  He has raise doubts time and again about the whole idea thatRussia interfered in the election, even standing next to the Russianpresident as he did so.</p><p>TRUMP:  I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I willtell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in hisdenial today.</p><p>FOREMAN:  But of course, all the major U.S. intelligence agencies saythe evidence points squarely and overwhelmingly at Russia.</p><p>These are just half a dozen of examples of what the Washington Postsays or hundreds of times the president misstated, misled, or flat-outlied about the Russian investigation.</p><p>Tom Foreman, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Let's do more in this show, we're here in Davos, I'm withthe Wired editor-in-chief, that's a magazine called Wired, he's notwired himself.  Nicholas Thompson is in the house.  It's cold over theyear.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>In an era of Donald Trump, just for my benefit and the benefit of theviewers, let's just define the difference between misinformation anddisinformation, if you will.</p><p>NICHOLAS THOMPSON, EDITOR IN CHIEF, WIRED:  It's tricky boundary, butI would say, misinformation is information that somebody didn't intendto mislead.  It is put something wrong on the Internet.  And the waysocial networks work, a lot of times that gets rather amplified.</p><p>Disinformation is when somebody goes on and says I'm going to confusethem, I want to disrupt democracy.  I want to put something genuinelywrong and I'm going to do it with malicious intent.</p><p>ANDERSON:  How much disinformation is around these days?</p><p>THOMPSON:  An awful lot because the people have seen that it can bequite effective the way the platform worked, the way our minds work,you can put misleading malevolent information on the Internet and itwill spread and it will mislead people.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So, what is Big Tech doing about that?  Because he seemedtrouble at present, isn't it?</p><p>THOMPSON:  It's -- well, it's a deep trouble in lots of ways atpresent, but there have been extraordinary efforts to try to stop thisand certainly in United States --</p><p>ANDERSON:  Is it a little too late?</p><p>THOMPSON:  Too little too late for 2016.  There is incredibledisinformation.  And of course, we are living in the consequences ofthat.  But if you look the 2018 election, things are on a lot better.We don't know for sure because you never can quite tell what'shappened.  The question now is the capacity for this information hasgone with artificial intelligence, the ability to create images thatlook like anybody or sound like anybody.</p><p>So as we head into 2020, what can we do not have this problem getworse?  And then of course, in elections around the world, what can bedone now to prevent it?  ANDERSON:  A lot of focus here on climate change.  Some say that weare decades behind the curve. Is Big Tech the next crisis that wellare not talk -- I know you said, you know, back in the day in 2016, wewere sideswiped by what was going on, by this disinformation.  You say2018, it looks that we are doing better.  And by 2020, you know, willwe have move to -- let me just give you our views of, you know,something to think about here.</p><p>Amazon will soon know when you need light bulbs right before theyburned out.  YouTube knows how to keep you staring at the screen longpause when in your interest stuff.  An advertiser in the future mightknow your sexual preferences before they are clear to you.</p><p>THOMPSON:  Yes, that's true.  I mean, the amount of data that wegenerate that the companies have and the capacity they have to usethat data and understand us is mind-boggling.  And that's one of thereasons people care so much about privacy right now because when youthink about the data that could be given off.</p><p>But when you think about the future, the world is cracking apart.Democracy is faltering right now.  Technology is for the role in thefraction of democracy and the question is, many of these companieswere designed to promote democracy.  So can they help bring the worldback together then?</p><p>ANDERSON:  We're they?  We're they really, we were told they designedto promote democracy --</p><p>THOMPSON:  Certainly many of the people who work there cared deeplyabout the idea that technology would help promote democracy, wouldmake the world, you know, more open and connected.</p><p>ANDERSON:  But are they connected?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>THOMPSON:  That is a very good question.  I think there are structuraldecisions made at the beginning that set companies in the wrongdirection, but I absolutely believe there is a deep strain of idealismin Silicon Valley, which is why there is a real reckoning right now.</p><p>ANDERSON:  To that point and I know that one of the sessions that youwill be part of here will be a session about human rights andtechnology.</p><p>[03:55:05] THOMPSON:  Yes.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Just what's the can see (ph) of your argument or narrativeabout human rights and whether technology is a good or bad things forour rights going forward?</p><p>THOMPSON:  Technology should be a very good thing.  It should be thingthat, you know, enables people who don't have voices to have voicesthat allows people who have been imprisoned unjustly to organizecampaigns to get out.  But what we've also seen is because ofmisinformation and disinformation that can have the opposite effect.One of the most interesting questions for me, since I'll be discussingit on today is that the structure of the Internet was initiallydesigned to give people anonymity, right?  So that you could reporthuman rights abuses.  But because the structure allows your anonymity,that makes disinformation and misinformation and abuse of dissidentsmuch easier.  So it's a structural decision made when the Internet iscreated that ultimately has kind of the opposite effect.</p><p>And so one of the things that technology is doing now is trying tolook the way the Internet works, the way the platforms were concerned,what did we do wrong that help put us in the world where it now andcan we fix it?  And can we fix it while still making lots of money,which is a separate platform?</p><p>ANDERSON:  So I put this to you then, you're invited on this show thistime next year, beginning of 2020, what will have been achieve for thegood of you and me, and the rest of our viewers by this time nextyear?</p><p>THOMPSON:  My hope, is that the companies that put many more peoplelooking for disinformation and most importantly that they've changethe structure of the algorithms at a deep level so they don't rewarddisinformation and misinformation the way they do it now.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Is it a return on investment if they do that?  Is there anincentive to --</p><p>THOMPSON:  Short-term negative returns on investment.  You lose money,right?  The algorithm are set up to optimize money right now.  Butlook at the reputational damage that has been done, because of thelast couple of years.  So in the long run we would be all better offand they might even make more money.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Nick Thompson in the house, viewers, thank you for that,sir.</p><p>THOMPSON:  See you next year.</p><p>ANDERSON:  You will.  And you're watching the special edition of CNNNewsroom, I'm Beck Anderson live in Davos in Switzerland for thisyear's World Economic Forum.</p><p>LU STOUT:  Take care Becky, I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong.

But this year's trade disputes and slowing growth have been the major topics here in Davos, the World Economic Forum so far.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So is the rise of populism and what some are calling deglobalization shaking the world order. Also, breaking with traditions, some major figures are missing from the meeting this year. With Brexit battles at home, British Prime Minister Theresa May isn't here, and the yellow vests protests keeping the French president busy as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The U.S. government shutdown meant the White House didn't send a delegation, but U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did speak by teleconference and he praised political disruptions, saying he felt it was a force for good.</p><p>But one of the leaders who did make the trip to Davos was Brazil's new president. Jair Bolsonaro delivered the message that his country was open for business.</p><p>Well, in the coming hours, we expect to hear from the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, amongst others.</p><p>But this year, for the first time, the organizers here at the World Economic Forum have named six people under the age of 30 as co-chairs of the meeting. It makes sense. Young people are the people who are going to be most impacted by all of the things that are being talked about here in Davos, climate change, the rise of A.I. and automation, long running conflicts, for example.</p><p>And when UNICEF, the global body tasked with promoting the rights of youngsters asked young people what they want world leaders and business tycoons to focus on, they were clear, we want better jobs, more access to education and more than half believe business leaders could do more to help young people succeed.</p><p>Well, UNICEF executive director, Henrietta Fore, joining me now. The youngsters have spoken. Our business leaders pay anything more than lip service to their demands, Henrietta?</p><p>HENRIETTA FORE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, UNICEF: I think it's starting and having this Davos session on young people and on globalization, they're really starting to pick up the idea that young people need a better education, they need to think about what kinds of jobs and skills they need for the future and that we need to help train them and give them internships and apprenticeships.</p><p>It's their time. They say we're 25 percent of the world but we're 100 percent of your future. And they're right.</p><p>ANDERSON: And when I said they pay more than lip service and you -- this isn't your first visit to the Davos meeting. We met here last year. I think you were newly installed in the job at that time.</p><p>Are you feeling more or less optimistic about the prospects for youngsters around the world? I mean, I live in a region where more than 60 percent of people are under the age of 30, unemployment very high across the Middle East region, and sort of optimism pretty low.</p><p>FORE: Yes. Well, you know, on the one hand there is a whole group of countries that are quite optimistic about their young people and their imbalance. For many, though, this demographic dividend, this enormous population surge is really overwhelming them. It's overwhelming all of their capacities in schools and institutions.</p><p>So, it's mixed. But this is the 30th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. So, we're optimistic at UNICEF that this is the time when everyone is going to advocate.</p><p>And we've just launched this new initiative, Becky, Generation Unlimited and that's for young people between the ages of 10 and 24. We want the world to stand up for this age group to try to give them a chance a future in life.</p><p>ANDERSON: Generation Unlimited, mark that one, viewers. Last year, this time, we discussed the plight of children in conflict. In Syria, for example, four million kids have been born since the start of the civil war. And that means they have only known war in their entire lives, same with twice (ph) to kids in Yemen or places like South Sudan or the Rohingya children, for example.</p><p>Apart from appealing for funds and more support, what can an organization like yours do here at Davos to make a difference?</p><p>FORE: Well, we hope that we're going to be able to continue those funds. We work in humanitarian sessions. So, for instance, education in Syria and in Yemen, half the schools are closed and these young people need to get back into school.</p><p>[03:05:07] So, if you've been a child in Syria you may have been born during the war, you've only known war, it's been going on for eight years. And so, many of the students have to catch up. So, they're in one room school houses. We have an accelerated program for children to catch up. So, businesses here can help by funding, but also giving us online education so that we can do it in every language with every community no matter how remote the community. But they can help in education and nutrition, in health, in protection, water and sanitation. Water is an enormous need, clean water, you know that.</p><p>ANDERSON: So many of the issues that you and I have discussed in the past conflict, inequality, poverty being discussed here I have to say alongside issues like climate change, for example, the environment. Just how difficult is it to embed these issues within the minds of those -- at a meeting like this who really can make a difference.</p><p>Let's be -- let's be really honest. I mean, you're here once again. I know it's important. You need political will from government. You need that funding support. But this private sector up here, and you just alluded to some of the things that can be done. But you know, are they -- are they paying more than lip service? I'm going to ram this question home until I get you. I'm not suggesting you're not being honest. I'm just saying, are they doing more than just paying lip service?</p><p>FORE: Well, they could do so much more. This is care about doing the right thing now. They care about the sustainable development goals. They have purpose. They have a mission. But have they really thought through how their businesses, their new innovations could help the humanitarian world or all of these young children around the world? They have not yet thoroughly thought about that.</p><p>So, we're trying to catch every business we can, every foundation we can. We need innovations in our world. We're doing things the same way. When I was in Syria, we were in the bombed-out area in east Douma -- in Douma in east Ghouta, and when you walk through there, it's not livable. The apartment buildings are coming down. We had big vats of water that are clean water that you can go to get clean water for cooking for your family.</p><p>Our business is thinking about how their supply chains and how their products and services could be used in these situations. We have 300 emergencies a year.</p><p>So, to your point, could we use more help? We surely could. We need the commitment of every CEO here. We do. But we need them to look at their basic business so that it's sustainable so they want to do it year after year after year because the world needs a lot of help.</p><p>ANDERSON: I know you don't come here thinking, well, let's hope we achieve something. You come here with a defined mission. What is the takeaway that you -- that you will be pleased with Friday afternoon when you leave this mountain top in Switzerland? What are you looking to take away?</p><p>FORE: So, if they would all commit to stand up for young people, commit to Generation Unlimited, that would be tremendous. We've got humanitarian appeals coming out. For UNICEF, we are in the neighborhood of $3.8 billion a year, half funded. So, if they can help us with products and services and funding volunteers, that would be great.</p><p>ANDERSON: Henrietta, let's hope they're listening. Thank you.</p><p>FORE: Thank you, Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON: Henrietta Fore with us today.</p><p>Well, a lot more from Davos in the day to come. We got a number of headlining leaders here. It's a busy day. There are some -- notable absentees this year. And we've been discussing those, not least Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron and the U.S. president, but there's an awful lot on the agenda. We'll be across it for you. Stay with us. Back to you for the time being.</p><p>STOUT: Yes. And Becky, thank you for that very important conversation on empowering children around the world, and as you said, has been more than just lip service. It's got to be real.</p><p>Now we're monitoring another confrontation in the works in Washington, D.C. U.S. President Donald Trump, he is moving ahead with plans for his State of the Union speech, but it's unclear at this moment exactly where he will deliver it.</p><p>And the Republicans and the Democrats they will vote on dueling plans to reopen the government. Neither is expected to pass.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Jim Acosta has more.</p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: It's a question the White House is struggling to answer exactly where will President Trump deliver his State of the Union address in just one week.</p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: There are many ways he can deliver the State of the Union address. I'm not going to get ahead of anything he would announce.</p><p>ACOSTA: Even though House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on the president to delay his address to Congress scheduled for next Tuesday, the White House sent a letter to the House sergeant at arms requesting a planning session as if the speech was still on the calendar, writing, \"Given that we lost valuable time over the past week my team would like to reschedule the walk-through for this Monday, if at all possible.\"</p><p>[03:10:12] The White House has even considered the possibility of holding a rally outside of Washington if both sides can't reach an agreement. The brinkmanship is escalating as Senate leaders bicker over rival plans to reopen the government and all seem dead on arrival.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, (R) MAJORITY LEADER, KENTUCKY: The opportunity to end all of this is stating us right in the face. That's why we'll vote on this legislation on the Senate floor this week. SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) MINORITY LEADER, NEW YORK: The American people know that President Trump is responsible for the shutdown. And now they have learned that Leader McConnell is a co-conspirator in the shutdown.</p><p>ACOSTA: Meanwhile, some of the federal employees actually dealing with the impact of the shutdown like FBI agents are warning real world consequences may be looming.</p><p>TOM O'CONNOR, PRESIDENT, FBI AGENTS ASSOCIATION: The failure to fund the FBI undermines essential FBI operations such as those designated to combat crimes against children, drug and gang crimes and terrorism.</p><p>ACOSTA: With the shutdown now more than a month long, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the World Economic Forum in Davos that he hopes the standoff will be over soon, even though there appears to be no end in sight.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When is the shutdown over?</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: We all hope that it will end fairly quickly. I hope that we get this one resolved in relatively shorter order.</p><p>ACOSTA: A new book written by a West Wing insider painting a picture of White House dysfunction even when the government is open. In his book \"Team of Vipers\" former White House aide, Cliff Sims, describes a situation that is out of control, including one moment when Mr. Trump lashed out at former House Speaker Paul Ryan for criticizing the president's handling of the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville.</p><p>According to the book, the president claimed he had helped the speaker in the past, saying, quote, \"You are out there dying like a dog, Paul. Like a dog.\"</p><p>The book appears to be the kind of leaking the president has blasted in the past like when he tweeted last year, \"leakers are traitors and cowards and we will find out who they are.\"</p><p>One White House official who isn't offering much information these days is White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders who hasn't hold a briefing in more than a month. The president says he's behind that decision, tweeting, \"The reasons Sarah Sanders does not go to the podium much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely and inaccurately, in particular, certain members of the press. I told her not to bother. The word gets out anyway. Most who never us fairly enhance the term fake news.\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The last we checked there has not been one held this year, Hogan. Is there any plan to start that back up again or see Sarah Sanders back at the podium?</p><p>GIDLEY: She's going to come back when she finds a reason to do that because so often it's so funny. Because the media often tell us that when Sarah Sanders stands right behind me at this podium why can't we hear from the president.</p><p>ACOSTA: The last time the White House held a press briefing was on December 18th, more than a month ago and before the government shutdown began. That means that White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders has not answered one question from the podium while how this government shutdown is affecting millions of Americans across the country.</p><p>Jim Acosta, CNN, the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STOUT: Covington Catholic high school will reopen later on Wednesday with a police presence around the school. The Kentucky high school has been the focus of controversy after video of students at the March for Life in Washington went viral. Teenagers wearing Make America Great Again hats were seen encountering a Native American elder, Nathan Phillips.</p><p>The students were widely condemned for mocking Phillips. A video showing different angles raised questions about what actually happened. A student in the video says he was not disrespectful.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICK SANDMANN, TEEN IN VIDEO: As far as standing there, I have every right to do so. In hindsight, I wish we could have walk away.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT: Now President Trump publicly sided with the students. Press Secretary Sarah Sanders says that the administration has reached out to express support for them, and says if the president invites them to the White House it will be after the shutdown ends.</p><p>Now Venezuela is getting ready for more demonstrations against President Nicolas Maduro. The protest come hours after U.S. Vice President Mike Pence stir the pot in a Twitter video promising support for the people of Venezuela who are raising their voices for freedom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Nicolas Maduro is a dictator with no legitimate claim to power. He's never won the presidency in a free and fair election and he's maintained his grip of power by imprisoning anyone who dares to oppose him.</p><p>The United States joins with all freedom loving nations in recognizing the National Assembly as the last vestige of democracy in your country, for it's the only body elected by you, the people.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICOLAS MADURO, PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA (through translator): Never before has an official for the highest level come out in the name of his government. He spoke on behalf of the President of the United States to say that in Venezuela the opposition must overture the government.</p><p>[03:15:01] That is why I have decided and given the order to the chancellor of the public that we initiate a total absolute revision of the relations with the government of the United States of America. And in the next hours, we will take political diplomatic and defense decisions of national sovereignty in defense of the constitution, in defense of Venezuelan democracy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT: Nicolas Maduro there. And we will be monitoring protest action in Venezuela later today.</p><p>You're watching Newsroom. And up next we'll be going back to Davos for the World Economic Forum. David Attenborough's message for leaders about climate change coming up.</p><p>ANDERSON: Davos it is sub-zero cold and every one here talking global warming. So how does that add up? Well, the big thing to know is that this climate and there's weather.</p><p>Climate, the average conditions over a really long time, decades, centuries, millennia even. Whereas, weather more of what's going on right now. So, like a hot summer's day doesn't make a hot year. A lot of snow doesn't freeze climate equations.</p><p>Plus, extreme weather like gigantic snowstorms can also be linked to a changing climate. And that explains why the world can still be getting warmer as a whole while we still see a lot of freezing events around it.</p><p>Well, some leaders heading towards more pro-business approach, and perhaps stepping away from protecting the planet. Brazil's new president, Jair Bolsonaro, delivered a message that his country is open for business. But critics worry he could be a disaster for the environment and the Amazon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAIR BOLSONARO, PRESIDENT OF BRAZIL (through translator): Brazil's economy is still relatively close to foreign trades. And to change that situation is one of my administration's major commitments. You can be sure that by the end of my term in office our economic team led by Minister of Finance, Paulo Guedes, will position Brazil in the ranking of the 50 best countries in the world to do business.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[03:19:56] ANDERSON: Well, my next guest says the Davos elite and I'm assuming she's alluding to the presidents there are still pretending we have time to fix the climate crisis. We don't, she says, period.</p><p>Greenpeace International executive director, Jennifer Morgan joining me now. I mean, Jair Bolsonaro heavily criticized by your own agency for the potential damage he will do to the Amazon and the environment with some of his policies.</p><p>But ultimately, Jennifer, you couldn't be here with a more attentive audience this year.</p><p>JENNIFER MORGAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL: Yes.</p><p>ANDERSON: I mean, you know, so David Attenborough speaking to just how important it is that humans begin to think about, you know, what is going on. It's now or never, right?</p><p>MORGAN: Absolutely. I mean in the World Economic Forum's own global risk report has identified climate changes again year after year. But again, climate change, the top risk. We have the world scientist in October, saying, if we don't change course immediately --</p><p>ANDERSON: Yes.</p><p>MORGAN: -- we will see an increase of temperature and cataclysmic. We're in an emergency situation right now.</p><p>ANDERSON: And you've said make no mistake, we are in a climate emergency and that's emergency must dominate. This isn't though the first time that we've heard these calls here. The voices, though, certainly louder this time. How do we, you, and everybody, how do we convert words into actions at this point?</p><p>MORGAN: Well, I think there's a number of different ways. One is just for people for leaders to -- well, read the IPCC report and internalize what this actually means, right? The other is for them to listen to the 15-year-olds.</p><p>You know, yesterday, we actually had Greta Thunberg at the event where Sir David Attenborough was speaking come in and ask leaders here, corporate leaders to pledge, to promise her that they will stay below or do everything they can stay below 1.5 degrees.</p><p>ANDERSON: A member of consent in the room?</p><p>MORGAN: It was a spatter of applause, right, she's coming here.</p><p>ANDERSON: Yes.</p><p>MORGAN: Actually, she's on her way from Sweden by train and she said, you know, I don't believe any for one minute you're going to do it, but prove me wrong, right? So -- and then there's a whole other side of this equation, which is from a business perspective of Davos are the opportunities that are here actually and you heard that from a major Indian company.</p><p>ANDERSON: Well, let's talk about some of those because return on investment is clearly what the guys and the women who are -- who employed by businesses to come up this hill and negotiate deals. It's about returns on investments, so talk to us about the opportunities of the environment.</p><p>MORGAN: Well, I think there are two sides here. One is the opportunity. So renewable energy costs have gone, you know, they're dramatically lower that it's cheaper to go renewable than fossil fuel right now, even if you don't count in all of the cost.</p><p>ANDERSON: Only just, but yes.</p><p>MORGAN: Yes, only just, but if you don't count in all of the health costs also of air pollution and coal. So, you see the opportunities that are -- that are there.</p><p>You see also the costs in supply chains, right, of the climate impacts which often get forgotten. So, I just, you know, in the U.S., for example, 40 percent of small businesses don't get reopened after there's extreme weather event, after there's an extreme hurricane, that type of things. So, you need to be looking at both of those things.</p><p>If you look at, for example, mobility right now, right, who is going to be making the first the big market win on electric vehicles that need to be powered by hundred percent renewables.</p><p>So, it's all over the place, but the missing piece for my perspective is the political leadership which also needs to come from the corporates because they may say things here but go back home to the parliament, and who's really pushing a high carbon price? Who's pushing a hundred percent renewables?</p><p>ANDERSON: Well, who is doing well? Let's name and shame. Who is doing well at present and who needs to do better?</p><p>MORGAN: Well, I think who's doing well on the renewable side of things, you know, actually, China has been doing quite well on the renewables, meeting their targets here and there. India is moving on solar in a very big way. Costa Rica is going carbon neutral, small but actually very important. You know, if you look at their mobility concepts how they are going to be doing electric buses, how their whole electricity grid.</p><p>ANDERSON: True.</p><p>MORGAN: Those are ones that you can listen to.</p><p>ANDERSON: So, back in an envelope wish list, if you and I, and I will say now you're invited onto the show this time next year --</p><p>MORGAN: I'm ready here.</p><p>ANDERSON: -- from end 2020. What do you want to be telling me that was that you feel was successful in 2019? What are the key missions this year and what do you want to achieve?</p><p>MORGAN: So, number one is a phaseout of coal in Germany by 2030, and that will be decided this Friday, if not next week, and Chancellor Merkel is here and she should be signaling that. So next year, she can come and say we're phasing out coal by 2030, we're doing it and adjust way on good just transition. [03:24:57] And Europe will have signaled it's going to increase its ambition under the Paris agreement. That means they're going to raise their target, right? And that means that they will have moved towards a coal phase out. So, we need those coal phases out but Germany is number one really right now.</p><p>ANDERSON: Are you basically treading water on the states until Donald Trump isn't elected again.</p><p>MORGAN: Absolutely not.</p><p>ANDERSON: I'm not suggesting he won't be elected for a moment.</p><p>MORGAN: Absolutely not. No. There's a green new deal proposal that is coming forward also from youth actually in the U.S., which is making its way through the House of Representatives. So, hopefully, that next year that will be making its way forward that's going to --</p><p>ANDERSON: Got it.</p><p>MORGAN: -- takes the scale into account. So, there are some big things. There's a summit in September by the U.N. secretary-general, I want to see leaders coming and announcing they're going to do more and the numbers. I want to see the numbers.</p><p>ANDERSON: There's some big asks in all of that. Jennifer, thank you. Good luck here.</p><p>MORGAN: Thank you.</p><p>ANDERSON: It's Wednesday morning in Davos, day two. Some big talk is not least, Angela Merkel today. Let's see what she says about some of the key issues. It's not just, Kristie, this year about globalization versus deglobalization, about whether as Pompeo suggested, do we really want economic growth. Is that mission target going forward?</p><p>This year, much talk, much talk about climate change, about the environment, about innovation, about inequality, poverty, comfort, and have that all fits in this message is that there is no world going forward if we don't insure that we get on with some of those issues that we've been talking about for years. Kristie?</p><p>STOUT: Absolutely, Becky. And as your guest, Jennifer Morgan, just told you, all those issues so important, but you got to have the political leadership and the will to deliver it.</p><p>Becky, thank you so much. We'll check in with you soon.</p><p>Now, all eyes on Moscow in just a few hours when Russian and Turkish leaders will meet to discuss what happens next in Syria. Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan are set to focus on Ankara's proposed security zone in northern Syria.</p><p>And even though the Kremlin supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad while Turkey has backed the rebels fighting its forces, Moscow says it can play fair. Well, let's get straight to Moscow. CNN's Matthew Chance is standing by. Matthew, these two leaders are -- and they have been on opposite sides of the conflict. So, as they hold these talks today, what kind of common ground are they going to reach?</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, I think, Kristie, it's more of a question of what compromise these two figures that have a great deal of sort of measure political respect for each other. In fact, they got quite a good personal relationship which underpins their abilities to compromise.</p><p>What kind of compromise are they going to be able to reach on this issue? You're rightly point out that one of -- one of Turkey's overriding strategic objectives in Syria is to establish, you know, a safe haven or to deprive its Turkish rebels domestically of safe havens in that part of northern Syria. It wants to stage a full incursion into northern Syria to establish sort of security zones I supposed they would call them.</p><p>The Russians are keen for their ally, the Syrian President Bashar al- Assad, to reassert government control over all those areas. And so, you know, it's a diplomatic dance between these two figures to see what sort of compromise they can reach.</p><p>The Russians have been very adept I think at drawing Turkey into an acceptance of its position that Bashar al-Assad is going to be staying as the president of Syria. But in order to achieve that they had to in the past make certain compromises allowing Turkey to stage limited insurgents into various areas in northern Syria. And we may able to see something similar to that (ph) as a result of these talks.</p><p>STOUT: Got it. And that shock announcement from Donald Trump that the U.S. is withdrawing in Syria. Is that adding a sense of urgency for these leaders to reach a compromise?</p><p>CHANCE: I think it is because it's being seen as a big opportunity by the Turks to go in full on and really establish a big security zone in that part of northern -- northern Syria. And so, they're really sort of chomping at the bit to get in there to do that.</p><p>And the Russians are obviously very keen for their ally, Bashar al- Assad, to move his forces into that area as well. And so, some kind of compromise is going to have to be worked out. But it's a very risky game, of course. We're talking about too massive militaries, huge military force on the ground.</p><p>And one of the things that's driving their constant meetings and constant discussions about compromise is the reluctance of these two countries to get into a full-on military confrontation with each other.</p><p>STOUT: All right. Matthew Chance reporting live from Moscow. Thank you very much -- very much for joining us.</p><p>You've been watching CNN Newsroom coming to you live from Hong Kong. We'll hit you with the headlines right after this short break.</p><p>[03:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STOUT: Welcome back, I'm Kristie Lu Stout. Let's give you an update on the tops stories this hour. The U.S. Vice President Mike Pence is encouraging anti-government protesters in Venezuela ahead of a planned mass demonstration. He called President Nicolas Maduro a dictator with no legitimate claim to power. Mr. Maduro says he wants a total revision of relation with the U.S.</p><p>U.S. President Trump is still planning to deliver his State of the Union Address from the Capital as scheduled. That despite House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggesting he move the speech because of the ongoing government shutdown. Hundreds of thousands of government employees will miss a second paycheck this week.</p><p>Police had resume searching for Cardiff's City new star recruit, Emiliano Sala. He has been missing since his plane vanished midflight over the English Channel on Monday. Sala was flying from France to Cardiff for his English Premiere League debut. French authorities say they still have no news of the missing plane.</p><p>Let's take things over to our Becky Anderson. She is standing by for us at Davos, side of the World Economic Fund, Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON: And welcome back to what is a chilly morning here in Davos, this year's World Economic Forum. We are expecting to hear from leaders like the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe later on then, we are also expecting to hear from -- not expected to hear -- he is here with me, John Defterios, here with me right now.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: That will be a problem, I wasn't speaking at this point, right?</p><p>ANDERSON: Not quite yet actually (ph) yet. John, Angela Merkel and Shinzo Abe, amongst the number of world leaders who will be speaking here today. It's a busy day two.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Yes. I would recall it a primetime World Economic Forum. This is the core day, needless to say. Let's start with Angela Merkel. She's going to be leaving office soon, right? She has somebody coming in to replace her as the party chief. She doesn't like this idea of a U.K. exit from the European Union and she's so sensitive about her legacy.</p><p>Becky, I think she's going to make a push to say, it's not too late to negotiate. She said it a week ago, but I think she's going to comeback in and say for the greater good of the European Union and for the future of Britain, let's try to work something out, at least something that's not a shock to the system. She has to worry about her growth, 1.5 percent in 2018, was the worst in five years.</p><p>Does Shinzo Abe weigh in to the U.S.-China debate, I think, is the big question here. China is a huge exporter so as Japan and clearly certain that he'll come out and say, look, this is not good for the global economy, even though he is somewhat of an ally, Shinzo Abe, of Donald Trump.</p><p>[03:35:03] Interesting, I think that we have the Ethiopian prime minister as emerging market side (ph) fascinated by the fact that the growing about 10 percent, transition of power after the death of the previous leader, a huge market in east Africa, one that is very central to the plans of the Middle East as well, they invest in to the market.</p><p>And I think the keynote in terms of news coverage today is the vice president of China, Wang Qishan. He is a powerful player there. Two years ago Xi Jinping was saying let's not retreat from globalization, but try to solve it. Donald Trump came with a different message last year, banging the drums, we may had a stalemate, they are going to have to find a solution.</p><p>One source I spoke to yesterday was suggesting we can see it in the next couple of months. May not be what Donald Trump's looking for, but Donald Trump will say, I fought the good fight and I got what I wanted for the United States. It's hurting global markets. It's hurting the global economy.</p><p>ANDERSON: It is. You're absolutely right. These trade wars have been front and center since the appointment of Donald Trump back in 2016 and 2017, when he was inaugurated. We spoke earlier to one commentator here who said, he thought the year 2018 was a year that had -- to a certain extent was less affected by the trade wars than he thinks 2019 will be. But we've already seen this global markets rallying off the back of these issues, aren't we?</p><p>DEFTERIOS: We have. I tell you, as one observer told me this morning, it's colder in Davos this year, but it is a lot quieter without Donald Trump around.</p><p>ANDERSON: Yes.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: He was blowing the trumpets and saying I'm doing the greatest things, regulation reform, cutting taxes, the stock markets rallying. If he actually came to Davos in 2019, what would be his narrative? I'm fighting the good fight, shut the government down, fighting a good fight. I'm still fighting with China --</p><p>ANDERSON: And this markets full recovery, he will say.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Yes. No, but he clearly has to find a solution because this takes a year to work its way through. The tariffs are now in place. It's hurting U.S. farmers. He's having to pay to subsidize the U.S. farmers. He still has the threat hitting the European Union car manufacturers, don't forget, still has that threat with Germany. So he's has threats all around and his impulsiveness is what I think really rattles the Davos community, if you will.</p><p>The CEOs likes the idea of tax reform, who doesn't, if you are a leading company like this. It is almost like a dividend payment, but they don't want to see the tension 12 months on.</p><p>ANDERSON: I know. DEFTERIOS: Becky, this is a reality.</p><p>ANDERSON: There is an emerging narrative from the progressive Democrats in this space and says none of this is working for the man on the street saying, we're going to do something about it should they win in 2020.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Yes.</p><p>ANDERSON: It's a very different America, I think. John for the timing, thank you very much, indeed.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: All right.</p><p>ANDERSON: Democracy succeeded in Tunisia. But eight years after the Arab Spring, there is frustration and anger. We are going to hear from the head of Tunisia's government after this very short break. Stay with us.</p><p>[03:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON: Well, back in 2011, the uprising in Tunisia led to the president's ousting and a push for democracy. It's the Arab Spring's eight anniversary. Protest in Tunisia's spread to Egypt, Libya, Syria and Yemen. But there's now growing anger over Tunisia's economic decline in as some see it.</p><p>Joining me now is the head of the government of Tunisia, Youseff Chahed. Now, walk down memory lane, sir, if you will. Nearly a decade since the Jasmine Revolution. Are you confident there has been enough fundamental change in the factors that pushed Tunisians on to the streets because we are seeing and back on the streets at present?</p><p>YOUSEFF CHAHED, HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT OF TUNISIA: The short answer is yes. The wrong answer is that, of course. This is a democracy. You don't have a democracy that is born every year in the world. So, it takes time and Tunisia is not living alone.</p><p>We're living in a geopolitical situation. We are also threatened by all what's happened in the world, like those stories, groups, ISIS, Al Qaeda. We're attack three times in 2015, because we are Democratic.</p><p>So answering your question, I am confident, having people in the streets, demonstrating this is because Tunisia's democracy and they're free to do that.</p><p>ANDERSON: And there's be much support over the years of Tunisia and a democracy, which is very unusual in the Middle East and North African region. So, many compliments in that way that things have gone, but the IMF and other institutional -- or international leaders pushing you to cut government spending and to implement reforms in order to bring in more investment and create jobs.</p><p>Are you going to roll back on any of these IMF plans, these austerity plans? Because at present there are concerns, and if you don't, it will be an explosion on the street. CHAHED: I don't think -- I think of course, we know -- we need to understand why we arrive at this point because, as I mentioned yesterday in the session, there is a cost for having a democracy. We fight for having freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of press. So this is the cost.</p><p>During the last few years, the economy was suffered -- was suffering so -- now when we arrived, the situation was very difficult. Macroeconomics deficit were weak (ph). We arrived at 2016, there was seven person deficit -- public deficit. So, now we reduce it to 4.9 in 2018 and we aim to have 3.9 next year.</p><p>Growth was less than 1 percent in 2016. Now, we are talking about 3 percent. Of course, there's still some difficulties, but this is the learning curve to have democracy. You need to pay cost and we consider that this costs and that we still can manage it. And we still can -- I mean, most difficulty we can manage that.</p><p>ANDERSON: So, what you're telling me is that despite the concerns from Rached Ghannouchi, for example, who is the leader of the Modern Islamist Party, concerned that there will an explosion in Tunisia. You're saying that you will stick to what the IMF has embedded for you as far as austerity plans consent, no worrying back.</p><p>CHAHED: We are not doing that because IMF said we have to do that. We're doing that because we're concern and we are responsible for our country. We are responsible to have -- to stabile deficit. We are responsible of having -- to boost growth. So, we are doing those reforms not because IMF -- we are member of IMF, and we have a good cooperation with IMF, but we are not doing that under the pressure of IMF. We discussed with IMF. We explained some local specificities (ph). We can do that. We can do that.</p><p>Tunisia is a specific case. This is a unique case in the region with a democracy in the Arab-Muslim world. So, I think we are really convinced about doing that, about reducing deficit, about creating more jobs, about having the most sustainable model for Tunisia with renewable energy, with digitization. So all those reforms, we are really committed for those reform and we will do this reform.</p><p>ANDERSON: What are you going to do for the man in the street? How are going to satisfy them, the man on the street, to support these reforms? I know it is not easy. I mean, it wasn't easy in the U.K. under John Osborn, back in 2010 and after the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>You know, austerity is tough. How are you going to convince the man on the street that this is worth the pain because it was only eight years ago that we saw Tunisia and so many other countries around the region explode?</p><p>[03:45:12] CHAHED: So, by discussing, by explaining. Today, the dialogue is free Tunisia. We have free press or we can explain. The political class needs to play strong role explaining those reforms, explaining how important are those reforms. Also, we need to have a kind of safety net for those vulnerable people that can probably --</p><p>ANDERSON: You have that?</p><p>CHAHED: Yes. We are trying -- with IMF, we try to have that to explain that loose reform can be difficult for certain vulnerable people. So we need to address specifically those people having -- giving them social protection, giving them social -- I mean, covering their social needs. So this is important and this is among our discussion with IMF.</p><p>ANDERSON: The investors have been wary for some time about investing in Tunisia. You're optimistic about 2019 in a word?</p><p>CHAHED: Yes, yes. I mean, we're trying to create an enabling environment. If you see doing business with simply Tunisia, we own eight spots and we think -- we think we're about -- among the fifth countries in African and the Arabic world in terms of competitiveness. So, of course, I'm optimist.</p><p>ANDERSON: Good luck.</p><p>CHAHED: Thank you.</p><p>ANDERSON: Thank you, sir, and thanks for joining us. We are live from Davos. After this short break with a fact check on Donald Trump and the Russia investigation. Stay with us.</p><p>ANDERSON: Donald Trump has made more than 8,000 false or misleading claims since he became the U.S. president two years ago. Well, that is at least according to the \"Washington Post\" fact checker database. He frequently slams and belittles the Russia investigation.</p><p>But CNN's Tom Foreman reports the facts don't support necessarily what President Trump is saying. Have a listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It is one great hoax. This is a hoax. Witch-hunt.</p><p>TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Among all the president claims about the Russia probe, none has been so unwavering as the idea that it's a partisan plot to take him down.</p><p>TRUMP: It's a witch-hunt that is a disgrace.</p><p>FOREMAN: But the facts say otherwise. He's assertion of Robert Mueller and his team are angry Democrats, not an ounce of proof, even though some contributed to Democrats in the past. Trump's notion that no one on his team did anything wrong, refuted by charges against and guilty pleas from five of his associates.</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE: I don't believe Mr. Mueller would be involved in the witch-hunt.</p><p>FOREMAN: Even his Attorney General nominee is weighing in. BARR: I believe the Russians interfered or attempted to interfere with the election and I think we have to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>FOREMAN: Another claim, Trump had no business with Russia during the campaign.</p><p>TRUMP: I have nothing to do with Russia, folks, OK. I'll give you a written statement.</p><p>I know nothing about Russian, I know -- I know about Russia, but I know nothing about the inner workings of Russia. I don't deal with them.</p><p>FOREMAN: He's former Attorney Michael Cohen, heading to jail and cooperating with the Mueller investigation says contrary to earlier denials plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow were still in the works deep into the election.</p><p>RUDY GUILIANI, ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP: He's telling the prosecutors what they want to hear.</p><p>FOREMAN: Though Trump's current attorney, Rudy Giuliani, continues to try and muddy the water.</p><p>[03:50:03] GUILIANI: There's no business there.</p><p>JAKE TAPPER, CNN CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT: I don't deal there is what the president said.</p><p>GUILIANI: He said I'm not doing business in Russia.</p><p>TAPPER: He said, I don't deal there.</p><p>GUILIANI: I don't -- I don't have any -- he doesn't.</p><p>FOREMAN: Another claimed. Trump's team was not coordinating with Russians.</p><p>TRUMP: there has been no collusion. Absolutely no collusion.</p><p>FOREMAN: It's now known 16 Trump associates had contact with Russians during the campaign or transition, including at that now infamous meeting in Trump Tower involving Donald Trump Jr. in which he had been promised dirt on Hillary Clinton. Proof of course collusion? No. Communication? Absolutely.</p><p>And Trump has repeatedly said, maybe the Russians weren't even involve. He has raise doubts time and again about the whole idea that Russia interfered in the election, even standing next to the Russian president as he did so.</p><p>TRUMP: I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I will tell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today.</p><p>FOREMAN: But of course, all the major U.S. intelligence agencies say the evidence points squarely and overwhelmingly at Russia.</p><p>These are just half a dozen of examples of what the Washington Post says or hundreds of times the president misstated, misled, or flat-out lied about the Russian investigation.</p><p>Tom Foreman, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDERSON: Let's do more in this show, we're here in Davos, I'm with the Wired editor-in-chief, that's a magazine called Wired, he's not wired himself. Nicholas Thompson is in the house. It's cold over the year.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>In an era of Donald Trump, just for my benefit and the benefit of the viewers, let's just define the difference between misinformation and disinformation, if you will.</p><p>NICHOLAS THOMPSON, EDITOR IN CHIEF, WIRED: It's tricky boundary, but I would say, misinformation is information that somebody didn't intend to mislead. It is put something wrong on the Internet. And the way social networks work, a lot of times that gets rather amplified.</p><p>Disinformation is when somebody goes on and says I'm going to confuse them, I want to disrupt democracy. I want to put something genuinely wrong and I'm going to do it with malicious intent.</p><p>ANDERSON: How much disinformation is around these days?</p><p>THOMPSON: An awful lot because the people have seen that it can be quite effective the way the platform worked, the way our minds work, you can put misleading malevolent information on the Internet and it will spread and it will mislead people.</p><p>ANDERSON: So, what is Big Tech doing about that? Because he seemed trouble at present, isn't it?</p><p>THOMPSON: It's -- well, it's a deep trouble in lots of ways at present, but there have been extraordinary efforts to try to stop this and certainly in United States --</p><p>ANDERSON: Is it a little too late?</p><p>THOMPSON: Too little too late for 2016. There is incredible disinformation. And of course, we are living in the consequences of that. But if you look the 2018 election, things are on a lot better. We don't know for sure because you never can quite tell what's happened. The question now is the capacity for this information has gone with artificial intelligence, the ability to create images that look like anybody or sound like anybody.</p><p>So as we head into 2020, what can we do not have this problem get worse? And then of course, in elections around the world, what can be done now to prevent it? ANDERSON: A lot of focus here on climate change. Some say that we are decades behind the curve. Is Big Tech the next crisis that well are not talk -- I know you said, you know, back in the day in 2016, we were sideswiped by what was going on, by this disinformation. You say 2018, it looks that we are doing better. And by 2020, you know, will we have move to -- let me just give you our views of, you know, something to think about here.</p><p>Amazon will soon know when you need light bulbs right before they burned out. YouTube knows how to keep you staring at the screen long pause when in your interest stuff. An advertiser in the future might know your sexual preferences before they are clear to you.</p><p>THOMPSON: Yes, that's true. I mean, the amount of data that we generate that the companies have and the capacity they have to use that data and understand us is mind-boggling. And that's one of the reasons people care so much about privacy right now because when you think about the data that could be given off.</p><p>But when you think about the future, the world is cracking apart. Democracy is faltering right now. Technology is for the role in the fraction of democracy and the question is, many of these companies were designed to promote democracy. So can they help bring the world back together then?</p><p>ANDERSON: We're they? We're they really, we were told they designed to promote democracy --</p><p>THOMPSON: Certainly many of the people who work there cared deeply about the idea that technology would help promote democracy, would make the world, you know, more open and connected.</p><p>ANDERSON: But are they connected?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>THOMPSON: That is a very good question. I think there are structural decisions made at the beginning that set companies in the wrong direction, but I absolutely believe there is a deep strain of idealism in Silicon Valley, which is why there is a real reckoning right now.</p><p>ANDERSON: To that point and I know that one of the sessions that you will be part of here will be a session about human rights and technology.</p><p>[03:55:05] THOMPSON: Yes.</p><p>ANDERSON: Just what's the can see (ph) of your argument or narrative about human rights and whether technology is a good or bad things for our rights going forward?</p><p>THOMPSON: Technology should be a very good thing. It should be thing that, you know, enables people who don't have voices to have voices that allows people who have been imprisoned unjustly to organize campaigns to get out. But what we've also seen is because of misinformation and disinformation that can have the opposite effect. One of the most interesting questions for me, since I'll be discussing it on today is that the structure of the Internet was initially designed to give people anonymity, right? So that you could report human rights abuses. But because the structure allows your anonymity, that makes disinformation and misinformation and abuse of dissidents much easier. So it's a structural decision made when the Internet is created that ultimately has kind of the opposite effect.</p><p>And so one of the things that technology is doing now is trying to look the way the Internet works, the way the platforms were concerned, what did we do wrong that help put us in the world where it now and can we fix it? And can we fix it while still making lots of money, which is a separate platform?</p><p>ANDERSON: So I put this to you then, you're invited on this show this time next year, beginning of 2020, what will have been achieve for the good of you and me, and the rest of our viewers by this time next year?</p><p>THOMPSON: My hope, is that the companies that put many more people looking for disinformation and most importantly that they've change the structure of the algorithms at a deep level so they don't reward disinformation and misinformation the way they do it now.</p><p>ANDERSON: Is it a return on investment if they do that? Is there an incentive to --</p><p>THOMPSON: Short-term negative returns on investment. You lose money, right? The algorithm are set up to optimize money right now. But look at the reputational damage that has been done, because of the last couple of years. So in the long run we would be all better off and they might even make more money.</p><p>ANDERSON: Nick Thompson in the house, viewers, thank you for that, sir.</p><p>THOMPSON: See you next year.</p><p>ANDERSON: You will. And you're watching the special edition of CNN Newsroom, I'm Beck Anderson live in Davos in Switzerland for this year's World Economic Forum.</p><p>LU STOUT: Take care Becky, I'm Kristie Lu Stout in Hong Kong. The news continues next with Hannah Vaughan Jones in London. Keep watching CNN.</p><p>LYNDA KINKADE, CNN ANCHOR: U.S. Lawmakers offer dueling plans to end the partial government shutdown.

But this year's trade disputes and slowing growth havebeen the major topics here in Davos, the World Economic Forum so far.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So is the rise of populism and what some are calling deglobalizationshaking the world order. Also, breaking with traditions, some majorfigures are missing from the meeting this year.  With Brexit battlesat home, British Prime Minister Theresa May isn't here, and the yellowvests protests keeping the French president busy as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The U.S. government shutdown meant the White House didn't send adelegation, but U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo did speak byteleconference and he praised political disruptions, saying he felt itwas a force for good.</p><p>But one of the leaders who did make the trip to Davos was Brazil's newpresident. Jair Bolsonaro delivered the message that his country wasopen for business.</p><p>Well, in the coming hours, we expect to hear from the GermanChancellor Angela Merkel, the Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe,amongst others.</p><p>But this year, for the first time, the organizers here at the WorldEconomic Forum have named six people under the age of 30 as co-chairsof the meeting. It makes sense. Young people are the people who aregoing to be most impacted by all of the things that are being talkedabout here in Davos, climate change, the rise of A.I. and automation,long running conflicts, for example.</p><p>And when UNICEF, the global body tasked with promoting the rights ofyoungsters asked young people what they want world leaders andbusiness tycoons to focus on, they were clear, we want better jobs,more access to education and more than half believe business leaderscould do more to help young people succeed.</p><p>Well, UNICEF executive director, Henrietta Fore, joining me now. Theyoungsters have spoken.  Our business leaders pay anything more thanlip service to their demands, Henrietta?</p><p>HENRIETTA FORE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, UNICEF:  I think it's starting andhaving this Davos session on young people and on globalization,they're really starting to pick up the idea that young people need abetter education, they need to think about what kinds of jobs andskills they need for the future and that we need to help train themand give them internships and apprenticeships.</p><p>It's their time. They say we're 25 percent of the world but we're 100percent of your future. And they're right.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And when I said they pay more than lip service and you --this isn't your first visit to the Davos meeting. We met here lastyear. I think you were newly installed in the job at that time.</p><p>Are you feeling more or less optimistic about the prospects foryoungsters around the world? I mean, I live in a region where morethan 60 percent of people are under the age of 30, unemployment veryhigh across the Middle East region, and sort of optimism pretty low.</p><p>FORE:  Yes. Well, you know, on the one hand there is a whole group ofcountries that are quite optimistic about their young people and theirimbalance. For many, though, this demographic dividend, this enormouspopulation surge is really overwhelming them. It's overwhelming all oftheir capacities in schools and institutions.</p><p>So, it's mixed. But this is the 30th anniversary of the Convention onthe Rights of the Child. So, we're optimistic at UNICEF that this isthe time when everyone is going to advocate.</p><p>And we've just launched this new initiative, Becky, GenerationUnlimited and that's for young people between the ages of 10 and 24.We want the world to stand up for this age group to try to give them achance a future in life.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Generation Unlimited, mark that one, viewers. Last year,this time, we discussed the plight of children in conflict.  In Syria,for example, four million kids have been born since the start of thecivil war. And that means they have only known war in their entirelives, same with twice (ph) to kids in Yemen or places like SouthSudan or the Rohingya children, for example.</p><p>Apart from appealing for funds and more support, what can anorganization like yours do here at Davos to make a difference?</p><p>FORE:  Well, we hope that we're going to be able to continue thosefunds. We work in humanitarian sessions. So, for instance, educationin Syria and in Yemen, half the schools are closed and these youngpeople need to get back into school.</p><p>[03:05:07] So, if you've been a child in Syria you may have been bornduring the war, you've only known war, it's been going on for eightyears. And so, many of the students have to catch up.  So, they're inone room school houses. We have an accelerated program for children tocatch up.So, businesses here can help by funding, but also giving us onlineeducation so that we can do it in every language with every communityno matter how remote the community. But they can help in education andnutrition, in health, in protection, water and sanitation. Water is anenormous need, clean water, you know that.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So many of the issues that you and I have discussed in thepast conflict, inequality, poverty being discussed here I have to sayalongside issues like climate change, for example, the environment.Just how difficult is it to embed these issues within the minds ofthose -- at a meeting like this who really can make a difference.</p><p>Let's be -- let's be really honest. I mean, you're here once again. Iknow it's important. You need political will from government. You needthat funding support. But this private sector up here, and you justalluded to some of the things that can be done. But you know, are they-- are they paying more than lip service? I'm going to ram thisquestion home until I get you. I'm not suggesting you're not beinghonest. I'm just saying, are they doing more than just paying lipservice?</p><p>FORE:  Well, they could do so much more. This is care about doing theright thing now. They care about the sustainable development goals.They have purpose. They have a mission. But have they really thoughtthrough how their businesses, their new innovations could help thehumanitarian world or all of these young children around the world?They have not yet thoroughly thought about that.</p><p>So, we're trying to catch every business we can, every foundation wecan. We need innovations in our world. We're doing things the sameway. When I was in Syria, we were in the bombed-out area in east Douma-- in Douma in east Ghouta, and when you walk through there, it's notlivable. The apartment buildings are coming down. We had big vats ofwater that are clean water that you can go to get clean water forcooking for your family.</p><p>Our business is thinking about how their supply chains and how theirproducts and services could be used in these situations. We have 300emergencies a year.</p><p>So, to your point, could we use more help? We surely could. We needthe commitment of every CEO here. We do. But we need them to look attheir basic business so that it's sustainable so they want to do ityear after year after year because the world needs a lot of help.</p><p>ANDERSON:  I know you don't come here thinking, well, let's hope weachieve something. You come here with a defined mission. What is thetakeaway that you -- that you will be pleased with Friday afternoonwhen you leave this mountain top in Switzerland? What are you lookingto take away?</p><p>FORE:  So, if they would all commit to stand up for young people,commit to Generation Unlimited, that would be tremendous. We've gothumanitarian appeals coming out. For UNICEF, we are in theneighborhood of $3.8 billion a year, half funded. So, if they can helpus with products and services and funding volunteers, that would begreat.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Henrietta, let's hope they're listening. Thank you.</p><p>FORE:  Thank you, Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Henrietta Fore with us today.</p><p>Well, a lot more from Davos in the day to come. We got a number ofheadlining leaders here. It's a busy day. There are some -- notableabsentees this year. And we've been discussing those, not leastTheresa May, Emmanuel Macron and the U.S. president, but there's anawful lot on the agenda. We'll be across it for you. Stay with us.Back to you for the time being.</p><p>STOUT:  Yes. And Becky, thank you for that very important conversationon empowering children around the world, and as you said, has beenmore than just lip service. It's got to be real.</p><p>Now we're monitoring another confrontation in the works in Washington,D.C. U.S. President Donald Trump, he is moving ahead with plans forhis State of the Union speech, but it's unclear at this moment exactlywhere he will deliver it.</p><p>And the Republicans and the Democrats they will vote on dueling plansto reopen the government. Neither is expected to pass.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>Jim Acosta has more.</p><p>JIM ACOSTA, CNN SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT:  It's a question theWhite House is struggling to answer exactly where will President Trumpdeliver his State of the Union address in just one week.</p><p>HOGAN GIDLEY, DEPUTY WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY:  There are many wayshe can deliver the State of the Union address. I'm not going to getahead of anything he would announce.</p><p>ACOSTA:  Even though House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called on thepresident to delay his address to Congress scheduled for next Tuesday,the White House sent a letter to the House sergeant at arms requestinga planning session as if the speech was still on the calendar,writing, \"Given that we lost valuable time over the past week my teamwould like to reschedule the walk-through for this Monday, if at allpossible.\"</p><p>[03:10:12] The White House has even considered the possibility ofholding a rally outside of Washington if both sides can't reach anagreement. The brinkmanship is escalating as Senate leaders bickerover rival plans to reopen the government and all seem dead onarrival.</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL, (R) MAJORITY LEADER, KENTUCKY:  The opportunityto end all of this is stating us right in the face. That's why we'llvote on this legislation on the Senate floor this week.SEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, (D) MINORITY LEADER, NEW YORK:  The Americanpeople know that President Trump is responsible for the shutdown. Andnow they have learned that Leader McConnell is a co-conspirator in theshutdown.</p><p>ACOSTA:  Meanwhile, some of the federal employees actually dealingwith the impact of the shutdown like FBI agents are warning real worldconsequences may be looming.</p><p>TOM O'CONNOR, PRESIDENT, FBI AGENTS ASSOCIATION:  The failure to fundthe FBI undermines essential FBI operations such as those designatedto combat crimes against children, drug and gang crimes and terrorism.</p><p>ACOSTA:  With the shutdown now more than a month long, Secretary ofState Mike Pompeo told the World Economic Forum in Davos that he hopesthe standoff will be over soon, even though there appears to be no endin sight.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When is the shutdown over?</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE:  We all hope that itwill end fairly quickly. I hope that we get this one resolved inrelatively shorter order.</p><p>ACOSTA:  A new book written by a West Wing insider painting a pictureof White House dysfunction even when the government is open. In hisbook \"Team of Vipers\" former White House aide, Cliff Sims, describes asituation that is out of control, including one moment when Mr. Trumplashed out at former House Speaker Paul Ryan for criticizing thepresident's handling of the white supremacist violence inCharlottesville.</p><p>According to the book, the president claimed he had helped the speakerin the past, saying, quote, \"You are out there dying like a dog, Paul.Like a dog.\"</p><p>The book appears to be the kind of leaking the president has blastedin the past like when he tweeted last year, \"leakers are traitors andcowards and we will find out who they are.\"</p><p>One White House official who isn't offering much information thesedays is White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders who hasn't hold abriefing in more than a month. The president says he's behind thatdecision, tweeting, \"The reasons Sarah Sanders does not go to thepodium much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely andinaccurately, in particular, certain members of the press. I told hernot to bother. The word gets out anyway. Most who never us fairlyenhance the term fake news.\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  The last we checked there has not been one heldthis year, Hogan. Is there any plan to start that back up again or seeSarah Sanders back at the podium?</p><p>GIDLEY:  She's going to come back when she finds a reason to do thatbecause so often it's so funny. Because the media often tell us thatwhen Sarah Sanders stands right behind me at this podium why can't wehear from the president.</p><p>ACOSTA:  The last time the White House held a press briefing was onDecember 18th, more than a month ago and before the governmentshutdown began. That means that White House Press Secretary SarahSanders has not answered one question from the podium while how thisgovernment shutdown is affecting millions of Americans across thecountry.</p><p>Jim Acosta, CNN, the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STOUT:  Covington Catholic high school will reopen later on Wednesdaywith a police presence around the school. The Kentucky high school hasbeen the focus of controversy after video of students at the March forLife in Washington went viral. Teenagers wearing Make America GreatAgain hats were seen encountering a Native American elder, NathanPhillips.</p><p>The students were widely condemned for mocking Phillips. A videoshowing different angles raised questions about what actuallyhappened. A student in the video says he was not disrespectful.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICK SANDMANN, TEEN IN VIDEO:  As far as standing there, I have everyright to do so. In hindsight, I wish we could have walk away.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT:  Now President Trump publicly sided with the students. PressSecretary Sarah Sanders says that the administration has reached outto express support for them, and says if the president invites them tothe White House it will be after the shutdown ends.</p><p>Now Venezuela is getting ready for more demonstrations againstPresident Nicolas Maduro. The protest come hours after U.S. VicePresident Mike Pence stir the pot in a Twitter video promising supportfor the people of Venezuela who are raising their voices for freedom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Nicolas Maduro isa dictator with no legitimate claim to power. He's never won thepresidency in a free and fair election and he's maintained his grip ofpower by imprisoning anyone who dares to oppose him.</p><p>The United States joins with all freedom loving nations in recognizingthe National Assembly as the last vestige of democracy in yourcountry, for it's the only body elected by you, the people.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NICOLAS MADURO, PRESIDENT OF VENEZUELA (through translator):  Neverbefore has an official for the highest level come out in the name ofhis government. He spoke on behalf of the President of the UnitedStates to say that in Venezuela the opposition must overture thegovernment.</p><p>[03:15:01] That is why I have decided and given the order to thechancellor of the public that we initiate a total absolute revision ofthe relations with the government of the United States of America. Andin the next hours, we will take political diplomatic and defensedecisions of national sovereignty in defense of the constitution, indefense of Venezuelan democracy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STOUT:  Nicolas Maduro there. And we will be monitoring protest actionin Venezuela later today.</p><p>You're watching Newsroom. And up next we'll be going back to Davos forthe World Economic Forum. David Attenborough's message for leadersabout climate change coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Davos it is sub-zero cold and every one here talking globalwarming. So how does that add up? Well, the big thing to know is thatthis climate and there's weather.</p><p>Climate, the average conditions over a really long time, decades,centuries, millennia even. Whereas, weather more of what's going onright now. So, like a hot summer's day doesn't make a hot year. A lotof snow doesn't freeze climate equations.</p><p>Plus, extreme weather like gigantic snowstorms can also be linked to achanging climate. And that explains why the world can still be gettingwarmer as a whole while we still see a lot of freezing events aroundit.</p><p>Well, some leaders heading towards more pro-business approach, andperhaps stepping away from protecting the planet. Brazil's newpresident, Jair Bolsonaro, delivered a message that his country isopen for business. But critics worry he could be a disaster for theenvironment and the Amazon.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JAIR BOLSONARO, PRESIDENT OF BRAZIL (through translator):  Brazil'seconomy is still relatively close to foreign trades. And to changethat situation is one of my administration's major commitments. Youcan be sure that by the end of my term in office our economic team ledby Minister of Finance, Paulo Guedes, will position Brazil in theranking of the 50 best countries in the world to do business.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[03:19:56] ANDERSON:  Well, my next guest says the Davos elite and I'massuming she's alluding to the presidents there are still pretendingwe have time to fix the climate crisis. We don't, she says, period.</p><p>Greenpeace International executive director, Jennifer Morgan joiningme now. I mean, Jair Bolsonaro heavily criticized by your own agencyfor the potential damage he will do to the Amazon and the environmentwith some of his policies.</p><p>But ultimately, Jennifer, you couldn't be here with a more attentiveaudience this year.</p><p>JENNIFER MORGAN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL:  Yes.</p><p>ANDERSON:  I mean, you know, so David Attenborough speaking to justhow important it is that humans begin to think about, you know, whatis going on. It's now or never, right?</p><p>MORGAN:  Absolutely. I mean in the World Economic Forum's own globalrisk report has identified climate changes again year after year. Butagain, climate change, the top risk. We have the world scientist inOctober, saying, if we don't change course immediately --</p><p>ANDERSON:  Yes.</p><p>MORGAN:  -- we will see an increase of temperature and cataclysmic.We're in an emergency situation right now.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And you've said make no mistake, we are in a climateemergency and that's emergency must dominate. This isn't though thefirst time that we've heard these calls here. The voices, though,certainly louder this time. How do we, you, and everybody, how do weconvert words into actions at this point?</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, I think there's a number of different ways. One is justfor people for leaders to -- well, read the IPCC report andinternalize what this actually means, right? The other is for them tolisten to the 15-year-olds.</p><p>You know, yesterday, we actually had Greta Thunberg at the event whereSir David Attenborough was speaking come in and ask leaders here,corporate leaders to pledge, to promise her that they will stay belowor do everything they can stay below 1.5 degrees.</p><p>ANDERSON:  A member of consent in the room?</p><p>MORGAN:  It was a spatter of applause, right, she's coming here.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Yes.</p><p>MORGAN:  Actually, she's on her way from Sweden by train and she said,you know, I don't believe any for one minute you're going to do it,but prove me wrong, right? So -- and then there's a whole other sideof this equation, which is from a business perspective of Davos arethe opportunities that are here actually and you heard that from amajor Indian company.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, let's talk about some of those because return oninvestment is clearly what the guys and the women who are -- whoemployed by businesses to come up this hill and negotiate deals. It'sabout returns on investments, so talk to us about the opportunities ofthe environment.</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, I think there are two sides here. One is theopportunity. So renewable energy costs have gone, you know, they'redramatically lower that it's cheaper to go renewable than fossil fuelright now, even if you don't count in all of the cost.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Only just, but yes.</p><p>MORGAN:  Yes, only just, but if you don't count in all of the healthcosts also of air pollution and coal. So, you see the opportunitiesthat are -- that are there.</p><p>You see also the costs in supply chains, right, of the climate impactswhich often get forgotten. So, I just, you know, in the U.S., forexample, 40 percent of small businesses don't get reopened afterthere's extreme weather event, after there's an extreme hurricane,that type of things. So, you need to be looking at both of thosethings.</p><p>If you look at, for example, mobility right now, right, who is goingto be making the first the big market win on electric vehicles thatneed to be powered by hundred percent renewables.</p><p>So, it's all over the place, but the missing piece for my perspectiveis the political leadership which also needs to come from thecorporates because they may say things here but go back home to theparliament, and who's really pushing a high carbon price? Who'spushing a hundred percent renewables?</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, who is doing well? Let's name and shame. Who is doingwell at present and who needs to do better?</p><p>MORGAN:  Well, I think who's doing well on the renewable side ofthings, you know, actually, China has been doing quite well on therenewables, meeting their targets here and there. India is moving onsolar in a very big way. Costa Rica is going carbon neutral, small butactually very important. You know, if you look at their mobilityconcepts how they are going to be doing electric buses, how theirwhole electricity grid.</p><p>ANDERSON:  True.</p><p>MORGAN:  Those are ones that you can listen to.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So, back in an envelope wish list, if you and I, and I willsay now you're invited onto the show this time next year --</p><p>MORGAN:  I'm ready here.</p><p>ANDERSON:  -- from end 2020. What do you want to be telling me thatwas that you feel was successful in 2019? What are the key missionsthis year and what do you want to achieve?</p><p>MORGAN:  So, number one is a phaseout of coal in Germany by 2030, andthat will be decided this Friday, if not next week, and ChancellorMerkel is here and she should be signaling that. So next year, she cancome and say we're phasing out coal by 2030, we're doing it and adjustway on good just transition.[03:24:57] And Europe will have signaled it's going to increase itsambition under the Paris agreement. That means they're going to raisetheir target, right? And that means that they will have moved towardsa coal phase out. So, we need those coal phases out but Germany isnumber one really right now.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Are you basically treading water on the states until DonaldTrump isn't elected again.</p><p>MORGAN:  Absolutely not.</p><p>ANDERSON:  I'm not suggesting he won't be elected for a moment.</p><p>MORGAN:  Absolutely not. No. There's a green new deal proposal that iscoming forward also from youth actually in the U.S., which is makingits way through the House of Representatives. So, hopefully, that nextyear that will be making its way forward that's going to --</p><p>ANDERSON:  Got it.</p><p>MORGAN:  -- takes the scale into account. So, there are some bigthings. There's a summit in September by the U.N. secretary-general, Iwant to see leaders coming and announcing they're going to do more andthe numbers. I want to see the numbers.</p><p>ANDERSON:  There's some big asks in all of that. Jennifer, thank you.Good luck here.</p><p>MORGAN:  Thank you.</p><p>ANDERSON:  It's Wednesday morning in Davos, day two. Some big talk isnot least, Angela Merkel today. Let's see what she says about some ofthe key issues. It's not just, Kristie, this year about globalizationversus deglobalization, about whether as Pompeo suggested, do wereally want economic growth. Is that mission target going forward?</p><p>This year, much talk, much talk about climate change, about theenvironment, about innovation, about inequality, poverty, comfort, andhave that all fits in this message is that there is no world goingforward if we don't insure that we get on with some of those issuesthat we've been talking about for years. Kristie?</p><p>STOUT:  Absolutely, Becky. And as your guest, Jennifer Morgan, justtold you, all those issues so important, but you got to have thepolitical leadership and the will to deliver it.</p><p>Becky, thank you so much. We'll check in with you soon.</p><p>Now, all eyes on Moscow in just a few hours when Russian and Turkishleaders will meet to discuss what happens next in Syria. VladimirPutin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan are set to focus on Ankara's proposedsecurity zone in northern Syria.</p><p>And even though the Kremlin supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assadwhile Turkey has backed the rebels fighting its forces, Moscow says itcan play fair.Well, let's get straight to Moscow. CNN's Matthew Chance is standingby. Matthew, these two leaders are -- and they have been on oppositesides of the conflict. So, as they hold these talks today, what kindof common ground are they going to reach?</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  Well, Ithink, Kristie, it's more of a question of what compromise these twofigures that have a great deal of sort of measure political respectfor each other. In fact, they got quite a good personal relationshipwhich underpins their abilities to compromise.</p><p>What kind of compromise are they going to be able to reach on thisissue? You're rightly point out that one of -- one of Turkey'soverriding strategic objectives in Syria is to establish, you know, asafe haven or to deprive its Turkish rebels domestically of safehavens in that part of northern Syria. It wants to stage a fullincursion into northern Syria to establish sort of security zones Isupposed they would call them.</p><p>The Russians are keen for their ally, the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, to reassert government control over all those areas. And so,you know, it's a diplomatic dance between these two figures to seewhat sort of compromise they can reach.</p><p>The Russians have been very adept I think at drawing Turkey into anacceptance of its position that Bashar al-Assad is going to be stayingas the president of Syria. But in order to achieve that they had to inthe past make certain compromises allowing Turkey to stage limitedinsurgents into various areas in northern Syria. And we may able tosee something similar to that (ph) as a result of these talks.</p><p>STOUT:  Got it. And that shock announcement from Donald Trump that theU.S. is withdrawing in Syria. Is that adding a sense of urgency forthese leaders to reach a compromise?</p><p>CHANCE:  I think it is because it's being seen as a big opportunity bythe Turks to go in full on and really establish a big security zone inthat part of northern -- northern Syria. And so, they're really sortof chomping at the bit to get in there to do that.</p><p>And the Russians are obviously very keen for their ally, Bashar al-Assad, to move his forces into that area as well. And so, some kind ofcompromise is going to have to be worked out. But it's a very riskygame, of course. We're talking about too massive militaries, hugemilitary force on the ground.</p><p>And one of the things that's driving their constant meetings andconstant discussions about compromise is the reluctance of these twocountries to get into a full-on military confrontation with eachother.</p><p>STOUT:  All right. Matthew Chance reporting live from Moscow. Thankyou very much -- very much for joining us.</p><p>You've been watching CNN Newsroom coming to you live from Hong Kong.We'll hit you with the headlines right after this short break.</p><p>[03:30:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STOUT:  Welcome back, I'm Kristie Lu Stout.  Let's give you an updateon the tops stories this hour.  The U.S. Vice President Mike Pence isencouraging anti-government protesters in Venezuela ahead of a plannedmass demonstration.  He called President Nicolas Maduro a dictatorwith no legitimate claim to power.  Mr. Maduro says he wants a totalrevision of relation with the U.S.</p><p>U.S. President Trump is still planning to deliver his State of theUnion Address from the Capital as scheduled.  That despite HouseSpeaker Nancy Pelosi suggesting he move the speech because of theongoing government shutdown.  Hundreds of thousands of governmentemployees will miss a second paycheck this week.</p><p>Police had resume searching for Cardiff's City new star recruit,Emiliano Sala.  He has been missing since his plane vanished midflightover the English Channel on Monday.  Sala was flying from France toCardiff for his English Premiere League debut.  French authorities saythey still have no news of the missing plane.</p><p>Let's take things over to our Becky Anderson.  She is standing by forus at Davos, side of the World Economic Fund, Becky.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And welcome back to what is a chilly morning here in Davos,this year's World Economic Forum.  We are expecting to hear fromleaders like the German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Japan's PrimeMinister Shinzo Abe later on then, we are also expecting to hear from-- not expected to hear -- he is here with me, John Defterios, herewith me right now.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  That will be a problem, I wasn't speaking at this point,right?</p><p>ANDERSON:  Not quite yet actually (ph) yet.  John, Angela Merkel andShinzo Abe, amongst the number of world leaders who will be speakinghere today.  It's a busy day two.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes.  I would recall it a primetime World Economic Forum.This is the core day, needless to say.  Let's start with AngelaMerkel.  She's going to be leaving office soon, right?  She hassomebody coming in to replace her as the party chief.  She doesn'tlike this idea of a U.K. exit from the European Union and she's sosensitive about her legacy.</p><p>Becky, I think she's going to make a push to say, it's not too late tonegotiate.  She said it a week ago, but I think she's going tocomeback in and say for the greater good of the European Union and forthe future of Britain, let's try to work something out, at leastsomething that's not a shock to the system.  She has to worry abouther growth, 1.5 percent in 2018, was the worst in five years.</p><p>Does Shinzo Abe weigh in to the U.S.-China debate, I think, is the bigquestion here.  China is a huge exporter so as Japan and clearlycertain that he'll come out and say, look, this is not good for theglobal economy, even though he is somewhat of an ally, Shinzo Abe, ofDonald Trump.</p><p>[03:35:03] Interesting, I think that we have the Ethiopian primeminister as emerging market side (ph) fascinated by the fact that thegrowing about 10 percent, transition of power after the death of theprevious leader, a huge market in east Africa, one that is verycentral to the plans of the Middle East as well, they invest in to themarket.</p><p>And I think the keynote in terms of news coverage today is the vicepresident of China, Wang Qishan.  He is a powerful player there.  Twoyears ago Xi Jinping was saying let's not retreat from globalization,but try to solve it.  Donald Trump came with a different message lastyear, banging the drums, we may had a stalemate, they are going tohave to find a solution.</p><p>One source I spoke to yesterday was suggesting we can see it in thenext couple of months.  May not be what Donald Trump's looking for,but Donald Trump will say, I fought the good fight and I got what Iwanted for the United States.  It's hurting global markets.  It'shurting the global economy.</p><p>ANDERSON:  It is.  You're absolutely right.  These trade wars havebeen front and center since the appointment of Donald Trump back in2016 and 2017, when he was inaugurated.  We spoke earlier to onecommentator here who said, he thought the year 2018 was a year thathad -- to a certain extent was less affected by the trade wars than hethinks 2019 will be.  But we've already seen this global marketsrallying off the back of these issues, aren't we?</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  We have.  I tell you, as one observer told me thismorning, it's colder in Davos this year, but it is a lot quieterwithout Donald Trump around.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Yes.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  He was blowing the trumpets and saying I'm doing thegreatest things, regulation reform, cutting taxes, the stock marketsrallying.  If he actually came to Davos in 2019, what would be hisnarrative?  I'm fighting the good fight, shut the government down,fighting a good fight.  I'm still fighting with China --</p><p>ANDERSON:  And this markets full recovery, he will say.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes.  No, but he clearly has to find a solution becausethis takes a year to work its way through.  The tariffs are now inplace.  It's hurting U.S. farmers.  He's having to pay to subsidizethe U.S. farmers.  He still has the threat hitting the European Unioncar manufacturers, don't forget, still has that threat with Germany.So he's has threats all around and his impulsiveness is what I thinkreally rattles the Davos community, if you will.</p><p>The CEOs likes the idea of tax reform, who doesn't, if you are aleading company like this.  It is almost like a dividend payment, butthey don't want to see the tension 12 months on.</p><p>ANDERSON:  I know.DEFTERIOS:  Becky, this is a reality.</p><p>ANDERSON:  There is an emerging narrative from the progressiveDemocrats in this space and says none of this is working for the manon the street saying, we're going to do something about it should theywin in 2020.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  Yes.</p><p>ANDERSON:  It's a very different America, I think.  John for thetiming, thank you very much, indeed.</p><p>DEFTERIOS:  All right.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Democracy succeeded in Tunisia.  But eight years after theArab Spring, there is frustration and anger.  We are going to hearfrom the head of Tunisia's government after this very short break.Stay with us.</p><p>[03:40:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Well, back in 2011, the uprising in Tunisia led to thepresident's ousting and a push for democracy.  It's the Arab Spring'seight anniversary.  Protest in Tunisia's spread to Egypt, Libya, Syriaand Yemen.  But there's now growing anger over Tunisia's economicdecline in as some see it.</p><p>Joining me now is the head of the government of Tunisia, YouseffChahed.  Now, walk down memory lane, sir, if you will.  Nearly adecade since the Jasmine Revolution.  Are you confident there has beenenough fundamental change in the factors that pushed Tunisians on tothe streets because we are seeing and back on the streets at present?</p><p>YOUSEFF CHAHED, HEAD OF THE GOVERNMENT OF TUNISIA:  The short answeris yes.  The wrong answer is that, of course.  This is a democracy.You don't have a democracy that is born every year in the world.  So,it takes time and Tunisia is not living alone.</p><p>We're living in a geopolitical situation.  We are also threatened byall what's happened in the world, like those stories, groups, ISIS, AlQaeda.  We're attack three times in 2015, because we are Democratic.</p><p>So answering your question, I am confident, having people in thestreets, demonstrating this is because Tunisia's democracy and they'refree to do that.</p><p>ANDERSON:  And there's be much support over the years of Tunisia and ademocracy, which is very unusual in the Middle East and North Africanregion.  So, many compliments in that way that things have gone, butthe IMF and other institutional -- or international leaders pushingyou to cut government spending and to implement reforms in order tobring in more investment and create jobs.</p><p>Are you going to roll back on any of these IMF plans, these austerityplans?  Because at present there are concerns, and if you don't, itwill be an explosion on the street.CHAHED:  I don't think -- I think of course, we know -- we need tounderstand why we arrive at this point because, as I mentionedyesterday in the session, there is a cost for having a democracy.  Wefight for having freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom ofpress.  So this is the cost.</p><p>During the last few years, the economy was suffered -- was sufferingso -- now when we arrived, the situation was very difficult.Macroeconomics deficit were weak (ph).  We arrived at 2016, there wasseven person deficit -- public deficit.  So, now we reduce it to 4.9in 2018 and we aim to have 3.9 next year.</p><p>Growth was less than 1 percent in 2016.  Now, we are talking about 3percent.  Of course, there's still some difficulties, but this is thelearning curve to have democracy.  You need to pay cost and weconsider that this costs and that we still can manage it.  And westill can -- I mean, most difficulty we can manage that.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So, what you're telling me is that despite the concernsfrom Rached Ghannouchi, for example, who is the leader of the ModernIslamist Party, concerned that there will an explosion in Tunisia.You're saying that you will stick to what the IMF has embedded for youas far as austerity plans consent, no worrying back.</p><p>CHAHED:  We are not doing that because IMF said we have to do that.We're doing that because we're concern and we are responsible for ourcountry.  We are responsible to have -- to stabile deficit.  We areresponsible of having -- to boost growth.  So, we are doing thosereforms not because IMF -- we are member of IMF, and we have a goodcooperation with IMF, but we are not doing that under the pressure ofIMF.  We discussed with IMF.  We explained some local specificities(ph).  We can do that.  We can do that.</p><p>Tunisia is a specific case.  This is a unique case in the region witha democracy in the Arab-Muslim world.  So, I think we are reallyconvinced about doing that, about reducing deficit, about creatingmore jobs, about having the most sustainable model for Tunisia withrenewable energy, with digitization.  So all those reforms, we arereally committed for those reform and we will do this reform.</p><p>ANDERSON:  What are you going to do for the man in the street?  Howare going to satisfy them, the man on the street, to support thesereforms?  I know it is not easy.  I mean, it wasn't easy in the U.K.under John Osborn, back in 2010 and after the 2008 financial crisis.</p><p>You know, austerity is tough.  How are you going to convince the manon the street that this is worth the pain because it was only eightyears ago that we saw Tunisia and so many other countries around theregion explode?</p><p>[03:45:12] CHAHED:  So, by discussing, by explaining.  Today, thedialogue is free Tunisia.  We have free press or we can explain.  Thepolitical class needs to play strong role explaining those reforms,explaining how important are those reforms.  Also, we need to have akind of safety net for those vulnerable people that can probably --</p><p>ANDERSON:  You have that?</p><p>CHAHED:  Yes.  We are trying -- with IMF, we try to have that toexplain that loose reform can be difficult for certain vulnerablepeople.  So we need to address specifically those people having --giving them social protection, giving them social -- I mean, coveringtheir social needs.  So this is important and this is among ourdiscussion with IMF.</p><p>ANDERSON:  The investors have been wary for some time about investingin Tunisia.  You're optimistic about 2019 in a word?</p><p>CHAHED:  Yes, yes.  I mean, we're trying to create an enablingenvironment.  If you see doing business with simply Tunisia, we owneight spots and we think -- we think we're about -- among the fifthcountries in African and the Arabic world in terms of competitiveness.So, of course, I'm optimist.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Good luck.</p><p>CHAHED:  Thank you.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Thank you, sir, and thanks for joining us.  We are livefrom Davos.  After this short break with a fact check on Donald Trumpand the Russia investigation.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Donald Trump has made more than 8,000 false or misleadingclaims since he became the U.S. president two years ago.  Well, thatis at least according to the \"Washington Post\" fact checker database.He frequently slams and belittles the Russia investigation.</p><p>But CNN's Tom Foreman reports the facts don't support necessarily whatPresident Trump is saying.  Have a listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It is one great hoax.This is a hoax.  Witch-hunt.</p><p>TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT:  Among all the president claims aboutthe Russia probe, none has been so unwavering as the idea that it's apartisan plot to take him down.</p><p>TRUMP:  It's a witch-hunt that is a disgrace.</p><p>FOREMAN:  But the facts say otherwise.  He's assertion of RobertMueller and his team are angry Democrats, not an ounce of proof, eventhough some contributed to Democrats in the past.  Trump's notion thatno one on his team did anything wrong, refuted by charges against andguilty pleas from five of his associates.</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL NOMINEE:  I don't believe Mr. Muellerwould be involved in the witch-hunt.</p><p>FOREMAN:  Even his Attorney General nominee is weighing in.BARR:  I believe the Russians interfered or attempted to interferewith the election and I think we have to get to the bottom of it.</p><p>FOREMAN:  Another claim, Trump had no business with Russia during thecampaign.</p><p>TRUMP:  I have nothing to do with Russia, folks, OK.  I'll give you awritten statement.</p><p>I know nothing about Russian, I know -- I know about Russia, but Iknow nothing about the inner workings of Russia.  I don't deal withthem.</p><p>FOREMAN:  He's former Attorney Michael Cohen, heading to jail andcooperating with the Mueller investigation says contrary to earlierdenials plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow were still in the works deepinto the election.</p><p>RUDY GUILIANI, ATTORNEY FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP:  He's telling theprosecutors what they want to hear.</p><p>FOREMAN:  Though Trump's current attorney, Rudy Giuliani, continues totry and muddy the water.</p><p>[03:50:03] GUILIANI:  There's no business there.</p><p>JAKE TAPPER, CNN CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT:  I don't deal thereis what the president said.</p><p>GUILIANI:  He said I'm not doing business in Russia.</p><p>TAPPER:  He said, I don't deal there.</p><p>GUILIANI:  I don't -- I don't have any -- he doesn't.</p><p>FOREMAN:  Another claimed.  Trump's team was not coordinating withRussians.</p><p>TRUMP:  there has been no collusion.  Absolutely no collusion.</p><p>FOREMAN:  It's now known 16 Trump associates had contact with Russiansduring the campaign or transition, including at that now infamousmeeting in Trump Tower involving Donald Trump Jr. in which he had beenpromised dirt on Hillary Clinton.  Proof of course collusion?  No.Communication?  Absolutely.</p><p>And Trump has repeatedly said, maybe the Russians weren't eveninvolve.  He has raise doubts time and again about the whole idea thatRussia interfered in the election, even standing next to the Russianpresident as he did so.</p><p>TRUMP:  I have great confidence in my intelligence people, but I willtell you that President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in hisdenial today.</p><p>FOREMAN:  But of course, all the major U.S. intelligence agencies saythe evidence points squarely and overwhelmingly at Russia.</p><p>These are just half a dozen of examples of what the Washington Postsays or hundreds of times the president misstated, misled, or flat-outlied about the Russian investigation.</p><p>Tom Foreman, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDERSON:  Let's do more in this show, we're here in Davos, I'm withthe Wired editor-in-chief, that's a magazine called Wired, he's notwired himself.  Nicholas Thompson is in the house.  It's cold over theyear.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>In an era of Donald Trump, just for my benefit and the benefit of theviewers, let's just define the difference between misinformation anddisinformation, if you will.</p><p>NICHOLAS THOMPSON, EDITOR IN CHIEF, WIRED:  It's tricky boundary, butI would say, misinformation is information that somebody didn't intendto mislead.  It is put something wrong on the Internet.  And the waysocial networks work, a lot of times that gets rather amplified.</p><p>Disinformation is when somebody goes on and says I'm going to confusethem, I want to disrupt democracy.  I want to put something genuinelywrong and I'm going to do it with malicious intent.</p><p>ANDERSON:  How much disinformation is around these days?</p><p>THOMPSON:  An awful lot because the people have seen that it can bequite effective the way the platform worked, the way our minds work,you can put misleading malevolent information on the Internet and itwill spread and it will mislead people.</p><p>ANDERSON:  So, what is Big Tech doing about that?  Because he seemedtrouble at present, isn't it?</p><p>THOMPSON:  It's -- well, it's a deep trouble in lots of ways atpresent, but there have been extraordinary efforts to try to stop thisand certainly in United States --</p><p>ANDERSON:  Is it a little too late?</p><p>THOMPSON:  Too little too late for 2016.  There is incredibledisinformation.  And of course, we are living in the consequences ofthat.  But if you look the 2018 election, things are on a lot better.We don't know for sure because you never can quite tell what'shappened.  The question now is the capacity for this information hasgone with artificial intelligence, the ability to create images thatlook like anybody or sound like anybody.</p><p>So as we head into 2020, what can we do not have this problem getworse?  And then of course, in elections around the world, what can bedone now to prevent it?  ANDERSON:  A lot of focus here on climate change.  Some say that weare decades behind the curve. Is Big Tech the next crisis that wellare not talk -- I know you said, you know, back in the day in 2016, wewere sideswiped by what was going on, by this disinformation.  You say2018, it looks that we are doing better.  And by 2020, you know, willwe have move to -- let me just give you our views of, you know,something to think about here.</p><p>Amazon will soon know when you need light bulbs right before theyburned out.  YouTube knows how to keep you staring at the screen longpause when in your interest stuff.  An advertiser in the future mightknow your sexual preferences before they are clear to you.</p><p>THOMPSON:  Yes, that's true.  I mean, the amount of data that wegenerate that the companies have and the capacity they have to usethat data and understand us is mind-boggling.  And that's one of thereasons people care so much about privacy right now because when youthink about the data that could be given off.</p><p>But when you think about the future, the world is cracking apart.Democracy is faltering right now.  Technology is for the role in thefraction of democracy and the question is, many of these companieswere designed to promote democracy.  So can they help bring the worldback together then?</p><p>ANDERSON:  We're they?  We're they really, we were told they designedto promote democracy --</p><p>THOMPSON:  Certainly many of the people who work there cared deeplyabout the idea that technology would help promote democracy, wouldmake the world, you know, more open and connected.</p><p>ANDERSON:  But are they connected?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>THOMPSON:  That is a very good question.  I think there are structuraldecisions made at the beginning that set companies in the wrongdirection, but I absolutely believe there is a deep strain of idealismin Silicon Valley, which is why there is a real reckoning right now.</p><p>ANDERSON:  To that point and I know that one of the sessions that youwill be part of here will be a session about human rights andtechnology.</p><p>[03:55:05] THOMPSON:  Yes.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Just what's the can see (ph) of your argument or narrativeabout human rights and whether technology is a good or bad things forour rights going forward?</p><p>THOMPSON:  Technology should be a very good thing.  It should be thingthat, you know, enables people who don't have voices to have voicesthat allows people who have been imprisoned unjustly to organizecampaigns to get out.  But what we've also seen is because ofmisinformation and disinformation that can have the opposite effect.One of the most interesting questions for me, since I'll be discussingit on today is that the structure of the Internet was initiallydesigned to give people anonymity, right?  So that you could reporthuman rights abuses.  But because the structure allows your anonymity,that makes disinformation and misinformation and abuse of dissidentsmuch easier.  So it's a structural decision made when the Internet iscreated that ultimately has kind of the opposite effect.</p><p>And so one of the things that technology is doing now is trying tolook the way the Internet works, the way the platforms were concerned,what did we do wrong that help put us in the world where it now andcan we fix it?  And can we fix it while still making lots of money,which is a separate platform?</p><p>ANDERSON:  So I put this to you then, you're invited on this show thistime next year, beginning of 2020, what will have been achieve for thegood of you and me, and the rest of our viewers by this time nextyear?</p><p>THOMPSON:  My hope, is that the companies that put many more peoplelooking for disinformation and most importantly that they've changethe structure of the algorithms at a deep level so they don't rewarddisinformation and misinformation the way they do it now.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Is it a return on investment if they do that?  Is there anincentive to --</p><p>THOMPSON:  Short-term negative returns on investment.  You lose money,right?  The algorithm are set up to optimize money right now.  Butlook at the reputational damage that has been done, because of thelast couple of years.  So in the long run we would be all better offand they might even make more money.</p><p>ANDERSON:  Nick Thompson in the house, viewers, thank you for that,sir.</p><p>THOMPSON:  See you next year.</p><p>ANDERSON:  You will.

Continue reading We finally know why the Instagram founders really quit</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last year, in an effort to give shape to The Interface's coverage area, I posted a public list of questions that I hoped to investigate over time. I saved my favorite one for last: why did Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger really leave Instagram?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the months since the co-founders abruptly quit, we've gotten more details about the split. We learned that increasing tension with Facebook, combined with an unusually long post-acquisition tenure at their acquirer, had made them antsy. But we still never knew what specifically led them to resign, or why it was announced in such a hurry.</p><p>Today, with the publication of Nick Thompson and Fred Vogelstein's 12,000-word account of Facebook's past year and a half, I am happy to say that the mystery is now solved. Drawing on interviews with 65 current and former employees, the Wired authors paint a detailed picture of the steps leading to Systrom and Krieger's departure.</p><p>According to their reporting, the timeline goes like this:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Instagram's rapid rise bred resentment at Facebook, where some top executives came to feel that the acquisition was siphoning growth and engagement away from the core Facebook app.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>As Mark Zuckerberg prepared to reorganize his executive team for the first time ever, the Instagram founders pushed for then-News Feed chief Adam Mosseri to be their official delegate from the mothership. They liked him and thought he could be an effective buffer against intrusive Facebook demands.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>After Systrom participated in magazine profiles, Zuckerberg declared that no one else could do so without permission from him or Sheryl Sandberg.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>In an earnings call in July 2018, Zuckerberg took credit for Instagram's success, saying  We believe Insta\u00adgram has been able to use Facebook's infrastructure to grow more than twice as quickly as it would have on its own. </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Zuckerberg then charged his then-head of growth, Javier Olivan, to make a list of all the ways Facebook boosted Instagram's growth. Some of those supports included a tag on Instagram photos shared to Facebook noting where they had originally been posted, and allowing Instagram to use a person's Facebook friends to suggest Instagram follows for them.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Zuckerberg then told Systrom he was taking away all those supports, apparently to protect the health of the Facebook app.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Systrom sent a memo to Instagram employees informing them that Zuckerberg was taking away the growth tools, saying he opposed them but the company had no choice but go along. Facebook was terrified the memo would leak.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Systrom then immediately peaced out for a few months of paternity leave.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>With Systrom on leave, Facebook began testing location tracking and a disgusting hamburger button inside Instagram, offending Systrom's delicate sensibilities.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Systrom began to suspect that Zuckerberg was intent on making him miserable enough that he would quit. (See: hamburger button.)</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Systrom and Krieger decided to quit soon after the former came back from paternity leave. After they informed their team that they intended to leave, the news leaked to the New York Times, blindsiding the communications team and forcing Facebook to rush up a hurried goodbye. (The rush job was one of the main lingering mysteries about the departure.)</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>I find all of this   highly plausible? It's also somewhat tragic: as the Wired story notes, Instagram's design has made it harder for bad actors to misuse it, and it retains an appeal for North American users that the core Facebook app has long since squandered. You can debate how much Facebook contributed to Instagram's success   and surely it contributed a lot   but Systrom and Krieger had unshakeable beliefs about app design that served them very well, and now that they're gone all that is left is for Instagram to become a reskinned version of the Facebook app.</p><p>As for the rest of the Wired piece, it could serve as a nice introduction to Facebook's past year and a half for anyone who hasn't been following along with The Interface. The authors gamely try to weave a thread through Cambridge Analytica, the challenges of content moderation, executive departures, the future of the news industry, Joel Kaplan's malign influence, fights among the communications team, Zuckerberg's comments about the Holocaust, last fall's data breach, the Definers scandal, the Facebook Research app scandal, and the creeping threat of regulation.</p><p>My main takeaway is that an app that has 2.7 billion users is going to have a lot of things happening inside it, and to it, and that it might make a good subject for a daily newsletter.</p><p>In any case, I am glad that a core mystery about Facebook's past year and a half can now officially said to be closed. Facebook surely runs smoother now that recalcitrant product leaders like Systrom and Krieger (and WhatsApp's Jan Koum and Brian Acton) have left the company. Whether it runs better, though, is still an open question.</p><p>Democracy</p><p>Thousands of leaked Facebook documents show Mark Zuckerberg as  master of leverage' in plan to trade user data</p><p>Olivia Solon and Cyrus Farivar report on a leak of more documents produced in discovery for the Pikini lawsuit that we've written about a few times around here. Main takeaway: Facebook considered selling user data more seriously than was previously known. (Facebook is also taking legal action against developer Six4Three, which it believes leaked the documents to reporters. It could result in jail time for the leakers.)</p><p>Still, these freshly leaked documents show that the plans to sell access to user data were discussed for years and received support from Facebook's most senior executives, including Zuckerberg, chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, chief product officer Chris Cox and VP of growth Javier Olivan.</p><p>Trump's 2020 plan: Target seniors on Facebook</p><p>If it ain't broke, don't fix it. (On the other side of the aisle, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez just deactivated her personal account.) Sara Fischer reports:</p><p>The Trump campaign is spending nearly half (44%) of its Facebook ad budget to target users who are over 65 years old, as opposed to Democratic candidates who are only spending 27% of their budget on that demographic, according to data given to Axios exclusively from Bully Pulpit Interactive.</p><p>Russian lawmakers approve plan to take more control over internet traffic</p><p>The Russian internet is rapidly becoming a mirror of China's, Colin Lecher reports:</p><p>Under the proposal, Russian internet traffic would be required to be sent through servers in the country, according to the AP, giving the country more leverage to surveil and censor information. The bill was approved by the State Duma, and it will now head to the upper legislative chamber before going to President Putin's desk for a signature.</p><p>Google blocks Chinese app TikTok in India after court order</p><p>I'm legitimately surprised that this happened to TikTok before larger platforms like YouTube. Does the Indian government want to strangle India in its crib? I'd also note that the ban stems from some rather vague concerns   you'd think the government would tie the ban to a high-profile incident rather than generic worrying.</p><p>Google has blocked access to the hugely popular video app TikTok in India to comply with a state court's directive to prohibit its downloads, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.</p><p>The move comes hours after a court in southern Tamil Nadu state refused a request by China's Bytedance Technology to suspend a ban on its TikTok app, putting its future in one of its key markets in doubt.</p><p>Twitter Left Up Ilhan Omar Death Threats So Law Enforcement Could Investigate</p><p>Alex Kantrowitz reports on an unintended consequence of Twitter's policy around removing tweets containing death threats:</p><p>Twitter would've typically taken down the threatening tweets once they were reported, but the company left them up to enable potential law enforcement collaboration, a source close to the company told BuzzFeed News. The Capitol Hill police are working on the issue, the source said.</p><p>The incident highlights Twitter's flawed approach to dealing with death threats on its platform. Instead of reporting death threats to law enforcement as a policy, Twitter simply deletes them. This means its users can make these threats with little fear of retribution, since the tweets usually disappear before police can review them.  This creates incentives for users of the platform,  a Democratic congressional aide told BuzzFeed News.  There's a reason people on this platform feel comfortable making open death threats to Ilhan Omar. </p><p>How Jack Dorsey plans to change Twitter</p><p>Jack Dorsey sat for an uncomfortable interview at TED on Tuesday. Among other things, he discussed a blog post the company put out today noting some progress in fighting abuse on the platform.</p><p>TED 2019: Jack Dorsey Is Captain of the Twittanic</p><p>Emily Dreyfuss notes a dramatic moment at Dorsey's TED interview:</p><p>In his signature black hoodie and jeans, unkempt facial hair and black beanie, he sat with head of TED Chris Anderson and Whitney Pennington Rodgers, who curates current affairs for the conference, for a conversation that left all three members, and the audience, frustrated.</p><p> We're on this great voyage with you on the Twittanic,  Anderson told Dorsey after roughly 20 minutes of interrupted back and forth.  There are people in steerage who are saying,  We are worried about the iceberg ahead!' And you say,  That is a good point' and  our boat hasn't been built to handle it,' and we're waiting, and you are showing this extraordinary calm and we're all worried but we're outside saying,  Jack, turn the fucking wheel!' </p><p>Calling out Big Tech for subverting Western democracy</p><p>Journalist Carole Cadwalladr appeared at TED this week to discuss social networks with her customary restraint. Ina Fried reports:</p><p>She specifically singled out Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg, Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and Square and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey as  accessories  to  subversion. </p><p>She called on Facebook to reveal more of what happened in Brexit and the 2016 U.S. elections.  It's a crime scene and you have the evidence,  she said.  It's not enough to say you will do better in the future. </p><p>A YouTuber Standing As A UKIP Candidate Invited Supporters To A Gaming Community That Has Chatrooms Filled With White Supremacist And Anti-Semitic Content</p><p>Discord's hate-speech problem doesn't seem to be getting any better, Mark Di Stefano and Alex Wickham report:</p><p>Outside the election channel, but within the  Athens  server that Benjamin directed his supporters to, are other channels of discussion containing violent material.</p><p>In one discussion in a channel called #the-temple-of-veethena-nike from March 2019 about the new copyright law approved by the European Parliament, members talked about killing pro-EU politicians.</p><p>Elsewhere</p><p>Facebook's Portal will now surveil your living room for half the price</p><p>Get  em while they're hot:</p><p>No, you're not misremembering the details from that young adult dystopian fiction you're reading   Facebook really does sell a video chat camera adept at tracking the faces of you and your loved ones. Now, you too can own Facebook's poorly timed foray into social hardware for the low, low price of $99. That's a pretty big price drop considering that the Portal, introduced less than six months ago, debuted at $199.</p><p>Facebook is discontinuing P2P payments in Messenger in the UK and France on June 15</p><p>Sad news for those who enjoyed sending P2P payments in Messenger in the UK and France!</p><p>Logan Paul helps Alex Jones avoid YouTube ban</p><p>YouTube may want to think through whether it wants banned users to appear in videos created by the platform's stars. Julia Alexander reports on Alex Jones' cozying up to Logan Paul:</p><p>This marked the second time in a month that Jones was allowed to appear on a popular YouTube personality's channel, following a four-hour appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast in February. During his latest appearance, Jones discussed dangerous conspiracy theories, including Pizzagate and misinformation about autism. These are examples of conspiracy theories that YouTube has spent time trying to combat.</p><p>Mutiny at HQ Trivia fails to oust CEO</p><p>I wanted to write a lead column about HQ's sad decline, and perhaps I'll still get around to it. But in the meantime read Josh Constine's absolutely wild account of the startup's past five months, which have been more dramatic than any social-media since peak boardroom-drama Twitter.</p><p>By February 2019, HQ's staff was fed up. Two sources confirm that 20 of the roughly 35 employees signed a letter asking the board to remove Yusupov and establish a new CEO. With HQ's download rate continuing to sink, they feared he'd run the startup into the ground. One source suggested Yusupov might rather have seen the whole startup come crashing down with the blame placed on the product than have it come to light that he played a large hand in the fall. The tone of the letter, which was never formally delivered but sources believe the board knew of, wasn't accusatory but a plea for transparency about the company's future and the staff's job security.</p><p>At a hastily convened all-hands meeting in late February, HQ investor Liew told the company his fund Lightspeed would support a search for a new CEO to replace Yusupov, and provide that new CEO with funding for 18 more months of runway. Liew told the staff he would step down from the board once that CEO was found, but the search continues and so Liew remains on HQ's board.</p><p>Inside HQ's attempt to grow its ad business</p><p>Despite HQ's struggles, it still can be valuable to advertisers, Kerry Flynn reports:</p><p>To sell sponsorships, HQ's team touts the game's concurrent viewership. HQ hasn't been able to reach the same heights it had in 2018   the game peaked with 2.4 million concurrent viewers last March during a game with a $250,000 jackpot   but it still attracts hundreds of thousands per game. For example, HQ's  The Twilight Zone  game had about 478,000 viewers at question one, according to a recording of the game. HQ's team compares that to current viewership on Facebook's knockoff trivia games and Twitter's live shows, which have concurrent viewers in the tens of thousands compared to hundreds of thousands on HQ, sources familiar with the discussions told Digiday.</p><p>Launches</p><p>Twitter introduces 40 adorable Avengers emoji, including Korg from Thor: Ragnarok</p><p>Twitter might be slow to addressing any of your personal concerns about the platform and its relationship to democracy, but it's moving fast when it comes to big movie tie-ins. Julia Alexander:</p><p>Marvel Studios partnered with pop artist Truck Torrence to create the Twitter emoji seen in the photo below. The obvious superheroes are there   Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, Thor, and Hawkeye   along with newcomers like the cast of Black Panther, Captain Marvel, and Thanos himself. Most importantly, there are two emoji for Korg and Miek, the best characters from Thor: Ragnarok.</p><p>Takes</p><p>Privacy Is Too Big to Understand</p><p>Charlie Warzel calls for a new definition of privacy in his new newsletter, which you should subscribe to:</p><p>At its heart, privacy is about how that data is used to take away our control. Today, our control is chipped away in ways large and small. It may be as innocuous as using your listed preferences, browsing behavior, third-party information about your annual income and a rough understanding of the hours that you're most susceptible to make a purchase to nudge you toward buying a pair of shoes. Or it may be as potentially life-altering as the inability to get a loan or see a job listing.</p><p>For survivors of abuse, privacy might mean the freedom to live safely without exposing sensitive location information to stalkers. For undocumented immigrants, digital privacy could mean the difference between a parent being able to drop her child off at school or rush a loved one to the hospital without fear of deportation.</p><p>Private Groups Might Be The Last Good Thing About Facebook</p><p>Anne Helen Peterson writes about the positive impact that running a Facebook group has had on her life and work:</p><p>I started the original group in 2009, and have never monetized it. I do it because I really, really like it, and the people who are part of it tell me they really, really like it too. It's a place where I feel like I can ask questions, or for help working through an idea that's not quite there yet. Members come from all over the world, and, according to Facebook's analytics, 81% identify as women. Men periodically post in the comments. But they recognize, in a way I rarely see online, that their opinions are secondary.</p><p>For many of us, these groups are one of the few remaining things tethering us to a platform that's proven itself ineffective at combating toxicity, misinformation, and abuse in nearly every way. They provide community for people from all over the world, doing a bunch of different stuff, with a bunch of different and intersecting identities.</p><p>And finally  </p><p>How Hedgehogs Became Instagram's Most Miserable Celebrities</p><p>Hedgehogs are tiny and have salmonella and you should NOT snuggle with them, Eliza Brooke reports. But that hasn't stopped them from becoming popular on Instagram:</p><p> Hedgehogs and small exotic animals are often impulse purchases, so when [people] see a video of them eating a tiny birthday cake with a hat, you're not actually getting that when you get your pet,  says Schindler.  Social media has encouraged ownership of animals that isn't realistic for what they're going to end up with. </p><p>After hearing that a few people had gotten hedgehogs because of Lionel, Mathias took it upon herself to post about the realities of hedgehog care on her website.  They're real animals and come with a lot of responsibility,  she says.</p><p>Please read this story before you buy a hedgehog!</p><p>Talk to me</p><p>Send me tips, comments, questions, and your favorite moments from Facebook's past 15 months: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:casey@theverge.com\">casey@theverge.com</email></p><p>Tags: <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/tag/373164/\">\u00a0</url>See Website:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/4/17/18411363/why-instagram-founders-quit-hamburger-button-location-tracking\">https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/4/17/18411363/why-instagram-founders-quit-hamburger-button-location-tracking</url><br/>Contact Information:<br/>Casey Newton<br/><br/>Tags:<br/>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/wire/\">Wire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/news-category/artificial-intelligence-newswire/\">Artificial Intelligence Newswire</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/global-regions/united-states/\">United States</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://icrowdnewswire.com/category/language/english/\">English</url><br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ICRWDE-httpicrowdnewswirecom20190419wefinallyknowwhytheinstagramfoundersreallyquit</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ICRWDE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VXM-VGG1-JCTB-F0K1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433665</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3095\"/><timeReceived>12:20 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 iCrowdNewswire, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>iCrowdNewswire (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30185\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 19, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

After long years of decline prior to the pandemic, the sense of inevitable disaster is becoming overwhelming. Pick your place, and the headlines will tell you most of the story: \"Further blow for East Kilbride as Marks &amp; Spencer confirm closure of flagship store,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">reports the Scottish Daily Record</url>, adding that the news came \"just days after Zara announced it would leave ... with Boots stores in the town under threat and a number of restaurants having closed\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The sadness of the stories seems all the greater when you read about the thriving trade based around brown parcels adorned with stylised smiles. Traditional shops may be in free fall, but since the start of 2020 the worth of the Amazon empire is reckoned to have increased by more than half, to an astonishing $1.49 trillion (\u00a31.1tn). Last Thursday, it announced quarterly sales <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">that were up 40%</url> on the same period last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Much of this has been driven by what the pandemic has done to people's buying habits, and a share of the e-commerce market now put at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">44% in the US</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">about 30%</url> in the UK. But also relevant is Amazon's Web Services division, which has cleaned up as companies have shifted more of their activities to the online cloud.</p><p>For Jeff Bezos, who founded the company and owns 11% of it, the upshot is yet another jump beyond the limits of earthly wealth and influence. His is a gigantic, omnivorous kind of capitalism that makes past pioneers look tiny: on 20 July, Amazon's skyrocketing share price meant that in a single day, Bezos's fortune <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">increased by $13bn</url> - more than triple Richard Branson's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">entire net worth</url>.</p><p>Last week, when he made his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">first ever appearance</url> before a committee of the US Congress - alongside Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook, and the Google chief, Sundar Pichai - the impression was of a man secure in his position, occasionally unsettled by questions about his company's power and alleged abuses of it, but calmly confident that the future was still his.</p><p>As shown by its newly announced plans to break into the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">UK grocery delivery market</url>, and the prospect of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">up to 30</url> of its checkout-free Go convenience stores in commuter hotspots, there seems no limit to Amazon's ambitions for retailing. It is ceaselessly expanding, both as a direct vendor and the host of a vast marketplace for other sellers that often looks like a brutally effective means of divining what products are becoming popular and then ensuring the company <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">sells them itself</url> (a practice that Bezos told his congressional interrogators was against company policy, though he \" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">can't guarantee</url> \" it has never happened).</p><p>Meanwhile, as if to suggest a corporation plucked from the pages of a Philip K Dick novel, the same giant firm that supplies millions of us with every consumer item under the sun - and that sits at the heart of many homes via its Echo devices - also delivers <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">computing services to the CIA</url>, Nasa, the US navy, and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency</url>.</p><p>Amazon's sheer scale means that the effects of what it does transcend the fortunes of the company and amount to deep social transformations. For its retail customers, consumerism is no longer a matter of venturing outside the home but the lonely transcendence of ordering and then getting. Most of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">Amazon's workers</url>, meanwhile, are either shut behind windowless walls, doing the minute and monotonous tasks that punctuate the workings of machines, or frantically delivering parcels. Complaints about the company's treatment of its employees are now a constant, but - like those about Amazon's record on tax - they rarely gain real traction. Prior to delivery, the average Amazon package is thought to require just <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">one minute of labour</url> : soon enough, this will surely dwindle even further.</p><p>But if all this denotes historic change, politics has yet to catch up. Thanks partly to the nostalgic mood defined by Brexit, in the UK too many people in charge still fixate on somehow reviving traditional shops. The government's latest proposal is an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">online sales tax</url>, which would make up for cuts to business rates, thereby supposedly allowing retail businesses to survive.</p><p>In some places, such measures might have beneficial effects. The problem is that fixating on the traditional high street serves as a distraction from thinking about the workings of online business and Amazon specifically: how to challenge its vast power, monitor and regulate what happens to its workers, and manage the impact of the technology.</p><p>Some of the most incisive answers have recently come from a former Amazon insider. In May, the Amazon tech engineer and vice-president Tim Bray <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">left its</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">Web</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">Services division</url>. Incensed by the fact that colleagues who had protested about the treatment of warehouse workers during the pandemic had been dismissed, he began writing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">punchy blogposts</url> focused on what ought to be done about big tech's power.</p><p>\"Amazon is exceptionally well-managed and has demonstrated great skill at spotting opportunities and building repeatable processes for exploiting them,\" he said. \"It has a corresponding lack of vision about the human costs of the relentless growth and accumulation of wealth and power. If we don't like certain things Amazon is doing, we need to put legal guardrails in place to stop those things ... a combination of antitrust and living-wage and worker-empowerment legislation, rigorously enforced, offers a clear path forward.\"</p><p>Bray thinks Amazon needs to be broken up. He also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">makes the case for unionising</url> its workers, and finally forcing the firm to collectively bargain with them. He doesn't talk so much about the even bigger question of the effects of technology on many of the people currently working for the online retail giants. Even before the pandemic, one forecast suggested that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">80% of jobs</url> in \"retail transportation, warehousing and logistics\" were newly susceptible to automation; others have said that nearly 500,000 UK retail jobs could be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">lost to robots by 2024</url>. In a world in which the workplace has become a byword for infection, those trends will presumably accelerate.</p><p>In the US and at the heart of the European Union, some of this is at least being discussed. Yet leaving the EU is likely to boost efforts to turn the UK into a light-touch regulatory paradise for capitalists and to encourage our national tendency to see large corporations as an uncontrollable force of nature.</p><p>\"The only real constant in retail is customers' desire for lower prices, better selection, and convenience,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/further-blow-east-kilbride-marks-22366079\">Bezos told his questioners</url> on Capitol Hill. Herein lies what is propelling us into the future, from Seattle to post-industrial Scotland: supply meeting demand. Meanwhile, politicians fail to address profound questions about corporate power, work and wealth, and a world changing beyond recognition.</p><p> John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-64907649</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GY-FRY1-JCJY-G33F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1143\"/><timeReceived>3:31 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

El avance de\u00a0blockchain Los avances en los \u00faltimos meses de la\u00a0blockchain\u00a0\u2014una lista inmutable de registros de transacciones que est\u00e1 replicada en m\u00faltiples entidades\u2014la hacen una de las tendencias a seguir en el a\u00f1o que comienza. Originalmente se hab\u00eda adaptado como base del Bitcoin y se us\u00f3 en otras criptomonedas, pero su uso podr\u00eda escribir la historia tecnol\u00f3gica de la pr\u00f3xima d\u00e9cada. Entre los hitos recientes se encuentran:\u00a0el inter\u00e9s generado por las criptomonedas[1]\u00a0y las\u00a0ICOs, la explosi\u00f3n del ecosistema\u00a0Ethereum, el debut de Jap\u00f3n como primera gran econom\u00eda en aceptar al Bitcoin como un instrumento oficial de pagos,\u00a0la emisi\u00f3n de los primeros futuros del Bitcoin[2]\u00a0por parte de la\u00a0Chicago Mercantile Exchange, el estudio por parte de una veintena de pa\u00edses para emitir sus propias criptomonedas, la preparaci\u00f3n de grandes bancos y corporaciones para la masificaci\u00f3n de aplicaciones basadas en la\u00a0blockchain\u00a0y el avance para el respaldo monetario de criptomonedas m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de la tecnolog\u00eda. Se espera que en 2018 se desarrollen aplicaciones basadas en la\u00a0blockchain\u00a0para los siguientes 10 rubros: 1. Servicios Bancarios - Pagos y servicios mercantiles, intercambio de divisas y transacciones internacionales, incluyendo remesas. </p><p>2. Servicios Financieros - Plataformas para pr\u00e9stamos, monederos digitales, pagos\u00a0peer-to-peer, gesti\u00f3n de activos, seguros de todo tipo 3. Levantamiento de Capital - Plataformas para Crowdfunding y emisi\u00f3n de\u00a0ICOs 4. Contratos Inteligentes - Auto ejecutables y complementados por el aprendizaje autom\u00e1tico. 5. Gestiones Diversas - De Identidad, de Seguridad, Certificaciones y Credenciales, principalmente mediante el uso de\u00a0Ethereum. 6. Aplicaciones de Gobierno - Votaciones y referendos, legislaci\u00f3n, eliminaci\u00f3n de burocracia, ciudades inteligentes y acceso a servicios electr\u00f3nicos gubernamentales. 7. Descentralizaci\u00f3n de Mercados - Incluyendo la evoluci\u00f3n de la Econom\u00eda Colaborativa 8. Cadenas de Suministro - Internet de las Cosas (IoT), principalmente a trav\u00e9s de\u00a0IOTA. 9. Almacenamiento de Datos - Descentralizaci\u00f3n de servidores en la nube, registro de bienes ra\u00edces y otras propiedades, aplicaciones de salud. 10. Plataformas de Predicci\u00f3n y Consumo de Contenido - Juegos de azar,\u00a0Paywalls. Estas aplicaciones tienen en com\u00fan en que a) se requiere un libro de registro; b) hay diferentes interesados en ver o modificar dicho registro; c) no hay un tercero de confianza irrebatible; d) los diferentes actores no se conocen; y e) se requiere una verificaci\u00f3n p\u00fablica. Sin estas premisas, es mejor construir bases de datos en vez de hacer aplicaciones basadas en la\u00a0blockchain. 2. Autos el\u00e9ctricos finalmente se convertir\u00e1n en una alternativa viable Hace 10 a\u00f1os, la compa\u00f1\u00eda Tesla Inc. revolucion\u00f3 la industria automotriz con el primer autom\u00f3vil de serie totalmente el\u00e9ctrico en usar bater\u00edas de iones de litio y en alcanzar m\u00e1s de 320 km con una sola carga,\u00a0el Tesla Roadster[3]. Despu\u00e9s de un lanzamiento dif\u00edcil al mercado, no par\u00f3 de crecer su gama de carros el\u00e9ctricos y logr\u00f3 producir modelos altamente exitosos como el Tesla Model S \u2014el carro el\u00e9ctrico\u00a0plug-in\u00a0m\u00e1s vendido mundialmente en 2015 y 2016\u2014 y el Tesla Model X. A pesar de que los autos fabricados por Tesla son, posiblemente, los mejores veh\u00edculos del tipo en la actualidad, su elevado precio los ha dejado fuera del alcance del consumidor promedio. Este 2018 se viene una gran ola de ventas[4]\u00a0de autos el\u00e9ctricos asequibles. Si bien, aunque el 2017 fue el a\u00f1o con mayores ventas de carros el\u00e9ctricos \u2014casi 200 mil unidades en EUA y por primera vez,\u00a0un mill\u00f3n de unidades alrededor del mundo[5]\u2014, los autos el\u00e9ctricos solo representan aproximadamente 1.5% de la venta total de autom\u00f3viles en EUA y menos del 1% en todo el mundo. Algunos de los nuevos modelos accesibles para el consumidor promedio que competir\u00e1n este a\u00f1o en el mercado global son el Chevrolet Bolt (que\u00a0rompi\u00f3 su r\u00e9cord de ventas[6]\u00a0en EUA en diciembre pasado), el Tesla Model 3 (considerado el sed\u00e1n 'econ\u00f3mico' de la prestigiosa marca) y el 2018 Nissan Leaf (cuya primera edici\u00f3n ha sido el veh\u00edculo totalmente el\u00e9ctrico\u00a0m\u00e1s vendido hasta la fecha[7]). Estos tres autos est\u00e1n entre los USD$29 mil y USD$36 mil, lo cual confirma una sustancial reducci\u00f3n de precios en comparaci\u00f3n con los primeros modelos. Otro factor que impulsar\u00e1 fuertemente la demanda de autos el\u00e9ctricos es que potencias mundiales como China, Reino Unido, Alemania y Francia ya hicieron p\u00fablicos sus planes para prohibir la venta de coches que funcionan con gasolina y di\u00e9sel durante las pr\u00f3ximas d\u00e9cadas. De acuerdo con\u00a0Bloomberg New Energy Financial, para el 2040, las ventas mundiales de autos el\u00e9ctricos llegar\u00e1n a los 530 millones de unidades de un total de 1,630 millones de autos vendidos, es decir,\u00a0un 33% del mercado global del sector[8]. Finalmente, los precios seguir\u00e1n bajando y los consumidores \u2014cada d\u00eda m\u00e1s interesados en la preservaci\u00f3n de la naturaleza\u2014 los adoptar\u00e1n en mayor medida, por lo que este a\u00f1o presenciaremos ventas hist\u00f3ricas. 3. Primeras compa\u00f1\u00edas realizaran ensayos cl\u00ednicos de CRISPR-Cas9 en humanos La revolucionaria tecnolog\u00eda CRISPR-Cas9 permite modificar con mucha precisi\u00f3n el genoma de cualquier c\u00e9lula. Esto lo ha convertido en una herramienta poderos\u00edsima con posibilidades casi ilimitadas para tratar y curar padecimientos, particularmente, enfermedades heredadas que tienen pocas opciones de tratamiento, como el c\u00e1ncer. Ya han transcurrido casi 5 a\u00f1os desde\u00a0la primera vez[9]\u00a0que cient\u00edficos emplearon CRISPR-Cas9 para editar c\u00e9lulas humanas vivas, pero\u00a0su primera aplicaci\u00f3n real en humanos[10]\u00a0apenas se realiz\u00f3 en el 2016, por un equipo chino que buscaba tratar el c\u00e1ncer de pulm\u00f3n en un paciente. Durante el 2018, compa\u00f1\u00edas biotecnol\u00f3gicas como CRISPR Therapeutics y Vertex Pharmaceuticals ser\u00e1n de las primeras que realizar\u00e1n ensayos cl\u00ednicos basados en tecnolog\u00eda CRISPR-Cas9 en pacientes humanos.\u00a0CRISPR Therapeutics solicit\u00f3[11]\u00a0durante el 2017 el permiso de reguladores europeos para intentar corregir gen\u00e9ticamente la beta talasemia, una enfermedad de la sangre ocasionada por una mutaci\u00f3n en las c\u00e9lulas de hemoglobina. La compa\u00f1\u00eda espera dar un gran paso en el tratamiento de enfermedades sangu\u00edneas heredadas durante este a\u00f1o, llevando a cabo la prometedora terapia para edici\u00f3n de genes,\u00a0CTX001[12], en colaboraci\u00f3n con Vertex Pharmaceuticals. A pesar del r\u00e1pido crecimiento que ha tenido la CRISPR-Cas9 en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os, a\u00fan quedan muchos obst\u00e1culos por delante.\u00a0Un estudio[13]\u00a0publicado a principios del 2018 revel\u00f3 que la mayor\u00eda de los humanos podr\u00edan poseer anticuerpos que combaten los dos tipos m\u00e1s importantes de la prote\u00edna Cas9, que es el pilar de la tecnolog\u00eda CRISPR-Cas9. Adem\u00e1s, la creciente pol\u00e9mica \u00e9tica y social sobre la edici\u00f3n gen\u00e9tica complica a\u00fan m\u00e1s el proceso de aprobaci\u00f3n regulatoria. Sin duda, la CRISPR-Cas9 podr\u00e1 presentar grandes riesgos para salud, pero si los ensayos cl\u00ednicos resultan exitosos, la recompensa ser\u00e1 mucho mayor. 4. Incidencia de los gobiernos en servicios digitales, principalmente redes sociales La publicidad online, especialmente aquella\u00a0microdirigida\u00a0a las personas con fines pol\u00edticos y de polarizaci\u00f3n de la opini\u00f3n p\u00fablica, no le est\u00e1 gustando a los pol\u00edticos, quienes hasta hace poco hablaban de las bondades de las redes sociales y la democratizaci\u00f3n de los medios. Pero diferentes grupos de legisladores han cambiado de opini\u00f3n por\u00a0la creaci\u00f3n de burbujas de opini\u00f3n,[14]\u00a0la persecuci\u00f3n de utilidades a toda costa, as\u00ed como la explotaci\u00f3n de noticias falsas por parte de pol\u00edticos, agentes desestabilizadores y empresas de propaganda pol\u00edtica. Es por ello que cada d\u00eda m\u00e1s\u00a0se est\u00e1n cuestionando los principios rectores del Internet,[15]\u00a0como el art\u00edculo 230 de la Ley de Decencia de las Telecomunicaciones de EE.UU. Por ejemplo, los senadores Klobuchar, Warner y McCain presentaron el proyecto bipartito llamado 'Ley de Publicidad Honesta' para que la difusi\u00f3n en Internet se someta a las 'mismas normas de transparencia que los anuncios en televisi\u00f3n, prensa y radio'. La Uni\u00f3n Europea busca prohibir o limitar el\u00a0micro-targeting\u00a0de anuncios pol\u00edticos, Francia prepara su 'ley anti-Fake News'\u00a0y cada d\u00eda hay m\u00e1s llamados\u00a0a bloquear el Twitter de los l\u00edderes mundiales,[16]\u00a0comenzando por Donald Trump. En M\u00e9xico, se espera la votaci\u00f3n definitiva sobre la reforma para considerar como hecho il\u00edcito la difusi\u00f3n de informaci\u00f3n que pueda causar 'deshonra, descr\u00e9dito, perjuicio o exponer al desprecio a alguien,' cuya ambig\u00fcedad puede derivar en un peligroso uso pol\u00edtico. Se puede anticipar que el 2018 traer\u00e1 movimientos regulatorios y de censura para las redes sociales. Sin embargo, una vez m\u00e1s, los gobiernos ser\u00e1n reactivos a la tecnolog\u00eda, que a nivel redes sociales evolucionar\u00e1 a comunidades sociales de mayor volumen: las comunidades sociales, masivas, simult\u00e1neas y en l\u00ednea. Estas nuevas comunidades, basadas en el\u00a0livestream, permitir\u00e1n que millones de extra\u00f1os puedan conectarse a aplicaciones y vivir en el ciberespacio experiencias y pl\u00e1ticas simult\u00e1neas, interactivas y personalizadas. Pero mientras las personas disfrutan estas nuevas experiencias, los gobiernos tendr\u00e1n un reto mayor: comenzar la reinvenci\u00f3n de la econom\u00eda pol\u00edtica, la diplomacia y la gobernanza\u00a0en el marco de la Cuarta Revoluci\u00f3n Industrial[17]. Por ejemplo, cada vez veremos m\u00e1s pa\u00edses desarrollando estrategias nacionales de Inteligencia Artificial y de Ciberseguridad \u2014 ambas ser\u00e1n claves para ser relevantes a nivel geopol\u00edtico. Y lamentablemente, los legisladores y jueces no tienen conocimientos s\u00f3lidos de tecnolog\u00eda. 5. La Inteligencia Artificial (IA) se incorpora a procesos de la vida diaria La ciencia ficci\u00f3n jug\u00f3 un papel fundamental sobre lo que podr\u00eda ser la IA y en los a\u00f1os recientes, algunos entusiastas de la tecnolog\u00eda se decepcionaron por las aplicaciones 'poco espectaculares' de la IA. Sin embargo, el 2018 ser\u00e1 un gran a\u00f1o para esta tecnolog\u00eda, ya que los algoritmos de aprendizaje autom\u00e1tico (o\u00a0machine learning, por su t\u00e9rmino en ingl\u00e9s) la est\u00e1n mejorando y los inversionistas le est\u00e1n apostando con convicci\u00f3n. Las tendencias muestran que se est\u00e1n usando peque\u00f1as herramientas y aplicaciones que se implementan en plataformas, algoritmos y dispositivos que usamos desde hace tiempo. Detr\u00e1s de esto se encuentra que la IA es ya una inversi\u00f3n tecnol\u00f3gica prioritaria para grandes empresas, que quieren\u00a0combinar la tecnolog\u00eda con sus pol\u00edticas de implementaci\u00f3n de cambios[18]\u00a0y disminuci\u00f3n de costos. Adem\u00e1s, han fragmentado las grandes conquistas tecnol\u00f3gicas del futuro en frentes que produzcan victorias peque\u00f1as, multidisciplinarias y recurrentes. Cabe subrayar que las \u00e1reas de expansi\u00f3n de la IA est\u00e1n siendo diferentes a las del software tradicional. Entre ellas hay que destacar los dispositivos de reconocimiento de voz, detecci\u00f3n facial, reconocimiento de emociones, uso de lenguaje natural, creaci\u00f3n de contenido, integraci\u00f3n con sistemas de aprendizaje autom\u00e1tico,\u00a0aprendizaje no supervisado[19],\u00a0procesamiento v\u00eda\u00a0edge-computing[20],\u00a0as\u00ed como compilaci\u00f3n y presentaci\u00f3n masiva de\u00a0Big Data. Adem\u00e1s, en l\u00ednea con el avance tecnol\u00f3gico, todos estos procesos no solo ser\u00e1n m\u00e1s avanzados, sino tambi\u00e9n ser\u00e1n m\u00e1s econ\u00f3micos \u2014y en diversos casos,\u00a0descentralizados[21]. Dentro de estas aplicaciones, hay que resaltar el desarrollo de nuevos hardware de especializaci\u00f3n a trav\u00e9s de chips de procesamiento gr\u00e1fico con IA (GPUs, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s), que quieren competirle a NVIDIA. Hasta ahora, la empresa de California ha dominado la industria, pero el procesamiento gr\u00e1fico en general tendr\u00e1 un desarrollo acelerado en los pr\u00f3ximos meses dado el inter\u00e9s \u2014tanto del sector privado como de gobiernos pro-tecnolog\u00eda\u2014 en explotar nuevas capacidades de procesamiento de video para los sectores de defensa y m\u00e9dico. La industria\u00a0healthcare\u00a0fue el sector de AI que levant\u00f3 m\u00e1s dinero y\u00a0realiz\u00f3 m\u00e1s operaciones en 2017[22]. Ah\u00ed veremos aplicaciones en \u00e1reas como administraci\u00f3n y monitorizaci\u00f3n del estilo de vida, asistentes virtuales, im\u00e1genes m\u00e9dicas y diagn\u00f3stico, entre otros. Estas aplicaciones mostrar\u00e1n beneficios tangibles de la aplicaci\u00f3n de la IA, dej\u00e1ndonos la sensaci\u00f3n de que el ser humano y la m\u00e1quina pueden combinarse para mejorar a la especie humana. Es por estas razones que el a\u00f1o entrante tambi\u00e9n traer\u00e1 m\u00e1s debate sobre las implicaciones de los avances tecnol\u00f3gicos. Por ejemplo, se espera que las agendas p\u00fablica y legislativa incluyan temas como las directrices \u00e9ticas dentro de la IA, la eliminaci\u00f3n de empleos por parte de procesos basados en esta tecnolog\u00eda, la atenci\u00f3n a desplazados digitales, as\u00ed como la implementaci\u00f3n de conceptos como justicia, confianza y equidad. 6. Ciberseguridad: Entre la confidencialidad y la amenaza exponencial La ciberseguridad es desde hace tiempo un tema permanente en la mesa de los riesgos tecnol\u00f3gicos. Sin temor a caer en exageraciones, la ciberseguridad volver\u00e1 a ser un tema preponderante en el 2018. Entre las buenas noticias que traer\u00e1 el a\u00f1o se encuentra la puesta en marcha del\u00a0Reglamento General de Protecci\u00f3n de Datos de la Uni\u00f3n Europea[23]\u00a0(GDPR, por sus siglas en ingl\u00e9s), que aspira a regresarle a los ciudadanos el control sobre sus datos personales y simplificar la regulaci\u00f3n de la regi\u00f3n. Por otro lado, veremos el enfoque en la integridad de la protecci\u00f3n de datos, una evoluci\u00f3n necesaria despu\u00e9s de los continuos quebrantos a la confidencialidad por parte de compa\u00f1\u00edas y\u00a0hackers \u2014\u00a0y l\u00f3gicamente, tambi\u00e9n habr\u00e1 m\u00e1s vulneraciones a bases de datos, sistemas con informaci\u00f3n sensible,\u00a0blockchains, y por primera vez, criptomonedas. Sin embargo, habr\u00e1 dos novedades relevantes en estos\u00a0hackeos. Por un lado, el objetivo primario de los delincuentes ser\u00e1 con menos frecuencia el robo de informaci\u00f3n personal y m\u00e1s com\u00fanmente, la apropriaci\u00f3n de sistemas \u2014 desde la explotaci\u00f3n de vulnerabilidades del IoT, hasta la falla de sistemas m\u00e9dicos, as\u00ed como el ataque a infraestructura cr\u00edtica, la seguridad nacional o la ciberguerra. Por el otro, ser\u00e1 el primer a\u00f1o en el que\u00a0la mayor\u00eda de los ataques sean hechos con estructuras relacionadas a la IA[24]: uso de\u00a0chatbots\u00a0para enviar\u00a0spam,\u00a0phishingo fraude, criptogr\u00e1ficos o\u00a0ransomware\u00a0basados en\u00a0machine learning,\u00a0creaci\u00f3n de patrones para evitar ser detectados o ataques de fuerza bruta basados en IA para adivinar contrase\u00f1as. A pesar de que la IA pueda ser utilizada para la defensa de los nuevos sistemas digitales, es probable que, en t\u00e9rminos absolutos, el cibercrimen explote mejor estas nuevas tecnolog\u00edas, pues sus consecuencias m\u00e1s radicales pueden amenazar la vida de las personas o desplomar activos tecnol\u00f3gicos de referencia. En s\u00edntesis, la amenaza estar\u00e1 llegando no solo a afectaciones nunca antes vistas, sino que requerir\u00e1 que los usuarios y organizaciones tengamos un nivel de precauci\u00f3n al que no estamos acostumbrados \u2014y para el que quiz\u00e1 sea dif\u00edcil prepararnos. 7. La llegada de la red 5G La tercera generaci\u00f3n (3G) de telefon\u00eda m\u00f3vil \u2014aparecida en 2001\u2014 marc\u00f3 un parteaguas en las telecomunicaciones por ser la primera en ofrecer velocidad de transmisi\u00f3n de datos de hasta 2 Mbps, m\u00e1s que suficiente para soportar videollamadas en alta definici\u00f3n como para tener una experiencia de usuario decente. En el 2009, comenz\u00f3 el despliegue de la cuarta generaci\u00f3n (4G), que es hasta 10 veces m\u00e1s r\u00e1pida que la 3G. Y aunque la red m\u00f3vil 4G ya se utiliza en m\u00e1s de 188 pa\u00edses, solamente\u00a0en el 11%[25]\u00a0de ellos, es la red m\u00e1s utilizada. De hecho,\u00a0solo 1 de 4[26]\u00a0conexiones m\u00f3viles en el mundo est\u00e1n en la red m\u00e1s r\u00e1pida de la 4G, la 4G-LTE. Afortunadamente, su baja adopci\u00f3n no detuvo el desarrollo de la siguiente generaci\u00f3n. La quinta generaci\u00f3n (5G) de telefon\u00eda m\u00f3vil ser\u00e1 la sucesora de la 4G-LTE y algunos pa\u00edses con mayor adopci\u00f3n de la LTE ya tienen en la mira comenzar a remplazarla durante los pr\u00f3ximos a\u00f1os. Este 2018, la multinacional de telecomunicaciones AT...espera convertirse en\u00a0la primera compa\u00f1\u00eda estadounidense[27]\u00a0en introducir el servicio de red m\u00f3vil 5G a una docena de ciudades en EUA. Por otro lado, Corea del Sur planea implementar\u00a0una prueba piloto[28]\u00a0de la red m\u00f3vil 5G durante los Juegos Ol\u00edmpicos de Invierno 2018 en Pyeongchang. Adem\u00e1s, tiene como meta desplegar una red m\u00f3vil 5G comercial para finales de 2019. La red m\u00f3vil 5G podr\u00e1 ser\u00a0hasta 100 veces m\u00e1s r\u00e1pida[29]\u00a0que la 4G-LTE, con una\u00a0velocidad de entre 1 y 10 Gbps[30]\u00a0(a esta velocidad un programa de TV se descarga en 3 segundos o menos), tendr\u00e1 una latencia muy baja (de hasta 1 ms) y una capacidad para soportar hasta mil millones de conexiones. Permitir\u00e1 que millones de objetos cotidianos como electrodom\u00e9sticos, altavoces, sensores, ropa, y otros objetos del Internet de las Cosas puedan estar enlazados. Tambi\u00e9n facilitar\u00e1 que veh\u00edculos aut\u00f3nomos puedan tomar decisiones en tiempo real basadas en informaci\u00f3n en la nube y que se pueda hacer\u00a0streaming\u00a0de v\u00eddeos 4K Ultra HD y simult\u00e1neamente descargar una pel\u00edcula HD, en menos de un minuto. Pese a que la red 5G comenzar\u00e1, anticipadamente, a desplegarse durante este a\u00f1o, a\u00fan hay un largo camino por delante. En los pa\u00edses en v\u00edas de desarrollo, la adopci\u00f3n del 4G sigue siendo muy baja \u2014solo un 20% de las conexiones son 4G\u2014 por lo que a\u00fan faltaran varios a\u00f1os m\u00e1s para ver la proliferaci\u00f3n de la red 5G.COMPARTIR:<url

Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he was gathering state attorneys general to discuss big tech following Trump's Twitter tirades on Google last week. This should alarm tech firms because that means a Republican conspiracy theory about a liberal bias in tech seems to have evolved into a high-level Justice Department discussion. </p><p>That conspiracy might be the catalyst that breaks up big tech. The US government's sniping at Silicon Valley took an unexpected and serious turn on Wednesday when the most powerful lawyer in the country, attorney general Jeff Sessions, made ominous noises about monopolistic behaviour and censorship. In a statement on Wednesday[1], the Department of Justice said (emphasis ours): \"The attorney general has convened a meeting with a number of state attorneys general this month to discuss a growing concern that these companies may be hurting competition and intentionally stifling the free exchange of ideas on their platforms.\" There are two issues Sessions appears to be concerned with. One is that some tech firms, though he doesn't say which, are monopolies. The other is that they stifle free speech. The latter is a Republican talking point that has gained ground after President Donald Trump accused both Google and Twitter of stifling right-wing voices[2], though without much proof. As an example, he falsely claimed that Google promoted Barack Obama's State of the Union address[3], but not his own. He also claimed Twitter was \"shadow banning\" prominent Republicans, something Twitter has denied and which has been debunked[4]. It is true that Twitter did suspend right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones from its platform for seven days, though he is active once more and freely posting videos on YouTube. The conservative press has interpreted his suspension as a free speech issue, despite the fact Jones demonstrably violated Twitter's policies[5].Free speech might be a Trojan horse being used to breakup big techTrump and Sessions may have had their differences recently[6], but the attorney general seems to be picking up the baton from the President's Twitter tirades on tech. There are two things about Sessions' intervention that should alarm Silicon Valley. One is that what is effectively an emotive Republican conspiracy can evolve into a high-level Justice Department discussion. The other is that the confected free speech issue might be a Trojan horse to breakup big tech. Sessions said in his statement that he wanted to discuss how tech firms might be stifling competition, an issue which is quite separate from whether they violate the First Amendment. The three obvious candidates for any antitrust investigation would be Amazon, with its dominance of retail, Google, with its dominance of search and online ads, and Facebook for its dominance of social media. Many have made the case recently that Facebook should be separated from Instagram and WhatsApp[7], and that Google is the digital equivalent to big oil monopolies[8]. Up until now, it has not looked likely that the US would launch any antitrust investigation into three hugely successful homegrown firms. And it seemed especially unlikely that it would be the Republicans who triggered any kind of probe. But Republican sensitivity to perceived bias, and tech firms' central role in the Russian misinformation scandal \u2014 which has been hotly pursued by Democrats \u2014 mean there is a bipartisan appetite to scrutinise tech companies. Big tech is in the dock.NOW WATCH: What's going on with Elon Musk[9]See Also: Trump's Cabinet reportedly whispered about invoking the 25th Amendment, which lets 14 people remove a sitting president
