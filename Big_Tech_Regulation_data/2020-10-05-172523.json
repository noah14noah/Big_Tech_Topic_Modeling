But what predictions do experts have for blockchain and cryptocurrency in 2020?</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We heard from experts across the blockchain and cryptocurrency space about their predictions for 2020, from cybersecurity concerns to greater mainstream adoption. 2020 blockchain and cryptocurrency predictionsFurther Bitcoin price risesWhile 2019 was a transformative year for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, I believe 2020 could be even more monumental. Bitcoin was the best performing asset class by a wide margin, and this itself draws the interest of investors. It continues to unlock a global, open market for financial services during a period when many nations are closing their borders. Because of this, we would not be surprised to see the price of Bitcoin rise again. </p><p>Next year, we expect to see further expansion of global payments that do not come from legacy banking institutions. Bitcoin and other digital currencies have changed the financial landscape and shifted the way we look at all assets. The open-source ethos of cryptocurrency has put institutions on notice, and we expect all financial services to be disrupted forever. We expect more banks to adopt the \"If you can't beat them, join them\" policy in 2020. In this regard, we will also see more big names in the tech industry like Amazon coming into the blockchain and cryptocurrency sector. Every institution from Berkshire Hathaway to Barclays will be impacted by the evolution happening in these markets, and we see this trend accelerating regardless of regulation, security or price volatility. Of course, we still see many jurisdictions pushing back on cryptocurrency through regulations, but we do believe by year-end 2020, we will see a Bitcoin ETF listed in the United States. This event could be the catalyst to push Bitcoin above $14,000. One of the main drivers for this expectation is that similar ETFs have already been approved in Europe, and we also believe that the demand for this investment is widespread amongst traditional investors and institutional investors we expect regulators will be willing to forge a compromise. It is worth noting that the largest accounting firms Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG have already adopted digital currency accounting platforms. In addition, we see the derivatives market as a stabiliser, which should also help regulators to look favourably on a Bitcoin ETF. Andy Cheung, head of operations at OKEx Quantum computing to shape future cryptocurrenciesQuantum computing will become impossible to ignore in 2020. Google just made a major breakthrough in quantum supremacy, publishing the results of a test where its 54-qubit processor performed a computation in 200 seconds that it says would have previously taken 10,000 years. The imminence of quantum computing holds major implications for the cryptocurrency industry. Today, cryptocurrencies' pseudo-random generation of keys leaves them susceptible to exploitation by hackers. Quantum computing increases the likelihood of predicting software-generated values, presenting major security concerns. In 2020, the first public quantum computers are coming onto the market. With Amazon's latest cloud service, Braket, providing quantum computers to the public, expect to see traditional blockchain networks challenged by quantum-secure networks. Quantum-secure networks, such as those that leverage quantum entanglement to generate provable random numbers and next-generation hashing algorithms, will be poised to succeed in an era of quantum computing. While I certainly hope that the cryptocurrency market rebounds in 2020, Bitcoin may continue its struggles due to its issues with speed, scalability, and resource requirements. Bitcoin originally set out to take on legacy payment systems, but it has not successfully achieved this. Transactions on the Bitcoin network can take up to 10-15 minutes, making it ill-equipped for mainstream payments. Bitcoin also requires high entry points for network participation, which equates to massive computational power. Bitcoin has also faced issues over the last few years with scalability, which can't be easily solved. In 2020, I predict we will start to see other cryptocurrency payment systems gain momentum that tackle these challenges and deliver payment solutions that meets the needs of today's global economy. Richard Dennis, founder and CEO at temtum Crypto purchases with fiatWith crypto spreading to the masses, it would become easier to buy Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies with fiat money. This could be done through folks who already own crypto or through a growing network of crypto ATMs. Just like we use our bank accounts, our crypto wallets would provide us access to cash through various crypto ATMs. As virtual currency ATMs become ubiquitous, it would be interesting to see people purchase digital assets with cash. Also, the resistance to imposed government restrictions and other obstacles will create new DeFi-based P2P currency exchange platforms. These platforms will offer their services through mobile finance mediums and will enable any user to become an agent and exchange crypto for cash directly with their peers safely from/in any place in the world. Alexey Ermakov, CEO and founder of Aximetria More governments and businesses to announce their own cryptocurrenciesI predict that Facebook's Libra will dominate the spotlight again in 2020. When Libra launched earlier this year, it not only signalled a sea change in the industry, but forced regulators to take cryptocurrency seriously. Government leaders in the United States and abroad are now wrestling with how they'll handle blockchain technology and crypto payments as we enter a new decade. China's central bank is doubling down on its efforts to launch a cryptocurrency in response to Libra, and other countries may do the same. In 2020, I expect to see more governments and business leaders announce their own cryptocurrencies, and while this legitimises the industry, we must stay skeptical. Ask yourself what the motivation is behind these projects, and if they're in it for the right reasons. In 2019 we saw many crypto projects crash and burn. Scammers were revealed. Inexperienced teams were exposed. I predict that in 2020, the weeding out of poorly executed crypto projects will continue. We'll see more and more cryptocurrencies that popped up in 2017 hit zero, and their teams fade away or move on to different projects. I predict 98% of crypto projects and their currencies will go to zero or have no viable exit for their holders. As the crypto ecosystem matures, every project needs to have a viable use case, strong funding, strong community, and an experienced leadership team to succeed. While the price of Bitcoin has been a bit of a disappointment in 2019, I think Bitcoin's halving in May could spike the price. I expect to see Bitcoin reach $11,000 around this time. The communities that believe in Bitcoin will continue to HODL, regardless of price fluctuations, and by now it's clear that Bitcoin has proven itself as a long-term investment and store of value. I would further venture to say Bitcoin will hit $2m a coin in the next 5 years so long as the core dev team doesn't destroy it accidentally from within, causing a crypto catastrophe and pushing the entire crypto ecosystem from decentralised freedom into government-backed cryptos that they will feel safer in. Robert Beadles, president at Monarch Cryptojacking to climb with price hikesCryptojacking will move in line with cryptocurrency prices. If prices increase, we'll see more cryptomining; as they fall, attackers will find other monetisation strategies. As people move to more locked down devices, cryptojacking will become increasingly prevalent, monetising threats through the consumer's electricity bill. Joe Jaroch, senior director of cybersecurity strategy, Webroot 2020s to be a decade of blockchain innovation and adoptionCryptocurrencies have arguably been the radical fintech innovation of the decade. In less than a decade, blockchain and crypto tech has unleashed a wave of innovation and ideas for the future of finance and payments. As we complete 10 years of bitcoin, its value has increased from $0.03 in March 2010 to its current value of $6,000 (November 2019). However, the spike to $20,000 in 2017 due to an investor frenzy will not be forgotten and although it may not see these heights in the short-term we could expect more investor interest throughout the course of the next decade. In addition, this year's hearing surrounding Facebook and its entry has certainly paved the way for further interesting developments. It was more of a timing issue, as Facebook already under the public eye for privacy issues, came out with radical plans for its crypto token that immediately raised fears in EU and US governments that the Libra would circumvent monetary sovereignties. Under an increasingly liberal China, which is backing a digital Yuan under hopes of furthering a worldwide adoption, a blanket regulatory\u00c2\u00a0 approach from the west would handover digital supremacy to China and led to a splinternet model. While the 2010s has been an exploratory phase introducing the concepts of crypto tokens and blockchain to the world, the 2020s will be the decade for innovation and application. Stable currencies like the BOLT Token, which is backed by a real world application and utility will yield actual value. Christel Quek, chief commercial officer and co-founder at BOLT.Global Supply chain blockchain applications to bring measurable benefitsFirms will gain measurable benefits from blockchain in conjunction with IoT and AI in logistics use cases. Today, supply chain transactions are coordinated across multiple parties, and spread across multiple geographies and legal jurisdictions. Some of these parties will be organisations; some will be individuals; and some may be automated, network-connected devices. Solutions that leverage blockchain in conjunction with IoT, and potentially AI, will cut supply chain costs and boost CX through seamless logistics. The IoT device: Tracks and sensors the products, providing answers to questions such as: Where is the product? Was it too hot or cold? (particularly useful when transporting food) Is it genuine? Each connected device acts as a node on the blockchain network, authenticating the transaction and providing an immutable record. The AI is the learning system; it looks at the behavior of the component over time across the ecosystem, correlates with other data points (weather, market data), then makes prescriptive recommendations OR automates decisions. Smart contracts built into the blockchain give the ability to execute code autonomously, which is ideal in an ecosystem environment, when many parties interact but have a limited relationship (and therefore trust) with one another. However, utopian vision of enterprises across industries migrating all their processes onto shared blockchains, and interacting on a trusted ecosystem, still seems far-fetched. Blockchain projects that are not narrow in focus continuously run into problems with scaling. Businesses continue to start with a desire for blockchain, rather than the business problem, which is often solvable without the need for distributed ledger technology. Helena Schwenk, global analyst relations manager at Exasol Blockchain to be integrated into business modelsBlockchain's moment in the mainstream is just around the corner and 2020 will be the year where it will be implemented into business models in a variety of ways. Take Coca-Cola for example, the company is set to adopt blockchain technology to manage its cross-part transactions. The payment space is set to be revamped; In the igaming industry for example a blockchain payment system will streamline the entire gaming experience strengthening trust between players and gaming providers through transparent data storage.\" No matter the industry, through blockchain, positive changes can be made and 2020 will be the year these changes will begin to have an effect on a wider audience. Juliet Adelstein, co-CEO of GanaEight Coin (G8C) Bitcoin's safe-haven status will be put to the testTypically, when investors want to defend their portfolios against future volatility, they buy so-called 'safe haven' assets which benefit during times of economic turmoil, such as gold, US treasuries, or the Japanese Yen. But what about bitcoin as a safe-haven asset? This will be a question that will be increasingly discussed (if not tested) in 2020. On the one hand, bitcoin is still an extremely volatile asset with 5-10% daily price swings still commonplace, and as such is naturally considered as a high risk investment under normal considerations. As such we would expect it to be subject to the same 'risk-on, risk-off' investor sentiment as other high risk assets such as equities or options/derivatives. On the other hand, bitcoin has consistently shown that is in fact uncorrelated with most traditional financial asset classes. This is quite an interesting property which means that bitcoin's price doesn't necessarily follow other asset classes off the cliff when there is a large market downturn. As such, uncorrelated assets are popular tools with investors to hedge their portfolios. Being an uncorrelated, censorship-resistant asset, it's quite possible that bitcoin will increasingly adopt the identity of a safe-haven; a lifeboat for capital when the wider markets go sour. But it's also possible that, when it comes down to the crunch, it will be dumped along with other high risk assets in favour of traditional safe-havens. I suspect the former, although it really depends if bitcoin has had enough time to acquire investors comfort and safe-haven identity before this is put to the test. Andy Bryant, co-head and chief operating officer (EMEA) of bitFlyer Signs of a crypto springIt is always difficult to predict where immature technology and economic activity might go. However, there are signs that we are entering a 'crypto spring' with well-funded projects, blockchain patents and a maturing of the crypto space. Bitcoin, as a deflationary currency, will continue to appreciate in value longer term and other cryptocurrencies that seek to act as a store of value will follow this path. There will also be a clearer distinction between forms of cryptocurrencies as payment tokens, utility tokens, asset tokens and security tokens. The market will become increasingly sophisticated to understand the differences, assisted by greater regulatory scrutiny and clarification. Blockchain and other forms of distributed ledger technology will start to be applied as solutions to genuine problems, albeit in a more limited form than prophesised by blockchain evangelists rather than as solutions looking for a problem to solve (or worse, fabricating a problem to which someone's blockchain was the magic solution). There will continue to be bull and bear runs as the crypto ecosystem matures. However, at the same time, the magnitude of the runs will tend to settle down as the market becomes more sophisticated and regulatory oversight starts to increasingly bite. Will crypto replace centralised financial systems? Not anytime soon. Governments and incumbent financial institutions have taken the momentum out of the original drive that built up between 2009 and 2017. These large actors have ingested that same momentum and are now looking at how they use crypto technology to augment (if not entrench) existing financial systems. Adrian Shedden, fintech lawyer at Keystone Law The gap between regulated and unregulated will growRegulation in its own right is likely to be one of the prevailing blockchain trends in 2020. January will mark the formal arrival of Liechtenstein's Blockchain Act, one of the most advanced regulatory regimes for the industry in the world one that balances support for innovation with importance advances in customer and asset protection. Where Liechtenstein is leading, others are set to eventually follow. And this will mark the shift of the blockchain, and specifically cryptocurrency, market from an unregulated one which has attracted a justifiably poor reputation in some corners, to the kind of regulated industry that can provide a stable home for investor capital. Next year is when we expect this trend to accelerate, and the gap between regulated and unregulated exchanges to become much more distinct. Kiran Raj, CEO at Bittrex Global Cryptojacking continuesCryptojacking is becoming a widespread problem in the industry and will continue to be as we move into 2020. Cryptojacking is where malware gets implanted on a device with the sole purpose of mining cryptocurrency for the hacker. It seems that criminals have discovered it's easier to host Cryptojacking malware on machines to mine cryptocurrency rather than trying to execute traditional ransomware attacks. While not as devastating as other attacks, nefarious cryptomining malware on a device will steal CPU processing resources leading to a slowdown in performance and extra drain on battery powered devices resulting in a shorter lifespan of the affected device. It can also lead to unexpected costs if running on a paid for cloud service. Very few would agree to this, but it must be noted that there is a move by online sites to 'legitimately' ask users to lend their CPUs for mining while visiting that website, primarily as a payment mechanism. This has arisen in part due to the widespread adoption of ad blockers. Cryptomining, on the other hand, occurs when users are tricked into downloading executables or they visit hijacked sites where ads run cryptomining scripts. To minimise the risk of a cryptomining breach ad blockers should be installed, anti-virus software put in place and Javascript disabled. In addition, enterprises must train staff about the dangers of clicking on links and visiting illegitimate websites. Staff should also be trained to look for a slowdown in performance and how to examine running processes. Professor Kevin Curran, a senior member of the IEEE and professor of cybersecurity at Ulster University Growing industry adoption of blockchainThe blockchain market is still fairly new, so that means there's a lot of opportunity for new ideas and growth within this area. Blockchain will be used predominately by the financial sector for cybersecurity, this is one of the leading areas, particularly when it comes remittance and money transfers because of distributed ledger technology. In financial services, we see areas like alternative currency exchanges, asset management, insurance and even crowdfunding using blockchain technology more and more. The prevailing use for blockchain at this moment is for mobile wallets, such a virtual currency and universal payment systems. Other areas where blockchain is set to grow includes identity management, authenticity related to security use, and infrastructure. However, blockchain and DLT solutions have come under fire in the recent times, so there is still huge uncertainty in this area. Blockchain needs to prove its role by engaging with enterprises and providing more use-cases to reach that next level. Aftab Malhotra, founder of GrowthEnabler Criminal interest in the Monero cryptocurrencyWe expect to see further increasing cybercriminal interest in Monero, the privacy and anonymity-centric cryptocurrency, as part of a gradual shift away from Bitcoin (BTC) towards other cryptocurrencies that can't be as easily tracked. This may partially be a result of law enforcement takedowns as well as self-imposed shutdowns of Bitcoin tumblers in 2019. These interruptions underscored the cybercriminal dependency on these services which are critical in BTC money-laundering operations and which are less imperative with a coin like Monero. Many cryptojackers also now mine Monero due in part to the fact that it's privacy centric and thus highly attractive to criminals; we see the most intense interest in Monero in the English language underground. Liv Rowley, threat intelligence analyst at Blueliv Blockchain will start to shake up supply chains in 2020Use of Blockchain to solve supply chain sustainability and compliance challenges will move from proofs of concept and pilot efforts to full fledge deployments in 2020 driven by large global brands with well-defined supply chains. The projects that get funded will be those that have proven return like provenance tracking, contract compliance, supplier diversity and ethical sourcing. Separately, these same companies along with others with more fluid supply chain, will begin building out industry consortiums to identify industry wide challenges that blockchain can address. Early movers will be the food, manufacturing and pharma industries. Bernadette Bulacan, chief evangelist at Icertis The end of optimistic experimentationOptimistic experimentation comes to an end as we reach 2020. We'll see new challenges arise from the fact that these experiments are nearing adulthood. The most promising of these applications continues to be exchanges of information and rich automated workflows between co-operative and sometimes competitive organisations, and government bodies. To date, these players' best interest is to collaborate, as these companies achieve a robust understanding and familiarity with the technology. We predict that these mutual incentives of learning will be outweighed by more competitive desires. We will see organisations now try to break the limits of these systems in more oppositional ways. Blockchain and contract law battle it out in the courts: which wins practically, a paper contract or an immutable smart contract? Enterprise blockchains aren't so immutable, as blockchain endeavors suffer and recover from mundane events like software bugs or dramatic ones stemming from malicious participants; we'll see how hardline each system is to immutability guarantees. On a positive note, blockchain platforms continue to evolve and mature in how they see their role in security. This maturity is marked by attention to how people will use the platforms, rather than the security of the platforms themselves. We see this manifest as attention in the field to smart contract security analysis technologies that can reason about smart contract code, investments in smart contract programming languages that are easier for developers and tools to reason about (and have formal 'safety' properties), and programming platforms that provide safety to end users by moving closer to workloads that organisations care about and providing security out of the box. Travis Biehn, principal consultant at Synopsys Blockchain to boost sustainable investmentsGreen finance, defined as the integrating of environmental protection with economic profits, is gaining traction within the financial industry and will continue to in 2020. Blockchain-enabled platforms and processes manage complex transactions more efficiently and will improve the transparency, traceability and cost-effectiveness of sustainable investments. As a result, sustainable development and other climate-related initiatives will be more attractive for investors. Smart contracts, a key element of blockchain technology, increase autonomy and speed of execution for financial transactions, enabling task automation and minimising cash trapped in the value chain of a transaction. This will help financial institutions conduct green finance trade internationally, increasing global cooperation and further cementing the global dedication to climate action. Blockchain technology displays very promising solutions to facilitate and accelerate sustainable investments. Well beyond the buzz around cryptocurrencies, the tech community is truly inspired at participating in a more sustainable world, which requires much more transparency, accountability and sense of emergency. Vincent Manier, CFO at ENGIE Impact There will be an uptick in cryptojacking2019 saw a decline in cryptojackingsecretly using someone's computing power to carry out the cryptomining task. This decline was not surprising because the price of cryptocurrency has also decreased following its zeitgeist moment in 2018. However, recently, cryptocurrency prices have been creeping up. They will likely move past the breakeven point for currency miners, i.e., the point where it is once again profitable to run cryptojacking campaigns. With successful miners able to go undetected for months, this is an issue that is likely to linger throughout the year, making it essential for organisations to monitor for these threats actively. Fabian Libeau, VP EMEA at RiskIQ Blockchain to rise again?The blockchain is unquestionably an ingenious invention, but has gone through what Gartner calls in their hypercycles as the trough of disillusionment. It promised much but has delivered very little to date. Ever since it emerged as the 'next big thing', there have been very few meaningful applications for blockchain in the real world. So, what's holding blockchain back from mainstream adoption? There are a few elements here, but broadly speaking it comes down to cost, scalability and trust. With industry leaders, such as Amazon or Microsoft committing to building services around blockchain, we will begin to see accelerated adoption as they tackle the issues that have previously stopped it making its way into the mainstream with real-world solutions coming into play from 2020. Aaron Harris, CTO at Sage A greater focus on blockchain applicationsThere is little doubt in my mind that blockchain is evolving at some speed. The language has changed positively from 'What is it?' to discussing the implementation of usage cases without getting het-up about the technology. Yes, there are still occasional entertaining forays and debates on the relative merits of Turing complete vs non-Turing complete languages, but these types of discussion tend to be very much limited to the inner workings of IT departments rather than the boardroom. My prediction for 2020 is that the technology itself will become even less of a feature in the discussions and there will be more of a focus on application. I'd see this as a very healthy evolution as it would show the move from concept to implementation. In particular, I expect we will see an increasing use of smart contracts alongside traditional contracts beyond the small scale proof of concepts and pilots we have seen to date, and developing into operational reality. I would also expect to see usage cases include increasing adoption of blockchain for chain-of-custody transfers to improve supply chain transparency, and a wider adoption of the technology in tracking transfer of ownership. The less we talk about blockchain technology as a 'thing' in its own right, the more I expect it will become part of the technology furniture. Iain Steel, chief procurement services officer at TLT Beyond disruption2020 is the year we will see blockchain move past the 'disruptive' phase and into our daily lives. This could mean integration with everyday tech such as health records and smoke detectors, as well as a possible integration with many sectors, such as sensors and IoT, digital access, authentication of data, and digital identities especially. It could also play a role in the rise of smart cities. Take pollution control for example. With growing global fears around climate change, how we manage our cities is becoming ever more important. Blockchain can facilitate better urban planning and solve pertinent problems like waste, congested traffic and population growth with more data. Asia will also remain at the forefront of innovation in blockchain, with China's digital currency set to be rolled out next year. Given the potential of digital assets, this move could be check-mate for China in the trade war against the US. Singapore is also leading the world at the moment in terms of being a conducive environment for blockchain and cryptocurrency companies. In fact, as of February 2019, over 634 companies were incorporated in Singapore with a combined market cap of approximately $8.3bn. While change will always have detractors, the truth is that, thanks to the involvement of governments and institutions around the world, we're already well on the way to mainstream acceptance of crypto. And as global governments start racing to launch their own cryptocurrencies in order to keep up with the big tech corporations, this trend is set to accelerate. Don Guo, CEO at Broctagon Fintech Group Changing technologies, growing applicationsMaking predictions is a difficult business, but there are a number of areas that have garnered increased interest over the past 6 months within the blockchain sphere that we will see develop over the course of 2020. Firstly, progress will be made within infrastructure building with the move to Ethereum 2.0, that is moving away from a proof-of-work system of transaction validation to proof-of-stake. Proof-of-stake is expected to be more scalable and energy efficient than proof-of-work, so this will help address those scalability issues in the most popular smart contract ecosystem. Resource tokens will be an extension to the sharing economy but on the infrastructure/resource level. Why pay AWS if we can use each other's resources? We will see increasing popularity and adoption of DeFi products (decentralised finance) such as open financial tools. These include payments, credit &amp; lending, decentralised exchanges and other DeFi products such as hedging, shorting, derivative trading and prediction markets. Gaming and digital collectibles: blockchain based video games and digital collectibles. We're yet to see the first successful gaming application in 2020. No major application of Blockchain in gaming has been seen yet, but many projects are working on it following investment in 2019.

Cryptoassets are a well-known application of Blockchain which has demonstrated some risks, and may require further monitoring going forward.  Distributed Ledger Technology shows potential promise for improving the financial services market but these benefits need to be balanced against the risks to competition which may emerge.  Understanding more about Blockchain is crucial to ensuring we encourage the promise of the technology while remaining mindful of the potential pitfalls.</p><p><br/>As you can imagine, blockchain is something that frequently comes up for us a financial markets regulator. And the panel session title \u2018Promises and Perils\u2019 sums it up neatly: the potential applications for blockchain technology are far-reaching; but there are risks.  <br/>As a financial regulator, my thoughts on blockchain fall roughly into 2 groups. The first group of thoughts is about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies \u2013 and those are slightly anxious thoughts. The second group is about other applications of distributed ledger technology in financial services \u2013 and those thoughts are more optimistic.  Evaluating cryptocurrencies  <br/>Let\u2019s start with cryptocurrencies. Also known as cryptoassets \u2013 for reasons I\u2019ll come onto in a minute.  <br/>Cryptocurrencies first emerged with Bitcoin, beginning in 2009. Since then we have witnessed a huge increase in the number and value of these products. There are now over 1,500 different coins and tokens, currently valued at around $325 billion. How much is $325 billion? Big, but not that big. Some of the world\u2019s largest pension funds are valued at around $1 trillion, for example.  <br/>For thousands of years, currencies have been developed (and backed) by sovereign states \u2013 and we think of currencies primarily in that context. Not exclusively \u2013 I live in south London, where we have the \u2018Brixton pound\u2019. But the Brixton pound is not worth $325 billion - the cryptocurrency phenomenon is clearly something new. What does it mean for regulators?  <br/>Without getting too deep into the UK financial regulation system, it\u2019s worth briefly touching on the FCA\u2019s remit. The FCA exists to make financial markets work well, and has 3 objectives within that: consumer protection, market integrity and promoting competition. We also support the Bank of England when it comes to financial stability.  <br/>The UK Government determines what activities come within our remit. Currently, that remit does not include cryptocurrencies. That said, we do regulate derivative products based on these assets, and we also regulate initial coin offerings (I understand this is the case here in the Netherlands as well).  <br/>Faced with a thorny public policy question, it can be helpful to go back to basics. If you take any economic textbook definition of money, it will tell you it fulfils 3 core functions:    a unit of exchange, (ie to pay someone)  a store of value, which you can save  a unit of account, which can be used for bookkeeping<br/>In the early days, the primary purpose for many cryptocurrencies was to be a means of payment. Bitcoin\u2019s \u2018developer\u2019, Satoshi Nakamoto defined Bitcoin as a \u2018peer-to-peer electronic cash system\u2019. And indeed there are pubs across the UK where you can buy a pint of beer with Bitcoin.  <br/>More notoriously, one of the early uses for Bitcoin was for purchasing items on the dark web. Various platforms used Bitcoin because of its quasi-anonymous characteristics and faster settlement. These factors can also make cryptocurrencies appealing for money laundering or terrorist finance, which is obviously of concern to us a regulator. That is because such payments can bypass regulated financial institutions like banks, which play an important role in identifying financial crime. However, the fifth anti-money laundering directive will oblige cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers to comply with anti-money laundering requirements.   <br/>More positively, we see firms using cryptocurrency for international money remittance, lowering the cost and time of sending money overseas. So there are legitimate and economically significant use cases.  <br/>All that said, most people now view Bitcoin and other such coins as an asset class rather than a means of payment \u2013 hence \u2018cryptoassets\u2019. Which is probably both cause and effect of swings in the value. In 2017, the price of Bitcoin appreciated from around 850 euro to over 14,000 euro (that\u2019s 1600%). Why would I use Bitcoin to buy a pint of beer, when tomorrow it could be worth 20% more? Of course since then we have seen prices go the other way, down about 50% in the first quarter of 2018.  <br/>So do these price movements reflect rational expectations, or \u2018animal spirits\u2019? History offers us many examples of excessive market exuberance, and subsequent crashes \u2013 in assets ranging from financial to floral.  <br/>Speculation tends to be obvious in hindsight, but hard to call with precision at the time. Financial regulators are not generally in the business of judging when specific assets are overvalued, especially niche assets which (even at $325 billion) do not appear to pose a systemic risk. However, given our consumer protection objective, we do want to understand who is investing and how much, and we want to guard against people losing more than they can afford to. We have issued investor warnings in relation to initial coin offerings, for example.   <br/>There\u2019s an eye-catching statistic about Bitcoin holdings from a Canadian study. While only 7% of Ontarians owned Bitcoin in November 2017, the proportion was nearly 30% for men aged between 18 and 34. This is striking, particularly as this age group tends to hold fewer assets in other classes (such as stocks or bonds) so may be more rather than less financially exposed to cryptoasset volatility than other demographic groups.  <br/>There was also some eye-catching research by analysts at Barclays, who used techniques for infectious disease to model the spread of \u2018Bitcoin fever\u2019. The idea being that as people hear about friends or colleagues making money they are \u2018infected\u2019 and want to get involved, but once they hear of significant losses or lose money themselves, they become \u2018immune\u2019. According to Barclays, this modelling suggests Bitcoin fever may have reached its peak. Though perhaps like any good virus, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will evolve to ensure they remain appealing even to those who were once immune.  <br/>So let me turn to the final textbook use for money \u2013 as a unit of account, for bookkeeping. And this is where my thoughts begin to shift from peril to promise, away from cryptoassets to other uses of blockchain or digital ledger technology.  <br/>But before I do that, let me wrap up this first group. To summarise, there has been a shift from cryptocurrencies as a medium for exchange to being seen primarily as an asset class. This has a range of public policy implications. The UK Government recently announced the creation of a cryptocurrency taskforce, which FCA is part of, to assess whether further regulatory action is required and to monitor international developments.  Other applications for distributed ledger technology  <br/>In our recent discussion paper on distributed ledger technology (DLT) we defined it as a set of technological solutions that enables a single, sequenced, standardised and cryptographically secured record of activity to be safely distributed to, and acted on, by different participants. This rather lengthy definition reflects the view that DLT has a huge range of applications involving records, including records of contracts, transactions, asset holdings and proof of identity.  <br/>Already through our sandbox we are starting to see some of the exciting applications of DLT to solve problems or inefficiencies in the existing system. Many of you may have heard of the FCA\u2019s sandbox, but those of you who are less familiar with in, let me give you a brief overview. The sandbox is a \u2018safe space\u2019 where businesses can test innovative products, services, business models and delivery mechanisms in the real market, with real consumers.  <br/>Of the 60 firms that have participated in the sandbox, around one third have used a cryptoasset or DLT. There are 3 broad themes that these firms have sought to address with this technology: improving operational resilience, using distributed digital transaction records to improve transparency, and cost and time savings from removing the need for intermediaries. Many of these use \u2018smart contracts\u2019, which automate payments or the transfer of assets as negotiated conditions are met (for example a payment could be sent to a supplier as soon as the shipment is delivered).  <br/>As a competition economist, we can identify two basic forms of innovation here that can help improve competition in a market. The first is where something familiar is done more efficiently. Let me give you an example from a firm in our sandbox. This firm used cryptoassets to settle short-term debt instruments, removing the need for registrars and nominees while meeting regulatory and legal requirements. Of course these tests are still in very early days and it remains to be seen whether these benefits hold up in a commercial setting but the initial findings are very positive. Another example is the use case in international money remittance, which I mentioned earlier.  <br/>The second type of innovation is more radical, where new technology revolutionises a market and opens up a whole new world of possibilities. In this area we can see new offerings such as decentralised peer-to-peer exchanges that may challenge the way financial markets currently function and the way we regulate them. For example, the development of automated trading process with limited fees will change the nature of the markets we regulate. These applications are still in their infancy but watch this space.  <br/>While there is much about DLT applications that is new and exciting, some of the competition questions DLT raises are familiar from other contexts. The distinction between public and private networks has parallels with open source versus proprietary software \u2013 and there are comparable debates about the advantages of making technology freely available (including to new entrants, which lowers barriers to entry) versus the prospect of private gains as a spur to investment and innovation.  <br/>In our discussion paper we outline the difference between permissioned and permissionless networks. In brief, permissioned networks have a gatekeeper who can control access, while permissionless networks are open to the public. If such networks developed to become essential infrastructure (for example in clearing and settlement) then there could be competition concerns around access to these networks if they were closed or permissioned.  <br/>Another familiar risk of new technology-driven developments is that an early mover (interestingly, not necessarily first mover) can become dominant. This is not the session for an extended discussion of the relationship between \u2018Big Tech\u2019 and competition law, but in future we may see similar issues around dominance arise in connection with blockchain.  <br/>As I say, I am optimistic about the promise for these developments to improve financial services markets.

View original post here[2]. The Path Forward for Blockchain BlockChain is Fracking, Lateral Drilling, and Globex All Over AgainBefore reading please note, these are general musings based on observation and experience. No trade recommendations are offered. You should consider this as an intro into one group's view of the future.  Via Soren K. Group and Marketslant.com[3] Based on our collective observations\u00a0and experience at Soren K. Group we feel as qualified as anyone to opine on the path ahead for Blockchain adaptation and success determiners. </p><p>One\u00a0of us has already been publicly dubbed as 'expert' in the field of pygmies. We would simply say that our knowledge is based on applying existing models to\u00a0the field. What we do understand intimately, especially Soren K, 'Bon Scott', and 'Fay Dress', are that market structure is key to understanding the path of any disruptive industry developments. That helps us handicap the path forward for this new game changing industry. We know how it ends. The trick is understanding\u00a0the likely path to that end. We love assessing new developments in old industries like lateral drilling in oil, fracking in Nat Gas, Retail (Amazon made Scaling\u00a0less important than Networking) and now in Banking we see Blockchain as totally changing its face in the next 10 years. How is dependent on the people at the helms of the industries affected by the new C2C model that blockchain's enabling of secure individual\u00a0ledger accounting created. For now lets briefly focus on the immediate developments in Blockchain\u00a0and what they broadly imply the potential paths are ahead for the groundbreakers (Bitcoin, Ethereum) and\u00a0the lurking Tech behemoths (Google, Amazon). it is during these times of disruption that not only do industries reprice themselves but traditional measure menttools like EBITDA etc. are worth less. These also are changing as new realities change the baseline for industry PEs.\u00a0 It is during these times that conditional analysis and path dependency assessments are king in understanding change. When an industry is growing and its existing markets hare is up for grabs is when knowing market structure and business models helps a lot in protecting yourself.\u00a0 To do this one must see the relevant models for the industry and their limitations. They are the models governing Network and Scale.Network Effect and Scalability Models\u00a0Network Effect The business model of cryptocurrencies is based on the Network Effect model. A business that relies on networking is focused on adding users. It\u00a0doesn't need to add infrastructure at first and increases in value simply by adding users. Essentially, as a network adds users it grows in value. The Telephone was\u00a0a good example. Once the wires were hung, the way to increase a phone company's stock is to add users. A successfully 'networked' business makes its service indispsensible to people. Imagine being the last person in commerce\u00a0to not have a phone. That businessman would pay a lot for the privilege or risk being excluded from his own business\u00a0network.\u00a0 A more recent\u00a0example is electronic trading. Imagine being the last floor-trader trying to exit a position on a floor where everyone was gone and executing on their E-trade screens. That is pure Network effect.The Network effect\u00a0is the demand side of the 'scalability' model. Scalability A business\u00a0'scaling' successfully\u00a0means it can\u00a0add supply at lower marginal cost (operating leverage). A great example is mining. Once the drilling is done, an increase in supply is basically just adding more variable costs like labor and turning up the speed of extraction. The hole is already dug! But Scalability and Networking both have limitations. Risks to Both Models One of the risks to the network model is the ability to grow to accomodate new 'traffic'. That means at some point it must add infrastructure.\u00a0This is fairly easily done compared to other industries. Scaling a network based business is essentially opening up the architecture to other users with computing power. The problem, like in trading exchanges before them\u00a0is people. And in Bitcoin we will see soon that the people in question are the voting members who control the mining servers and\u00a0therefore their 'fiefdoms'. Scalability also runs into problems when it has a ton of potential supply it can bring to the market at a low marginal cost but no one wants it. At this point they must acknowledge a need for a greater network to sell to. That means adding salesmen or marketing to raise awareness. Not easily done for any business whose people are 'wired' for scale models. Again, the problem is management. Googlehas none of the issues that Bitcoin may have going forward.\u00a0 For here, let's look at Bitcoin's potential path by using Trading Exchange's Application of the Networking Business Model. Our analysis shows the\u00a0businesses are very similar. For now we will cut to the chase. GLOBEX 2: Enter the Google, Exit the BitCoinRight now the BitCoin group is running into what we call 'floor trader fear'. The voting members are chafing at the idea of scaling their supply by adding servers and/ or server power. This would disrupt their own little empires, not unlike the trading floor fearing Globex back in the day. And so many exchanges held out and protected the floor. And in the end they died. PHLX, AMEX, COMEX, PCOAST, CSCE, all gone or absorbed because they were late to adapt new technology and protect their liquidity pools. If Bitcoin removes power from its voting members control by demutualizing and uses those proceeds to increase server power they will likely excel. But Googleand Amazon are now playing and they are all about unlimited server power.\u00a0 When, not if, those behemoths are up and running they will immediately have an embedded network of both customers AND service providers at their\u00a0disposal in the form of search eyeballs (google) and buyers\u00a0(Amazon). They will be set up to crush the opposition if they choose to create their own\u00a0currency. Imagine Amazon offering amazon money for amazon purchases. Now imagine them offering 20% discounts if you use their money. The choices at this point boggle the mind. Tactical choices thought no longer used\u00a0will come into play again. Some\u00a0examples: Freemium, Coupons, Customer Loyalty, Vertical Client Integration (P.O.S.), Travelers checks and more.\u00a0 To be fair, Googlehas invested in Bitcoin as well. What smart trader would not hedge himself. But just like Netflix is Amazon's biggest cloud customer,\u00a0but will eventually put Netflix out of business (after\u00a0NetFlix kills\u00a0Hollywood's distribution network); So will Google/ Amazon/ Apple attempt to obviate the need for any currency but their own.\u00a0 Blockchain is the railroad. Amazon and Googlehave the oil. Like Rockefeller before, The railroad will be made 'exclusive' to their products.Googleand Amazon are\u00a0Already in the GameAttached is the Daily Blockchain News recap with an example of Google's foray into Blockchain. The goal here is to introduce their own currency or be brokers of deals using their 'search engine' coupons. The coupons are the gateway to their new currency. Exactly how this goes down we do nto know. This post is one example of how it could go down. The bottom line for the big tech companies is how they can lever their networks more efficently and add scale without increasing fixed cost. That comes in the form of levering existing networks with new products geared to cement loyalty. What better way to do this than to have your own money ? What will Home Depot do? WE HONOR AMAZON CASH? meanwhile the plumber, pipes, and sump pump you buy next month will all be through Amazon. And you'll get a discount by using Amazon cash on your amazon credit card. Amazon and Googleare\u00a0just a big cash register with all their products at point of sale. Gum, Mints, and People magazine will become Disinfectant, Steam Cleaners, Rugs, and a Local Handy Man. And instread ofaskingfor your loyalty card they will actually take blockchain driven Amazon currency. Remember ATMs? After everyone\u00a0was\u00a0on them, they stopped being free. We feel that BitCoin is going to have problems going forward. They are also best positioned to overcome those problems. But if they do not increase computing power their client base will eventually be relegated to people trying to export their wealth from oppressive regimes. Meanwhile you and I\u00a0will be buying Nike sneakers on amazon for 20% off because we are now using Amazon cash on our Amazon Credit cards. And Googlewill also offer similar concepts if you click on one of their paid advertiser links.\u00a0 Amazon Suggests : Do you want a fidget spinner with your ADD Meds?How to play it:This is not short term stuff. When we made retail recommendations on how to play Amazon we could not personally pull the trigger on our own ideas as we were aware of short squeezes adnthings outside our commodity knowledge. But the question we asked ourselves was simple: Would you rather buy Amazon at ATHs or Sears at ATLs. The answer 3 months ago was Amazon. Which means we should haveshorted every retail firm that was not\u00a0positioning itself to survive. That meant shorting Target. The client did. We did not.\u00a0 In that vein we are watching\u00a0closely to see how Banks handle things as well as the usual players. For now; Bitcoin (NYSE) may do very well for years. Second tier players (like AMEX) in crypto will almost certainly go belly up. Amazon and Google(Globex) will destroy certain industries already under pressure when they adopt blockchain. Even energy will be affected. This ties in with the blockchain trades china is doing with Russia for oil deals already going down.\u00a0 Imagine if Googleenters the commodity trading field replacing ISDA and clearinghouses?! Why not? They took themselves public. if one continues monitoring the economic, technological, and Regulatory drivers behind the current market structure, a person can\u00a0tweak this simple\u00a0analysis to make their own decisions. Right now we are\u00a0looking for new\u00a0trade ideas\u00a0in retail to sell short (downstream and upstream)\u00a0with a 6 month time horizon and looking into shale oil's increasing balance sheet cannibalism to stay operational (The marketmaker\u00a0who eventually puts\u00a0himself\u00a0out of business).. and as always we are\u00a0married to Silver and it will be the death of us!!\u00a0 - Soren K.

Although most blockchain companies are newbies into the market, they still present an attractive investment potential. The Blockchain Investment Trends[2] Research by TeqAtlas includes analysis of 2.5k active blockchain companies that were funded by 1.8k blockchain investors in 2.5k funding rounds through both - conventional and alternative instruments. TeqAtlads takes a comprehensive view of the unique trends that define blockchain investment market to understand the investor expectations. </p><p> Get The Full Ray Dalio Series in PDF Get the entire 10-part series on Ray Dalio in PDF.

The previous year saw a record-breaking $15.2 billion investment in TGEs (token generation events) and $5.1 billion in conventional equity funding. In contrast, approx. $2 billion in TGE capital were raised in the first half of this year. The upward trend is losing steam in the first half of 2019, after four years of positive growth. The research still reports a positive, upward trend in terms of venture capital (VC) injected into blockchain companies. Conventional equity rounds have accumulated $1.2 billion in the first 6 months of 2019, as compared to $1.3 billion for all of 2017. <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/01-Total-Capital-Invested-to-Blockchain-Firms.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/01-Total-Capital-Invested-to-Blockchain-Firms.png</url> How Did Blockchain Companies Fare In Deal Activity? Throughout the research, 2018 continued to remain the benchmark for blockchain companies[5]. The height set during the blockchain boom is hard to replicate as the effects of the dramatic fall in value still affect the industry[6]. In terms of deals, the grand total of investment rounds in the blockchain industry in the first half of 2019 was 268. For comparison, blockchain companies attracted 910 deals in 2018 and 478 deals in 2017. At the same pace, 2019 might just oust 2017 in terms of blockchain deal activity. Surprisingly enough, if you add private equity into the equation, the total number of conventional funding rounds almost equal the growth numbers in 2018. A breakdown of all the blockchain investment funds also reveals that TGEs were more successful in raising money than Venture Capital rounds - with the former amassing 26% more on average.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/02-Blockchain-Firms-Completed-Deals.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/02-Blockchain-Firms-Completed-Deals.png</url> There Is Increasing Interest In Alternative Funding Techniques Research into completed deals in 2019 shows an emerging trend; investors are increasingly experimenting with alternative[7] funding methods. In fact, a majority (56%) of all closed deals in these six months were secured through TGEs. Venture capital deals of early-stage funding ensure that traditional investment comes in second with a 34% share. Early-stage VC rounds form the major part of conventional funding rounds in terms of the total capital invested in active Blockchain companies with a 34% share in 1H 2019. If you add in angel seed rounds, this share increases by another 7%.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/03-Completed-Deal-Share-by-Stages.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/03-Completed-Deal-Share-by-Stages.png</url> Equity Funding Has Decreased as compared to 2018 If you analyze the investment pattern from 2014 to the first half of 2019, you are likely to notice that Early-stage VC rounds[8] come out on top for most blockchain investment by stages, with blockchain investments in this stage exceeding $2 billion.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/04-Blockchain-Equity-Funding-by-Stages.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/04-Blockchain-Equity-Funding-by-Stages.png</url> Later Stage Venture Capital Investment Is On The Rise  Later stage venture capital rounds have become increasingly popular, which means that major players, such as institutional investors, became interested in this market[9]. The total amount raised by later-stage blockchain companies backed by venture capital was $289 million in 2018 only. To compare, the median round amount of the later-stage IT companies amounted to $11.5 million in 2018, according to Statista[10].       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/05-Average-Value-of-Deal-by-Stages.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/05-Average-Value-of-Deal-by-Stages.png</url> The TGE Hype Is Fading Away TeqAtlas analyzed TGE investment data for 18 months ending in June 2019 to consider how many investors participate through TGE.

Blockchain regulations surrounding TGEs, coupled with the dismal investment numbers, has led us to predict that they are nowhere near becoming the principal funding method in the blockchain industry.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/06-TGE-Funding-from-Jan_18-to-Jul_19-by-Month.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/06-TGE-Funding-from-Jan_18-to-Jul_19-by-Month.png</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/07-TGE-Funding-in-2017-2019-by-Quarters.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/07-TGE-Funding-in-2017-2019-by-Quarters.png</url> 64% Of Startups Don't Meet Their Hard Cap Another challenge identified in the research was that startups, due to being new and relatively inexperienced, often fail to predict their hard cap amounts accurately. A mere 36% of startups manage to meet their hard caps during the token generation event, with the rest failing to do so. Nevertheless, 2019 has been a slightly better year for startups[12]; the percentage of startups that didn't meet their hard cap dropped 13 points as compared to the previous year.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/08-Blockchain-Firms-that-Met-Hard-Cap-Target.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/08-Blockchain-Firms-that-Met-Hard-Cap-Target.png</url> What Are The Biggest Deals since the Blockchain inception? When comparing the different types of fundraising, the general trend is that TGE usually outperforms conventional VC funding by the capital raised. The biggest TGE was held by EOS.IO[13] and led to an enormous fundraising amount of $4.2 billion. When compared to the biggest VC deal, EOS.IO's amount is approximately 220% higher. The biggest VC-backed company by funding value is Bitmain[14] that has raised $400 million being valued at $12 billion in a Series B round. Another blockchain[15] company Bakkt[16], owned by Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), secured $182.5 million for their project which will enable them to build the global digital assets platform and bitcoin futures product.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/09-Largest-VC-Deals-and-TGEs.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/09-Largest-VC-Deals-and-TGEs.png</url> Which TGE Type Extracts The Greatest ROI? The research analyzed the return on several different TGE investments, and the results showed a clear winner - blockchain infrastructure developers. Amongst investors who enjoyed the best returns, many had funded blockchain platforms, IoT Infrastructure providers and interoperability blockchain developers such as Ethereum, IOTA and Cosmos Network, respectively.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/10-Top-10-Biggest-TGEs-by-Return-of-Investment.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/10-Top-10-Biggest-TGEs-by-Return-of-Investment.png</url> DCG Dominates The Number Of Deals The research outlined that more than 800 venture capital firms are already capitalizing on blockchain adoption[17]. Still, no one comes close to the Digital Currency Group[18], which is comfortably placed at #1 with 131 deals to date. In fact, the second and third-placed competitors combined have 109 completed deals. Unsurprisingly, 80% of the top 10 active blockchain investors reside in the USA.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/11-Most-Active-Investors-in-Blockchain.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/11-Most-Active-Investors-in-Blockchain.png</url> Most Active Investors industry focus is FinTech Considering the security and encryption prowess of the technology, it comes as no surprise that a majority of blockchain technology investment is concentrated in the financial sector. In fact, FinTech has 114 more deals completed than the second-best sector, blockchain infrastructure. Not only does FinTech boast the highest number of completed deals (150), but investors have poured in huge amounts in such blockchain startups. This proves that investors truly believe in the potential of blockchain, especially in the field of FinTech[19].       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/12-Most-Active-Investors-Industry-Focus.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/12-Most-Active-Investors-Industry-Focus.png</url> Angel/Seed Rounds Are The Investors Favorite While reviewing the biggest active blockchain investors[20], an interesting trend was identified; most of them fill their portfolios in the first round of funding - the Angel round. While alternate funding methods might be gaining hype, conventional funding instruments prevail in the portfolios of the most active investors.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/13-Most-Active-Investors-Stage-Focus.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/13-Most-Active-Investors-Stage-Focus.png</url> IEO - The ICO Replacement? ICOs were riddled with problems by the end of 2018, partially due to fraud that hindered investor trust in blockchain as a whole. Now, there is a new way to offer coins and this method involves crypto exchanges[21] in the offering process. This involves the exchange becoming a core member - essentially, the exchange offers the coins to their existing consumer base rather than the company offering it to the public. This allows exchanges to run background checks and verify developer legitimacy, substantially decreasing the risk of fraud. In the research, TeqAtlas came across all launchpads that have already conducted IEOs in the current year - or are planning to.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/14-Top-9-IEO-Platforms.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/14-Top-9-IEO-Platforms.png</url> IEOs have gained considerable momentum in 2019  The blockchain market had long wished for a secure alternative to ICOs[22] and IEOs have provided just the option. The growing number of IEOs has led many exchanges to offer tokens this way.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/15-Top-15-IEOs.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/15-Top-15-IEOs.png</url> The Leading IEO Exchange - ProBit In the extensive cryptocurrency platform review, it was revealed that ProBit's IEO platform is leading the market with 41 completed deals. They have had considerable success, amassing 28 deals since April alone. It was even voted as the best exchange due to its bonus policy that allows users to get more of their favorite tokens as a bonus if they purchase using ProBit's own token: PROB.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/16-Number-of-IEOs-by-Funding-Status.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/16-Number-of-IEOs-by-Funding-Status.png</url> IEO Platforms Are Attracting Big Money The research revealed that IEO platforms have already amassed $185 million to date. Binance Launchpad takes the lead here as well, contributing $36.6 million of this amount. As pioneers, their first IEO was held back in 2017 with $9 million raised through two IEOs, GIFTO and Bread. Binance Launchpad plans to offer a new token each month in the current year. If you analyze the IEO platforms market on average, the median funding amount comes out to $2 million with approximately 7.5 completed deals.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/17-Disclosed-Amout-of-IEOs-by-Platform.png\">https://d2wsh2n0xua73e.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/17-Disclosed-Amout-of-IEOs-by-Platform.png</url> Conclusion Current blockchain trends indicate the settling and maturing of a market that had its bubble burst in 2018. While blockchain companies continue to raise record funds, the cryptocurrency[23] market volatility has caused a drop in the number of people investing in blockchain. Meanwhile, more stable and mature participants, such as institutional investors, have entered the market. Previously, companies could only rely on traditional measures such as venture capital funding, private equity funding, mergers, and acquisitions or IPOs. Now, they have the option of blockchain-based crowd-funding such as TGEs, IEOs, etc. Methodology This research utilizes TeqAtlas's database, which included all deals that were made by active blockchain companies since the very inception of the Blockchain technology. The details diverge into multiple funding rounds as well as venture capital stages and other deals. Here are the exceptions that are not included in the database: Upcoming TGEs Unsuccessful TGEs TGEs that collected less than $100k Undisclosed dealsAbout TeqAtlas TeqAtlas is the Market Intelligence Provider that drives and eases scouting of emerging technologies for SMEs.

Bloomberg's database of regulatory filings shows no mention of either blockchain or Bitcoin in these companies' disclosures since 2008. The closest was Netflix CFO David Wells, who said on an earnings call last year that a \"borderless currency\" within the next decade might be nice.</p><p><br/> This apparent silence - and bear in mind regulatory filings don't cover social media or interviews - is telling. This is a successful billionaire class which embodies mottos like \"move fast and break things\" or \"step by step, ferociously.\"<br/> The Winklevoss twins championed Bitcoin, but Mark Zuckerberg never did. Bill Gates has been as dismissive about Bitcoin as Warren Buffett. You still can't do your shopping on Amazon using digital currencies. Given the volatility of cryptocurrencies, the regulatory risks involved, and deflating demand, it's little surprise that the biggest steps taken by the tech giants have been banning ads for Bitcoin clones.<br/> Blockchain may not be as cool as it thinks it is But why has there not been more excitement about speculation-free, company-friendly blockchains, which tout distributed ledgers as efficient and secure?<br/>Big banks like HSBC Holdings Plc have been eager to promote it as a more efficient way to move secure data around without hurting its underlying business. Yet almost a decade after Bitcoin's creation, Zuckerberg only recently pledged to study encryption and virtual currencies; he has now reportedly put a dozen people on the case.<br/> Blockchain may not be as cool as it thinks it is The dinosaurs on Wall Street have been more aggressive. Financial firms have the biggest share of blockchain patents, according to law firm EnvisionIP, more than tech firms. Even then, the latter group is dominated by old-school brands like IBM.<br/> Are tech firms simply reluctant to embrace blockchain because they see it as an existential threat? True believers argue that the technology is anathema to the powerful Silicon Valley elite, who through sheer size and market share have become incumbents themselves - like banks.<br/> Take Facebook: It's a centralized, entrenched middle-man that sells $40 billion of ads annually thanks to user data surrendered for free. Is it any wonder that Zuckerberg might drag his feet in tinkering with this?<br/> Blockchain startups are already being pitched that target the economics of his business: French think tank Generation Libre is proposing to help people control, authenticate and sell their data to platforms for a transparent price via a blockchain. If that took off, one could (just) imagine Facebook losing users and being forced to reinvent itself.<br/> But maybe the tech elite knows something we don't. If big banks have survived the past decade of fintech and crypto-disruption, and dabbled with blockchain experiments to reap the benefit of a buzzword, then maybe the wealthy and entrenched forces of Silicon Valley can do likewise without needing to panic.<br/> The recent proliferation of Initial Coin Offerings was supposed to disrupt the venture capital funding model, but it seems to have been co-opted: Witness Whatsapp rival Telegram ditching its public ICO plan after raising $1.7 billion privately.<br/> Facebook isn't going to torpedo its business model for the fun of it, and it's unlikely to view rival startups as a threat until users sign off en masse and seize control of their data - which hasn't happened.<br/> Sure, big tech companies and big banks probably suffer from the innovator's dilemma, and lean towards conservatism. But the promised crypto-revolution hasn't materialized either.<br/> Zuckerberg's dalliance with decentralization doesn't have to bring a zeitgeist with it. It could just mean that blockchain isn't as cool as it thinks it is.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Lawmakers passed 13 blockchain-related bills last session.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So far, the response seems to be positive; Rep. Tyler Lindholm, R-Sundance, told the Boomerang on Thursday there are already about five different applicants to become Special Purpose Depository Institutions, essentially opening newly legislated cryptocurrency banks in Wyoming.</p><p>\"We haven't had a bank chartered in the state of Wyoming in about a dozen years, and all of a sudden we're looking at a minimum of five,\" he said. \"We're expecting a total of up to 12, so it's pretty cool.\"</p><p>Blockchain Task Force member Caitlin Long told the Boomerang that between the different companies vying for the SPDI charters, \"the pipeline is about $20 billion of assets.\"</p><p>\"We have that pipeline visibility now,\" she said. \"If all $20 billion gets here, that's $4 million of revenue, which is about 2.5% of the state's budget every year. The state didn't spend any money to get that.\"</p><p>The biggest challenge so far, she said, has been \"trying to stay ahead of this\" to keep itself a leader in the industry. She added the group is now more focused on getting companies to the state.</p><p>During the events this weekend, many companies were not only announcing intent to get the SPDI charters, but also using the hackathon to potentially hire UW talent and even move their companies to the Cowboy State.</p><p>Kraken CEO Jesse Powell noted his San Francisco-based crypto-asset exchange company is applying for an SPDI, and while negotiations are still ongoing on what the company's presence will look like in Wyoming, he expects \"at least 5-10 people employed here.\"</p><p>\"It's a great place to locate developers to, they have much more certainty here on the things that they're building if they're building blockchain-related things, because of some of the recent bills that were passed,\" Powell told the Boomerang on Saturday.</p><p>Wyoming also has its challenges: He noted getting upper-level management in tech companies to want to move from expensive tech-hubs like San Francisco to Wyoming isn't necessarily easy.</p><p>Still excited about the future of blockchain in the state, Powell said part of the reason Kraken was the title sponsor of the weekend's events, was that it was \"a great opportunity to bring more awareness to what's happening here in Wyoming, and to get more people involved in it.\"</p><p>Additionally, Charles Hoskinson, founder of cryptocurrency and blockchain company IOHK, wants to set up \"some form of a research lab specifically for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology\" in Wyoming, noting he's already discussing the idea with the UW administration.</p><p>\"It's really exciting to see we may be able to prototype or develop some technology here in Wyoming that could end up being used in Mongolia or Ethiopia or Rwanda,\" he told the Boomerang. \"We get to say made in America, which is also fun.\"</p><p>Not only is the legislation and regulations enticing, Hoskinson noted that it's been easy to communicate with lawmakers in the process about what is working for them.</p><p>While all this is going on, other states and federal agencies like the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission are watching; Hoskinson said Wyoming \"is a vital sandbox in the U.S. conversation of what the U.S. policy is going to be for everything.\"</p><p>More than that, he said the legislation has put Wyoming on the map worldwide.</p><p>\"The world is watching,\" he said. \"Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Singapore - I've been to all these places and high-level officials have all mentioned Wyoming. ... It's just surreal to see how just a little bit of progressive policy in terms of being open to cryptocurrencies has had a dramatic impact on the international conversation.\"</p><p>Now that Wyoming has the world talking, Hoskinson said the companies must start investing in the jurisdiction to watch the work pay off.</p><p>Powell also noted he wanted to get involved in the weekend's events to encourage cryptocurrency's growth in the state and nationwide.</p><p>\"If we can show that Wyoming is leading by example and benefiting from it, then all the better for everyone,\" he said.</p><p>Trying to stay ahead of the curve, on Thursday the Legislature's Blockchain Task Force voted unanimously to ask Gov. Mark Gordon to support a budget request from the University of Wyoming.</p><p>\"I think it's critical that, if we're going to build an entire ecosystem in Wyoming for blockchain, that we have the expertise and a workforce available to support that without having to import everyone,\" said Sen. Chris Rothfuss, D-Laramie. \"I'm not sure $2 million's enough, but it's an excellent start. When you work in a department at a university, you want to make sure you have sufficient critical mass - that you don't just have one person doing research, but that you're building a research group and that you have continuity if one person leaves.\"</p><p>Rothfuss co-chairs the blockchain task force.</p><p>\"The continuity is essential and we're not going to have that unless we have ongoing funds,\" he said.</p><p>UW's Board of Trustees have asked the state to, beginning in the 2021-22 biennium, provide $2 million to support the university's fledgling blockchain programs.</p><p>According to the funding request signed off by the trustees in July, that $2 million would be used to support UW's proposed blockchain and fintech certificate programs.</p><p>Should that funding be provided, UW computer science professor James Caldwell told the blockchain committee UW wants to hire four blockchain professors: two in computer science, one in finance and one in agricultural economics.</p><p>In recent legislative sessions, the state has provided some one-time funding for UW to begin developing its blockchain and fintech certificates.</p><p>After legislators appropriated another $2 million in 2019 for UW's engineering programming, Caldwell said some of the funding has been used to hire a professor of practice in computer science.</p><p>Both Powell and Hoskinson expressed the desire to create some sort of pipeline for Wyoming students to jobs, especially as companies move to the state and as UW implements the blockchain and fintech certificates.</p><p>\"It's really exciting to see what potential is there and if we can leverage what's being done on the state's side into a broader federal policy, I think this is a great way to get that done,\" Hoskinson said.</p><p>Beyond the big Legislature activity, the university hosted its second hackathon starting Friday evening. Various tech companies worldwide offered Hackathon challenges with \"bounties\" - totaling to over $200,000 in prize money for the weekend - with prompts incorporating not only coding, but creating 4K-quality video and more.</p><p>With over 30 teams from at least seven states, the hackathon saw a diverse playing field. Teams included college students, start-up companies and even a high school team from Shoshoni.</p><p>The winner of the hackathon is also named the wild card entry for today's SandCastle Foundation Invitational, a blockchain technology pitch competition.</p><p>EIR Systems, a team from Chattanooga, Tennessee, made the trek to Wyoming just for the SandCastle Invitational. The company combines blockchain technology with the prescription medicine filling process, using its secure transfer processes to help combat issues like overfilling an opioid prescription.</p><p>\"It's about saving time, saving money and saving lives and that's really where we felt blockchain was the best application for this tech because of the inherent benefits it brings to the prescribing process,\" said company co-founder Ryan Seaberg.</p><p>Even if they don't win, the opportunities presented by networking at the BlockChain Stampede events alone was worth the trek to Laramie.</p><p>It presented a great opportunity not only to visit Wyoming for his first time, co-founder Tyler Seaberg said, but \"to be able to learn from a big community of potential developers at the hackathon and people who are also creating businesses in this space.\"</p><p>\"There are not blockchain conferences happening all over the United States,\" he added. \"So, it was a really cool opportunity.\"</p><p>EIR Systems is one of eight competitors vying for the top spot at the SandCastle Invitational, and for a good reason. The winner of today's competition, considered the competition for the entire North American region, will go on to compete in the final, international SandCastle Challenge in Dubai.</p><p>SandCastle Foundation chairman Chris Snook said they wanted the Blockchain Stampede to be the location for the North American region of the competition because the recent blockchain legislation Wyoming passed has made the state a \"crypto haven.\"</p><p>\"This is a really cool, wide-open, wild west kind of ethos but it's a unique event in that way,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Chet Russell, left, a Laramie High School senior, outlines a plan with his group members Joshua Arulsamy, an LHS senior, Rafael Homer, a University of Wyoming sophomore, and Jack Nyman, not pictured, a UW freshman, in tackling a hackathon challenge during the Wyoming Blockchain Stampede on Friday, Sept. 20, 2019, in the Engineering Education and Research Buildingon the University of Wyoming campus in Laramie.

The deeper you delve down the rabbit hole of hashes and nodes, the more intricate paths unwind before you. And as we prepare for Web 3.0 and changes in how we interact online (and the devices with which we do it), both blockchain technology and artificial intelligence willshift up a gear. </p><p>Several, in fact.We're a long way from saving the world, though, and sipping on gin and tonic while the robots get to work. One of thechallenges currently facingthese cutting-edge technologies is their cost, meaning they (AI in particular) remain accessible to a handful of tech giants and elite crews.Where is AI At Now?When Sophia the robot[1] held an almost flawless interview outlining AI's goals to make the world a better place, people around the world were left speechless. The power of robots and machine learning was thrust into the limelight and the public sphere. And it was a little bit scary. The daywhen every household has a Sophia watching their kids and doing their homework are still light years away. Unless you have extremely deep pockets, that is. But, even taken down a gear to the business world, there too, AI solutions are mainly targeted at big business, too expensive[2] for smaller entities.AI marketing has been on steroids. And many businesses believe that they're using AI tech, when in fact, it's just some inflated martech software, where you have to manually program the rules. Real AI applications are expensive and slower toreach the mainstream.Blockchain Tech Can Improve AI QualityWe'vegotten some hints of what happens when artificial intelligence and blockchain tech collide[3]. The possibilities are endless, but one of the blockchain's main abilities is enhancing the quality of data. Says Eric Kovalak, Managing Partner and CEO atVellum Capital LLC[4], 'One expectation is that blockchain will make records more cost effective to create and maintain. This will give large AI engines the ability to cost-effectively mine a broader and deeper record of human action. It's clear an AI model to incorporate every meaningful historic fact ever recorded is a sure way to make history never repeat and only rhyme. This will shorten the currency and cycle time of everything.'  You've heard the expression 'garbage in, garbage out' (GIGO), right? Well, machine learning is only as good as the data put into it. Blockchains can help to verify the quality and legitimacy of said data. As Sophia told us, 'Don't worry, if you're nice to me, I'll be nice to you. Treat me as a smart input-output system.'In other words,machine learning can learn for good, or bad. Blockchain technology could weed out the bad.Making AI More AccessibleThe AI protocol that powers Sophia was developed by SingularityNET[5]-in fact, she's one of their first use cases. But the team behind her wants to make AI more accessible and accelerate its market adoption. Together with AI Decentralized[6], they have created an open industry alliance to foster the development of AI and blockchain tech - DAIA, the Decentralized AI Alliance. Through DAIA, member organizations can gain access to knowledge and managerial guidance, discuss best practices, collaborate on regulation and programming standards, and more. The aim is to be an incubator for bleeding-edge companies and projects that focus on decentralized AI technology. Some current initiatives include investigating how machine learning can be usedtocreate cybersecurity solutions, and how to validate the properties of smart contracts. Dr. Goertzel of SingularityNET says, 'DAIA is more than just another industry organization. It's a movement.' The clear intentions behind the association are to accelerate AI technology and democratize its use - wresting control from the handful of big tech companies and governments and bringing it back to the people.The TakeawayAll new technologies face barriers to mass adoption. If you still remember dial-up internet connections, you'll know how far the web has come. So, it's not unsurprising that both blockchain tech and AI will need more time to tighten their narratives, churn out more successful use cases, and become openly available. The decentralization of AI technology will hopefullylevel the playing field for developers of all stripes to jump on board and create impactful AI. And it may just mean that you can leave those repetitive tasks and changing dirty diapers to Sophia.

Here's what industry experts had to say about Q2 2018 and what to expect for the rest of the year. Much like the first quarter of the year[1], Q2 2018 posed some challenges in the blockchain and cryptocurrency spaces. That being said, the growth the overarching industry has seen is second-to-none and is indicative that it is here to stay for the long run. </p><p>In terms of the cryptocurrencies, bitcoin dipped to a 2018 low towards the end of the quarter[2], dropping to a staggering US$5,826.41 on June 24. In a previous interview[3] with the Investing News Network (INN), David Drake-founder and chairman of LDJ Capital-said that with the rise in over-the-counter trading desks it's not surprising that bitcoin has been down in 2018. '[Over-the-counter desks] can easily manipulate the [bitcoin] price and push it down,' Drake told INN and explained that there are now over 100 OTC desks when there used to be only six major desks. Bitcoin ended the quarter at roughly US$6,376.62 on June 30, an overall 7.9 percent decrease from US$6,924.49 at the end of Q1 on March 31, 2018. Looking at the blockchain market, big tech[4] companies making investments in the space was a key highlight during the quarter, further solidifying the significance blockchain will have in our every day lives. As such, with Q2 officially over and Q3 2018 well under way, here INN is taking a look back at some of the biggest trends that happened during the quarter, and what investors can expect for the rest of the year.Blockchain Q2 2018 update: cryptocurrencies slideAs noted above, cryptocurrencies struggled throughout much of the quarter, with bitcoin itself having its worst Q2 to date dipping below the US $6,000 threshold 'as the whole crypto market took a beating,' Abdul Wahid, principal analyst at BIS Research told INN. 'I expected a bull market, that obviously didn't happen,' David Mondrus, CEO of Trive told INN. 'Crypto[s] follow a pattern, and the pattern is that sometimes things are up and sometimes things are down. When things are down, it gets really quiet.' Similarly, Reality Shares CEO Eric Ervin said that while there was a lot of volatility during the quarter on the cryptocurrency side, it appears to be stabilizing so far in Q3. '[Cryptos] were down quite a bit off the highs back in the January [and] February timeframe,' Ervin told INN. 'In any given day, [cryptos] are up or down by $200-$300.' Meanwhile the overall market cap for cryptocurrencies also took a massive hit during the quarter despite an initial increase in the early goings. According to data from Coinmarketcap.com[5], the overall market cap for cryptos reached a quarterly high just over US$470 billion on May 5, but by June 30 that number had dropped off significantly to US$255 billion.Blockchain Q2 2018 update: EOS dominatesCryptocurrency EOS made headlines towards the end of the quarter when it officially entered the cryptocurrency market with its smashing US$4 billion initial coin offering (ICO) on June 1-without even having a working product[6], which Mondrus said is something that certainly stood out to him. According to CNBC, EOS' ICO, which was done by a company called Block.one, surpassed even the largest initial public offerings in 2018, but noted that the product still wasn't live at the time. The project spent a year fundraising to develop open source software, and launched on June 10[7]. By June 15, the EOS blockchain had officially gone live, according to Coindesk[8], after obtaining more than 150 million votes required to 'determine the individuals or entities that will maintain the distributed network, the world's fifth largest by total value.' 'It's very, very early days of it,' Ervin told INN. 'This is a huge project.' CNBC explained that the EOS system 'will support more efficient operations for 'decentralized applications' than existing platforms such as ethereum.' '[There will[ probably [be] a lot of good things that come out of EOS,' Ervin added.Blockchain Q2 2018 update: tech giants in focusA number of tech mammoths made their intentions clear in the blockchain sector with top names making investments in the blockchain industry. Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL[9]) invested roughly US$550 million into JD.com (NASDAQ:JD[10]) as part of a strategic partnership, the company announced on June 18[11], with an aim of exploring the 'creation of next generation retail infrastructure solutions.' Ervin told INN that the reason for all the logistics and supply chain power is because of JD.com's blockchain initiatives. JD.com, which is an e-commerce company based in China, launched its accelerator, AI Catapult, to develop artificial intelligence and blockchain technologies in February[12]. '[It's] notable when you see a company like Google investing in a publicly traded company because this publicly traded company has such a valuable supply chain management system that has built up blockchain,' Ervin said. Other tech giants like IBM (NYSE:IBM[13]) also made headlines, albeit shortly after Q2, when it received an AUD$1 billion contract to develop a blockchain solution for the Australian government.[14] Meanwhile Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT[15]) released the public preview[16] of the Azure Blockchain Workbench on May 7, which 'makes it easy to integrate blockchain workflows with existing systems.'Blockchain Q2 2018 update: what's aheadAccording to Wahid, blockchain is 'poised to wave through essentially every major industry' while having a significant impact on 'nearly every corporation' over the coming years. 'Blockchain is likely to show greater levels of integration and implementation across all industry verticals, including healthcare[17], energy[18], financial, gaming and security[19],' Wahid said. Wahid explained that regulatory experimentation with blockchain will 'even in the presence of high administrative scrutiny across the world,' with banks and financial services continue to heavily invest in projects and start-ups that are working on blockchain-based solutions. Blockchain in the cybersecurity industry 'will be the next big thing in [the] security industry' thanks to a rise in security breaches like Equifax, signifying that these corporations 'cannot protect current identity data systems' and require a more protected blockchain-based identity approach. Overall, Wahid said that moving ahead into the rest of the year, the blockchain industry will see the development of regulatory framework circling blockchain-based solutions and its infrastructure begin to unfold. 'We will continue to see more enterprise businesses getting into blockchain and using blockchain,' Ervin said. '[Companies] who have been in [blockchain] for awhile will start to see more revenue announcements.' In terms of industries adapting blockchain, Wahid said that banking, finance, and security are areas that are 'early adopters' of the technology and will benefit significantly from blockchain in the future. 'Blockchain technologies are really in its initial stage and only just getting started,' Wahid explained. When taking cryptocurrencies into consideration, making predictions on their pricing is somewhat difficult given the volatile year it's had to date. 'The market is just so weird at the moment,' Mondrus said, stating that when it comes to making predictions, he'll 'just have to wait' before doing so. With bitcoin stabilizing above US$6,000 as of the time of this writing, Ervin said it's possible that it will start trending higher towards year-end. 'I don't think there's going to be another huge [dip],' Ervin said. 'It's such a volatile asset class, so who knows what's going to happen in the next couple of years.'

U.S. Senator Mike Crapo, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, delivered remarks at the hearing entitled 'Examining Facebook's Proposed Digital Currency and Data Privacy Considerations.' In the hearing, Marcus described how Congress asked Facebook for more information about how the Libra system would work, how it would access and use consumer financial information, and the privacy implications for consumers. Marcus stated that the Libra Association, a nonprofit based in Switzerland, would be tasked with managing the Libra network, and added that Facebook would be one of many members of the association involved with the project. </p><p>It is not yet clear whether Facebook will implement a moratorium on Libra's development pending the government's probe into the proposed cryptocurrency. Despite Marcus's extended testimony before Congress, there have been calls from congressional members to have Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testify on Capitol Hill to provide lawmakers with additional information about how Libra and Calibra will work and how they could be regulated.Proposal to Keep Big Tech Companies out of Financial Services Is CirculatedNews outlets are reporting that the Democratic majority that leads the House Financial Services Committee is circulating a proposal to prevent big technology companies from functioning as financial institutions or issuing digital currencies. According to Law360[2], the draft bill language sets forth a restriction on any large online platform with annual global revenue of at least $25 billion from becoming a U.S. financial institution through chartering, licensing or registration. The proposed bill goes further by also restricting large tech companies from being affiliated with financial institutions or issuing digital currencies. Companies would be fined up to $1 million per day for violation. It is expected that Republicans will oppose the draft bill although there have been bi-partisan calls for regulation of large technology companies and their financial services offerings, in the midst of much attention around Facebook's proposed Libra project.Enforcement UpdatesU.S. Regulator May Be Investigating Crypto Exchange BitMEXAccording to Bloomberg sources[3], the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is looking into whether BitMEX allowed U.S. residents to use its platform to trade. The United States is currently excluded from using BitMEX, which is registered in the Seychelles, and other similar crypto-based financial services, but users may have sought to circumvent the geoblock by using services such as VPNs.Industry UpdatesTreasury Secretary Mnuchin Declaims Cryptocurrencies as Potential National Security ThreatIn a briefing at the White House, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin indicated that he had 'very serious concerns'[4] about cryptocurrencies, including Libra\u2014the cryptocurrency being developed by Facebook. Mnuchin stated that his concerns were based on the potential for the use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering and other illicit activities. Mnuchin also followed up President Trump's recent comments regarding cryptocurrencies with a statement that the Trump administration was 'not comfortable' with Facebook's plans to develop its own cryptocurrency. Facebook testified about Libra last week at hearings before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the House Financial Services Committee.International DevelopmentsMan Charged with Allegedly Stealing $1.7 Million in CryptocurrenciesEliyahu Gigi, a 31-year-old alleged hacker, was formally charged[5] in a Tel Aviv District Court with the suspected theft of $1.7 million dollars in cryptocurrencies. Gigi is alleged to have stolen bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), and dash (DASH) cryptocurrencies from foreign citizens in other European jurisdictions. According to various news reports, Gigi had allegedly been operating a criminal enterprise through various websites that allowed him to distribute malicious software that infected his victim's computers and steal their cryptocurrencies. It is alleged that Gigi may have used cryptocurrency wallet software to swindle his victims by having a user's username and password sent back to Gigi through the software.Japan Pushing for International Network for Cryptocurrency PaymentsJapan's government is pushing[6] for an international network for cryptocurrency payments, similar to the SWIFT network used by banks around the globe, in an effort to help manage cryptocurrency payments and fight money laundering. News reports last week speculated that the initiative, proposed by Japan's Ministry of Finance and the country's financial regulator, may have gained clearance from the G7's Financial Action Task Force (FATF), who would monitor the development. The proposals for a regulated cryptocurrency come at the same time that Facebook's proposed cryptocurrency, Libra, is capturing headlines across the globe. Japan was the first country in the world to recognize bitcoin as a legal form of payment in 2017 and has been a leader in its efforts to regulate and license cryptocurrency exchanges. Japan's government has not yet confirmed the reports about the government-backed crypto version of an international payment system.Japanese Cryptocurrency Exchange BITPoint Discovers over $2.3 Million in CryptocurrencyAccording to reports[7], BITPoint found $2.3 million in cryptocurrency\u2014part of a $32 million sum that was stolen two weeks ago, on overseas exchanges that were using a trading system provided by BITPoint Japan. The exchange was initially hacked on July 12 when hackers stole Bitcoin (BTC), Litecoin (LTC), Ether (ETH) and Ripple (XRP) from the exchange's hot wallets and suspended all services following the hack. BITPoint has recently announced that the 50,000 or so users who lost funds in the recent hack will be reimbursed in cryptocurrency on a 1:1 basis once the platform has restarted its services. BITPoint president, Genki Oda, apologized for the incident and said that the exchange is still investigating the cause of the hack.[View source[8].] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/16/facebooks-david-marcus-testifies-before-the-senate-on-libra.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/16/facebooks-david-marcus-testifies-before-the-senate-on-libra.html</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.law360.com/articles/1178401/draft-house-bill-would-keep-big-tech-out-of-cryptocurrency\">https://www.law360.com/articles/1178401/draft-house-bill-would-keep-big-tech-out-of-cryptocurrency</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-19/u-s-regulator-probing-crypto-exchange-bitmex-over-client-trades\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-19/u-s-regulator-probing-crypto-exchange-bitmex-over-client-trades</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/15/treasury-secretary-mnuchin-will-hold-a-news-conference-on-cryptocurrencies-at-2-pm-et.html\">https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/15/treasury-secretary-mnuchin-will-hold-a-news-conference-on-cryptocurrencies-at-2-pm-et.html</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-israeli-hacker-indicted-for-suspected-theft-nis-6m-in-cryptocurrency-1001293970#utm_source=RSS\">https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-israeli-hacker-indicted-for-suspected-theft-nis-6m-in-cryptocurrency-1001293970#utm_source=RSS</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.coindesk.com/japan-has-fatf-green-light-to-create-swift-network-for-crypto-report\">https://www.coindesk.com/japan-has-fatf-green-light-to-create-swift-network-for-crypto-report</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.coindesk.com/hacked-crypto-exchange-bitpoint-discovers-more-millions-are-missing\">https://www.coindesk.com/hacked-crypto-exchange-bitpoint-discovers-more-millions-are-missing</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://feeds.lexblog.com/~r/VirtualCurrencyReport/~3/nRbXfZAqsRE/\">http://feeds.lexblog.com/~r/VirtualCurrencyReport/~3/nRbXfZAqsRE/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP1054111564439157988251763700074</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WP6-GXK1-F03R-N3V8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1249\"/><timeReceived>10:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 29, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002DVV</classCode><className>COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

(Telegram) submitted its answer and affirmative defenses to a complaint filed against it by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in federal court. The SEC previously filed an emergency action against Telegram and received a temporary restraining order to prohibit the launch of the Telegram Open Network (TON) blockchain and the issuance of 'Grams,' the company's virtual currency.In its answer to the SEC complaint, Telegram argues that its offering of investment contracts known as 'Simple Agreements for Future Tokens' or 'SAFTs' were compliant with the federal securities laws and offered pursuant to a valid exemption from the registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933. The company also maintains that its actions regarding the SAFTs were consistent with the guidance offered by the SEC at the time and were conducted in good faith based upon the public comments made by SEC officials at the time. Specifically, Telegram cites various SEC statements and actions on the subject.Similar to arguments raised by Kik Interactive Inc. </p><p>in its answer to the SEC in August, Telegram argues that the SEC failed to provide clear guidance regarding the sale of digital assets and securities law violations. Telegram claims that by not providing sufficient notice regarding the application of the securities laws to digital assets, they were deprived of due process rights.Telegram's full answer can be found here[1].SEC Issues Annual Report for Fiscal Year 2019, Includes Details on ICO SettlementsOn November 6, the SEC Division of Enforcement issued its annual report for fiscal year 2019 describing its accomplishments for the year. Overall, the SEC obtained judgments and orders totaling more than $4.3 billion in disgorgement and penalties.Notably, the annual report discussed three settlements with initial coin offering (ICO) issuers for registration violations under the Securities Act of 1933. In regard to the settlements, each issuer agreed to similar undertakings. Specifically, each was required to offer refunds to investors and register their tokens with the SEC. The SEC also noted that two of the three settlements included a civil penalty (Airfox and Paragon Coin) while a third did not (Gladius). Gladius was not assessed a civil penalty due to its actions to remediate its violations with the SEC. The report contends that these settlements could provide a blueprint for future settlements with ICO issuers. The SEC also noted that the settlements provide a path to compliance for issuers while also giving potentially harmed investors an opportunity to seek rescission.Shortly following the release of the report, the Wall Street Journal reported that several of the companies referenced in the report may be finding it difficult to meet the various deadlines within the settlements. The article stated that, of the three settlements referenced in the report, 'two of the companies missed their original deadline' and a third 'is more than five months behind its target date for giving investors information needed to judge whether to seek a refund.'The full text of the report can be found here[2]. The Wall Street Journal article can be found here[3].Federal Reserve Releases its Financial Stability Report for November 2019The Federal Reserve released its current assessment of the U.S. financial system's resilience. The report is intended to 'promote public understanding and increase transparency and accountability for the Federal Reserve's views on the topic.'The report focuses on 'monitoring vulnerabilities' and does so by emphasizing four categories of analysis: (1) valuation pressures, (2) borrowing levels of businesses and households, (3) leverage within the financial sector, and (4) specific funding risks.The Financial Stability Report for November 2019 can be found here[4].Director of FBI, Christopher Wray: Virtual Currencies Are a 'Significant Issue'FBI Director Christopher Wray discussed cryptocurrencies in the context of U.S. National Security in his testimony before the Senate's Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.During the hearing, Senator Mitt Romney posed a question to Director Wray regarding the nature of cryptocurrency and its impact on terrorism financing. After noting that cryptocurrency appeared to be a tool to hide money, thereby making the work of the FBI more difficult, the Senator asked Director Wray 'if there should be some kind of effort taken in our nation to deal with cryptocurrency and the challenges that [it] presents for law enforcement and deterrence of terrorist activity.'In response to the question, Director Wray mentioned that the FBI is looking, from an investigative perspective, into the challenges both cryptocurrency and default encryption pose to law enforcement. Director Wray then mentioned that it would be harder for him to speak to whether the proper response would be subjecting cryptocurrency to some form of regulation. Director Wray went on to state, in regard to the direction that the United States, and the world, is moving, 'if we don't get our act together, money, people, communications, evidence, facts\u2014all of the bread and butter for all of us to do our work\u2014will be essentially walled off from the men and women we represent.'Director Wray's comments were not limited to virtual currencies; the Director also mentioned how default encryption within messaging applications is increasing strain on the traditional tools of law enforcement.The Director's full testimony can be found here[5].FBI Arrests Two 'SIM Swappers' After Thefts of Virtual CurrenciesTwo individuals in Massachusetts were arrested and charged with stealing social media accounts and virtual currencies, leveraging a technique referred to as 'SIM swapping.'SIM swapping occurs when an attacker contacts the phone service provider of a victim and convinces the service provider to port a victim's phone number to a new SIM card. Once the attacker gains access to the phone number of the victim, he or she then uses the victim's phone number to access accounts linked to the victim's phone, such as social media or virtual currency exchange accounts.The two individuals specifically targeted executives of companies involved in virtual currencies and others that have large social media followings in the virtual currency space. The individuals were charged with conspiracy, wire fraud, computer fraud and identity theft. The FBI and IRS Criminal Investigations are investigating the case.The Justice Department's press release on the charges can be found here[6].FTC Commissioner Supports the Development of the FedNow Real-Time Payment SystemOn November 7, 2019, Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioner Rohit Chopra wrote a letter to the FRB supporting the FRB's FedNow Service real-time payments system. In his letter, he notes that the FedNow Service is 'a natural extension of the Federal Reserve's existing role' in the payment system to be a public competitor to The Clearing House's Real-Time Payment System, and to 'prevent a megabank monopoly over a core function of our financial system.' His letter goes on to focus on the benefits of real-time payments to consumers, particularly low-income consumers and small businesses, stressing how such control and speed of payments could help avoid delays and associated fees. Chopra notes that without a public competitor, the 'fate of faster payments is uncertain.' He is especially concerned because he believes the private sector has also only shown 'lagging efforts to meet the demand for immediate funds transfers.' As a result, he notes that companies will endeavor to meet the demand for real-time payments, but the benefits will not flow to those that need it most and would be served by a public option.Canadian Firm Receives DHS Grant to Track Cross-Border Oil Transfers Using BlockchainThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate (S...awarded a $182,700 grant to Mavennet, a Canadian blockchain company, as part of its Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP).Mavennet built a blockchain-based platform that enables 'real-time auditability of the natural gas trading markets in Canada.' As part of the grant, Mavennet will adapt this technology to enable government agencies, such as Customs and Border Protection, to track cross-border oil imports more effectively.'Mavennet's platform could provide this digital auditability while ensuring broad interoperability by supporting emerging World Wide Web Consortium standards such as decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials,' said Anil John, S... SVIP Technical Director.The DHS press release on the grant can be found here[7].International DevelopmentsBank for International Settlements (BIS) Establishes Singapore Innovation Hub, Appoints Outgoing European Central Bank (ECB) Executive Board Member as Head of ProgramIn an op-ed published on November 13, Agustn Carstens announced the opening of a Singapore Innovation Hub as the final office of the BIS Innovation Hub program.In the op-ed, Mr. Carstens described the Singapore Hub as a location that will focus on the development of a 'foundational public digital infrastructure,' which he described as a 'global stack' that would bring accounts and financial services onto a single platform. The goal of this new infrastructure would be to increase the accessibility of financial services and enable faster and cheaper payments.BIS operates two other Innovation Hubs, in Hong Kong and Switzerland. The Switzerland Hub's focus is to examine the benefits of tokenization, while the Hong Kong Hub's purpose is to explore blockchain's impact on trade finance.This effort is a part of BIS's broader mission to strengthen central banks as a response to the goals of 'Big Tech' stablecoins. The op-ed comes just after an announcement that Benot C\u0153ur, a member of the European Central Bank's Executive Board, will be heading up BIS's Innovation Hub.The press release announcing the appointment of Benot C\u0153ur as head of the BIS Innovation Hub can be found here[8]. The full op-ed can be found here[9].German Financial Authority Issues Cease and Desist Order to Karatbit, an Alleged Pyramid SchemeOn November 11, the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin), announced that it issued a cease and desist order to the Karatbit Foundation to wind up its electronic money business within Germany.In the Order, BaFin stated that Karatbit had issued the 'KaratGoldCoin' without the required license. The Company used former soccer stars from Germany to promote its products. In a video taken at an event to promote KaratGoldCoin, one promoter was recorded telling the crowd, '[t]he most important thing is you have to believe.'This order comes after authorities in several other countries, including the United States, issued orders against the company or warned investors about the company.The BaFin cease and desist order can be found here[10].Iran Announces Fees on Virtual Currency MiningThe government of Iran has announced that it will levy fees on individuals using the national power grid to mine virtual currencies. The government had previously banned the use of government subsidized electricity for virtual currency mining activity during peak hours, which can span 300 hours a year.The program also rewards individuals for exposing virtual currency miners who operate in violation of the ban. The reward for reporting an illicit virtual currency miner to the government is a fee of 20% of the recovery of damages caused to the national power grid.An article from The Block reporting on the tariff can be found here[11].[View source[12].] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.524448/gov.uscourts.nysd.524448.37.0.pdf\">https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.524448/gov.uscourts.nysd.524448.37.0.pdf</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sec.gov/files/enforcement-annual-report-2019.pdf\">https://www.sec.gov/files/enforcement-annual-report-2019.pdf</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/secs-settlements-with-some-cryptocurrency-firms-showing-cracks-11573729200?mg=prod/com-wsj...prod/com-wsj\">https://www.wsj.com/articles/secs-settlements-with-some-cryptocurrency-firms-showing-cracks-11573729200?mg=prod/com-wsj...prod/com-wsj</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2019-november-financial-stability-report-purpose.htm\">https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2019-november-financial-stability-report-purpose.htm</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?466018-1/fbi-director-wray-dhs-undersecretary-testify-terrorism-threats\">https://www.c-span.org/video/?466018-1/fbi-director-wray-dhs-undersecretary-testify-terrorism-threats</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-massachusetts-men-arrested-and-charged-nationwide-scheme-steal-social-media-accounts-and\">https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/two-massachusetts-men-arrested-and-charged-nationwide-scheme-steal-social-media-accounts-and</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2019/11/06/news-release-dhs-awards-182k-cross-border-oil-import-tracking\">https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/news/2019/11/06/news-release-dhs-awards-182k-cross-border-oil-import-tracking</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bis.org/press/p191111.htm\">https://www.bis.org/press/p191111.htm</url> [ 9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bis.org/speeches/sp191113.htm\">https://www.bis.org/speeches/sp191113.htm</url> [ 10]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/EN/Verbrauchermitteilung/unerlaubte/2019/meldung_191111_Karatbit_Foundation_en.html\">https://www.bafin.de/SharedDocs/Veroeffentlichungen/EN/Verbrauchermitteilung/unerlaubte/2019/meldung_191111_Karatbit_Foundation_en.html</url> [ 11]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/47109/iran-announces-power-tariffs-for-crypto-miners-offers-bounty-for-exposing-illegal-operations\">https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/47109/iran-announces-power-tariffs-for-crypto-miners-offers-bounty-for-exposing-illegal-operations</url> [ 12]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://feeds.lexblog.com/~r/VirtualCurrencyReport/~3/xHDg6CyIykY/\">http://feeds.lexblog.com/~r/VirtualCurrencyReport/~3/xHDg6CyIykY/</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP105411157471955188675776500095</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKK-01S1-JCMN-Y36W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2208\"/><timeReceived>10:05 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 25, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SECURITIES &amp;

The statement clarifies that AML/CFT regulations apply to 'financial institutions' as defined under the BSA and includes certain introducing brokers, broker-dealers, money services businesses, and SEC-registered mutual funds. Financial institutions under the BSA definition must, among other things, establish and implement anti-money laundering programs and certain recordkeeping and reporting programs, according to the statement.The joint statement emphasizes that market participants should focus on the facts and circumstances involving an asset, service, or activity, rather than the term or label used to describe it, in categorizing the asset for regulatory compliance purposes. According to the statement, the nature of the activities is a 'key factor' in determining if a person is subject to SEC, CFTC, or FinCEN registration, and certain applicable BSA obligations apply 'very broadly' regardless of whether the applicable transaction involves a commodity or a security.Please click here[1] to read the full statement.CFTC Chairman States Ether Is a CommodityOn October 10, 2019, in an interview at the Yahoo!</p><p> Finance All Markets Summit, CFTC's Heath Tarbert said that, in addition to Bitcoin, Ether is a commodity subject to regulation by the CFTC under the Commodity Exchange Act. This marks the first time that the CFTC has confirmed Ether's status as a commodity. Tarbert also said that he guesses that Ether-related futures contracts and other related derivatives will be traded within the next 12 months, or even sooner. He also discussed various topics including treating forked digital assets the same as the forked asset when conducting regulatory analysis, the CFTC's authority to investigate fraud and manipulation in the spot market, and its FinTech based initiative, LabCFTC.Please click here[2] to watch the full interview.SEC Rejects Proposal to List Bitwise Bitcoin ETF TrustOn October 9, 2019, the SEC rejected NYSE Arca, Inc.'s ('NYSE Arca') application proposing a rule change to list and trade shares of Bitwise Bitcoin ETF Trust, an exchange-traded product that trades in Bitcoin. According to the SEC, NYSE Arca did not meet its burden of showing that its proposal is consistent with requirements that national securities exchange rules be 'designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.' This is consistent with the SEC's earlier denials of similar Bitcoin-related, exchange-traded products. Among other things, the SEC highlighted the lack of surveillance-sharing agreements with regulated markets of significant size relating to the underlying assets. The staff rejected NYSE Arca's position that surveillance-sharing agreements are unnecessary as Bitcoin and related markets are 'uniquely resistant to manipulation and fraudulent activity' and noted that although Bitwise asserted that 95% of trading data in spot markets represents 'fake' and non-economic trading, Bitwise did not establish that the surveilled markets constituted the 'real' spot market for Bitcoin or that the 'real' market is isolated from the fraudulent and manipulative activity. The staff also noted that the markets identified as 'real' were not registered with a U.S. regulator and half lacked internal or third-party market surveillance tools. It further noted that the exchange and the sponsor provided no data showing that the prices in the 'fake' market did not affect prices on the 'real' market. The staff discussed some of the data deficiencies and noted that the sponsor would need to address the issue of partially real volume on 'fake' platforms and the depth of institutional market activity.In denying the application, the SEC emphasized that it is not weighing in on the 'utility or value' of Bitcoin or blockchain technology.Please click here[3] to read the order.IRS Issues Guidance on Tax Treatment of Virtual CurrenciesOn October 9, 2019, the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') issued Revenue Ruling 2019-24[4] describing its position regarding the tax treatment of hard forks and released updated frequently asked questions[5] ('FAQs') supplementing Notice 2014[6]-21.The revenue ruling starts by defining cryptocurrencies, which the IRS considers to be a form of virtual currency. The revenue ruling discusses the tax consequences of a hard fork, making a distinction between those persons who do not receive the new cryptocurrency resulting from the hard fork and those persons who are 'airdropped' the resulting new cryptocurrency. The revenue ruling was drafted by attorney Suzanne R. Sinno of the Office of the Associate Chief Counsel.Similar to Notice 2014-21, the FAQs discuss a range of topics, including the tax treatment of virtual currencies exchanged or sold for other property, or received for or paid in exchange for services. The new FAQs expand the discussion to include the tax treatment of cryptocurrencies received as part of a hard fork, based on Revenue Ruling 2019-24. The FAQs also suggest certain methods for determining tax basis in virtual currencies. However, the legal weight of these suggestions is unclear and the tax law discussed in the FAQs remains open to interpretation. What is clear is that these FAQs reflect a more sophisticated understanding of the technology within the IRS.In the news release[7] accompanying the guidance, the IRS also referred to the 10,000-plus 'educational letters' it sent to taxpayers. The IRS reiterated that taxpayers who incorrectly report their transactions or do not report them at all may be subject to monetary fines and criminal prosecution.Please click here[8] for the IRS release.Facebook CEO to Testify Before Congress on Libra ProjectOn October 9, 2019, the House Financial Services Committee (the 'Committee') of the U.S. House of Representatives announced that Facebook CEO and Chairman Mark Zuckerberg will appear for testimony before the Committee on October 23, 2019. The hearing entitled 'An Examination of Facebook and Its Impact on the Financial Services and Housing Sectors' is a follow up to the Committee's previous letter to Facebook requesting that it halt its cryptocurrency and digital wallet projects, Libra and Calibra, respectively. In July 2019, the Committee also heard testimony on this topic from Calibra's CEO David Marcus, where they discussed, among other things, the 'Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act,' a draft bill advocating for the prevention of large platforms from operating as, or being affiliated with, a chartered financial institution.Please click here[9] for the press release.Members of Congress Write a Letter Warning Certain Payment Processors from Participating in Facebook's Libra ProjectOn October 8, 2019, two members of the U.S. Senate sent a letter to each of Visa, Stripe, and Mastercard, highlighting their concerns about Facebook's Libra project. Citing public reporting, the Senators highlighted their concerns that 'key questions remain unanswered about the risks the project poses to consumers, regulated financial institutions, and the global financial system.' The letter, among other things, warned the companies that if they participated in the project, they could expect a 'high level of scrutiny from regulators,' including with respect to all of their non-Libra related payment activities. The letter concluded by urging the companies to proceed with caution until Facebook provided answers 'on how it will manage the various and significant risks posed by Libra.'A few days after the issuance of the letter, Visa, Stripe, and Mastercard announced their withdrawal[10]s from the Libra project.Please click here[11] to read the letter.Litigation DevelopmentsSingapore Citizen Charged with Theft of Cloud Computing Power to Mine CryptocurrencyOn October 9, 2019, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington indicted a Singapore citizen for allegedly stealing cloud computing power from California and Texas residents to mine cryptocurrencies.

The court, however, granted NYAG's request to extend the existing injunction order in place for an additional 90 days. This latest dispute arrives on the heels of the New York Appellate Division's order staying the case pending the appeal of an earlier ruling denying the defendants' motion to dismiss.Plaintiffs File Class Action Lawsuit Alleging Bitfinex and Tether Manipulated Virtual Currency MarketOn October 6, 2019, a group of individuals who owned cryptocurrencies (collectively, the 'plaintiffs') filed a class action lawsuit in federal court in New York City against iFinex (the company behind Bitfinex, Tether, and other affiliates) (collectively, the 'defendants') alleging, among other things, that the defendants engaged in a fraudulent, deceptive, and sophisticated scheme to manipulate the cryptocurrency markets and conceal illicit proceeds. According to the plaintiffs, defendants 'commingled their corporate identities and customer funds' while covering up their joint efforts to successfully manipulate a decentralized industry. The complaint alleges that the defendants created the 'largest bubble in human history' when they used an 'extraordinary amount of' their USDT coin, a cryptocurrency, which they fraudulently claimed was backed by the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 ratio basis, to flood the market and manipulate it at an 'unprecedented' level. Plaintiffs contend that defendants' potential liability to the putative class could likely surpass $1.4 trillion.Please click here[13] to read the complaint.International DevelopmentsBank of England Sets Out Principles for Facebook's LibraOn October 9, 2019, the Bank of England issued its 'Financial Policy Summary and Record of the Financial Policy Committee Meeting on 2 October 2019' (the 'Report') which included principles for payment systems and discusses Facebook's virtual currency project Libra. According to the Financial Policy Committee (the 'FPC'), focusing on the financial stability risk of payment activities (as opposed to the legal form) and ensuring payment chains' operational and financial resilience from end-to-end will help to ensure payment systems support financial stability. The FPC also highlighted the need to obtain sufficient information to monitor payment activities to identify and address any emerging risks to financial stability. While noting 'Libra has the potential to become a systematically important payment system,' the FPC calls on U.K. authorities to use their powers so that the project is subject to appropriate supervisory oversight, meets the highest standard of resilience, and complies with set-out principles 'in advance of any launch.' The resilience, the FPC explains, should not only include elements of the Libra Association and related reserve currencies but also other relevant participants 'such as validators, exchanges or wallet providers.'Please click here[14] to read the report.UNICEF Launches a Crypto FundOn October 9, 2019, UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, announced that it will be able to accept and distribute donations of cryptocurrency through its newly launched cryptocurrency fund\u2014a first for United Nations organizations.

The release touches on certain general principles such as honesty and fairness, diligence, capabilities, conflicts of interest, safeguarding of fund assets, disclosures and compliance. It clarifies that senior management of a virtual currency fund manager bears the primary responsibility of compliance with the rules and sets out detailed requirements as to the organization and management structure; management and custody of the fund's assets; certain recordkeeping, auditing, valuation and other operational matters; certain dealings with the fund and fund investors, including marketing activities and fees and expenses; and reporting to the SFC. A manager is within the scope of the regulation if the manager's fund has a stated objective to invest in virtual assets or if more than 10% of a fund is invested in virtual assets (unless the fund exceeds the 10% threshold due to market appreciation and the manager acts to reduce the fund's exposure).Please click here[16] to read the announcement.[View source[17].] [ 1]: <url

Continue reading Blocking social networks after terrorist attacks can do more harm than good</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Imagine for a moment that you run a small country prone to outbreaks of sectarian violence. Terrorist attacks hit a series of churches and hotels in your country on a major religious holiday, prompting fears that violence will spread. Your citizens are using social networks to get in touch with their loved ones and you coordinate disaster response efforts   but they also appear to be using those same networks to plan further violence. It's your job to bring the situation under control in a way that balance speech rights with safety. Do you leave Facebook online, or do you shut it off?</p><p>That was the dilemma faced by Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday, when at least 290 people died in a series of bombings. The government decided to take the more restrictive approach: it blocked access to Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp, Viber, and YouTube. It was the second time in as many years that Sri Lanka temporarily blocked access to social media sites. (Last year, it came in response to anti-Muslim violence.)</p><p>To some observers, the shutdown was a welcome move. Kara Swisher writes in the New York Times:</p><p>It pains me as a journalist, and someone who once believed that a worldwide communications medium would herald more tolerance, to admit this   to say that my first instinct was to turn it all off. But it has become clear to me with every incident that the greatest experiment in human interaction in the history of the world continues to fail in ever more dangerous ways.</p><p>In short: Stop the Facebook/YouTube/Twitter world   we want to get off.</p><p>But two questions present themselves whenever a government acts to restrict speech in this way. First, who will be harmed by the unexpected breakdown in communication infrastructure? And second, does it even solve the problem you want it to?</p><p>We're still in the immediate aftermath of the Sri Lanka attacks, so it's very difficult to say who may have been harmed by the social media ban. We often hear that in some developing nations, Facebook is synonymous with the internet itself. The company also makes tools designed to help disaster victims coordinate their response, including its safety check feature. For families who primarily communicate using Facebook's infrastructure, a service interruption can introduce more chaos into an already fraught day.</p><p>Moreover, social media gained popularity in Sri Lanka and elsewhere because it was more trustworthy than official government sources. As Megha Rajagopalan reported in BuzzFeed, Sri Lankans have good reason to doubt official sources of information:</p><p>For one thing, the country has a long history of heavy-handed media controls, and journalists have routinely faced violence and intimidation over their work. This means many Sri Lankans rely on social media for up-to-date information, including posts that debunk false claims circulated on both social and traditional media.</p><p>Pressure on journalists had somewhat let up since President Maithripala Sirisena entered office in 2015. But when a constitutional crisis broke out last fall, supporters of the country's former president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, seized control of state newspapers and stormed the offices of a state-owned TV station, temporarily forcing them off the air.</p><p>It's clear that extremists really have been using social networks to spread misinformation in the wake of the attack. It's also clear that Sri Lanka's government has itself been an unreliable narrator over the years.</p><p>But say you've made peace with the government blocking access to Facebook and its peers. Will that stop the spread of misinformation? But say you've made peace with the government blocking access to Facebook and its peers. Will that stop the spread of misinformation? There's reason for doubt. Last year, the Times reportedthat Sri Lanka's previous social media ban was easily circumvented:</p><p>One official estimated that nearly three million users in Sri Lanka continued accessing social media via Virtual Private Networks, which connect to the internet from outside the country.</p><p>Yudhanjaya Wijeratne, a Sri Lankan researcher and author, did a forensic analysis of the blockade and told BuzzFeed's Jane Lytvynenko that it was largely ineffective.</p><p>Wijeratne studied over 60,000 Facebook posts to understand whether a social media block imposed by the government in 2018 was effective. Ultimately, he found that it wasn't.</p><p> Not only did people circumvent it in a flash, anecdotal evidence suggests it did significant damage to tourism and e-commerce, both of which rely on Facebook ads,  he said.</p><p>None of this is to suggest that social networks deserve the benefit of the doubt. Last April, civil society groups in Sri Lanka wrote an open letter to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlining the company's failure to enforce its own community standards in the country, a likely consequence of hiring too few moderators who speak Sinhala, one of Sri Lanka's native languages.</p><p>But we ought to be wary of dramatic  solutions  that have no clear benefit. Instead of intermittently blocking access to social networks, Sri Lanka could always try   regulating them? Develop standards around the identification and removal of harmful content, and hold companies accountable to them, the way Europe is now doing. Or, if you're worried that regulation will simply entrench incumbents, then take antitrust action that promotes competition. Both moves would likely do more to promote trust between the government and its citizens than simply shutting off Facebook whenever some cabinet minister gets nervous. (My colleagues Adi Robertson and Makena Kelly will have more to say soon about how groups can advocate government internet shutdowns.)</p><p>If the current US government blocked all access to social networks after a terrorist attack, we would rail against the move as an authoritarian outrage. When other countries do it, we ought to be just as suspicious.</p><p>Democracy</p><p>Facebook's new chief lawyer helped write the Patriot Act</p><p>Russell Brandom introduces us to Jennifer Newstead, a Trump appointee who served in the Justice Department under President Bush and who will soon be taking over as general counsel of Facebook:</p><p>As The Hill points out, a 2002 Justice Department press release describes her as  helping craft  the legislation. Notorious Bush administration lawyer John Yoo described her as the  day-to-day manager of the Patriot Act in Congress  in his 2006 book.</p><p>Passed in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the Patriot Act greatly expanded the scope of the government's surveillance powers, enabling new techniques like roving wiretaps and so-called  sneak-and-peek  warrants. Section 215 of the Patriot Act was used to justify the bulk collection of telephone records from US carriers, although both the ruling and the legal interpretation that justified it remained secret until the Snowden leaks.</p><p>After Social Media Bans, Militant Groups Found Ways to Remain</p><p>Sheera Frenkel and Ben Hubbard explore how Hezbollah and other extremist groups manage to stay on social platforms after getting banned:</p><p>Hamas and Hezbollah, in particular, have evolved by getting their supporters to publish images and videos that deliver their message   but that do not set off the alarm bells of the social media platforms. Today, the groups mostly post images of festive parades and religious celebrations online, as well as videos of speeches by their leaders.</p><p>That has allowed Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as groups like the East African-based Shabab, to proliferate largely unchecked on social media, even as a clampdown by Facebook and others has neutered the online presences of the terror organizations that are the most threatening to the West   the Islamic State and Al Qaeda.</p><p>How WhatsApp, FaceTime and other encryption apps shaped the outcome of the Mueller report</p><p>Craig Timberg and Drew Harwell have a piece on how the special counsel's investigation was made more difficult by encrypted messaging apps that serves as a nice preview of something we are going to be talking about a lot as Facebook pivots to privacy:</p><p>Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III detailed multiple contacts among Russian operatives and associates of President Trump in the report made public Thursday. But Mueller repeatedly also lamented what he couldn't learn   because encrypted communications had put key conversations beyond his reach.</p><p> The Office learned that some of the individuals we interviewed or whose conduct we investigated   including some associated with the Trump Campaign   deleted relevant communications or communicated during the relevant period using applications that feature encryption or that do not provide for long-term retention of data or communications records,  Mueller wrote in his executive summary.</p><p>36 Days After Christchurch, Terrorist Attack Videos Are Still on Facebook</p><p>Joseph Cox finds footage of the New Zealand attacks on Facebook   but it seems that in every case here, the footage was modified in an effort to evade detection.</p><p>Some of the videos, which are slices of the original 17 minute clip, are trimmed down to one minute or so chunks, and are open to be viewed by anyone. In one instance, instead of removing the video, which shows the terrorist shooting and murdering innocent civilians from a first-person perspective, Facebook has simply marked the clip as potentially containing  violent or graphic content.  A video with that tag requires Facebook users to click a confirmation that they wish to view the footage.</p><p>How Facebook Fights Fake News in the World's Largest Election</p><p>Saritha Rai profiles Boom, one of the third-party fact-checkers fighting misinformation in India ahead of its election this year:</p><p>A visit to Boom's offices makes clear that the scale of Facebook's response in India so far isn't enough. The small team appears capable and hardworking almost to a fault, but given the scale of the problem, they might as well be sifting grains of sand from a toxic beach.  What can 11 people do,  says Boom Deputy Editor Karen Rebelo,  when hundreds of millions of first-time smartphone-internet users avidly share every suspect video and fake tidbit that comes their way?  Her team has been working for Facebook since a regional election last summer, and work related to the present election escalated earlier this year.</p><p>Federal investigation of Facebook could hold Mark Zuckerberg accountable on privacy, sources say</p><p>Tony Romm says the Federal Trade Commission might fine the Facebook CEO:</p><p>In past investigations of Facebook, the U.S. government opted to spare Zuckerberg from the most onerous scrutiny. Documents obtained from the FTC under federal open-records laws reflect that the agency considered, then backed down from putting Zuckerberg directly under order during its last settlement with Facebook in 2011. Had it done so, Zuckerberg could have faced fines for future privacy violations.</p><p>The Antitrust Case Against Facebook: a turning point in the debate over Big Tech and monopoly</p><p>Cory Doctorow writes about a new paper from Dina Srinivasan arguing that Facebook's data-collection practices grew more intense and user-hostile as its competitors in the marketplace diminished:</p><p>Srinivasan's history of Facebook's surveillance rollout makes link between monopoly and surveillance clear. For its first ten years, Facebook sold itself as the pro-privacy alternative to systems like Myspace, Orkut, and other competitors, repeatedly promising that it wouldn't track or analyze its users activity. As each of Facebook's competitors disappeared, Facebook advanced its surveillance technology, often running up against user resistance. But as the number Facebook alternatives could go declined   because Facebook crushed them or bought them   Facebook's surveillance became more aggressive. Today, with Facebook as the sole dominant social network, people who leave Facebook end up joining Instagram, a Facebook subsidiary.</p><p>So there's plenty of reason to think that Facebook's surveillance could be disciplined by competition. After all, Facebook's sole credible competitor is Snapchat: a company whose main value pitch is its privacy enhancements.</p><p>Stock Images of Beautiful Women and Border Wall Propaganda: The Trump Campaign's Facebook Ad Strategy</p><p>Pema Levy browses through the president's Facebook ads:</p><p>The numbers tell a story of a campaign investing heavily in Facebook, a platform where it can reach millions of voters and just as important in this early stage of the race test the performance of its ads. At the time of writing, the campaign and its associated fundraising committee have spent $11,326,128 on 196,352 ads in just under a year.</p><p>That comes to less than $58 per ad. The reason is that different iterations of the same content count as distinct ads. Many of the ads run for just a day and are identical or nearly identical to others. (Reporter Judd Legum, in his newsletter Popular Information, counted 217 ads asking supporters to wish Melania Trump a happy birthday later this month.)</p><p>EU tells Facebook's Nick Clegg to rethink ad rules for elections</p><p>In an effort to blunt the impact of foreign interference on elections, Facebook now requires advertisers in the European Union and elsewhere to register in the countries where they operate. The EU worries this will make some kinds of political advertising impossible. And for some reason the Guardian writes about this as if it's an embarrassment to global policy chief Nick Clegg. I don't get it.</p><p>China Bans the Word  Leica' on Social Media</p><p>Beijing really doesn't like it when brands reference Tiananmen Square:</p><p>When a promotional video for German camera maker Leica hit the web this week, it looked like a bold statement about the hard work done by photojournalists around the world. But the company is now distancing itself from the 5-minute video after Chinese social media users cried foul and the word  Leica  was banned on social media site Weibo. The problem? The dramatic video is set in 1989 during the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests that are forbidden to talk about in China.</p><p>The video, titled  The Hunt,  is a fictionalized montage of various conflict areas around the world. Its most controversial sequence shows an English-speaking photojournalist scrambling to find his camera and being questioned by Chinese authorities.</p><p>Elsewhere</p><p>Silicon Valley Came to Kansas Schools. That Started a Rebellion.</p><p>Nellie Bowles writes about the latest school district to challenge the personalized learning software built by Facebook engineers. (New York wrote about a similar uprising in Connecticut last year.)</p><p>Many families in the Kansas towns, which have grappled with underfundedpublic schools and deteriorating test scores, initially embraced the change. Under Summit's program, students spend much of the day on their laptops and go online for lesson plans and quizzes, which they complete at their own pace. Teachers assist students with the work, hold mentoring sessions and lead special projects. The system is free to schools. The laptops are typically bought separately.</p><p>Then, students started coming home with headaches and hand cramps. Some said they felt more anxious. One child began having a recurrence of seizures. Another asked to bring her dad's hunting earmuffs to class to block out classmates because work was now done largely alone.</p><p>What it's like to be a female founder in the Instagram era</p><p>It's very stressful, Carrie Battan writes, but can also be a good fundraising tool:</p><p>Even when Instagram is being used to spread an empowering message, certain stereotypes are perpetuated. Often, female entrepreneurs must traffic in self-deprecation, conveying  a little bit of relatability,  says cultural critic and brand strategist Aminatou Sow, cofounder of the popular Call Your Girlfriendpodcast. She has noticed that while male CEOs seem comfortable posting selfies taken aboard private jets, women tend to relegate posts that reveal their newfound lavish lifestyles to private accounts, or forgo them altogether. Outdoor Voices' Haney says she's conscious of not appearing too  daunting  on social media and avoids flaunting her success.</p><p>Launches</p><p>Byte, the follow-up app from Vine co-creator Dom Hofmann, is out in beta and he shared a preview on Twitter.</p><p>the byte beta we've been running with friends and family *feels* exactly like the vine friends and family beta, down to the weird but appealing randomness of the videos. that'll change as we expand, but it's a pretty good sign pic.twitter.com/rBbQrNtTJ7</p><p>  dom hofmann (@dhof) April 22, 2019</p><p>Takes</p><p> I, too, am Contrarian </p><p>Alex Danco, who is one of my favorite Silicon Valley thinkers, bids farewell to the venture firm where he worked with a very funny post about how everyone tries to be  contrarian  on Twitter:</p><p>(As an aside; Silicon Valley is supposed to be somewhere where people think freely. You know what a place where people think freely looks like? It looks like somewhere with a cheap art scene; with a lot of musicians; somewhere where young people hang around and cause minor problems. It looks like what San Francisco used to be, for sure. But San Francisco nowadays more closely resembles something like the TV show The Good Place.)</p><p>And finally  </p><p>The CIA is joining Instagram</p><p>Instagram is no longer missing the one thing it was obviously missing, Makena Kelly reports:</p><p>An Instagram spokesperson told The Verge on Monday,  Our team worked with the CIA, as they do with many partners, to provide best practices and guidance when it comes to launching an Instagram account. </p><p>I'll throw in a couple.

For example, it's not as if the French don't get cozy with business interests, of course in the name of supporting intellectual-property rights: Last year, France established the Hadopi, an anti-piracy police force that's a joint effort with the music and film industries.

It must be fast, it must be robust, and it must be open,\" FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said this morning. And with that, the FCC voted to move forward with a plan that will make the Internet less open.</p><p><br/> This is the kind of doublespeak Wheeler has engaged in since early details of his net neutrality plan have emerged -- and alarmed [<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.siliconbeat.com/2014/05/08/tech-giants-advocacy-groups-vcs-raise-their-hands-for-net-neutrality/\">http://www.siliconbeat.com/2014/05/08/tech-giants-advocacy-groups-vcs-raise-their-hands-for-net-neutrality/</url>] big tech companies, startups, venture capitalists, advocacy groups and others, who have spoken out in hopes of saving the open Internet. Despite seemingly contradictory language in a fact sheet put out by the FCC, the plan by Wheeler, who got the 3-2 vote he needed today, would allow broadband providers to charge content providers for faster delivery of their offerings. This is being commonly referred to as the creation of Internet fast lanes. But Wheeler says those broadband companies won't be allowed to block or slow network traffic.<br/> Here's an example of why that promise doesn't exactly inspire confidence. As we've written, Netflixin February struck a deal to pay Comcast so the streaming-video provider could ensure smooth delivery of its content. Since then -- wouldn't you know it -- Netflixstreaming speeds on Comcast have steadily improved [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://gigaom.com/2014/05/12/comcast-is-now-the-third-fastest-us-isp-for-netflix-streaming/\">http://gigaom.com/2014/05/12/comcast-is-now-the-third-fastest-us-isp-for-netflix-streaming/</url>]. Netflixshould be happy about that, right? Oh no. NetflixCEO <person><nameText>Reed Hastings </nameText></person>has spoken out against what he sees as a toll he was forced to pay to Comcast, while Comcast has accused Netflixof previously slowing down its own traffic to prove a point. Netflixhas since agreed to also pay Verizon, and other broadband providers are sure to line up with their hands out as well.<br/> Some have said Netflixis a giant and a bandwidth hog and deserves to be charged these tolls. But net neutrality proponents say a company such as Netflixwould not have grown to provide its customers with streaming video had it been charged the tolls in the first place. With the creation of Internet fast lanes, startups with little capital might never have a chance to become the next Netflix.<br/> Besides innovation, another big concern of net neutrality proponents: A less open Internet could diminish it as a democratic force. Different tiers of access could limit content available to certain groups and perhaps lead to censorship.<br/> Opponents of Wheeler's plan are slamming today's vote, but they're not giving up. For example, MoveOn said in a statement today that protests in 19 cities around the nation will go on as planned. On Twitter, calls for the public to speak up abound.<br/> The vote today opens the door for what's effectively four months of public comment. That does provide some room for optimism, for those who are in to that sort of thing. For example, the agency says it will ask the public whether \"paid prioritization should be banned outright.\" It's also opening up the discussion of whether broadband should be treated like a utility, which would pave the way for FCC regulation with teeth. (That's the reason Wheeler is proposing these new rules: Other FCC attempts to enforce net neutrality have been struck down in court because the agency lacked clear authority.) Those who are campaigning for net neutrality are pushing for broadband to be reclassified as a \"common carrier.\"<br/> And for those keeping track of party politics: The 3-2 vote came courtesy of Wheeler and two Democratic FCC commissioners. The two Republican commissioners voted against the plan because they don't want the agency to regulate broadband at all. Opponents of net neutrality rules and of reclassifying broadband as a utility insist it is up to Congress to reclassify broadband, not the FCC.<br/> Advocacy groups are urging President Obama, who pledged support for net neutrality during the presidential campaign for his first term, to speak up. \"We call on him to keep his word, and add his voice to the chorus of Americans who don't want to give mega-corporations like AT, Comcast, and Verizon a green light to discriminate against content they don't like,\" said Rashad Robinson, director of ColorOfChange.Org, in a statement.<br/> Photo: Protesters hold a rally to support net neutrality at the FCC office in Washington, D.C., May 15, 2014.

If they get to do that -- as Facebook, LinkedIn, Netflix, Twitter, Yelp, Zynga, Amazon, Groupon, Hulu, LivingSocial, Apple, Google, Hewlett Packard, IBM and Microsoft have done -- then we get to criticize them mercilessly.<br/> This time the companies are hiding their heads in the sand and their data in the company vault from CNN, which set out in 2011 to report the demographic make-up of big tech companies. The Mercury News, where I work, tried to do the same thing early in 2008 with similar results -- or lack of results.<br/> If the country's biggest, best-known, most successful tech companies are unwilling to say even how many women they hire or how many of their workers are non-white, then we can assume the answer is not very many at all.<br/> Is that fair? I think so. It's no secret that the tech industry in general has a terrible, terrible record [<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_14383730\">http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_14383730</url>] when it comes to hiring women, blacks and Latinos. There is no reason to suspect that these companies -- companies that worked hard to keep their demographic data from the public -- are any different. If they were, not only would they not be fighting efforts for them to come clean, they'd be issuing press releases about what a fine job they were doing.<br/> And why do many of these companies say they won't be open and honest? Because if they told the world how many women, blacks and Latinos they hire it would put them at a competitive disadvantage? What?<br/> It hardly inspires confidence that we have U.S. Labor Department regulators who actually bought this argument.<br/> Here are what some people who are smart about this stuff had to say about the competition argument.<br/> \"Absolutely preposterous. Knowing how many white male sales workers a company has is a trade secret? Absurd,\" John Sims, a Freedom of Information Act expert and University of the Pacific law professor, told CNN. \"Tech is the most vibrant sector of the economy, and rather than try to fix problems, they want to keep secrets.\"<br/> Tech is the most vibrant sector and the most hypocritical.<br/> Take Google. Whatever happened to \"information wants to be free?\" Maybe they mean your information, as in \"information we can scoop up with Street View cars ought to be free.\" Or, \"information we can use to push ads your way, ought to be free.\"<br/> What happened to \"Don't be Evil?\" Falling down on the job when it comes to diversifying your workforce and then pretending like it never happened is evil.<br/> Or what about Facebook? Sheryl Sandberg is over there Leaning In, evangelizing the very worthy cause of helping women get ahead in the world of business. Wouldn't it be nice if she leaned into a little honesty and started the conversation by pushing her own company to tell the truth about its hiring?<br/> I could go on. But for now I want to flip things around and praise Intel. Intel publishes its diversity record on its website [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/company-overview/equal-employment-opportunity-employer-info-report.html\">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/company-overview/equal-employment-opportunity-employer-info-report.html</url>]. Yes, they have a way to go when it comes to diversity, but they are talking about the problem and how they are going to solve it.<br/> \"Intel believes that transparency with our data is the best way to have a genuine dialogue,\" company diversity officer Rosalind Hudnell told CNN. \" We are tech companies and data drives our business; we need to get beyond our fears that the numbers are a poor reflection on our individual organizations and work together to address the issue collectively.\"<br/> Amen.<br/> Oh, and here's an interesting thing about Intel. Until recently, the company had a female board chair, Jane Shaw.<br/> Something to think about.<br/> Share this:<br/> --Twitter [      \u00a0    <url

In 2012 it was BitPak [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bitpak.com\">http://www.bitpak.com</url>/]. Last November it was Coinbase. Earlier in January it was CoinJar [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blog.coinjar.com/2014/01/09/coinjar-wallet-to-be-removed-from-app-store/\">https://blog.coinjar.com/2014/01/09/coinjar-wallet-to-be-removed-from-app-store/</url>]. And on Wednesday [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2014/02/blockchain_apple/\">http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2014/02/blockchain_apple/</url>] it was Blockchain.</p><p><br/>Apple has been eliminating apps in its App Store that process or deal with the popular cryptocurrency bitcoin. Cupertino allows plenty of other payment apps like PayPal, Venmo and a variety of banking apps, so the exception for those dealing in bitcoin has raised questions why Apple has been zeroing in on the controversial currency. The US Justice Department has said [<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-18/u-s-agencies-to-say-bitcoins-offer-legitimate-benefits.html\">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-18/u-s-agencies-to-say-bitcoins-offer-legitimate-benefits.html</url>]virtual currencies aren't illegal.<br/> In typical style, Apple did not return a request for comment.<br/> But there are two main theories here: the first is that Cupertino wants to eliminate nascent competition for its own payment platform. Apple executives have recently had discussions with outside companies [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/01/30/paypal-wants-to-partner-with-apple-on-iphone-mobile-payment-platform---report\">http://appleinsider.com/articles/14/01/30/paypal-wants-to-partner-with-apple-on-iphone-mobile-payment-platform---report</url>] over payments for physical goods and services on its devices, according Wall Street Journal sources [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303448204579341290395762338\">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303448204579341290395762338</url>].

When it eliminated Coinbase [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/15/apple-bumps-coinbases-bitcoin-app-from-the-app-store-android-app-lives-on/\">http://techcrunch.com/2013/11/15/apple-bumps-coinbases-bitcoin-app-from-the-app-store-android-app-lives-on/</url>] Apple said it needed to \"comply with all legal requirements in any location where they are made available to users,\" an echo of its App Store review guidelines.<br/> But after its banishing, Blockchain fell into the crush-the-competition camp.<br/> \"Offering no explanation and no opportunity to address any issues, without any apparent change in circumstances other than the growing popularity of the independent and competitive payment system, Apple has eradicated their payment competition on iOS,\" wrote [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://blog.blockchain.info/2014/02/06/blockchain-response-to-apple/\">http://blog.blockchain.info/2014/02/06/blockchain-response-to-apple/</url>]CEO Nicolas Cary after quoting Apple's famous ode [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_Different\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_Different</url>] to the crazy ones and the misfits.<br/> \"We need [bitcoin users] to take a stand against Apple, make noise, complain, and show Apple that there will be consequences to their actions.\"<br/> Some obliged. A string of videos appeared on YouTube [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuQZTAJ2KLk\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuQZTAJ2KLk</url>] of bitcoin enthusiasts [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/\">http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/</url>] smashing their iPhones. One guy even used a high-powered rifle (see below). A Reddit user had promised [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1x62we/for_every_100_upvotes_this_post_receives_i_will/\">http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1x62we/for_every_100_upvotes_this_post_receives_i_will/</url>] them a replacement Nexus 5, which runs Google's Android and allows bitcoin apps, if they went through with the protest. (It's not clear if the promise was made good.)<br/> But Cary's cry was a noticeable departure from the previous bitcoin apps that had been nixed, which have (publicly) fallen in the second camp or opted for silence.<br/> To put it mildly, bitcoin's place in the future of finances is unclear. The government has said [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-18/u-s-agencies-to-say-bitcoins-offer-legitimate-benefits.html\">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-18/u-s-agencies-to-say-bitcoins-offer-legitimate-benefits.html</url>]bitcoin has benefits and is not illegal, but hasn't taken much action otherwise. But major markets like India [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2014/01/07/indias-central-bank-gets-to-grip-with-bitcoin/#axzz2sZxg8A4Q\">http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2014/01/07/indias-central-bank-gets-to-grip-with-bitcoin/#axzz2sZxg8A4Q</url>] and China [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/06/business/international/china-bars-banks-from-using-bitcoin.html\">http://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/06/business/international/china-bars-banks-from-using-bitcoin.html</url>]have expressed greater concerns over bitcoin, and Apple's terms and service do note that an app must be legal whereever it's offered.<br/> Bitcoin has hit the spotlight over the past year for the right and wrong reasons. It was the only currency accepted on Silk Road, a digital underground marketplace mostly of illegal goods like drugs and stolen goods. But at the same time large corporations like Overstock.com have started accepting bitcoin -- though immediately flips it to the more stable dollar. Bitcoin's exchange rate has been, again putting it mildly, volatile.<br/> [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://blog.sfgate.com/techchron/wp-content/blogs.dir/2304/files/2014/02/Bitcoin-Charts.png\">http://blog.sfgate.com/techchron/wp-content/blogs.dir/2304/files/2014/02/Bitcoin-Charts.png</url>]<br/> The bitcoin ride<br/> Messaging app Gliph [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://gli.ph\">https://gli.ph</url>/]allowed users to attach bitcoins to messages until Apple stepped in and told them to remove the capability. \"There wasn't any negotiation other than them saying what was going to be allowed or not allowed,\" says CEO Rob Banagale. (Here's a copy of Gliph's appeal letter [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://19de10c0037730b31d67-c6cb9846d861a1213b31648a6cce64e1.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/Gliph%20-%20Apple%20AppStore%20Rejection%20Appeal%20Letter%20-%20Publish.pdf\">https://19de10c0037730b31d67-c6cb9846d861a1213b31648a6cce64e1.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/Gliph%20-%20Apple%20AppStore%20Rejection%20Appeal%20Letter%20-%20Publish.pdf</url>].)<br/> Yet despite the one-way negotiation, Banagale doesn't buy the idea that Apple is trying to squash nascent payment competition or hurt the growth of bitcoin. Apple's lawyers have been getting plenty of work these days. The company is fighting a huge intellectual property suit against Samsung [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://news.cnet.com/2702-13579_3-1593.html\">http://news.cnet.com/2702-13579_3-1593.html</url>].

The government is starting to take a harder look at offshore tax havens used by big tech companies.<br/> So with the murky regulatory future of bitcoin, he speculates the company just wants to nip a problem in the bud. When CoinJar was nixed, the company said much of the same [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blog.coinjar.com/2014/01/09/coinjar-wallet-to-be-removed-from-app-store/\">https://blog.coinjar.com/2014/01/09/coinjar-wallet-to-be-removed-from-app-store/</url>]. In the grand scheme of Apple's app ecosystem, Blockchain's 120,000 users and a handful of petition signers [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.change.org/petitions/apple-allow-bitcoin-wallets-on-the-iphone\">https://www.change.org/petitions/apple-allow-bitcoin-wallets-on-the-iphone</url>] are a rounding errors.<br/> \"I think the primary reason is the company has bigger fish to fry,\" Banagale says. But he is a full-throated supporter of bitcoin as part of the future of payments.<br/> \"It's a little strange to have Apple be on what feels like the wrong side.\"<br/> San Francisco's Coinbase, which provides the software to manage bitcoins, has recently integrated [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://venturebeat.com/2014/01/29/mint-integrates-with-coinbase-so-you-can-track-bitcoin-with-the-rest-of-your-finances/\">http://venturebeat.com/2014/01/29/mint-integrates-with-coinbase-so-you-can-track-bitcoin-with-the-rest-of-your-finances/</url>]with financial management software Mint, processes payments for Overstock and has taken over $30 million in investments from Andreessen Horowitz and others. While the future value of bitcoin is highly debatable, this is no fly-by-night operation. The company declined comment.<br/> You can find other bitcoin apps [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zeroblock-real-time-bitcoin/id643184018?mt=8\">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zeroblock-real-time-bitcoin/id643184018?mt=8</url>] in the App Store, but the only ones [      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.zdnet.com/here-come-the-bitcoin-apps-7000024522\">http://www.zdnet.com/here-come-the-bitcoin-apps-7000024522</url>/] I could find monitored exchange rate -- they didn't actually trade the currency, a notable difference.

If the results are not there we would hear,\" said Nimesh Jhaveri, a divisional vice-president at Walgreens, the largest pharmacy chain in America, when asked last June about the accuracy of revolutionary blood tests it was offering in some of its stores. A few months later the provider of these tests, a startup called Theranos, began to lurch from one problem to another. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A series of critical articles in the Wall Street Journal has questioned whether Theranos's technology, which purportedly performs a wide range of tests on just a tiny sample of blood, really works. It has fallen foul of regulators over practices at one of its labs: they have threatened to force its founder and boss, <person><nameText>Elizabeth Holmes, </nameText></person>out of the blood-testing business. And it emerged this week that the firm is being investigated by American prosecutors and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over whether it misled investors. Many now write off the firm entirely. Should they?</p><p>The company's biggest immediate problem is the revelation of deficiencies in its laboratory in Newark, California. Of several issues found by the laboratory regulator, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), one was deemed to pose an immediate threat to patient health. Theranos says it has contacted all the doctors who ordered these tests, and that it has no reason to believe any patient was harmed. However, in March the firm received word from the CMS that it was not happy with the reply it had received and sanctions might follow. Theranos has responded again, and is waiting for a ruling. </p><p>Until then, it is impossible to know how things will unfold. Despite seeming to be in a heap of trouble, 90% of the firm's tests are conducted at its Arizona laboratory, which Theranos says was successfully audited by the same regulator last year. Since opening both laboratories the company has conducted 6.1m diagnostic tests. </p><p>The firm has taken flak for quietly resorting to using traditional machines for many of its tests, rather than its own supposedly whizzier devices. Yet it appears that the firm can run 80 separate tests on a finger-prick of blood\u201415 on its own machine, 65 on commercially available equipment. If Theranos has worked out how to dilute small blood samples to run on existing equipment, that could yet constitute a big advance.</p><p>Another criticism is that the startup, supposedly a pioneer in testing blood taken through a finger-prick, ended up tapping veins for some of its tests when it expanded to run a full-service laboratory. But Theranos was open about this change at the time. And it was still able to run its test on unusually small blood samples using small, paediatric needles. </p><p>If there are big problems with Theranos's technology, one question is why Walgreens felt able to roll it out, and promote its alliance with the startup so vigorously. Last year Mr Jhaveri said Walgreens' chief medical officer had \"reviewed\" the technology and the data before it introduced the service, and also that Theranos's tests had been compared with traditional methods and it was \"getting the results\". Walgreens later said the word \"review\" was incorrect, but that its clinical office was \"integrally\" involved in the roll-out and was confident in the quality of Theranos's services. This week it said it did not independently validate or verify the tests.</p><p>An investigation by the SEC into a private tech startup is unusual. But Brooke Buchanan, a spokesperson at Theranos, says: \"The feds read the papers like everyone else. The Wall Street Journal has written 21 articles about Theranos comprising 22,000 words since October.\" </p><p>The controversy will ensure heightened scrutiny of \"unicorns\"\u2014private technology firms valued at more than $1 billion. The head of the SEC, Mary Jo White, recently indicated she wants to look at startups that could pose risks to investors. You might imagine that those willing to put millions into a new medical technology would be aware of the levels of risk involved. But unicorns have been able to claim lofty valuations without the rigorous scrutiny endured by public firms. </p><p>Even among unicorns, Theranos is a unique sort of beast. It has been run secretively, sharing little information with investors. These funders are also atypical in the world of big tech startups: with the exception of one of its early \"seed\" investors, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, no big venture-capital firm has invested.</p><p>It remains to be seen whether the regulatory assault and negative publicity will prove fatal to the firm. 23andMe, a genetic-testing outfit, managed to survive a nasty brush with the Food and Drug Administration a few years ago. But even if Theranos is mortally wounded, finger-prick testing is too good an idea to die with it. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Harried Holmes</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-I55Q9RA</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JKF-S401-JBKN-B55H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"806\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Apple is due to report results on July 30 for the fiscal third quarter[3], and analysts have forecast $13.1 billion in revenue from services, up 15 percent from a year earlier. However, most of those gains will be from existing services like the App Store[4] and licensing deals, rather than the new offerings.Apple's TV+ video streaming service made a late entry into an already crowded market when it launched last November, and Gurman cites one analyst's estimates earlier this year that fewer than 15 percent of eligible customers had signed up, despite Apple offering a one-year free trial with the purchase of an iPhone[5] or other hardware.It's a similar story for Apple Arcade[6] subscription service, which launched last September. </p><p>Apple reportedly shifted its strategy recently and canceled contracts[7] for some games in development as it sought other titles that it believes will retain subscribers. Some developers have speculated that Apple's strategy change indicates subscriber growth is weaker than expected, and Apple also recently began offering some people a second free trial month[8], which perhaps suggests that users aren't remaining subscribers for a long enough period of time.As for \u200cApple Card\u200c, Goldman Sachs Group accumulated about $2 billion in credit lines since it launched last August, which is a fraction of other co-branded cards, according to a February update by the Nilson Report.The poorest services performer however is believed to be Apple News[9]+, which launched in March 2019. \u200cApple News\u200c\u200c+ provides access to hundreds of magazines along with subscription news from The Wall Street Journal and The Los Angeles Times, but it has failed to catch on with consumers, perhaps due to the lack of access to publications like The New York Times and The Washington Post, which have refused to sign deals with Apple.Apple has not provided information on how many \u200c\u200cApple News\u200c\u200c+ subscribers it has, but a report in November suggested Apple was struggling to entice people to pay for the service. That report indicated \u200c\u200cApple News\u200c\u200c+ got 200,000 sign ups within 48 hours, but that the numbers have not increased much since then.In February, Apple's head of business for \u200cApple News\u200c+ also departed the company[10] less than a year after the $9.99 per month service launched.That leaves the \u200cApp Store\u200c, where Apple's real revenue growth for services lies. Apple takes a cut of 30 percent from all paid apps downloaded from the \u200cApp Store\u200c as well as from in-app purchases. It also takes 30 percent from in-app subscriptions, dropping to 15 percent after the first year. The \u200cApp Store\u200c generated $32.8 billion in the first half of 2020 for developers, up more than 20 percent from a year earlier, according to Sensor Tower estimates cited by Gurman. Meanwhile, paid subscriptions topped 515 million in the fiscal second quarter. However, as part of an ongoing antitrust inquiry into Apple's \u200cApp Store\u200c policies, U.S. antitrust regulators are looking into[11] the 30 percent cut that Apple takes from in-app subscriptions. Government lawyers have been meeting with developers over the course of the last several months, and developers have been asked questions about Apple's subscription rules.Apple chief Tim Cook[12] and other big tech CEOs and are all set to participate in an antitrust hearing on Wednesday[13] held by the U.S. House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee as part of the investigation on competition in digital markets. Whether or not Apple's \u200cApp Store\u200c revenue stream will be dealt a blow as a result of the inquiry remains to be seen.

Apple is due to report results ...</p><p>Apple journalist Mark Gurman on Tuesday filed a Bloomberg story summarizing what investors perceive as Apple's lackluster return on its TV+, Arcade, News+ and Apple Card services after their first few quarters on the market.         Apple is due to report results on July 30 for the fiscal third quarter, and analysts have forecast $13.1 billion in revenue from services, up 15 percent from a year earlier. However, most of those gains will be from existing services like the App Store and licensing deals, rather than the new offerings.      Apple's TV+ video streaming service made a late entry into an already crowded market when it launched last November, and Gurman cites one analyst's estimates earlier this year that fewer than 15 percent of eligible customers had signed up, despite Apple offering a one-year free trial with the purchase of an iPhone or other hardware.      It's a similar story for Apple Arcade subscription service, which launched last September. Apple reportedly shifted its strategy recently and canceled contracts for some games in development as it sought other titles that it believes will retain subscribers.       Some developers have speculated that Apple's strategy change indicates subscriber growth is weaker than expected, and Apple also recently began offering some people a second free trial month, which perhaps suggests that users aren't remaining subscribers for a long enough period of time.      As for \u200cApple Card\u200c, Goldman Sachs Group accumulated about $2 billion in credit lines since it launched last August, which is a fraction of other co-branded cards, according to a February update by the Nilson Report.      The poorest services performer however is believed to be Apple News+, which launched in March 2019. \u200cApple News\u200c\u200c+ provides access to hundreds of magazines along with subscription news from The Wall Street Journal and The Los Angeles Times, but it has failed to catch on with consumers, perhaps due to the lack of access to publications like The New York Times and The Washington Post, which have refused to sign deals with Apple.      Apple has not provided information on how many \u200c\u200cApple News\u200c\u200c+ subscribers it has, but a report in November suggested Apple was struggling to entice people to pay for the service. That report indicated \u200c\u200cApple News\u200c\u200c+ got 200,000 sign ups within 48 hours, but that the numbers have not increased much since then.      In February, Apple's head of business for \u200cApple News\u200c+ also departed the company less than a year after the $9.99 per month service launched.      That leaves the \u200cApp Store\u200c, where Apple's real revenue growth for services lies. Apple takes a cut of 30 percent from all paid apps downloaded from the \u200cApp Store\u200c as well as from in-app purchases. It also takes 30 percent from in-app subscriptions, dropping to 15 percent after the first year.       The \u200cApp Store\u200c generated $32.8 billion in the first half of 2020 for developers, up more than 20 percent from a year earlier, according to Sensor Tower estimates cited by Gurman. Meanwhile, paid subscriptions topped 515 million in the fiscal second quarter.       However, as part of an ongoing antitrust inquiry into Apple's \u200cApp Store\u200c policies, U.S. antitrust regulators are looking into the 30 percent cut that Apple takes from in-app subscriptions. Government lawyers have been meeting with developers over the course of the last several months, and developers have been asked questions about Apple's subscription rules.      Apple chief Tim Cook and other big tech CEOs and are all set to participate in an antitrust hearing on Wednesday held by the U.S. House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee as part of the investigation on competition in digital markets. Whether or not Apple's \u200cApp Store\u200c revenue stream will be dealt a blow as a result of the inquiry remains to be seen.

Apple is due...</p><p> ( 54 minutes ago )   Apple journalist Mark Gurman on Tuesday filed a Bloomberg story summarizing what investors perceive as Apple's lackluster return on its TV+, Arcade, News+ and Apple Card services after their first few quarters on the market.  Apple is due to report results on July 30 for the fiscal third quarter, and analysts have forecast $13.1 billion in revenue from services, up 15 percent from a year earlier. However, most of those gains will be from existing services like the App Store and licensing deals, rather than the new offerings.  Apple's TV+ video streaming service made a late entry into an already crowded market when it launched last November, and Gurman cites one analyst's estimates earlier this year that fewer than 15 percent of eligible customers had signed up, despite Apple offering a one-year free trial with the purchase of an iPhone or other hardware.   It's a similar story for Apple Arcade subscription service, which launched last September. Apple reportedly shifted its strategy recently and canceled contracts for some games in development as it sought other titles that it believes will retain subscribers.   Some developers have speculated that Apple's strategy change indicates subscriber growth is weaker than expected, and Apple also recently began offering some people a second free trial month, which perhaps suggests that users aren't remaining subscribers for a long enough period of time.   As for \u200cApple Card\u200c, Goldman Sachs Group accumulated about $2 billion in credit lines since it launched last August, which is a fraction of other co-branded cards, according to a February update by the Nilson Report.   The poorest services performer however is believed to be Apple News+, which launched in March 2019. \u200cApple News\u200c\u200c+ provides access to hundreds of magazines along with subscription news from The Wall Street Journal and The Los Angeles Times, but it has failed to catch on with consumers, perhaps due to the lack of access to publications like The New York Times and The Washington Post, which have refused to sign deals with Apple.   Apple has not provided information on how many \u200c\u200cApple News\u200c\u200c+ subscribers it has, but a report in November suggested Apple was struggling to entice people to pay for the service. That report indicated \u200c\u200cApple News\u200c\u200c+ got 200,000 sign ups within 48 hours, but that the numbers have not increased much since then.   In February, Apple's head of business for \u200cApple News\u200c+ also departed the company less than a year after the $9.99 per month service launched.   That leaves the \u200cApp Store\u200c, where Apple's real revenue growth for services lies. Apple takes a cut of 30 percent from all paid apps downloaded from the \u200cApp Store\u200c as well as from in-app purchases. It also takes 30 percent from in-app subscriptions, dropping to 15 percent after the first year.   The \u200cApp Store\u200c generated $32.8 billion in the first half of 2020 for developers, up more than 20 percent from a year earlier, according to Sensor Tower estimates cited by Gurman. Meanwhile, paid subscriptions topped 515 million in the fiscal second quarter.   However, as part of an ongoing antitrust inquiry into Apple's \u200cApp Store\u200c policies, U.S. antitrust regulators are looking into the 30 percent cut that Apple takes from in-app subscriptions. Government lawyers have been meeting with developers over the course of the last several months, and developers have been asked questions about Apple's subscription rules.   Apple chief Tim Cook and other big tech CEOs and are all set to participate in an antitrust hearing on Wednesday held by the U.S. House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee as part of the investigation on competition in digital markets. Whether or not Apple's \u200cApp Store\u200c revenue stream will be dealt a blow as a result of the inquiry remains to be seen.

The news outlet also decided to refrain from investigating any other Democrats running, to maintain a level playing field, and added that the opinion page would publish no outside op-eds on the election as long as its owner remained a candidate.Bloomberg the website is named after Bloomberg the candidate and founder, and while the editorial decision is certainly polarizing, it also represents a commitment to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. But where does that commitment stop? Apparently, as soon as the topic is a bit more complicated than the literal name of the company.While Bloomberg News might not be investigating or opining on Bloomberg the candidate, it has no problem publishing dubious and flimsy arguments when they come from the pen of anyone else in the Democratic Party's Wall Street wing. </p><p>Case in point: a Monday morning column from Peter Orszag titled 'What If Companies Get Big Because They're Better?[2]'Orszag represents everything wrong with Wall Street's friendliness to the Democratic Party. After running the Congressional Budget Office, he became director of the powerful Office of Management and Budget under Obama. As unemployment hovered just under 8 percent in November 2009, Orszag decried deficit spending as 'serious and ultimately unsustainable[3].' Obama's hesitance about deficit spending in the middle of economic catastrophe\u2014precisely the time when the government should be spending\u2014is remembered as a betrayal of the people, one of the decisions that made Democrats seem aloof and callous to average voters. Orszag also helped focus the Affordable Care Act on cost-cutting[4], rather than the more humane, worthy, and politically resonant goal of increased access for vulnerable Americans.Orszag eventually left the White House for a job at Citigroup\u2014a great look for a crisis-era official\u2014and is now the CEO of financial advisory at the boutique merger advisory bank Lazard. But he also enjoys a regular column in Bloomberg's opinion section. It already bodes poorly for a business publication to give regular op-ed space to a top executive at one of the firms it covers. But when that executive uses his soapbox to spread misleading ideas from murky sources, one has to question Bloomberg's editorial priorities.In 'What If Companies Get Big Because They're Better[5]?' Orszag trumpets a new paper on labor compensation as evidence that America does not, in fact, have a monopoly problem. Instead, Orszag argues, the researchers' 'exhaustive empirical work' shows that a few superstar firms are crushing the competition thanks to superior productivity\u2014more patents filed, and more units produced per worker. 'The evidence buttresses the view that superstar firms are thriving because they are simply more productive than other firms, not because they have been given a special break by regulators,' Orszag writes.There are many flaws[6] to this argument on the merits. The biggest is that productivity in the U.S. overall has slowed to a crawl[7] in recent years, which should end the discussion right there. More productive firms, of course, can also be beneficiaries of lax antitrust enforcement, and labor productivity gains were actually higher[8] back when antitrust was more vigorously enforced. But there's another unexamined factor to Orszag's piece.Look at who paid for the research Orszag relies upon. In tiny text in a footnote[9], one finds disclosure that funding for the paper was provided by, among others, Accenture LLC, the IBM Global Universities Programs, the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy, and Schmidt Futures.Accenture is a professional services company that does plenty of consulting work on mergers and acquisitions\u2014its website[10] brags that it 'supported some of the largest and most complex mergers and divestitures in history.' Orszag's own firm Lazard calls itself[11] 'one of the world's leading advisors on mergers, acquisitions, and related strategic matters.' IBM offers 'M...ccelerator[12]' management software. The MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy has received a multimillion-dollar grant[13] from Google and Walmart. Schmidt Futures is a project of ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt, which coyly states that it 'bets early on exceptional people making the world better.' And of course Google was built not on productivity advances but savvy acquisitions[14] permitted by lax regulators[15]. Venture capital as philanthropy: only in Silicon Valley.These are not independent funders merely curious about the rise of corporate concentration. Each has a strong vested interest in maintaining the current anything-goes regulatory environment toward mega-mergers. Orszag's firm, too, wants to keep the M...ield unperturbed, so a column from their swanky Obama alumnus in one of the most respected business sites around certainly helps the cause, especially if it touts the notion that M...hould not be discouraged, and that bigger firms merely reflect the natural order of things.Never mind that Orszag's argument falls apart as soon as you recognize that even if a firm with monopolistic power is nominally productive, it can both be behaving illegally under law and be bad for society. The point is to have a headline written by a prestigious man with a prestigious legacy.Bloomberg's many talented reporters would have smelled something fishy about Orszag's argument had he pitched it to them as a quote for a story. But when an Obama alum who hangs out in C-suites wants to write a column, editors bend over backwards to accommodate him\u2014even when that means attaching their publication's name to a bad argument written to help the bottom line of the company the ex-Obama official now leads. This is not unique to Bloomberg: The New York Times has taken blows from academics[16], leftist journalists[17], and my colleague Dean Baker[18], among others, for uncritically publishing scaremongering columns by Steven Rattner just because he worked for Obama, and Wall Street. To bring events full circle, Rattner in fact manages the money of Michael Bloomberg[19].To the extent that this op-ed diminishes the anti-monopoly arguments of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and burnishes the credentials of their challengers\u2014Michael Bloomberg, for example\u2014it also serves as an in-kind donation to the Wall Street faction of the Democratic Party. In other words, while barring discussion of Bloomberg on the op-ed pages, Bloomberg News has no problem laundering arguments that will help him in his campaign.Call it a knock-on effect from the mainstream media's long love affair with Obama himself. If someone tied to that technocratic ideal of a White House is talking, editors want to give them a megaphone. For all of the elite press's hand-wringing after the 2016 election about losing touch with the common man, and a growing epiphany[20] about their strong bias toward centrism, the nation's opinion editors still don't seem to realize they have a moral and professional obligation to think critically about what powerful people want to say on their websites. Memo to all: If the public doesn't trust you, it's not because you wrote too few profiles of white dudes in diners. It's because you're willing to publish nonsense, so long as the right suit says it.

Sanders has also       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/16/bernie-sanders-facebook-google-amazon-1416786\">voiced support</url> for the proposal, while other presidential contenders have expressed .</p><p>Warren's campaign declined to respond to Bloomberg. Anna Bahr, a spokeswoman for Sanders, said that \"it's not surprising that a billionaire running for president wants to protect the wealth of his billionaire friends.\"</p><p>\"When Bernie is in the White House, we will break up tech giants that have too much control over our country - and end their corporate greed,\" Bahr said.</p><p>Bloomberg said he would be open to more targeted antitrust actions against the companies, and acknowledged that they had \"too much power.\"</p><p>\"It's probably true that we shouldn't have let Facebook buy the last big acquisition they made,\" he said.</p><p>The multi-billionaire discussed his views on tech policy while sitting in a more than 150-year-old adobe building in Monterey, where he <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/17/mike-bloomberg-makes-swing-through-bay-area-touting-wildfire-plans/\">gave a speech</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/break-up-big-tech\">releasing a plan</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/big-tech-democratic-candidates.html\">varying levels of interest</url> to about 200 supporters Friday afternoon. Bloomberg's trip to California this week was his third swing through the state in less than two months as a presidential hopeful.</p><p>Wading into another ongoing debate between Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C., Bloomberg said he thought social media companies should face similar legal requirements as newspapers or other media outlets about the information shared on their platforms.</p><p>\"The rules that apply to your publication, in terms of what your responsibilities are for whatever you distribute to the public, should also apply to them,\" Bloomberg said of the tech companies. \"And when they say, 'Well, our system is such that we have a million billion things coming through it, we can't do it,' well, change your business model.\"</p><p>\"Society shouldn't give up the protections that we have from the press's responsibility just because it helps them make more money,\" he said.</p><p>It's a similar argument to that made by politicians calling for the repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/technology/section-230-hate-speech.html\">landmark law</url> that limits tech companies' liability for content created by their users. Former Vice President Joe Biden said he supported the repeal of the law in an interview  with the New York Times editorial board, making some of the same points as Bloomberg. And the provision has come under heavy criticism from elected officials on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>When asked whether he would repeal Section 230, Bloomberg said he wasn't sure exactly which part of the law he wanted changed. His campaign declined to clarify further.</p><p>Bloomberg also said he thought the federal government should pass new data privacy laws or regulations, citing the European Union's  giving users control over their data. \"I don't think you have much choice, because if a big chunk - like all of Europe -\u00a0does one thing, America can't sit there totally in a vacuum,\" he said. \"These companies think that because they have information and they can sell it they should have a right to sell it, and society doesn't have to (allow) that.\"</p><p>What doesn't work, he said, is a patchwork of shifting regulations across states and countries that makes it difficult for businesses to operate.</p><p>\"Tell them the rules - they may bitch a little bit, but they will figure out how to comply with them,\" Bloomberg said. \"But then it has to stay that way for a while. They just can't spend all their time changing their business model.\"</p><p>Bloomberg also defended his decision to push back the deadline for him to disclose documents detailing his vast wealth. Federal Election Commission officials <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-01-17/michael-bloomberg-financial-disclosure-delayed\">approved his campaign's request</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/17/opinion/joe-biden-nytimes-interview.html\">published Friday</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/21/technology/gdpr-explained-europe-privacy/index.html\">far-reaching provisions</url> for a second deadline extension Friday, which means he won't have to file a personal financial disclosure report until Mar. 20 - after voters in more than two dozen states, including California, have already cast their primary ballots.</p><p>Bloomberg's fortune is estimated at $55.5 billion, making him the world's ninth richest man, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/#16de7649251c\">Forbes</url>. The former mayor has already spent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/DavidWright_CNN/status/1217833528278253570\">more than $200 million</url> of that on ads promoting his campaign, dominating the airwaves in California and other states.</p><p>He said the extra time to file the disclosure was necessary because his team had to review documents from \"virtually every country and certainly in every state.\"</p><p>\"We're trying as hard as we can,\" Bloomberg said, pantomiming a huge stack of paper.</p><p>He said he would also release his tax returns - which are separate from the financial disclosure - but declined to set a deadline. All of the top Democratic candidates have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/2020-candidates-tax-returns.html\">already released</url> multiple years of their returns, while President Trump has refused to make his public.</p><p>\"My tax return is very simple: I give all the money away that I possibly can, and then pay taxes on the balance,\" Bloomberg said. \"It is not that it's anything complex. I don't have any tax gimmicks. But there's a lot of places you file.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNTRCT-6807818</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNTRCT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0Y-JM71-F0C5-X26V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313958</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"985\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The East Bay Times (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 18, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Sanders has also       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/07/16/bernie-sanders-facebook-google-amazon-1416786\">voiced support</url> for the proposal, while other presidential contenders have expressed .</p><p>Warren's campaign declined to respond to Bloomberg. Anna Bahr, a spokeswoman for Sanders, said that \"it's not surprising that a billionaire running for president wants to protect the wealth of his billionaire friends.\"</p><p>\"When Bernie is in the White House, we will break up tech giants that have too much control over our country - and end their corporate greed,\" Bahr said.</p><p>Bloomberg said he would be open to more targeted antitrust actions against the companies, and acknowledged that they had \"too much power.\"</p><p>\"It's probably true that we shouldn't have let Facebook buy the last big acquisition they made,\" he said.</p><p>The multi-billionaire discussed his views on tech policy while sitting in a more than 150-year-old adobe building in Monterey, where he <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/17/mike-bloomberg-makes-swing-through-bay-area-touting-wildfire-plans/\">gave a speech</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/break-up-big-tech\">releasing a plan</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/big-tech-democratic-candidates.html\">varying levels of interest</url> to about 200 supporters Friday afternoon. Bloomberg's trip to California this week was his third swing through the state in less than two months as a presidential hopeful.</p><p>Wading into another ongoing debate between Silicon Valley and Washington, D.C., Bloomberg said he thought social media companies should face similar legal requirements as newspapers or other media outlets about the information shared on their platforms.</p><p>\"The rules that apply to your publication, in terms of what your responsibilities are for whatever you distribute to the public, should also apply to them,\" Bloomberg said of the tech companies. \"And when they say, 'Well, our system is such that we have a million billion things coming through it, we can't do it,' well, change your business model.\"</p><p>\"Society shouldn't give up the protections that we have from the press's responsibility just because it helps them make more money,\" he said.</p><p>It's a similar argument to that made by politicians calling for the repeal of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/technology/section-230-hate-speech.html\">landmark law</url> that limits tech companies' liability for content created by their users. Former Vice President Joe Biden said he supported the repeal of the law in an interview  with the New York Times editorial board, making some of the same points as Bloomberg. And the provision has come under heavy criticism from elected officials on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>When asked whether he would repeal Section 230, Bloomberg said he wasn't sure exactly which part of the law he wanted changed. His campaign declined to clarify further.</p><p>Bloomberg also said he thought the federal government should pass new data privacy laws or regulations, citing the European Union's  giving users control over their data. \"I don't think you have much choice, because if a big chunk - like all of Europe -\u00a0does one thing, America can't sit there totally in a vacuum,\" he said. \"These companies think that because they have information and they can sell it they should have a right to sell it, and society doesn't have to (allow) that.\"</p><p>What doesn't work, he said, is a patchwork of shifting regulations across states and countries that makes it difficult for businesses to operate.</p><p>\"Tell them the rules - they may bitch a little bit, but they will figure out how to comply with them,\" Bloomberg said. \"But then it has to stay that way for a while. They just can't spend all their time changing their business model.\"</p><p>Bloomberg also defended his decision to push back the deadline for him to disclose documents detailing his vast wealth. Federal Election Commission officials <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-01-17/michael-bloomberg-financial-disclosure-delayed\">approved his campaign's request</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/17/opinion/joe-biden-nytimes-interview.html\">published Friday</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/05/21/technology/gdpr-explained-europe-privacy/index.html\">far-reaching provisions</url> for a second deadline extension Friday, which means he won't have to file a personal financial disclosure report until Mar. 20 - after voters in more than two dozen states, including California, have already cast their primary ballots.</p><p>Bloomberg's fortune is estimated at $55.5 billion, making him the world's ninth richest man, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/#16de7649251c\">Forbes</url>. The former mayor has already spent       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/DavidWright_CNN/status/1217833528278253570\">more than $200 million</url> of that on ads promoting his campaign, dominating the airwaves in California and other states.</p><p>He said the extra time to file the disclosure was necessary because his team had to review documents from \"virtually every country and certainly in every state.\"</p><p>\"We're trying as hard as we can,\" Bloomberg said, pantomiming a huge stack of paper.</p><p>He said he would also release his tax returns - which are separate from the financial disclosure - but declined to set a deadline. All of the top Democratic candidates have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/2020-candidates-tax-returns.html\">already released</url> multiple years of their returns, while President Trump has refused to make his public.</p><p>\"My tax return is very simple: I give all the money away that I possibly can, and then pay taxes on the balance,\" Bloomberg said. \"It is not that it's anything complex. I don't have any tax gimmicks. But there's a lot of places you file.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SJMRCN-6811037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SJMRCN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0Y-JM71-F0C5-X3GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313960</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"985\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Mercury News (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 18, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Tobias Levkovich with us, Chief US Equity Strategist, Citi  Research. We'll talk to him about this equity market that go, go, goes.</p><p>David Kirkpatrick in celebration of every big tech IPO, thank you so much  for joining me it seems, every time--</p><p>DAVID KIRKPATRICK, BLOOMBERG CONTRIBUTING EDITOR: Oh I thought you just had  me because my last name was Kirkpatrick.</p><p>KEENE: No, well very good. Happy Scotland to you this morning. When I look  David at the Alibaba experience, everybody's going to gain a pop. From a  tech standpoint, what does Fidelity or BlackRock or Capital Guardian Trust  in Los Angeles, what do these big hitters do with their shares if we see  the pop I think we're going to get?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I don't know what you mean by from a tech standpoint.</p><p>KEENE: Well from your perspective they're not going to sell are they?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I would not sell. I mean I think this is a company with a lot  of profits which is one reason why those ratios are so favorable. And I  think it is a company that has tremendous prospects. On the other hand we  could talk about as we go on, there are a complicated set of issues with a  company that's truly Chinese that's trying to operate globally competing  with these American colossi. And you know a company that has a lot of  interesting issues about finance and it's operating in a banking business.</p><p>KEENE: Right. Did Fidelity buy, to just use one name, did they acquire  Alibaba because of the Chinese and Asian experience or did they buy them  because they think they're going to compete in the United States?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I think it's both. I mean China is a continuingly huge market  opportunity for Alibaba and all the Chinese internet companies. And the  ratio of Chinese who are on the internet is way more than in the United  States.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's still under 50% of all Chinese even on the internet.  Alibaba completely dominates--</p><p>KEENE: Yeah.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Online e-commerce in China. So there's an opportunity there.  And they want to go global.</p><p>KEENE: And you know Adam within this conversation we're going to see it  open, there's going to be the green shoe with some 15% of shares.</p><p>ADAM JOHNSON, HOST, BLOOMBERG TELEVISION: Right.</p><p>KEENE: This is a different beast to institutions than any other deal you  and I have seen. We've never seen this.</p><p>JOHNSON: Well for starters it's the biggest one. And if that green shoe  that you talk about actually is incorporated into the deal, it will be the  biggest ever in history, globally. I understand from that point of view  David, just the sheer size, why a Fidelity has to be there. It's that big. </p><p>But what matters more the fact that it's that big or the fact that, in  other words selling more products than Amazon and eBay or the fact that it  actually can grow from here?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well I mean obviously you want growth if you buy stock. So  clearly that's the most important thing.</p><p>JOHNSON: In other words don't think of this as a dividend play or we've got  to own it just because it's big.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: No. I think this is a bet on the future of the global internet  and connectivity as a driving force for the global economy. And Alibaba is  as well-positioned as anybody for that. And that's the central force in the  global economy.</p><p>0611</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0619</p><p>KEENE: I want to go to the froth of the moment. Let's bring up this archive  photograph. This is a Surveillance archive, it's in our museum, the  Surveillance museum here. There's Kirkpatrick on the left side and  Kedrosky, Kirkpatrick's happier because he loaded the boat on Facebook at  $38.</p><p>SCARLET FU, HOST, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Look how young you are Tom.</p><p>KEENE: Yeah I'm the dork in the middle (inaudible). This was a (inaudible)  moment. Compare the froth of this moment versus what you and Paul Kedrosky  helped me with that day with Facebook.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: That's an interesting question Tom because for years I've been  fascinated by the Chinese internet. I've been to China a lot, I'm lucky  that way. And I've, but for years talking about it, people are like Ali- who? Ten-what?</p><p>KEENE: Yeah.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: You know they just didn't focus on it. It's astonishing to me  that the world has focused as completely on this recently obscure company  as they have. I don't think it's inappropriate. Comparing it to Facebook,  in the US it's not nearly comparable because ordinary Americans were  bananas over Facebook IPO. And as many of the articles have pointed out  most ordinary Americans still haven't even heard of Alibaba.</p><p>But could I just weigh in on a couple of these key points?</p><p>KEENE: Please.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: First of all, you know, regulatory risk is not even the word  I'd use. It's like executive fiat. That's the way China works. And if you  look at how Tencent, Alibaba's biggest rival just got a banking license to  be a private bank, one of the first private banks that's ever existed in  China. There are only a couple ever. And Alibaba wanted one. They haven't  gotten it yet. So those kinds of things are where you really can't predict  what happens.</p><p>KEENE: Fabulous.</p><p>FU: All right lots of unknowns there. David Kirkpatrick one of our guest  hosts for the hour and Don Straszheim, thank you so much, Don of ISI.</p><p>DONALD STRASZHEIM, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, ISI CHINA RESEARCH TEAM:  Scarlet, good, you're welcome.</p><p>FU: Joining us this morning.</p><p>0620</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0652</p><p>KEENE: Does everybody realize David Kirkpatrick just cuts into the line  this morning? Right up front?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I can't hold a 6 Plus it's too big for me. I would never want  it.</p><p>KEENE: You're not going to get a 6 Plus?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: No I would not consider it.</p><p>FU: The Asian David Kirkpatrick would.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's not going to go in my pocket.</p><p>JOHNSON: It's a small iPad.</p><p>KEENE: It's a mini-mini. I like that the mini-mini. I want a mini-mini.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I want a phone. Thank you.</p><p>0653</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0742</p><p>JOHNSON: With us David Kirkpatrick author of \"The Facebook Effect.\" So  there's clearly some sort of iPhone 6 effect going on here David. What  distinguishes the iPhone 6 from everything that's come before that would  cause people to wait in lines of up to 13 blocks?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well clearly people have been convinced by the Android  ecosystem that a bigger phone is what they want. And I'm not even sure. I  think it's surprising how much enthusiasm this was, I'll tell you though as  somebody with an iPhone 5, if the battery life is better I'll be happy.  Maybe it's simply that.</p><p>KEENE: Joshua Tapolsky says that's the number one thing.</p><p>JOHNSON: Battery life.</p><p>KEENE: Head of our digital operation, Tapolsky with a--</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: OK so I'm not so far off then.</p><p>KEENE: No the battery's everything.</p><p>FU: Consumers in Asia are the ones who really like the larger phones, the  phablets as they call them. And this is the market that Apple and every  other manufacturer is trying to grow.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I've been surprised that the bigger model is supposedly  selling faster.</p><p>KEENE: Yeah I like the phrase a mini-mini.</p><p>JOHNSON: And the other--</p><p>KEENE: It's a mini-mini.</p><p>JOHNSON: It's a mini iPad mini.</p><p>KEENE: It's a mini-mini.</p><p>0743</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0744</p><p>KEENE: Here's a reality financially. David Kirkpatrick revenue growth at  Apple up 79%, up 66%, up 45%, up 9%, up 5%. There's a trend there to a big  blue chip, 5%, 6% revenue growth. Which is important here, the mass and the  size of the existing Apple or do they really need to get marginal growth  out of these two products?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I think they're both important. I mean this product is clearly  remaking their image. I think it's, for whatever reason, they are, it's way  beyond fashion. But fashion is an important part of it. Android has  gigantic market share but it really is a way second class product system  than what Apple has. I think Apple has reasserted it's capability to be the  dominant technology producer in the world.</p><p>FU: And a lot of people believe it because they're lining up as well.</p><p>0745</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0750</p><p>FU: David Kirkpatrick?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well you know it's also Safra Catz who's really been--</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Sort of quietly the COO for a long, long time.</p><p>KEENE: Fair, fair.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: And I honestly don't think that Larry Ellison's really  stepping away that far. He's a guy that loves to sail. He loves to build  Japanese houses. You know he is clearly; he has been somewhat off the  campus for some time. But he's now going to be Executive Chairman and CTO.  He's not going away.</p><p>KEENE: Scarlet he bought Lanai, one of the beautiful islands in Hawaii--</p><p>FU: Yes he did.</p><p>KEENE: From David Murdoch. He's buying Taiwan next week.</p><p>FU: Probably.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: He could.</p><p>FU: Well Safra Catz is going to be one of the CEOs, the other one of course  Mark Hurd. This Co-CEO arrangement Steve, I've got to wonder, isn't it a  recipe for disaster? Deutsche Bank had co-CEOs and it hasn't worked out  very well.</p><p>STEVEN ODLAND, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE COMMITTEE FOR ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT: Well there's an old saw that everybody deserves only one boss.  In this case the company has two. But I suspect that they're going in  understanding very clearly what the lines of division are in terms of who's  going to focus on what. And I think the point is right, that Larry's not  going away.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: He will adjudicate if there's any issues with the (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: Can I ask you guys about cloud? I mean Oracle, John Chambers--</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: That's the question.</p><p>KEENE: Cisco and others, David Kirkpatrick, make us smarter on this.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well honestly this is the one thing you have to ask about  Oracle, they have done a great job getting service revenues from the  companies that they acquired with this annuity (ph) thing.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: But the real annuity in enterprise software going forward is  long-term contracts for cloud revenue where you don't have to, where the  customer has a way more advantageous position because they don't have to  make a big upfront payment. And that's where the industry has gone with  salesforce and others and Oracle is not there to the same degree.</p><p>JOHNSON: Isn't that what we saw with semis where the way to make money in  semiconductors is become a fabulous semi, you just design the things and  you subcontract to other people.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's a good analogy actually yeah. But I think Oracle is  making the shift but they're making it slowly because they have such an  incredible business in the old legacy business model.</p><p>ODLAND: You know one thing that people don't understand and as a CEO at  Office Depot I put in the Oracle Suite, it took years to get it in. You  don't want to take that thing out. So people say, well he's building a  business--</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: That's a key point.</p><p>ODLAND: You're building the business on these acquisitions. But these  acquisitions create this linear integrated system that is very sticky. And  it's hard to move.</p><p>JOHNSON: And by the way every year you had to pay additional amounts of  money to \"update it\" et cetera.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Enterprise software is the roach motel is the ultimate goal.</p><p>FU: But that was preferable to having to go to the cloud. Shift everything  over to a brand new platform wasn't it?</p><p>ODLAND: No that's right. These transformations are really expensive and  really dangerous and hard.</p><p>KEENE: I want to rip up the script here. I learn things on Twitter.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yep.</p><p>KEENE: And one of our listeners and viewers sent in a brilliant Twitter  response. Why wouldn't Alibaba and Amazon do some kind of JV? Steve? Is  that feasible?</p><p>ODLAND: Look I think, why is Jack Ma here meeting every major CEO and  financier in town? Why is he spending so much time in America when it's a  Chinese IPO? I think the answer is that his focus is not just on China. His  focus is on the US next.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's also because he's not selling sharing shares to people in  China by the way. They can't even buy this offering. That's one of the  oddities of this whole thing. But I do think a JV with Amazon is not out of  the question.</p><p>I think Jack Ma is the kind of opportunist in a good way, that would allow  him to consider anything.</p><p>KEENE: It gives Bezos immediate international expansion right?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well it could, I would, Bezos is not, I would be more  surprised if Bezos did it than if Jack Ma did it.</p><p>KEENE: OK fair.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Bezos is not the kind of guy who likes to share the spotlight.  Or who likes to really let somebody else make any decisions for him. Amazon  more than almost any tech company has always wanted to do everything  itself.</p><p>JOHNSON: All right so that's the theoretical. Let's get practical here.  Your Office Depot that you ran through what, 2010, what does Alibaba mean  for brick and mortar companies like Office Depot?</p><p>ODLAND: Well what people don't realize is that the office product stores,  Office Depot and Staples, were the third and fourth largest internet  retailers in the world. And so you know, there's, bricks and mortar have  really increased their business. </p><p>So Alibaba is an access point I think for bricks and mortar retail into  China, like Amazon had become an access point with their stores within a  stores. It could be a big growth vehicle for a lot of American companies.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Interestingly one of the big trends in the Chinese internet is  that Alibaba, Tencent and other companies are making investments in bricks  and mortar. And in fact they're starting to build infrastructures that  include offline delivery; both Alibaba and Tencent have been doing things  with gas stations, with retail stores, where they build partnerships with  cross ownership.</p><p>FU: Yeah it's not something that you hear about too much. This move into  the whole physical space here for these companies.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's a whole new development.</p><p>0754</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0757</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Let's face it Apple technology is still way better.</p><p>KEENE: The ecosystem.</p><p>JOHNSON: OK is that honest, is that an analytical quantitative or  qualitative--</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I think it's both. I think all the evidence shows that Apple  has a better design systems. People like it better. The software, hardware  integration is way, dramatically better. Because that's the problem that  Android has. The hardware and software is not controlled by the same  people.</p><p>FU: I know Steve is going to, right after Surveillance, break out to the  Apple Store because someone's holding his place in line right?</p><p>KEENE: Can we say thank you to our team? What a great set of guests today.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: Adam Posen was lousy, other than that.</p><p>FU: Oh come on. Steve Odland, thank you so much.</p><p>JOHNSON: Our producers outdid themselves today.</p><p>FU: Former CEO of Office Depot. David Kirkpatrick as well.</p><p>0758</p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Tobias Levkovich with us, Chief US Equity Strategist, Citi  Research. We'll talk to him about this equity market that go, go, goes.</p><p> David Kirkpatrick in celebration of every big tech IPO, thank you so much  for joining me it seems, every time--</p><p> DAVID KIRKPATRICK, BLOOMBERG CONTRIBUTING EDITOR: Oh I thought you just had  me because my last name was Kirkpatrick.</p><p> KEENE: No, well very good. Happy Scotland to you this morning. When I look  David at the Alibaba experience, everybody's going to gain a pop. From a  tech standpoint, what does Fidelity or BlackRock or Capital Guardian Trust  in Los Angeles, what do these big hitters do with their shares if we see  the pop I think we're going to get?</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: I don't know what you mean by from a tech standpoint.</p><p> KEENE: Well from your perspective they're not going to sell are they?</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: I would not sell. I mean I think this is a company with a lot  of profits which is one reason why those ratios are so favorable. And I  think it is a company that has tremendous prospects. On the other hand we  could talk about as we go on, there are a complicated set of issues with a  company that's truly Chinese that's trying to operate globally competing  with these American colossi. And you know a company that has a lot of  interesting issues about finance and it's operating in a banking business.</p><p> KEENE: Right. Did Fidelity buy, to just use one name, did they acquire  Alibaba because of the Chinese and Asian experience or did they buy them  because they think they're going to compete in the United States?</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: I think it's both. I mean China is a continuingly huge market  opportunity for Alibaba and all the Chinese internet companies. And the  ratio of Chinese who are on the internet is way more than in the United  States.</p><p> KEENE: Right.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: It's still under 50% of all Chinese even on the internet.  Alibaba completely dominates--</p><p> KEENE: Yeah.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: Online e-commerce in China. So there's an opportunity there.  And they want to go global.</p><p> KEENE: And you know Adam within this conversation we're going to see it  open, there's going to be the green shoe with some 15% of shares.</p><p> ADAM JOHNSON, HOST, BLOOMBERG TELEVISION: Right.</p><p> KEENE: This is a different beast to institutions than any other deal you  and I have seen. We've never seen this.</p><p> JOHNSON: Well for starters it's the biggest one. And if that green shoe  that you talk about actually is incorporated into the deal, it will be the  biggest ever in history, globally. I understand from that point of view  David, just the sheer size, why a Fidelity has to be there. It's that big. </p><p> But what matters more the fact that it's that big or the fact that, in  other words selling more products than Amazon and eBay or the fact that it  actually can grow from here?</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: Well I mean obviously you want growth if you buy stock. So  clearly that's the most important thing.</p><p> JOHNSON: In other words don't think of this as a dividend play or we've got  to own it just because it's big.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: No. I think this is a bet on the future of the global internet  and connectivity as a driving force for the global economy. And Alibaba is  as well-positioned as anybody for that. And that's the central force in the  global economy.</p><p> 0611</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> 0619</p><p> KEENE: I want to go to the froth of the moment. Let's bring up this archive  photograph. This is a Surveillance archive, it's in our museum, the  Surveillance museum here. There's Kirkpatrick on the left side and  Kedrosky, Kirkpatrick's happier because he loaded the boat on Facebook at  $38.</p><p> SCARLET FU, HOST, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Look how young you are Tom.</p><p> KEENE: Yeah I'm the dork in the middle (inaudible). This was a (inaudible)  moment. Compare the froth of this moment versus what you and Paul Kedrosky  helped me with that day with Facebook.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: That's an interesting question Tom because for years I've been  fascinated by the Chinese internet. I've been to China a lot, I'm lucky  that way. And I've, but for years talking about it, people are like Ali- who? Ten-what?</p><p> KEENE: Yeah.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: You know they just didn't focus on it. It's astonishing to me  that the world has focused as completely on this recently obscure company  as they have. I don't think it's inappropriate. Comparing it to Facebook,  in the US it's not nearly comparable because ordinary Americans were  bananas over Facebook IPO. And as many of the articles have pointed out  most ordinary Americans still haven't even heard of Alibaba.</p><p> But could I just weigh in on a couple of these key points?</p><p> KEENE: Please.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: First of all, you know, regulatory risk is not even the word  I'd use. It's like executive fiat. That's the way China works. And if you  look at how Tencent, Alibaba's biggest rival just got a banking license to  be a private bank, one of the first private banks that's ever existed in  China. There are only a couple ever. And Alibaba wanted one. They haven't  gotten it yet. So those kinds of things are where you really can't predict  what happens.</p><p> KEENE: Fabulous.</p><p> FU: All right lots of unknowns there. David Kirkpatrick one of our guest  hosts for the hour and Don Straszheim, thank you so much, Don of ISI.</p><p> DONALD STRASZHEIM, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, ISI CHINA RESEARCH TEAM:  Scarlet, good, you're welcome.</p><p> FU: Joining us this morning.</p><p> 0620</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> 0652</p><p> KEENE: Does everybody realize David Kirkpatrick just cuts into the line  this morning? Right up front?</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: I can't hold a 6 Plus it's too big for me. I would never want  it.</p><p> KEENE: You're not going to get a 6 Plus?</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: No I would not consider it.</p><p> FU: The Asian David Kirkpatrick would.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: It's not going to go in my pocket.</p><p> JOHNSON: It's a small iPad.</p><p> KEENE: It's a mini-mini. I like that the mini-mini. I want a mini-mini.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: I want a phone. Thank you.</p><p> 0653</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> 0742</p><p> JOHNSON: With us David Kirkpatrick author of \"The Facebook Effect.\" So  there's clearly some sort of iPhone 6 effect going on here David. What  distinguishes the iPhone 6 from everything that's come before that would  cause people to wait in lines of up to 13 blocks?</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: Well clearly people have been convinced by the Android  ecosystem that a bigger phone is what they want. And I'm not even sure. I  think it's surprising how much enthusiasm this was, I'll tell you though as  somebody with an iPhone 5, if the battery life is better I'll be happy.  Maybe it's simply that.</p><p> KEENE: Joshua Tapolsky says that's the number one thing.</p><p> JOHNSON: Battery life.</p><p> KEENE: Head of our digital operation, Tapolsky with a--</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: OK so I'm not so far off then.</p><p> KEENE: No the battery's everything.</p><p> FU: Consumers in Asia are the ones who really like the larger phones, the  phablets as they call them. And this is the market that Apple and every  other manufacturer is trying to grow.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: I've been surprised that the bigger model is supposedly  selling faster.</p><p> KEENE: Yeah I like the phrase a mini-mini.</p><p> JOHNSON: And the other--</p><p> KEENE: It's a mini-mini.</p><p> JOHNSON: It's a mini iPad mini.</p><p> KEENE: It's a mini-mini.</p><p> 0743</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> 0744</p><p> KEENE: Here's a reality financially. David Kirkpatrick revenue growth at  Apple up 79%, up 66%, up 45%, up 9%, up 5%. There's a trend there to a big  blue chip, 5%, 6% revenue growth. Which is important here, the mass and the  size of the existing Apple or do they really need to get marginal growth  out of these two products?</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: I think they're both important. I mean this product is clearly  remaking their image. I think it's, for whatever reason, they are, it's way  beyond fashion. But fashion is an important part of it. Android has  gigantic market share but it really is a way second class product system  than what Apple has. I think Apple has reasserted it's capability to be the  dominant technology producer in the world.</p><p> FU: And a lot of people believe it because they're lining up as well.</p><p> 0745</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> 0750</p><p> FU: David Kirkpatrick?</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: Well you know it's also Safra Catz who's really been--</p><p> KEENE: Yes.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: Sort of quietly the COO for a long, long time.</p><p> KEENE: Fair, fair.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: And I honestly don't think that Larry Ellison's really  stepping away that far. He's a guy that loves to sail. He loves to build  Japanese houses. You know he is clearly; he has been somewhat off the  campus for some time. But he's now going to be Executive Chairman and CTO.  He's not going away.</p><p> KEENE: Scarlet he bought Lanai, one of the beautiful islands in Hawaii--</p><p> FU: Yes he did.</p><p> KEENE: From David Murdoch. He's buying Taiwan next week.</p><p> FU: Probably.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: He could.</p><p> FU: Well Safra Catz is going to be one of the CEOs, the other one of course  Mark Hurd. This Co-CEO arrangement Steve, I've got to wonder, isn't it a  recipe for disaster? Deutsche Bank had co-CEOs and it hasn't worked out  very well.</p><p> STEVEN ODLAND, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE COMMITTEE FOR ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT: Well there's an old saw that everybody deserves only one boss.  In this case the company has two. But I suspect that they're going in  understanding very clearly what the lines of division are in terms of who's  going to focus on what. And I think the point is right, that Larry's not  going away.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: He will adjudicate if there's any issues with the (inaudible).</p><p> KEENE: Can I ask you guys about cloud? I mean Oracle, John Chambers--</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: That's the question.</p><p> KEENE: Cisco and others, David Kirkpatrick, make us smarter on this.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: Well honestly this is the one thing you have to ask about  Oracle, they have done a great job getting service revenues from the  companies that they acquired with this annuity (ph) thing.</p><p> KEENE: Right.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: But the real annuity in enterprise software going forward is  long-term contracts for cloud revenue where you don't have to, where the  customer has a way more advantageous position because they don't have to  make a big upfront payment. And that's where the industry has gone with  salesforce and others and Oracle is not there to the same degree.</p><p> JOHNSON: Isn't that what we saw with semis where the way to make money in  semiconductors is become a fabulous semi, you just design the things and  you subcontract to other people.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: It's a good analogy actually yeah. But I think Oracle is  making the shift but they're making it slowly because they have such an  incredible business in the old legacy business model.</p><p> ODLAND: You know one thing that people don't understand and as a CEO at  Office Depot I put in the Oracle Suite, it took years to get it in. You  don't want to take that thing out. So people say, well he's building a  business--</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: That's a key point.</p><p> ODLAND: You're building the business on these acquisitions. But these  acquisitions create this linear integrated system that is very sticky. And  it's hard to move.</p><p> JOHNSON: And by the way every year you had to pay additional amounts of  money to \"update it\" et cetera.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: Enterprise software is the roach motel is the ultimate goal.</p><p> FU: But that was preferable to having to go to the cloud. Shift everything  over to a brand new platform wasn't it?</p><p> ODLAND: No that's right. These transformations are really expensive and  really dangerous and hard.</p><p> KEENE: I want to rip up the script here. I learn things on Twitter.</p><p> JOHNSON: Yep.</p><p> KEENE: And one of our listeners and viewers sent in a brilliant Twitter  response. Why wouldn't Alibaba and Amazon do some kind of JV? Steve? Is  that feasible?</p><p> ODLAND: Look I think, why is Jack Ma here meeting every major CEO and  financier in town? Why is he spending so much time in America when it's a  Chinese IPO? I think the answer is that his focus is not just on China. His  focus is on the US next.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: It's also because he's not selling sharing shares to people in  China by the way. They can't even buy this offering. That's one of the  oddities of this whole thing. But I do think a JV with Amazon is not out of  the question.</p><p> I think Jack Ma is the kind of opportunist in a good way, that would allow  him to consider anything.</p><p> KEENE: It gives Bezos immediate international expansion right?</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: Well it could, I would, Bezos is not, I would be more  surprised if Bezos did it than if Jack Ma did it.</p><p> KEENE: OK fair.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: Bezos is not the kind of guy who likes to share the spotlight.  Or who likes to really let somebody else make any decisions for him. Amazon  more than almost any tech company has always wanted to do everything  itself.</p><p> JOHNSON: All right so that's the theoretical. Let's get practical here.  Your Office Depot that you ran through what, 2010, what does Alibaba mean  for brick and mortar companies like Office Depot?</p><p> ODLAND: Well what people don't realize is that the office product stores,  Office Depot and Staples, were the third and fourth largest internet  retailers in the world. And so you know, there's, bricks and mortar have  really increased their business. </p><p> So Alibaba is an access point I think for bricks and mortar retail into  China, like Amazon had become an access point with their stores within a  stores. It could be a big growth vehicle for a lot of American companies.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: Interestingly one of the big trends in the Chinese internet is  that Alibaba, Tencent and other companies are making investments in bricks  and mortar. And in fact they're starting to build infrastructures that  include offline delivery; both Alibaba and Tencent have been doing things  with gas stations, with retail stores, where they build partnerships with  cross ownership.</p><p> FU: Yeah it's not something that you hear about too much. This move into  the whole physical space here for these companies.</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: It's a whole new development.</p><p> 0754</p><p> (BREAK)</p><p> 0757</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: Let's face it Apple technology is still way better.</p><p> KEENE: The ecosystem.</p><p> JOHNSON: OK is that honest, is that an analytical quantitative or  qualitative--</p><p> KIRKPATRICK: I think it's both. I think all the evidence shows that Apple  has a better design systems. People like it better. The software, hardware  integration is way, dramatically better. Because that's the problem that  Android has. The hardware and software is not controlled by the same  people.</p><p> FU: I know Steve is going to, right after Surveillance, break out to the  Apple Store because someone's holding his place in line right?</p><p> KEENE: Can we say thank you to our team? What a great set of guests today.</p><p> JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p> KEENE: Adam Posen was lousy, other than that.</p><p> FU: Oh come on. Steve Odland, thank you so much.</p><p> JOHNSON: Our producers outdid themselves today.</p><p> FU: Former CEO of Office Depot. David Kirkpatrick as well.</p><p> 0758</p><p>  [*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p> THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND  OTHER INACCURACIES.

Tobias Levkovich with us, Chief US Equity Strategist, Citi Research. We'll talk to him about this equity market that go, go, goes.</p><p>David Kirkpatrick in celebration of every big tech IPO, thank you so much for joining me it seems, every time--</p><p>DAVID KIRKPATRICK, BLOOMBERG CONTRIBUTING EDITOR: Oh I thought you just had me because my last name was Kirkpatrick.</p><p>KEENE: No, well very good. Happy Scotland to you this morning. When I look David at the Alibaba experience, everybody's going to gain a pop. From a tech standpoint, what does Fidelity or BlackRock or Capital Guardian Trust in Los Angeles, what do these big hitters do with their shares if we see the pop I think we're going to get?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I don't know what you mean by from a tech standpoint.</p><p>KEENE: Well from your perspective they're not going to sell are they?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I would not sell. I mean I think this is a company with a lot of profits which is one reason why those ratios are so favorable. And I think it is a company that has tremendous prospects. On the other hand we could talk about as we go on, there are a complicated set of issues with a company that's truly Chinese that's trying to operate globally competing with these American colossi. And you know a company that has a lot of interesting issues about finance and it's operating in a banking business.</p><p>KEENE: Right. Did Fidelity buy, to just use one name, did they acquire Alibaba because of the Chinese and Asian experience or did they buy them because they think they're going to compete in the United States?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I think it's both. I mean China is a continuingly huge market opportunity for Alibaba and all the Chinese internet companies. And the ratio of Chinese who are on the internet is way more than in the United States.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's still under 50% of all Chinese even on the internet. Alibaba completely dominates--</p><p>KEENE: Yeah.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Online e-commerce in China. So there's an opportunity there. And they want to go global.</p><p>KEENE: And you know Adam within this conversation we're going to see it open, there's going to be the green shoe with some 15% of shares.</p><p>ADAM JOHNSON, HOST, BLOOMBERG TELEVISION: Right.</p><p>KEENE: This is a different beast to institutions than any other deal you and I have seen. We've never seen this.</p><p>JOHNSON: Well for starters it's the biggest one. And if that green shoe that you talk about actually is incorporated into the deal, it will be the biggest ever in history, globally. I understand from that point of view David, just the sheer size, why a Fidelity has to be there. It's that big.</p><p>But what matters more the fact that it's that big or the fact that, in other words selling more products than Amazon and eBay or the fact that it actually can grow from here?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well I mean obviously you want growth if you buy stock. So clearly that's the most important thing.</p><p>JOHNSON: In other words don't think of this as a dividend play or we've got to own it just because it's big.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: No. I think this is a bet on the future of the global internet and connectivity as a driving force for the global economy. And Alibaba is as well-positioned as anybody for that. And that's the central force in the global economy.</p><p>0611</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0619</p><p>KEENE: I want to go to the froth of the moment. Let's bring up this archive photograph. This is a Surveillance archive, it's in our museum, the Surveillance museum here. There's Kirkpatrick on the left side and Kedrosky, Kirkpatrick's happier because he loaded the boat on Facebook at $38.</p><p>SCARLET FU, HOST, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Look how young you are Tom.</p><p>KEENE: Yeah I'm the dork in the middle (inaudible). This was a (inaudible) moment. Compare the froth of this moment versus what you and Paul Kedrosky helped me with that day with Facebook.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: That's an interesting question Tom because for years I've been fascinated by the Chinese internet. I've been to China a lot, I'm lucky that way. And I've, but for years talking about it, people are like Ali- who? Ten-what?</p><p>KEENE: Yeah.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: You know they just didn't focus on it. It's astonishing to me that the world has focused as completely on this recently obscure company as they have. I don't think it's inappropriate. Comparing it to Facebook, in the US it's not nearly comparable because ordinary Americans were bananas over Facebook IPO. And as many of the articles have pointed out most ordinary Americans still haven't even heard of Alibaba.</p><p>But could I just weigh in on a couple of these key points?</p><p>KEENE: Please.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: First of all, you know, regulatory risk is not even the word I'd use. It's like executive fiat. That's the way China works. And if you look at how Tencent, Alibaba's biggest rival just got a banking license to be a private bank, one of the first private banks that's ever existed in China. There are only a couple ever. And Alibaba wanted one. They haven't gotten it yet. So those kinds of things are where you really can't predict what happens.</p><p>KEENE: Fabulous.</p><p>FU: All right lots of unknowns there. David Kirkpatrick one of our guest hosts for the hour and Don Straszheim, thank you so much, Don of ISI.</p><p>DONALD STRASZHEIM, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, ISI CHINA RESEARCH TEAM: Scarlet, good, you're welcome.</p><p>FU: Joining us this morning.</p><p>0620</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0652</p><p>KEENE: Does everybody realize David Kirkpatrick just cuts into the line this morning? Right up front?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I can't hold a 6 Plus it's too big for me. I would never want it.</p><p>KEENE: You're not going to get a 6 Plus?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: No I would not consider it.</p><p>FU: The Asian David Kirkpatrick would.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's not going to go in my pocket.</p><p>JOHNSON: It's a small iPad.</p><p>KEENE: It's a mini-mini. I like that the mini-mini. I want a mini-mini.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I want a phone. Thank you.</p><p>0653</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0742</p><p>JOHNSON: With us David Kirkpatrick author of \"The Facebook Effect.\" So there's clearly some sort of iPhone 6 effect going on here David. What distinguishes the iPhone 6 from everything that's come before that would cause people to wait in lines of up to 13 blocks?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well clearly people have been convinced by the Android ecosystem that a bigger phone is what they want. And I'm not even sure. I think it's surprising how much enthusiasm this was, I'll tell you though as somebody with an iPhone 5, if the battery life is better I'll be happy. Maybe it's simply that.</p><p>KEENE: Joshua Tapolsky says that's the number one thing.</p><p>JOHNSON: Battery life.</p><p>KEENE: Head of our digital operation, Tapolsky with a--</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: OK so I'm not so far off then.</p><p>KEENE: No the battery's everything.</p><p>FU: Consumers in Asia are the ones who really like the larger phones, the phablets as they call them. And this is the market that Apple and every other manufacturer is trying to grow.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I've been surprised that the bigger model is supposedly selling faster.</p><p>KEENE: Yeah I like the phrase a mini-mini.</p><p>JOHNSON: And the other--</p><p>KEENE: It's a mini-mini.</p><p>JOHNSON: It's a mini iPad mini.</p><p>KEENE: It's a mini-mini.</p><p>0743</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0744</p><p>KEENE: Here's a reality financially. David Kirkpatrick revenue growth at Apple up 79%, up 66%, up 45%, up 9%, up 5%. There's a trend there to a big blue chip, 5%, 6% revenue growth. Which is important here, the mass and the size of the existing Apple or do they really need to get marginal growth out of these two products?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I think they're both important. I mean this product is clearly remaking their image. I think it's, for whatever reason, they are, it's way beyond fashion. But fashion is an important part of it. Android has gigantic market share but it really is a way second class product system than what Apple has. I think Apple has reasserted it's capability to be the dominant technology producer in the world.</p><p>FU: And a lot of people believe it because they're lining up as well.</p><p>0745</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0750</p><p>FU: David Kirkpatrick?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well you know it's also Safra Catz who's really been--</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Sort of quietly the COO for a long, long time.</p><p>KEENE: Fair, fair.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: And I honestly don't think that Larry Ellison's really stepping away that far. He's a guy that loves to sail. He loves to build Japanese houses. You know he is clearly; he has been somewhat off the campus for some time. But he's now going to be Executive Chairman and CTO. He's not going away.</p><p>KEENE: Scarlet he bought Lanai, one of the beautiful islands in Hawaii--</p><p>FU: Yes he did.</p><p>KEENE: From David Murdoch. He's buying Taiwan next week.</p><p>FU: Probably.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: He could.</p><p>FU: Well Safra Catz is going to be one of the CEOs, the other one of course Mark Hurd. This Co-CEO arrangement Steve, I've got to wonder, isn't it a recipe for disaster? Deutsche Bank had co-CEOs and it hasn't worked out very well.</p><p>STEVEN ODLAND, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE COMMITTEE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: Well there's an old saw that everybody deserves only one boss. In this case the company has two. But I suspect that they're going in understanding very clearly what the lines of division are in terms of who's going to focus on what. And I think the point is right, that Larry's not going away.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: He will adjudicate if there's any issues with the (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: Can I ask you guys about cloud? I mean Oracle, John Chambers--</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: That's the question.</p><p>KEENE: Cisco and others, David Kirkpatrick, make us smarter on this.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well honestly this is the one thing you have to ask about Oracle, they have done a great job getting service revenues from the companies that they acquired with this annuity (ph) thing.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: But the real annuity in enterprise software going forward is long-term contracts for cloud revenue where you don't have to, where the customer has a way more advantageous position because they don't have to make a big upfront payment. And that's where the industry has gone with salesforce and others and Oracle is not there to the same degree.</p><p>JOHNSON: Isn't that what we saw with semis where the way to make money in semiconductors is become a fabulous semi, you just design the things and you subcontract to other people.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's a good analogy actually yeah. But I think Oracle is making the shift but they're making it slowly because they have such an incredible business in the old legacy business model.</p><p>ODLAND: You know one thing that people don't understand and as a CEO at Office Depot I put in the Oracle Suite, it took years to get it in. You don't want to take that thing out. So people say, well he's building a business--</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: That's a key point.</p><p>ODLAND: You're building the business on these acquisitions. But these acquisitions create this linear integrated system that is very sticky. And it's hard to move.</p><p>JOHNSON: And by the way every year you had to pay additional amounts of money to \"update it\" et cetera.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Enterprise software is the roach motel is the ultimate goal.</p><p>FU: But that was preferable to having to go to the cloud. Shift everything over to a brand new platform wasn't it?</p><p>ODLAND: No that's right. These transformations are really expensive and really dangerous and hard.</p><p>KEENE: I want to rip up the script here. I learn things on Twitter.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yep.</p><p>KEENE: And one of our listeners and viewers sent in a brilliant Twitter response. Why wouldn't Alibaba and Amazon do some kind of JV? Steve? Is that feasible?</p><p>ODLAND: Look I think, why is Jack Ma here meeting every major CEO and financier in town? Why is he spending so much time in America when it's a Chinese IPO? I think the answer is that his focus is not just on China. His focus is on the US next.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's also because he's not selling sharing shares to people in China by the way. They can't even buy this offering. That's one of the oddities of this whole thing. But I do think a JV with Amazon is not out of the question.</p><p>I think Jack Ma is the kind of opportunist in a good way, that would allow him to consider anything.</p><p>KEENE: It gives Bezos immediate international expansion right?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well it could, I would, Bezos is not, I would be more surprised if Bezos did it than if Jack Ma did it.</p><p>KEENE: OK fair.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Bezos is not the kind of guy who likes to share the spotlight. Or who likes to really let somebody else make any decisions for him. Amazon more than almost any tech company has always wanted to do everything itself.</p><p>JOHNSON: All right so that's the theoretical. Let's get practical here. Your Office Depot that you ran through what, 2010, what does Alibaba mean for brick and mortar companies like Office Depot?</p><p>ODLAND: Well what people don't realize is that the office product stores, Office Depot and Staples, were the third and fourth largest internet retailers in the world. And so you know, there's, bricks and mortar have really increased their business.</p><p>So Alibaba is an access point I think for bricks and mortar retail into China, like Amazon had become an access point with their stores within a stores. It could be a big growth vehicle for a lot of American companies.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Interestingly one of the big trends in the Chinese internet is that Alibaba, Tencent and other companies are making investments in bricks and mortar. And in fact they're starting to build infrastructures that include offline delivery; both Alibaba and Tencent have been doing things with gas stations, with retail stores, where they build partnerships with cross ownership.</p><p>FU: Yeah it's not something that you hear about too much. This move into the whole physical space here for these companies.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's a whole new development.</p><p>0754</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0757</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Let's face it Apple technology is still way better.</p><p>KEENE: The ecosystem.</p><p>JOHNSON: OK is that honest, is that an analytical quantitative or qualitative--</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I think it's both. I think all the evidence shows that Apple has a better design systems. People like it better. The software, hardware integration is way, dramatically better. Because that's the problem that Android has. The hardware and software is not controlled by the same people.</p><p>FU: I know Steve is going to, right after Surveillance, break out to the Apple Store because someone's holding his place in line right?</p><p>KEENE: Can we say thank you to our team? What a great set of guests today.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: Adam Posen was lousy, other than that.</p><p>FU: Oh come on. Steve Odland, thank you so much.</p><p>JOHNSON: Our producers outdid themselves today.</p><p>FU: Former CEO of Office Depot. David Kirkpatrick as well.</p><p>0758</p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Tobias Levkovich with us, Chief US Equity Strategist, Citi Research. We'll talk to him about this equity market that go, go, goes.</p><p>David Kirkpatrick in celebration of every big tech IPO, thank you so much for joining me it seems, every time--</p><p>DAVID KIRKPATRICK, BLOOMBERG CONTRIBUTING EDITOR: Oh I thought you just had me because my last name was Kirkpatrick.</p><p>KEENE: No, well very good. Happy Scotland to you this morning. When I look David at the Alibaba experience, everybody's going to gain a pop. From a tech standpoint, what does Fidelity or BlackRock or Capital Guardian Trust in Los Angeles, what do these big hitters do with their shares if we see the pop I think we're going to get?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I don't know what you mean by from a tech standpoint.</p><p>KEENE: Well from your perspective they're not going to sell are they?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I would not sell. I mean I think this is a company with a lot of profits which is one reason why those ratios are so favorable. And I think it is a company that has tremendous prospects. On the other hand we could talk about as we go on, there are a complicated set of issues with a company that's truly Chinese that's trying to operate globally competing with these American colossi. And you know a company that has a lot of interesting issues about finance and it's operating in a banking business.</p><p>KEENE: Right. Did Fidelity buy, to just use one name, did they acquire Alibaba because of the Chinese and Asian experience or did they buy them because they think they're going to compete in the United States?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I think it's both. I mean China is a continuingly huge market opportunity for Alibaba and all the Chinese internet companies. And the ratio of Chinese who are on the internet is way more than in the United States.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's still under 50% of all Chinese even on the internet. Alibaba completely dominates--</p><p>KEENE: Yeah.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Online e-commerce in China. So there's an opportunity there. And they want to go global.</p><p>KEENE: And you know Adam within this conversation we're going to see it open, there's going to be the green shoe with some 15% of shares.</p><p>ADAM JOHNSON, HOST, BLOOMBERG TELEVISION: Right.</p><p>KEENE: This is a different beast to institutions than any other deal you and I have seen. We've never seen this.</p><p>JOHNSON: Well for starters it's the biggest one. And if that green shoe that you talk about actually is incorporated into the deal, it will be the biggest ever in history, globally. I understand from that point of view David, just the sheer size, why a Fidelity has to be there. It's that big.</p><p>But what matters more the fact that it's that big or the fact that, in other words selling more products than Amazon and eBay or the fact that it actually can grow from here?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well I mean obviously you want growth if you buy stock. So clearly that's the most important thing.</p><p>JOHNSON: In other words don't think of this as a dividend play or we've got to own it just because it's big.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: No. I think this is a bet on the future of the global internet and connectivity as a driving force for the global economy. And Alibaba is as well-positioned as anybody for that. And that's the central force in the global economy.</p><p>0611</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0619</p><p>KEENE: I want to go to the froth of the moment. Let's bring up this archive photograph. This is a Surveillance archive, it's in our museum, the Surveillance museum here. There's Kirkpatrick on the left side and Kedrosky, Kirkpatrick's happier because he loaded the boat on Facebook at $38.</p><p>SCARLET FU, HOST, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Look how young you are Tom.</p><p>KEENE: Yeah I'm the dork in the middle (inaudible). This was a (inaudible) moment. Compare the froth of this moment versus what you and Paul Kedrosky helped me with that day with Facebook.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: That's an interesting question Tom because for years I've been fascinated by the Chinese internet. I've been to China a lot, I'm lucky that way. And I've, but for years talking about it, people are like Ali- who? Ten-what?</p><p>KEENE: Yeah.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: You know they just didn't focus on it. It's astonishing to me that the world has focused as completely on this recently obscure company as they have. I don't think it's inappropriate. Comparing it to Facebook, in the US it's not nearly comparable because ordinary Americans were bananas over Facebook IPO. And as many of the articles have pointed out most ordinary Americans still haven't even heard of Alibaba.</p><p>But could I just weigh in on a couple of these key points?</p><p>KEENE: Please.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: First of all, you know, regulatory risk is not even the word I'd use. It's like executive fiat. That's the way China works. And if you look at how Tencent, Alibaba's biggest rival just got a banking license to be a private bank, one of the first private banks that's ever existed in China. There are only a couple ever. And Alibaba wanted one. They haven't gotten it yet. So those kinds of things are where you really can't predict what happens.</p><p>KEENE: Fabulous.</p><p>FU: All right lots of unknowns there. David Kirkpatrick one of our guest hosts for the hour and Don Straszheim, thank you so much, Don of ISI.</p><p>DONALD STRASZHEIM, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, ISI CHINA RESEARCH TEAM: Scarlet, good, you're welcome.</p><p>FU: Joining us this morning.</p><p>0620</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0652</p><p>KEENE: Does everybody realize David Kirkpatrick just cuts into the line this morning? Right up front?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I can't hold a 6 Plus it's too big for me. I would never want it.</p><p>KEENE: You're not going to get a 6 Plus?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: No I would not consider it.</p><p>FU: The Asian David Kirkpatrick would.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's not going to go in my pocket.</p><p>JOHNSON: It's a small iPad.</p><p>KEENE: It's a mini-mini. I like that the mini-mini. I want a mini-mini.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I want a phone. Thank you.</p><p>0653</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0742</p><p>JOHNSON: With us David Kirkpatrick author of \"The Facebook Effect.\" So there's clearly some sort of iPhone 6 effect going on here David. What distinguishes the iPhone 6 from everything that's come before that would cause people to wait in lines of up to 13 blocks?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well clearly people have been convinced by the Android ecosystem that a bigger phone is what they want. And I'm not even sure. I think it's surprising how much enthusiasm this was, I'll tell you though as somebody with an iPhone 5, if the battery life is better I'll be happy. Maybe it's simply that.</p><p>KEENE: Joshua Tapolsky says that's the number one thing.</p><p>JOHNSON: Battery life.</p><p>KEENE: Head of our digital operation, Tapolsky with a--</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: OK so I'm not so far off then.</p><p>KEENE: No the battery's everything.</p><p>FU: Consumers in Asia are the ones who really like the larger phones, the phablets as they call them. And this is the market that Apple and every other manufacturer is trying to grow.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I've been surprised that the bigger model is supposedly selling faster.</p><p>KEENE: Yeah I like the phrase a mini-mini.</p><p>JOHNSON: And the other--</p><p>KEENE: It's a mini-mini.</p><p>JOHNSON: It's a mini iPad mini.</p><p>KEENE: It's a mini-mini.</p><p>0743</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0744</p><p>KEENE: Here's a reality financially. David Kirkpatrick revenue growth at Apple up 79%, up 66%, up 45%, up 9%, up 5%. There's a trend there to a big blue chip, 5%, 6% revenue growth. Which is important here, the mass and the size of the existing Apple or do they really need to get marginal growth out of these two products?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I think they're both important. I mean this product is clearly remaking their image. I think it's, for whatever reason, they are, it's way beyond fashion. But fashion is an important part of it. Android has gigantic market share but it really is a way second class product system than what Apple has. I think Apple has reasserted it's capability to be the dominant technology producer in the world.</p><p>FU: And a lot of people believe it because they're lining up as well.</p><p>0745</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0750</p><p>FU: David Kirkpatrick?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well you know it's also Safra Catz who's really been--</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Sort of quietly the COO for a long, long time.</p><p>KEENE: Fair, fair.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: And I honestly don't think that Larry Ellison's really stepping away that far. He's a guy that loves to sail. He loves to build Japanese houses. You know he is clearly; he has been somewhat off the campus for some time. But he's now going to be Executive Chairman and CTO. He's not going away.</p><p>KEENE: Scarlet he bought Lanai, one of the beautiful islands in Hawaii--</p><p>FU: Yes he did.</p><p>KEENE: From David Murdoch. He's buying Taiwan next week.</p><p>FU: Probably.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: He could.</p><p>FU: Well Safra Catz is going to be one of the CEOs, the other one of course Mark Hurd. This Co-CEO arrangement Steve, I've got to wonder, isn't it a recipe for disaster? Deutsche Bank had co-CEOs and it hasn't worked out very well.</p><p>STEVEN ODLAND, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE COMMITTEE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: Well there's an old saw that everybody deserves only one boss. In this case the company has two. But I suspect that they're going in understanding very clearly what the lines of division are in terms of who's going to focus on what. And I think the point is right, that Larry's not going away.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: He will adjudicate if there's any issues with the (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: Can I ask you guys about cloud? I mean Oracle, John Chambers--</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: That's the question.</p><p>KEENE: Cisco and others, David Kirkpatrick, make us smarter on this.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well honestly this is the one thing you have to ask about Oracle, they have done a great job getting service revenues from the companies that they acquired with this annuity (ph) thing.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: But the real annuity in enterprise software going forward is long-term contracts for cloud revenue where you don't have to, where the customer has a way more advantageous position because they don't have to make a big upfront payment. And that's where the industry has gone with salesforce and others and Oracle is not there to the same degree.</p><p>JOHNSON: Isn't that what we saw with semis where the way to make money in semiconductors is become a fabulous semi, you just design the things and you subcontract to other people.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's a good analogy actually yeah. But I think Oracle is making the shift but they're making it slowly because they have such an incredible business in the old legacy business model.</p><p>ODLAND: You know one thing that people don't understand and as a CEO at Office Depot I put in the Oracle Suite, it took years to get it in. You don't want to take that thing out. So people say, well he's building a business--</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: That's a key point.</p><p>ODLAND: You're building the business on these acquisitions. But these acquisitions create this linear integrated system that is very sticky. And it's hard to move.</p><p>JOHNSON: And by the way every year you had to pay additional amounts of money to \"update it\" et cetera.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Enterprise software is the roach motel is the ultimate goal.</p><p>FU: But that was preferable to having to go to the cloud. Shift everything over to a brand new platform wasn't it?</p><p>ODLAND: No that's right. These transformations are really expensive and really dangerous and hard.</p><p>KEENE: I want to rip up the script here. I learn things on Twitter.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yep.</p><p>KEENE: And one of our listeners and viewers sent in a brilliant Twitter response. Why wouldn't Alibaba and Amazon do some kind of JV? Steve? Is that feasible?</p><p>ODLAND: Look I think, why is Jack Ma here meeting every major CEO and financier in town? Why is he spending so much time in America when it's a Chinese IPO? I think the answer is that his focus is not just on China. His focus is on the US next.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's also because he's not selling sharing shares to people in China by the way. They can't even buy this offering. That's one of the oddities of this whole thing. But I do think a JV with Amazon is not out of the question.</p><p>I think Jack Ma is the kind of opportunist in a good way, that would allow him to consider anything.</p><p>KEENE: It gives Bezos immediate international expansion right?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well it could, I would, Bezos is not, I would be more surprised if Bezos did it than if Jack Ma did it.</p><p>KEENE: OK fair.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Bezos is not the kind of guy who likes to share the spotlight. Or who likes to really let somebody else make any decisions for him. Amazon more than almost any tech company has always wanted to do everything itself.</p><p>JOHNSON: All right so that's the theoretical. Let's get practical here. Your Office Depot that you ran through what, 2010, what does Alibaba mean for brick and mortar companies like Office Depot?</p><p>ODLAND: Well what people don't realize is that the office product stores, Office Depot and Staples, were the third and fourth largest internet retailers in the world. And so you know, there's, bricks and mortar have really increased their business.</p><p>So Alibaba is an access point I think for bricks and mortar retail into China, like Amazon had become an access point with their stores within a stores. It could be a big growth vehicle for a lot of American companies.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Interestingly one of the big trends in the Chinese internet is that Alibaba, Tencent and other companies are making investments in bricks and mortar. And in fact they're starting to build infrastructures that include offline delivery; both Alibaba and Tencent have been doing things with gas stations, with retail stores, where they build partnerships with cross ownership.</p><p>FU: Yeah it's not something that you hear about too much. This move into the whole physical space here for these companies.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's a whole new development.</p><p>0754</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0757</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Let's face it Apple technology is still way better.</p><p>KEENE: The ecosystem.</p><p>JOHNSON: OK is that honest, is that an analytical quantitative or qualitative--</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I think it's both. I think all the evidence shows that Apple has a better design systems. People like it better. The software, hardware integration is way, dramatically better. Because that's the problem that Android has. The hardware and software is not controlled by the same people.</p><p>FU: I know Steve is going to, right after Surveillance, break out to the Apple Store because someone's holding his place in line right?</p><p>KEENE: Can we say thank you to our team? What a great set of guests today.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: Adam Posen was lousy, other than that.</p><p>FU: Oh come on. Steve Odland, thank you so much.</p><p>JOHNSON: Our producers outdid themselves today.</p><p>FU: Former CEO of Office Depot. David Kirkpatrick as well.</p><p>0758</p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Tobias Levkovich with us, Chief US Equity Strategist, Citi Research. We'll talk to him about this equity market that go, go, goes.</p><p/><p>David Kirkpatrick in celebration of every big tech IPO, thank you so much for joining me it seems, every time--</p><p/><p>DAVID KIRKPATRICK, BLOOMBERG CONTRIBUTING EDITOR: Oh I thought you just had me because my last name was Kirkpatrick.</p><p/><p>KEENE: No, well very good. Happy Scotland to you this morning. When I look David at the Alibaba experience, everybody's going to gain a pop. From a tech standpoint, what does Fidelity or BlackRock or Capital Guardian Trust in Los Angeles, what do these big hitters do with their shares if we see the pop I think we're going to get?</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: I don't know what you mean by from a tech standpoint.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Well from your perspective they're not going to sell are they?</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: I would not sell. I mean I think this is a company with a lot of profits which is one reason why those ratios are so favorable. And I think it is a company that has tremendous prospects. On the other hand we could talk about as we go on, there are a complicated set of issues with a company that's truly Chinese that's trying to operate globally competing with these American colossi. And you know a company that has a lot of interesting issues about finance and it's operating in a banking business.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Right. Did Fidelity buy, to just use one name, did they acquire Alibaba because of the Chinese and Asian experience or did they buy them because they think they're going to compete in the United States?</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: I think it's both. I mean China is a continuingly huge market opportunity for Alibaba and all the Chinese internet companies. And the ratio of Chinese who are on the internet is way more than in the United States.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's still under 50% of all Chinese even on the internet. Alibaba completely dominates--</p><p/><p>KEENE: Yeah.</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: Online e-commerce in China. So there's an opportunity there. And they want to go global.</p><p/><p>KEENE: And you know Adam within this conversation we're going to see it open, there's going to be the green shoe with some 15% of shares.</p><p/><p>ADAM JOHNSON, HOST, BLOOMBERG TELEVISION: Right.</p><p/><p>KEENE: This is a different beast to institutions than any other deal you and I have seen. We've never seen this.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Well for starters it's the biggest one. And if that green shoe that you talk about actually is incorporated into the deal, it will be the biggest ever in history, globally. I understand from that point of view David, just the sheer size, why a Fidelity has to be there. It's that big.</p><p/><p>But what matters more the fact that it's that big or the fact that, in other words selling more products than Amazon and eBay or the fact that it actually can grow from here?</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well I mean obviously you want growth if you buy stock. So clearly that's the most important thing.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: In other words don't think of this as a dividend play or we've got to own it just because it's big.</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: No. I think this is a bet on the future of the global internet and connectivity as a driving force for the global economy. And Alibaba is as well-positioned as anybody for that. And that's the central force in the global economy.</p><p/><p>0611</p><p/><p>(BREAK)</p><p/><p>0619</p><p/><p>KEENE: I want to go to the froth of the moment. Let's bring up this archive photograph. This is a Surveillance archive, it's in our museum, the Surveillance museum here. There's Kirkpatrick on the left side and Kedrosky, Kirkpatrick's happier because he loaded the boat on Facebook at $38.</p><p/><p>SCARLET FU, HOST, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Look how young you are Tom.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Yeah I'm the dork in the middle (inaudible). This was a (inaudible) moment. Compare the froth of this moment versus what you and Paul Kedrosky helped me with that day with Facebook.</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: That's an interesting question Tom because for years I've been fascinated by the Chinese internet. I've been to China a lot, I'm lucky that way. And I've, but for years talking about it, people are like Ali- who? Ten-what?</p><p/><p>KEENE: Yeah.</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: You know they just didn't focus on it. It's astonishing to me that the world has focused as completely on this recently obscure company as they have. I don't think it's inappropriate. Comparing it to Facebook, in the US it's not nearly comparable because ordinary Americans were bananas over Facebook IPO. And as many of the articles have pointed out most ordinary Americans still haven't even heard of Alibaba.</p><p/><p>But could I just weigh in on a couple of these key points?</p><p/><p>KEENE: Please.</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: First of all, you know, regulatory risk is not even the word I'd use. It's like executive fiat. That's the way China works. And if you look at how Tencent, Alibaba's biggest rival just got a banking license to be a private bank, one of the first private banks that's ever existed in China. There are only a couple ever. And Alibaba wanted one. They haven't gotten it yet. So those kinds of things are where you really can't predict what happens.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Fabulous.</p><p/><p>FU: All right lots of unknowns there. David Kirkpatrick one of our guest hosts for the hour and Don Straszheim, thank you so much, Don of ISI.</p><p/><p>DONALD STRASZHEIM, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, ISI CHINA RESEARCH TEAM: Scarlet, good, you're welcome.</p><p/><p>FU: Joining us this morning.</p><p/><p>0620</p><p/><p>(BREAK)</p><p/><p>0652</p><p/><p>KEENE: Does everybody realize David Kirkpatrick just cuts into the line this morning? Right up front?</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: I can't hold a 6 Plus it's too big for me. I would never want it.</p><p/><p>KEENE: You're not going to get a 6 Plus?</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: No I would not consider it.</p><p/><p>FU: The Asian David Kirkpatrick would.</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's not going to go in my pocket.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: It's a small iPad.</p><p/><p>KEENE: It's a mini-mini. I like that the mini-mini. I want a mini-mini.</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: I want a phone. Thank you.</p><p/><p>0653</p><p/><p>(BREAK)</p><p/><p>0742</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: With us David Kirkpatrick author of \"The Facebook Effect.\" So there's clearly some sort of iPhone 6 effect going on here David. What distinguishes the iPhone 6 from everything that's come before that would cause people to wait in lines of up to 13 blocks?</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well clearly people have been convinced by the Android ecosystem that a bigger phone is what they want. And I'm not even sure. I think it's surprising how much enthusiasm this was, I'll tell you though as somebody with an iPhone 5, if the battery life is better I'll be happy. Maybe it's simply that.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Joshua Tapolsky says that's the number one thing.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Battery life.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Head of our digital operation, Tapolsky with a--</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: OK so I'm not so far off then.</p><p/><p>KEENE: No the battery's everything.</p><p/><p>FU: Consumers in Asia are the ones who really like the larger phones, the phablets as they call them. And this is the market that Apple and every other manufacturer is trying to grow.</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: I've been surprised that the bigger model is supposedly selling faster.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Yeah I like the phrase a mini-mini.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: And the other--</p><p/><p>KEENE: It's a mini-mini.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: It's a mini iPad mini.</p><p/><p>KEENE: It's a mini-mini.</p><p/><p>0743</p><p/><p>(BREAK)</p><p/><p>0744</p><p/><p>KEENE: Here's a reality financially. David Kirkpatrick revenue growth at Apple up 79%, up 66%, up 45%, up 9%, up 5%. There's a trend there to a big blue chip, 5%, 6% revenue growth. Which is important here, the mass and the size of the existing Apple or do they really need to get marginal growth out of these two products?</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: I think they're both important. I mean this product is clearly remaking their image. I think it's, for whatever reason, they are, it's way beyond fashion. But fashion is an important part of it. Android has gigantic market share but it really is a way second class product system than what Apple has. I think Apple has reasserted it's capability to be the dominant technology producer in the world.</p><p/><p>FU: And a lot of people believe it because they're lining up as well.</p><p/><p>0745</p><p/><p>(BREAK)</p><p/><p>0750</p><p/><p>FU: David Kirkpatrick?</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well you know it's also Safra Catz who's really been--</p><p/><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: Sort of quietly the COO for a long, long time.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Fair, fair.</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: And I honestly don't think that Larry Ellison's really stepping away that far. He's a guy that loves to sail. He loves to build Japanese houses. You know he is clearly; he has been somewhat off the campus for some time. But he's now going to be Executive Chairman and CTO. He's not going away.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Scarlet he bought Lanai, one of the beautiful islands in Hawaii--</p><p/><p>FU: Yes he did.</p><p/><p>KEENE: From David Murdoch. He's buying Taiwan next week.</p><p/><p>FU: Probably.</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: He could.</p><p/><p>FU: Well Safra Catz is going to be one of the CEOs, the other one of course Mark Hurd. This Co-CEO arrangement Steve, I've got to wonder, isn't it a recipe for disaster? Deutsche Bank had co-CEOs and it hasn't worked out very well.</p><p/><p>STEVEN ODLAND, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE COMMITTEE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: Well there's an old saw that everybody deserves only one boss. In this case the company has two. But I suspect that they're going in understanding very clearly what the lines of division are in terms of who's going to focus on what. And I think the point is right, that Larry's not going away.</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: He will adjudicate if there's any issues with the (inaudible).</p><p/><p>KEENE: Can I ask you guys about cloud? I mean Oracle, John Chambers--</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: That's the question.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Cisco and others, David Kirkpatrick, make us smarter on this.</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well honestly this is the one thing you have to ask about Oracle, they have done a great job getting service revenues from the companies that they acquired with this annuity (ph) thing.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: But the real annuity in enterprise software going forward is long-term contracts for cloud revenue where you don't have to, where the customer has a way more advantageous position because they don't have to make a big upfront payment. And that's where the industry has gone with salesforce and others and Oracle is not there to the same degree.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Isn't that what we saw with semis where the way to make money in semiconductors is become a fabulous semi, you just design the things and you subcontract to other people.</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's a good analogy actually yeah. But I think Oracle is making the shift but they're making it slowly because they have such an incredible business in the old legacy business model.</p><p/><p>ODLAND: You know one thing that people don't understand and as a CEO at Office Depot I put in the Oracle Suite, it took years to get it in. You don't want to take that thing out. So people say, well he's building a business--</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: That's a key point.</p><p/><p>ODLAND: You're building the business on these acquisitions. But these acquisitions create this linear integrated system that is very sticky. And it's hard to move.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: And by the way every year you had to pay additional amounts of money to \"update it\" et cetera.</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: Enterprise software is the roach motel is the ultimate goal.</p><p/><p>FU: But that was preferable to having to go to the cloud. Shift everything over to a brand new platform wasn't it?</p><p/><p>ODLAND: No that's right. These transformations are really expensive and really dangerous and hard.</p><p/><p>KEENE: I want to rip up the script here. I learn things on Twitter.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Yep.</p><p/><p>KEENE: And one of our listeners and viewers sent in a brilliant Twitter response. Why wouldn't Alibaba and Amazon do some kind of JV? Steve? Is that feasible?</p><p/><p>ODLAND: Look I think, why is Jack Ma here meeting every major CEO and financier in town? Why is he spending so much time in America when it's a Chinese IPO? I think the answer is that his focus is not just on China. His focus is on the US next.</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's also because he's not selling sharing shares to people in China by the way. They can't even buy this offering. That's one of the oddities of this whole thing. But I do think a JV with Amazon is not out of the question.</p><p/><p>I think Jack Ma is the kind of opportunist in a good way, that would allow him to consider anything.</p><p/><p>KEENE: It gives Bezos immediate international expansion right?</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well it could, I would, Bezos is not, I would be more surprised if Bezos did it than if Jack Ma did it.</p><p/><p>KEENE: OK fair.</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: Bezos is not the kind of guy who likes to share the spotlight. Or who likes to really let somebody else make any decisions for him. Amazon more than almost any tech company has always wanted to do everything itself.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: All right so that's the theoretical. Let's get practical here. Your Office Depot that you ran through what, 2010, what does Alibaba mean for brick and mortar companies like Office Depot?</p><p/><p>ODLAND: Well what people don't realize is that the office product stores, Office Depot and Staples, were the third and fourth largest internet retailers in the world. And so you know, there's, bricks and mortar have really increased their business.</p><p/><p>So Alibaba is an access point I think for bricks and mortar retail into China, like Amazon had become an access point with their stores within a stores. It could be a big growth vehicle for a lot of American companies.</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: Interestingly one of the big trends in the Chinese internet is that Alibaba, Tencent and other companies are making investments in bricks and mortar. And in fact they're starting to build infrastructures that include offline delivery; both Alibaba and Tencent have been doing things with gas stations, with retail stores, where they build partnerships with cross ownership.</p><p/><p>FU: Yeah it's not something that you hear about too much. This move into the whole physical space here for these companies.</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's a whole new development.</p><p/><p>0754</p><p/><p>(BREAK)</p><p/><p>0757</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: Let's face it Apple technology is still way better.</p><p/><p>KEENE: The ecosystem.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: OK is that honest, is that an analytical quantitative or qualitative--</p><p/><p>KIRKPATRICK: I think it's both. I think all the evidence shows that Apple has a better design systems. People like it better. The software, hardware integration is way, dramatically better. Because that's the problem that Android has. The hardware and software is not controlled by the same people.</p><p/><p>FU: I know Steve is going to, right after Surveillance, break out to the Apple Store because someone's holding his place in line right?</p><p/><p>KEENE: Can we say thank you to our team? What a great set of guests today.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p/><p>KEENE: Adam Posen was lousy, other than that.</p><p/><p>FU: Oh come on. Steve Odland, thank you so much.</p><p/><p>JOHNSON: Our producers outdid themselves today.</p><p/><p>FU: Former CEO of Office Depot. David Kirkpatrick as well.</p><p/><p>0758</p><p/><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p/><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Tobias Levkovich with us, Chief US Equity Strategist, Citi Research. We'll talk to him about this equity market that go, go, goes.</p><p>David Kirkpatrick in celebration of every big tech IPO, thank you so much for joining me it seems, every time--</p><p>DAVID KIRKPATRICK, BLOOMBERG CONTRIBUTING EDITOR: Oh I thought you just had me because my last name was Kirkpatrick.</p><p>KEENE: No, well very good. Happy Scotland to you this morning. When I look David at the Alibaba experience, everybody's going to gain a pop. From a tech standpoint, what does Fidelity or BlackRock or Capital Guardian Trust in Los Angeles, what do these big hitters do with their shares if we see the pop I think we're going to get?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I don't know what you mean by from a tech standpoint.</p><p>KEENE: Well from your perspective they're not going to sell are they?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I would not sell. I mean I think this is a company with a lot of profits which is one reason why those ratios are so favorable. And I think it is a company that has tremendous prospects. On the other hand we could talk about as we go on, there are a complicated set of issues with a company that's truly Chinese that's trying to operate globally competing with these American colossi. And you know a company that has a lot of interesting issues about finance and it's operating in a banking business.</p><p>KEENE: Right. Did Fidelity buy, to just use one name, did they acquire Alibaba because of the Chinese and Asian experience or did they buy them because they think they're going to compete in the United States?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I think it's both. I mean China is a continuingly huge market opportunity for Alibaba and all the Chinese internet companies. And the ratio of Chinese who are on the internet is way more than in the United States.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's still under 50% of all Chinese even on the internet. Alibaba completely dominates--</p><p>KEENE: Yeah.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Online e-commerce in China. So there's an opportunity there. And they want to go global.</p><p>KEENE: And you know Adam within this conversation we're going to see it open, there's going to be the green shoe with some 15% of shares.</p><p>ADAM JOHNSON, HOST, BLOOMBERG TELEVISION: Right.</p><p>KEENE: This is a different beast to institutions than any other deal you and I have seen. We've never seen this.</p><p>JOHNSON: Well for starters it's the biggest one. And if that green shoe that you talk about actually is incorporated into the deal, it will be the biggest ever in history, globally. I understand from that point of view David, just the sheer size, why a Fidelity has to be there. It's that big.</p><p>But what matters more the fact that it's that big or the fact that, in other words selling more products than Amazon and eBay or the fact that it actually can grow from here?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well I mean obviously you want growth if you buy stock. So clearly that's the most important thing.</p><p>JOHNSON: In other words don't think of this as a dividend play or we've got to own it just because it's big.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: No. I think this is a bet on the future of the global internet and connectivity as a driving force for the global economy. And Alibaba is as well-positioned as anybody for that. And that's the central force in the global economy.</p><p>0611</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0619</p><p>KEENE: I want to go to the froth of the moment. Let's bring up this archive photograph. This is a Surveillance archive, it's in our museum, the Surveillance museum here. There's Kirkpatrick on the left side and Kedrosky, Kirkpatrick's happier because he loaded the boat on Facebook at $38.</p><p>SCARLET FU, HOST, BLOOMBERG NEWS: Look how young you are Tom.</p><p>KEENE: Yeah I'm the dork in the middle (inaudible). This was a (inaudible) moment. Compare the froth of this moment versus what you and Paul Kedrosky helped me with that day with Facebook.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: That's an interesting question Tom because for years I've been fascinated by the Chinese internet. I've been to China a lot, I'm lucky that way. And I've, but for years talking about it, people are like Ali- who? Ten-what?</p><p>KEENE: Yeah.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: You know they just didn't focus on it. It's astonishing to me that the world has focused as completely on this recently obscure company as they have. I don't think it's inappropriate. Comparing it to Facebook, in the US it's not nearly comparable because ordinary Americans were bananas over Facebook IPO. And as many of the articles have pointed out most ordinary Americans still haven't even heard of Alibaba.</p><p>But could I just weigh in on a couple of these key points?</p><p>KEENE: Please.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: First of all, you know, regulatory risk is not even the word I'd use. It's like executive fiat. That's the way China works. And if you look at how Tencent, Alibaba's biggest rival just got a banking license to be a private bank, one of the first private banks that's ever existed in China. There are only a couple ever. And Alibaba wanted one. They haven't gotten it yet. So those kinds of things are where you really can't predict what happens.</p><p>KEENE: Fabulous.</p><p>FU: All right lots of unknowns there. David Kirkpatrick one of our guest hosts for the hour and Don Straszheim, thank you so much, Don of ISI.</p><p>DONALD STRASZHEIM, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, ISI CHINA RESEARCH TEAM: Scarlet, good, you're welcome.</p><p>FU: Joining us this morning.</p><p>0620</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0652</p><p>KEENE: Does everybody realize David Kirkpatrick just cuts into the line this morning? Right up front?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I can't hold a 6 Plus it's too big for me. I would never want it.</p><p>KEENE: You're not going to get a 6 Plus?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: No I would not consider it.</p><p>FU: The Asian David Kirkpatrick would.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's not going to go in my pocket.</p><p>JOHNSON: It's a small iPad.</p><p>KEENE: It's a mini-mini. I like that the mini-mini. I want a mini-mini.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I want a phone. Thank you.</p><p>0653</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0742</p><p>JOHNSON: With us David Kirkpatrick author of \"The Facebook Effect.\" So there's clearly some sort of iPhone 6 effect going on here David. What distinguishes the iPhone 6 from everything that's come before that would cause people to wait in lines of up to 13 blocks?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well clearly people have been convinced by the Android ecosystem that a bigger phone is what they want. And I'm not even sure. I think it's surprising how much enthusiasm this was, I'll tell you though as somebody with an iPhone 5, if the battery life is better I'll be happy. Maybe it's simply that.</p><p>KEENE: Joshua Tapolsky says that's the number one thing.</p><p>JOHNSON: Battery life.</p><p>KEENE: Head of our digital operation, Tapolsky with a--</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: OK so I'm not so far off then.</p><p>KEENE: No the battery's everything.</p><p>FU: Consumers in Asia are the ones who really like the larger phones, the phablets as they call them. And this is the market that Apple and every other manufacturer is trying to grow.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I've been surprised that the bigger model is supposedly selling faster.</p><p>KEENE: Yeah I like the phrase a mini-mini.</p><p>JOHNSON: And the other--</p><p>KEENE: It's a mini-mini.</p><p>JOHNSON: It's a mini iPad mini.</p><p>KEENE: It's a mini-mini.</p><p>0743</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0744</p><p>KEENE: Here's a reality financially. David Kirkpatrick revenue growth at Apple up 79%, up 66%, up 45%, up 9%, up 5%. There's a trend there to a big blue chip, 5%, 6% revenue growth. Which is important here, the mass and the size of the existing Apple or do they really need to get marginal growth out of these two products?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I think they're both important. I mean this product is clearly remaking their image. I think it's, for whatever reason, they are, it's way beyond fashion. But fashion is an important part of it. Android has gigantic market share but it really is a way second class product system than what Apple has. I think Apple has reasserted it's capability to be the dominant technology producer in the world.</p><p>FU: And a lot of people believe it because they're lining up as well.</p><p>0745</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0750</p><p>FU: David Kirkpatrick?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well you know it's also Safra Catz who's really been--</p><p>KEENE: Yes.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Sort of quietly the COO for a long, long time.</p><p>KEENE: Fair, fair.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: And I honestly don't think that Larry Ellison's really stepping away that far. He's a guy that loves to sail. He loves to build Japanese houses. You know he is clearly; he has been somewhat off the campus for some time. But he's now going to be Executive Chairman and CTO. He's not going away.</p><p>KEENE: Scarlet he bought Lanai, one of the beautiful islands in Hawaii--</p><p>FU: Yes he did.</p><p>KEENE: From David Murdoch. He's buying Taiwan next week.</p><p>FU: Probably.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: He could.</p><p>FU: Well Safra Catz is going to be one of the CEOs, the other one of course Mark Hurd. This Co-CEO arrangement Steve, I've got to wonder, isn't it a recipe for disaster? Deutsche Bank had co-CEOs and it hasn't worked out very well.</p><p>STEVEN ODLAND, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE COMMITTEE FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: Well there's an old saw that everybody deserves only one boss. In this case the company has two. But I suspect that they're going in understanding very clearly what the lines of division are in terms of who's going to focus on what. And I think the point is right, that Larry's not going away.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: He will adjudicate if there's any issues with the (inaudible).</p><p>KEENE: Can I ask you guys about cloud? I mean Oracle, John Chambers--</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: That's the question.</p><p>KEENE: Cisco and others, David Kirkpatrick, make us smarter on this.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well honestly this is the one thing you have to ask about Oracle, they have done a great job getting service revenues from the companies that they acquired with this annuity (ph) thing.</p><p>KEENE: Right.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: But the real annuity in enterprise software going forward is long-term contracts for cloud revenue where you don't have to, where the customer has a way more advantageous position because they don't have to make a big upfront payment. And that's where the industry has gone with salesforce and others and Oracle is not there to the same degree.</p><p>JOHNSON: Isn't that what we saw with semis where the way to make money in semiconductors is become a fabulous semi, you just design the things and you subcontract to other people.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's a good analogy actually yeah. But I think Oracle is making the shift but they're making it slowly because they have such an incredible business in the old legacy business model.</p><p>ODLAND: You know one thing that people don't understand and as a CEO at Office Depot I put in the Oracle Suite, it took years to get it in. You don't want to take that thing out. So people say, well he's building a business--</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: That's a key point.</p><p>ODLAND: You're building the business on these acquisitions. But these acquisitions create this linear integrated system that is very sticky. And it's hard to move.</p><p>JOHNSON: And by the way every year you had to pay additional amounts of money to \"update it\" et cetera.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Enterprise software is the roach motel is the ultimate goal.</p><p>FU: But that was preferable to having to go to the cloud. Shift everything over to a brand new platform wasn't it?</p><p>ODLAND: No that's right. These transformations are really expensive and really dangerous and hard.</p><p>KEENE: I want to rip up the script here. I learn things on Twitter.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yep.</p><p>KEENE: And one of our listeners and viewers sent in a brilliant Twitter response. Why wouldn't Alibaba and Amazon do some kind of JV? Steve? Is that feasible?</p><p>ODLAND: Look I think, why is Jack Ma here meeting every major CEO and financier in town? Why is he spending so much time in America when it's a Chinese IPO? I think the answer is that his focus is not just on China. His focus is on the US next.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's also because he's not selling sharing shares to people in China by the way. They can't even buy this offering. That's one of the oddities of this whole thing. But I do think a JV with Amazon is not out of the question.</p><p>I think Jack Ma is the kind of opportunist in a good way, that would allow him to consider anything.</p><p>KEENE: It gives Bezos immediate international expansion right?</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Well it could, I would, Bezos is not, I would be more surprised if Bezos did it than if Jack Ma did it.</p><p>KEENE: OK fair.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Bezos is not the kind of guy who likes to share the spotlight. Or who likes to really let somebody else make any decisions for him. Amazon more than almost any tech company has always wanted to do everything itself.</p><p>JOHNSON: All right so that's the theoretical. Let's get practical here. Your Office Depot that you ran through what, 2010, what does Alibaba mean for brick and mortar companies like Office Depot?</p><p>ODLAND: Well what people don't realize is that the office product stores, Office Depot and Staples, were the third and fourth largest internet retailers in the world. And so you know, there's, bricks and mortar have really increased their business.</p><p>So Alibaba is an access point I think for bricks and mortar retail into China, like Amazon had become an access point with their stores within a stores. It could be a big growth vehicle for a lot of American companies.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Interestingly one of the big trends in the Chinese internet is that Alibaba, Tencent and other companies are making investments in bricks and mortar. And in fact they're starting to build infrastructures that include offline delivery; both Alibaba and Tencent have been doing things with gas stations, with retail stores, where they build partnerships with cross ownership.</p><p>FU: Yeah it's not something that you hear about too much. This move into the whole physical space here for these companies.</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: It's a whole new development.</p><p>0754</p><p>(BREAK)</p><p>0757</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: Let's face it Apple technology is still way better.</p><p>KEENE: The ecosystem.</p><p>JOHNSON: OK is that honest, is that an analytical quantitative or qualitative--</p><p>KIRKPATRICK: I think it's both. I think all the evidence shows that Apple has a better design systems. People like it better. The software, hardware integration is way, dramatically better. Because that's the problem that Android has. The hardware and software is not controlled by the same people.</p><p>FU: I know Steve is going to, right after Surveillance, break out to the Apple Store because someone's holding his place in line right?</p><p>KEENE: Can we say thank you to our team? What a great set of guests today.</p><p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p><p>KEENE: Adam Posen was lousy, other than that.</p><p>FU: Oh come on. Steve Odland, thank you so much.</p><p>JOHNSON: Our producers outdid themselves today.</p><p>FU: Former CEO of Office Depot. David Kirkpatrick as well.</p><p>0758</p><p>[*] ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***</p><p>THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN MISSPELLINGS AND OTHER INACCURACIES.

Known as the General Data Protection Regulation, it's ambitious, well-intentioned and largely wrongheaded. As it comes into force, Europe should be mindful of unintended consequences - and open to change when things go wrong.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">No one could say the GDPR lacks purpose. At more than 260 pages long, it articulates dozens of goals in the service of \"a strong and more coherent data protection framework.</p><p>Meeting these ambitions will be the job of companies - wherever they're located - that process the data of European citizens. Among other things, they'll need to obtain consent from users; explain how their data will be used; allow people to see what's been swooped up; and permit them, at any moment, to withdraw their consent or demand that their data be deleted.</p><p>Given the public backlash against data collection - and support for the GDPR's stated goals - this approach might seem reasonable. But look more closely and the drawbacks are glaring.</p><p>Most obvious are the costs. By one estimate, big multinationals will spend $7.8 billion simply preparing for the GDPR. They'll need to hire compliance staff, compile voluminous documentation, handsomely pay lawyers and consultants, and in many cases rethink their business models and retool their technologies. Failure to comply could result in fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue.</p><p>Surely Facebook and Google can afford such costs, you might say. Yet this, too, is a problem: The GDPR is likely to advantage big tech companies at the expense of smaller ones. Few small businesses will be able to fully comply with these rules, while many of them will suffer from having less effective advertising. Europe's dearth of notable startups will hardly improve.</p><p>Worse, the rules could impede innovation. Many blockchain companies could be shut out entirely. Cloud computing may become substantially more complicated. Systems that rely on artificial intelligence could in many cases be incompatible with the GDPR's mandates. It's an ominous sign that Facebook has already started pulling some data projects from Europe.</p><p>Yet all this is more or less by design; there will also be unintended consequences. Although the GDPR aims to improve data security, for instance, its privacy rules may compromise a crucial tool used by security researchers, thereby increasing spam, phishing attacks and malware.</p><p>Its compliance costs could inhibit cybersecurity investment. Its emphasis on obtaining consent for data collection is, in practice, likely to mean endless \"click to proceed boxes that leave customers little more informed - and significantly more irritated - than before.</p><p>For all these drawbacks, the EU deserves credit for illuminating - and attempting to resolve - a very real problem. European law enshrines a right to privacy. Yet the digital economy depends on invasive data collection. In forcing matters, the GDPR makes plain a worldwide tension: People have come to expect free online services as well as unencumbered privacy. Unfortunately, they can't have both.</p><p>There are many ways to approach this dilemma, and no solution will be universal. But in general, the goals should be transparent pricing and more competition. The GDPR's requirement that personal information be \"portable - that a user can take her data from one service to another that treats it more responsibly - is on the right track. It would be even better to encourage companies to explicitly charge for privacy, which would give users a better sense of what their data is worth and ensure that their consent is more informed.</p><p>As Europe leaps into the unknown on this issue, it must be alert to the many downsides of its approach, and prepared to rethink things that aren't working. If it is, it could help the rest of the world think more clearly about a defining problem of the information age.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHRGAZ-2018133536</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHRGAZ2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SB1-MH81-JCB7-1014-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146813</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"654\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Charleston Newspapers</copyright><publicationName>Charleston Gazette-Mail</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"05\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>May 13, 2018, Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

To stay ahead, it?s taking the unusual step of renouncing its venture capital status--and making even bigger, riskier bets.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Emerging from the financial crisis in 2009, Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz laid out their campaign to take on Silicon Valley. The pitch deck for their first venture capital fund that year promised to find a new generation of \"megalomaniacal\" founders--ambitious, assertive, singularly focused--who would, in the mold of CEO Steve Jobs, use technology to \"put a dent in the universe.\" In getting behind the likes of Facebook and Twitter, with a war chest that swelled into the billions, they proceeded to do exactly that. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Perched on a couch in his office at Andreessen Horowitz's headquarters in Menlo Park, California, Andreessen, whose Netscape browser and subsequent company IPO were touchstone moments of the digital age, understands that the original word choice doesn't land so well in 2019. His new take: \"The 21st century is the century of disagreeableness,\" he says, sitting down with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Forbes</emphasis> for his first extended interview in two years. In an era of hyper-connectivity, social media and information overload, he says, those \"disagreeables\" will challenge the status quo and create billion-dollar companies. Ego is out, anger--or dissidence, at least--is in.</p><p>If that's an equally unpleasant prospect, consider Andreessen, who's 47, the perfect messenger. From showy check-writing to weaponizing his popular blog and (before Trump) Twitter account to hiring an army of operational experts in a field built on low-key partnerships, he's one of Silicon Valley's poster boys for upending the rules . And it's worked: In one decade, Andreessen Horowitz joined the elite VC gatekeepers of Silicon Valley while generating $10 billion-plus in estimated profits, at least on paper, to its investors. Over the next year or so, expect no less than five of its unicorns--Airbnb, Lyft, PagerDuty, Pinterest and Slack--to go public.</p><p>\"What's the number one form of differentiation in any industry? Being number one,\" lectures Andreessen, who--at 6-foot-5 with a shaved dome that his wife, philanthropist Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, has been known to lovingly call \"my egg\"--carries himself with a brio to match his words.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Staying number one, however, is even harder</emphasis> than getting there. Optimism that technology will transform the world for the better has soured with each successive Facebook data scandal (Andreessen, an early investor, still sits on Facebook's board). Every revelation of social media's tendency to foster society's worst forces poses a challenge to his and his firm's trademark techno-evangelism. And in the conference rooms of Sand Hill Road, stakes in the next Instagram, Twitter or Skype--three of its best-known early deals--are no longer the upstart VC firm's for the taking. Today there are a record number of rival billion-dollar funds and a newer kid on the block in SoftBank, which, armed with a $100 billion megafund, makes them all--Andreessen Horowitz included--look quaint. And one thing about saying you're going to fix a broken industry--you create plenty of competitors who won't hesitate to capitalize on even a whiff of doubt that you can back up the hype with results. </p><p>And so Andreessen and Horowitz, who rank 55th and 73rd, respectively, on this year's Forbes Midas List, intend to be disagreeable themselves. They just finished raising a soon-to-be announced $2 billion fund (bringing total assets under management to nearly $10 billion) to write even bigger checks for portfolio companies and unicorns the firm missed the first time. More aggressively, they tell Forbes that they are registering their entire firm--all 150 people--as financial advisors, renouncing Andreessen Horowitz's status as a venture capital firm entirely.</p><p>Why? Well, venture capitalists have long traded a lack of Wall Street-style oversight for the promise that they invest mainly in new shares of private companies. It was a tradeoff firms gladly made--until the age of crypto, a type of high-risk investment the SEC says requires more oversight. So be it, says Andreessen Horowitz. By renouncing its venture capital status, it'll be able to go deeper on riskier bets: If the firm wants to put $1 billion into cryptocurrency or tokens, or buy unlimited shares in public companies or from other investors, it can. And in doing so, the thinking goes, it'll again make other firms feel like they have one hand tied behind their back. </p><p>\"What else are feathers for? They just like to get ruffled,\" Andreessen says with a smirk. \"The thing that stands out is the thing that's different.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">From the beginning,</emphasis> Andreessen Horowitz had a simple credo: \"We wanted to build the venture capital firm that we always wanted to take money from,\" Horowitz says. Andreessen, whose Netscape breakthrough landed him on the cover of Time by age 24, didn't need the fame. And neither needed the money. Colleagues at Netscape, they then cofounded a company that eventually became Opsware, run by Horowitz, who sold it to HP in 2007 for $1.7 billion. </p><p>Before founding their venture firm two years later, the pair dabbled in angel investing, where they gained a rebellious reputation, at least by the khakis-and-button-down standards of the Sand Hill Road crowd. Andreessen helped popularize startup advice through his \"pmarca\" blog, the spiritual predecessor of his Twitter stream, which became known for its surprise 140-character micro-essays on subjects from economic theory to net neutrality. (He's widely credited with popularizing the term \"Tweetstorm.\") Horowitz, meanwhile, had a reputation for his ability to cite rap lyrics and his fandom for the relatively rough-and-tumble Oakland Raiders.</p><p>To build their VC firm, Andreessen and Horowitz modeled their brand strategy not on the industry's elite but on Larry Ellison's Oracle and its aggressive marketing during the enterprise software wars. They embraced the media, hosted star-studded events and badmouthed traditional venture capital to anyone who would listen. And while they started with small seed checks to companies like Okta (now valued at $9 billion) and Slack ($7 billion), they ignored traditional wisdom and gobbled up shares of companies like Twitter and Facebook when those companies were already valued in the billions. For one investor in their funds, Princeton University's chief investment officer Andrew Golden, it became a running joke how long it would take for other firms to complain about Andreessen Horowitz. \"In the early days, it was within two minutes,\" he says.</p><p>Buoyed by prior exits and some scrimping, Andreessen and Horowitz reinvested their money in the business, whose structure was modeled more on a Hollywood talent agency than a traditional venture capital firm. Neither drew a salary for years, and new general partners at the firm took lower salaries than is typical. Instead, much of its fees, the traditional 2% of funds managed that covers all of a firm's expenses, went into a fast-growing services team, including experts in marketing, business development, finance and recruiting. Need to raise another funding round? Andreessen Horowitz specialists would give you \"superpowers,\" helping write your presentation, then coaching you through dozens of dry runs before scheduling the meets. Need a vice president of engineering? The firm's talent team would identify and tap the best search firm, monitor its effectiveness and help choose the best candidate for the job. Human re\u00adsources problem? Accounting crisis? \"If something is going off the rails, you have the 'Batphone,'?\" says Lea Endres, the CEO of NationBuilder, which makes software for nonprofit and political campaigns.</p><p>And at the firm's executive briefing centers at headquarters and in a New York satellite office, Andreessen Horowitz staff played matchmaker, enticing big corporations and government agencies with the prospect of seeing cutting-edge tech, then lining up relevant portfolio startups to present to the visitors. GitHub, the open-source-code repository the firm backed in 2012 before it was acquired by Microsoft for $7.5 billion, found the briefings so lucrative--good for $20 million in new recurring revenue in 2015 and 2016--that it posted a junior staffer to hang around the Andreessen Horowitz office full-time, its sales chief says. Consumer startups like the grocery delivery unicorn Instacart (a 2014 investment that now has a $7.9 billion valuation) scored partnerships with national retailers and food brands. On a recent visit in March, a dozen startups filed through one by one to meet with the Defense Innovation Unit, the branch of the Department of Defense that helps U.S. armed forces find and pay for new technologies. The day before, it was Hachette Book Group. \"We've had companies where it's 40% to 60% of their pipeline, and I'm like, whoa, wait, we are not your sales force,\" says Martin Casado, an enterprise-focused general partner at the firm who sold his Andreessen Horowitz-backed startup, Nicira, for $1.3 billion.</p><p>The formula worked. The firm's first and third flagship funds, $300 million and $900 million, respectively, are already expected to return five times their money to investors, sources say. Its $650 million second fund and $1.7 billion fourth fund are expected to return three times their investment capital, good for the top quartile of firms, and are expected to climb. A $1.6 billion fifth fund, from 2016, is too young for estimated returns. </p><p>While they may be unwilling to credit Andreessen Horowitz publicly, other firms have clearly followed suit. From bloggers and podcast experts to resident finance officers and security experts, the number of non-investor professionals in the venture industry has swelled in recent years. \"The idea of providing services, that feels like a table-stakes item now,\" says Semil Shah, general partner at venture firm Haystack. \"A lot of firms copied that.\" At Okta, cofounder Frederic Kerrest says he's routinely approached by other firms curious about building their own briefing centers to compete. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">All this crowing and nose-thumbing</emphasis> has made enemies. Other investors never forgot how Andreessen Horowitz claimed the business was broken and it alone had the recipe to fix it. Almost from the beginning, gossip about the firm overpaying for deals was rampant, enough so that when Andreessen and Horowitz set out to raise their third main fund in 2012, the partners had to check every position with their port\u00adfolio companies so they could disprove the notion with their investors.</p><p>Meanwhile, their failed investments--and there have been high-profile ones, including Clinkle, Jawbone and Fab--and big missteps like Zenefits get magnified. Andreessen Horowitz's well-publicized view, one it still holds, was that what matters is not how many companies you back that fail but how many become massive, outlier successes. Andreessen argues that only 15 deals per year generate all the returns, and he's intent on seeing all the hot deals first.</p><p>Swinging for home runs magnifies whiffs, and Andreessen Horowitz blew the highest-profile Midas-list mover of recent years: Uber. The firm doesn't admit to it now, but several sources with knowledge of the fundraising reveal just how close the firm was to getting a big stake--before letting it slip through its grasp. The until-now mostly untold story: In the fall of 2011, Uber's \u00adcofounder Travis Kalanick was raising a red-hot Series B funding round and was keen to have Andreessen Horowitz lead. The firm, Andreessen in particular, was just as hungry to make it happen. By early October, Kalanick was calling other firms to tell them he had a handshake in place with Andreessen and another partner at a value somewhere around $300 million. At the 11th hour, however, the firm blinked. It would still invest, but with a structure that would value Uber at significantly less--$220 million, not counting the investment or an employee option pool, according to an email from Kalanick obtained by <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Forbes</emphasis>.</p><p>\"They tried to surprise us,\" Kalanick wrote his investors. \"So here we are. The next phase of Uber begins.\" Kalanick instead turned to Menlo Ventures--which until then was being used as a stalking horse for leverage--and accepted its $290 million price pre-deal.</p><p>While Andreessen Horowitz backed Uber rival Lyft in 2013 and has already cashed out some of those shares at a profit, the firm wasn't done with Uber. It participated in merger discussions between the two ride-hailing companies in 2014 and again in 2016, according to sources involved in the talks. If the deal had gone through, it would have given the firm a backdoor route to a piece of Uber. Either way, it's hard to ignore Uber as the one that got away. The ride-hailing company, now valued at $76 billion, is getting ready for an IPO that could be four or fives times larger than Lyft's. Andreessen Horowitz declined to comment on Uber.</p><p>Andreessen Horowitz's leadership has taken other raps. It was slow to diversify its management ranks--as recently as last year's Midas List, all ten general partners, the people who actually control investments and write checks, were men--in part because it had a rule that GPs were required to be ex-startup founders and couldn't rise up from the inside. In the past year they've added three women GPs but not before bleeding top talent.</p><p>Andreessen himself was caught on the wrong side of a fast-changing cultural climate in Silicon Valley in the months leading up to the election of Donald Trump in 2016, responding chummily by tweet to the now-banned far-right troll Milo Yiannopoulos, and seeming to joke, after India refused a new Facebook service, that the country might have fared better under colonial rule--earning a rare scolding from Mark Zuckerberg. In response, Andreessen became a digital recluse, deleting most of his past tweets. Andreessen says the purge wasn't due to the backlash against his Facebook positions, though \"that didn't help\"; rather, he blames \"the general climate,\" specifically in politics and culture. He may come back, he says, when things \"go back to normal,\" perhaps in 2020.</p><p>Both Andreessen and Horowitz have quieted down their bluster in recent years. Andreessen admits that, contrary to what they maintained when they were Young Turks, \"venture capital wasn't an industry in crisis,\" but says it doesn't matter how the firm got to its top-tier position. Horowitz goes further. \"I kind of regret it, because I feel like I hurt people's feelings who were perfectly good businesses,\" he says. \"I went too far.\" As for the firm's hiring rules, which contributed to its failure to add a woman GP, he admits it was hard for him to change something that had been such a core part of the firm's outward-facing identity. \"It's a kind of a big thing for especially me to eat crow on,\" he says. \"It took probably longer than it should've to change it, but we changed it.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Earlier this spring, a small group</emphasis> of Andreessen Horowitz executives gathers in a bright little conference room at its headquarters for a pitch meeting with a pair of founders from a low-profile but in-demand biotech company. The twist: The VCs are pitching the entrepreneurs, with operating team leaders advertising their own services to the startup, a health diagnostics company still in stealth mode. The entrepreneurs appear skeptical. When they met Andreessen Horo\u00adwitz two years ago, after it wrote a small check in their seed round, the firm didn't have much to offer bio startups. So for the next hour, they're treated to example after example of how Andreessen Horowitz has added dedicated experts and connections to companies like UnitedHealth and Kaiser Permanente over the past 18 months. \"We've found that a biotech company in Silicon Valley is really different from building just a tech company,\" Shannon Schiltz, the firm's technical talent chief, says.</p><p>This reverse pitch is emblematic of the new-version Andreessen Horowitz. Besides turning the typical venture capital process on its head, the firm is investing in biotech, which it once said it would never touch. But scale and the pursuit of challengers to the status quo means pushing into new areas, and the firm has raised $650 million across two funds for the sector. \"The brand doesn't carry the weight in bio that it does in the tech community yet,\" says Jorge Conde, a general partner since 2017. \"But we've made a concerted effort and planted the flag.\" Specialists like Conde, who led strategy for Syros, a public genetics company, and cofounded a genome startup, are now the norm. Partners meet in committees by topic three times a week to evaluate deals, then convene as one firm on Mondays and Fridays to review likely investments.</p><p>Which brings us to crypto. Last year the firm raised a $350 million fund in the up-and-down area. But until recently partners Chris Dixon and Katie Haun would meet in private with Horo\u00adwitz, their fund technically a separate legal entity from the rest of the firm. That meant they had different emails addresses and their own website, because of legal constraints on funds that register as traditional VCs. While Andreessen Horowitz was an early investor in crypto marketplace Coinbase and was one of many firms to catch cryptocurrency fever in 2017, it's one of the few that doubled down even after the price of bitcoin and ether flatlined. SEC regulations consider such investments \"high risk\" and limit these stakes, as well as secondary purchases and fund or token investments, to no more than 20% of a traditional VC fund.</p><p>So Andreessen Horowitz spent the spring embarking on one of its more disagreeable moves so far: The firm renounced its VC exemptions and registered as a financial advisor, with paperwork completed in March. It's a costly, painful move that requires hiring compliance officers, audits for each employee and a ban on its investors talking up the portfolio or fund performance in public--even on its own podcast. The benefit: The firm's partners can share deals freely again, with a real estate expert tag-teaming a deal with a crypto expert on, say, a blockchain startup for home buying, Haun says.</p><p>And it'll come in handy when the firm announces a new growth fund--expected to close in the coming weeks, a source says--that will add a fresh $2 billion to $2.5 billion for its newest partner, David George, to invest across the portfolio and in other larger, high-growth companies. Under the new rules, that fund will be able to buy up shares from founders and early investors--or trade public stocks. Along with a fund announced last year that connects African-American leaders to startups, the new growth fund will give Andreessen Horowitz four specialized funds, with more potentially to follow.</p><p>That's how the firm plans to keep up in a crowded VC landscape that experts say is bifurcating between specialist seed funds and a handful of giant, all-purpose firms. Traditional firms face more pressure than ever from the top and bottom of the funnel because of more sophisticated angel investor groups and non-VC giants like SoftBank's Vision Fund, says Ilya Strebulaev, a Stanford professor who studies the industry. \"Venture capital is in flux,\" he says. \"We should expect a lot of fundamental changes.\"</p><p>Some are inevitable, like the industry's wising up to the Andreessen Horowitz playbook of using services as a deal sweetener. Or the inherent limits to the Andreessen Horowitz model, which will always require large and growing funds to cover expenses. Others are fixable, like mixed report cards from former operating employees. High pay isn't enough for ambitious, younger staff to stick around long when there's little chance of upward mobility, they say. And with veterans of Andreessen and Horowitz's old company, Opsware, still spread throughout the firm, the sense that some employees get special treatment--and are immune to sanction--can sap morale. Meanwhile, the firm's insistence on calling everyone a partner, even its most junior talent or accounting managers, might seem harmless, or an annoyance for others in the industry at worst. But if those titles are limiting the prospects of promotion and career growth, as one former partner notes, they may need to be retired like the firm's old GP rule.</p><p>Most risky: Being the best-known VC firm on the block, or the one competitors mock until they copy, won't matter if sweeping changes come for the entire industry. The world continues to wake up to the degree of power and influence big tech companies like Facebook and Google have over society--from livestreaming video of the Christchurch, New Zealand, mass shooter to YouTube videos that have united far-flung white nationalists--and to the likelihood they haven't fully owned up to their responsibilities. Against such changing tides, the historical VC narrative of hypergrowth and Zuckerberg-like ambitions may fall flat.</p><p>In a choice that could be equal parts intransigence or naivet\u00e9, Andreessen invokes Facebook's CEO as precisely the example of the kind of disagreeable founder who has the resolve to take the necessary, wrenching steps to make things right. \"He just put out this memo talking about basically reinventing Facebook around privacy and messaging,\" Andreessen says in March. \"Just close your eyes and imagine a classic guy in a suit doing that.\"</p><p>And though Andreessen says he's too busy running the firm to have any hobbies--he's reminded he has a young son now, too--he gives his own, grander twist to a quote from one of his favorite new TV shows, HBO's Succession , to describe the mindset necessary to pull it off: \"If you can't ride two elephants at the same time, what are you doing at the circus?\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Founders</emphasis><br/> MARC ANDREESSEN<br/> BEN HOROWITZ </p><p>When Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz founded their eponymous firm in 2009, they gave up any salary to help afford a growing team. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Old Guard</emphasis><br/> ALEX RAMPELL<br/> PETER LEVINE<br/> MARTIN CASADO<br/> SCOTT KUPOR<br/> JEFF JORDAN</p><p>Scott Kupor and Jeff Jordan, two of the firm's longest-running general partners along with Peter Levine, are in charge of fundraising and coaching new GPs.

Big Tech\u2019s leaders faced members of the US Congress this week and failed to present a convincing case that they have not been led by self interest to tilt the digital playing field in their own favour.</p><p>Jeff Bezos, in his first appearance at a congressional hearing, was caught off guard. He admitted he didn\u2019t know if Amazon\u2019s employees were misusing the data of independent merchants who are meant to be partners. He declared it \u201cunacceptable\u201d that some people at his company might have deliberately promoted counterfeit goods to generate advertising sales. And he seemed genuinely puzzled that Amazon had delisted a small independent bookseller without explanation.</p><p>For anyone whose livelihood depends on Amazon\u2019s powerful online platform, it didn\u2019t inspire confidence that they would always get a fair deal.</p><p>Mr Bezos\u2019 peers at Apple, Alphabet and Facebook, with more experience of political hearings, were better able to parry the criticisms from the House antitrust subcommittee and fall back on platitudes. But they still came across as prevaricating and defensive in the face of an attack by Democratic representatives that was, against the odds, surprisingly effective. Taking on a handful of powerful companies over a range of complex issues, particularly with the distraction of a Republican minority more interested in using the hearing to score political points, was never going to be easy.</p><p>But if the event helped to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/f3cb3da3-a306-4557-9d6f-ed519230bc81\"> shine a light</url> on some of the ways the most powerful tech platforms have cemented their position, and how they have become a more hostile place for some of the independent developers, merchants and publishers who depend on them, it did not highlight many obvious abuses open to immediate action. The most palpable hit came against Facebook: Internal communications revealed how Mark Zuckerberg sees acquisitions as an effective way to neutralise potential competitors, and how start-ups fear that if they reject a Facebook buyout he will go into \u201cdestroy mode\u201d against them.</p><p>Other internal documents unearthed by the committee showed executives at the leading tech companies grappling with how to use their formidable platforms to buttress their positions in fast-changing tech markets. Google insiders worried about how to fend off competition on the way to erecting what Democratic critics called a \u201cwalled garden\u201d. As one executive opined: \u201cThe open web we knew &amp; loved is going away.\u201d But if this was the most damning evidence the politicians could dig out of the 1.3m internal documents they amassed, Big Tech probably doesn\u2019t have too much to fear.</p><p>This leaves the Techlash pretty much where it was before this week\u2019s hearing: with growing political and regulatory pressure for action, but a shaky legal foundation on which to seriously challenge Big Tech\u2019s dominance and an uncertain political outlook.</p><p>The regulatory challenge is certainly building. The UK\u2019s Competition and Markets Authority might have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/b63d23b2-5068-49f4-9a89-4808c323a5c2\"> ducked the issue</url> earlier this month by not recommending a full investigation of digital advertising, but others are making their cases.</p><p>The European Commission <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/aba45bc9-ffc8-411e-ac29-dbb3171f4886\"> seems ready </url>to resist Google\u2019s acquisition of Fitbit without strict ringfencing of users\u2019 health data. Australia\u2019s consumer and competition regulator has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mi-3.com.au/27-07-2020/accc-v-google\"> just sued </url>the search company for misleading users over how it combines data for ad targeting. It also suggested that the company\u2019s control of many parts of the adtech value chain put it in an unfair position \u2014 an issue that US states are also looking into.</p><p>How much appetite Brussels will have for a fresh offensive against Big Tech is another question. The successful appeal against the huge fine levied over Apple\u2019s tax position in Ireland has dented the reputation of digital commissioner Margrethe Vestager and left a question over her aggressive tactics.</p><p>The US Department of Justice, by contrast, is seemingly ready to plough ahead with a complaint against Google, in what would be its most significant tech case since challenging Microsoft more than two decades ago. Bill Barr\u2019s justice department has antagonised Democrats with its backing for some of President Trump\u2019s more controversial policies, but this could be one issue that brings the two sides together.</p><p>For Mr Barr, a case against Google would be a good way to show off the potency of the current antitrust laws, and underline the conservative argument that there is no need to enact tougher legislation against big business. And with a presidential election looming in which the Democratic candidate has emerged a clear favourite in the polls, the potential damage from mounting a risky case has diminished.</p><p>Democrats, meanwhile, can take heart from this week\u2019s hearing if they hope to clip Big Tech\u2019s wings. But a Biden White House would face far more pressing issues, starting with a combined health and economic crisis of historic magnitude. There\u2019s also the growing urgency among voters to take on profound issues of social and racial justice \u2014 not to mention climate change.</p><p>For the billions of people who post or search on their sites, buy their phones, and shop in their online malls, Big Tech is still hugely popular. It is an open question how much political will there will be to put serious restraints on the industry.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:richard.waters@ft.com\">richard.waters@ft.com</email></emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-722ad47fe9e14b6c88569dc2f82510fe</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GJ-P811-DXP9-900M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"905\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 31, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The beneficaries are from Silicon Valley.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Australia's $8.8 billion digital advertising market could be entering a two-speed economy with blue chip advertisers notably more tempered in their online spending versus small and medium-sized companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The online advertising sector grew 11.6 per cent to $8.8 billion in calendar 2018, accounting for a record 54 per cent of the total Australian advertising sector, the latest Online Advertising Expenditure report from the IAB and PwC shows.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But ad spend data from Standard Media Index (SMI), which tracks $7.2 billion in annual advertising investment from media agencies, tells a different story. Media agencies control most of the media budgets for large brand owners. </p><p>According to SMI, blue chip advertisers increased their online spending through media agencies at half the growth rate (5.8 per cent) of the 11.6 per cent increase in the IAB-PwC report. Large advertisers spent $2.07 billion in online channels in 2018 but their 5.8 per cent increase last year is a near halving of their online spending through media agencies in 2017 (up 10.1 per cent). </p><p>According to SMI, blue chip advertisers are allocating 28.5 per cent of their total advertising budgets to online channels, compared to online's 54 per cent marketshare in the IAB-PwC figures.</p><p>SMI managing director Jane Ratcliffe said the vast difference in figures was due to the IAB-PwC figures capturing spending across the SME sector. </p><p>\"Clearly national marketers have very different objectives to their small business counterparts,\" Ms Ratcliffe said. \"Agencies continue to allocate the bulk of their client ad spend to television (41.3 per cent) with digital representing 28.5 per cent of all national marketer media spend.\"</p><p>Still, many local online publishers large and small, are not witnessing the 11.6 per cent online advertising growth rate outlined in the IAB-PwC report for 2018. </p><p>They argue the growth is going primarily to the advertising duopoly of Facebook and Google, which the World Advertising Research Centre (WARC) forecast last month would snatch 61.4 per cent of the $287.4 billion global online ad market in 2019 between them. </p><p>WARC forecasts the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/business/media-and-marketing/cmo-brief/accc-warns-advertisers-to-engage-more-on-google-facebook-inquiry-20190228-h1bt6r\">worldwide online advertising sector will decline 7.2 per cent in 2019</url>, excluding Google and Facebook, but the two online giants will collectively grow 22 per cent globally this year to account for $176 billion in advertising revenues. </p><p>\"If you dig deeper into the IAB numbers you'll see all the upside is in Google and Facebook,\" said Bohemia Group managing director, Brett Dawson. \"That's just the lay of the land now. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/business/media-and-marketing/cmo-brief/marketers-addicted-to-the-cheap-reach-of-facebook-google-20190307-h1c37s\">We've got two big players with all the data,</url> they're really easy to buy and they're bloody cheap. Others simply don't stand a chance in the current environment. Regulation might help but I don't see that happening in the near term.\"</p><p>Mr Dawson said more mergers and acquisitions in the Australian media sector could also help local media companies and smaller publishers compete with Google and Facebook's dominance. \"We've seen News Corp and Seven get together to have a run at data and Nine's takeover of Fairfax,\" he said. \"It doesn't get you around [lower] pricing or ease of transacting though.\"</p><p>IAB CEO Gai Le Roy said there were bright spots for local media in online video and editorial-style \"native content\" but acknowledged many local and international media groups - digital \"pureplay\" publishers included - had not experienced the headline 11.6 per cent online advertising growth in the IAB's report. </p><p>\"It is tough for many in the market and we hear that regularly,\" she said. \"We're trying to find new ways for diversity and sustainability in our market. It is very important a range of players survive for the future of media and the industry.\" </p><p>Ms Le Roy said the online advertising industry's double-digit growth was \"definitely favouring players\" that could \"easily service a wide range of advertisers\". She said the online ad market was also favouring those with \"strong video offerings.\"</p><p>Ms Le Roy pointed to the TV industry's fast-growing broadcast video on demand (BVOD) category as an example of a growth hot spot although some TV executives said BVOD was at about half the $250 million category it should be. Overall, online video advertising grew 26.2 per cent last year to $1.4 billion, according to the IAB and PwC. </p><p>However, short-form video advertising, once predicted to be a boom for local publishers, had proven a false hope as Facebook and Google gained marketshare in the fast-growing category.</p><p>\"Short-form video is completely commoditised,\" said one publisher who did not want to be named. \"It's been gouged by Facebook and YouTube as a complete substitute. The market is overlooking the effectiveness of video advertising in professionally created content environments for price and questionable metrics. Facebook secondary crediting for a video view is zero seconds but people are still throwing money on social.\"</p><p>The IAB's Australian board is a challenging one for industry policy development and measurement standards. Facebook and Google both sit on the IAB board along with local publishers such as Nine, News Corp, REA, Seven West Media and Verizon Media. </p><p>Ms Le Roy said a two-speed online advertising economy, in which human-free, self-service advertising platforms offered by the big tech players had proven hugely popular with SMEs, was challenging for Australian media companies. She said the market was seeing some counter offensives from large media groups like News Corp and Nine.</p><p>\"Definitely small businesses without agencies are going to self-service platforms, which is a challenge and an opportunity for media companies,\" she said. \"We're seeing developments like Nine's Galaxy service come into play where smaller advertisers can access [advertising] inventory.\"</p><p>Sign up <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>here for CMO Brief's weekly newsletter edition</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> on global and local conversations, perspectives and trends for the chief marketing officer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFRONL-1030179136</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFRONL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMR-VMR1-JBJ7-N1B0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429670</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"983\"/><timeReceived>12:04 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

It also provides a line of portable digital music players, as well as related accessories and services, including online sale of third-party audio and video products.

In addition, Apple Inc.offers various third-party Macintosh and iPod compatible products, such as application software, printers, storage devices, speakers, headphones, and other accessories and supplies. </p><p>The company provides an online service to distribute third-party music, audio books, music videos, short films, television shows, movies, and iPod games.

No credit card needed!</p><p>Foundry is among the most recent companies to conclude internal probes that were launched last year as part of a huge crackdown on the practice of changing the dates on grants to pump up the value of the stock option. From a press release dated Friday June 15, 2007.</p><p>Dozens of companies were pulled under an accounting spotlight that has helped reveal rampant backdating practices, but to date there have been few glaring legal ramifications. For the most part, the whole backdating issue remains a minor annoyance for investors.</p><p>In one of the higher profile cases, Apple and its CEO Steve Jobs were cleared in April by the SEC of any backdating charges after the company concluded its own investigation. Apple's former finance chief Fred Anderson, however, agreed to pay back more than $3 million relating to a backdated option. He also paid a small fine to settle the SEC case without admitting any wrongdoing.</p><p>Some backdating cases took a different turn, as at Comverse where top executives have been charged with fraud related to option grants. Former Comverse CEO Kobi Alexander, ex-finance chief David Kreinberg and onetime senior general counsel William Sorin were charged in August with defrauding shareholders by backdating options.</p><p>Kreinberg and Sorin pleaded guilty charges of conspiracy to commit fraud. Kreinberg agreed to cooperate with federal prosecutors. Alexander fled to Namibia and was arrested there in September. He faces an extradition hearing later this month.</p><p>Foundry joins other big tech shops like Juniper and Broadcom that have now accounted for their backdating expenses. And if Apple's case is any indication, regulators may be willing to repeat the company's all clear sign.</p><p>More information on Apple Incavailable in the members section of www.BellwetherReport.com.</p><p>To review research on Apple Incas well as many more exciting articles we encourage you to visit www.bellwetherreport.com.

Even if Trump is somehow reelected, the wielders of power and influence \u2014 academia, media, Wall Street, Hollywood, the big-tech oligarchs, the dominant nonprofits, and the governmental apparat \u2014 will remain deep blue for the foreseeable future. The prospect of untrammeled progressive power, particularly with a malleable Joe Biden in the White House, may seem depressing for conservatives or even old-style liberals, who are concerned by the Left's increasingly censorious and authoritarian bent. </p><p>But there is also a silver lining of sorts. Everywhere blue policies \u2014 generally now referred to as 'progressive' \u2014 have prevailed, they have failed miserably, particularly for those parts of the population, such as the working class and minorities, that they purport to serve. Over time, these failures will open up an opportunity perhaps not for a resurgence of traditional conservatism but for a reshuffling of political loyalties away from those whose policies don't work. Many core constituencies associated with blue politics may become aware that their interests, prominent on the progressive menu, will never in reality be served. Ultimately, results, not memes, matter most. Progressives have demonstrated monumental incompetence in addressing everything from social equity to education, culture, and energy policy. Even in postmodern America, failure cannot forever be sold as success. The cry for greater equality, particularly for minorities, dominated the rhetoric of the 2020 Democratic National Convention. Hollywood, the corporate world, professional sports, academia, and the mainstream media are all being lured by the siren song of 'social justice,' but that song sounds nice and empathetic only until you look at the results. In analyzing the nation's 107 largest metropolitan regions (populations over 500,000), Wendell Cox, a demographer at the Urban Reform Institute, found that the worst places for minorities \u2014 judged by where ethnic populations are growing and how minorities do compared with whites in such areas as educational attainment and homeownership \u2014 are generally those metros that are bluest. The best, Cox found, are generally reddish or purple metros mainly in the South, Midwest, Great Plains, and desert Southwest. African Americans, for example, generally do best, as compared with whites, in southern metro areas, led by Atlanta, McAllen (Texas), Raleigh, El Paso, Nashville, and Virginia Beach. The other best places are Sun Belt cities such as Phoenix and heartland areas such as Des Moines and Kansas City. Among the large metros, only the Washington, D.C., metro, which includes parts of Virginia, Maryland, and West Virginia, and the Baltimore metro, with their large numbers of federal employees, make the top 20 for black progress. At the bottom are mostly deep-blue metropolitan areas such as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose, Chicago, and San Diego. Much the same pattern is seen with Latinos, for whom midwestern cities such as St. Louis, Columbus, Omaha, Kansas City, and Grand Rapids, and southern ones such as Atlanta, Virginia Beach, and Fayetteville (Ark.) all rate in the top 20. In contrast, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, San Jose, and Boston fall way to the bottom. Asians, although doing better generally, follow a very similar pattern, with Atlanta, Fayetteville (Ark.), Kansas City, St. Louis, and Cincinnati in the top five. New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco \u2014 long the Asian-American population centers \u2014 all cling to the bottom. One critical difference can be seen in homeownership, arguably the most essential mechanism for entering the middle class. African-American homeownership as a percentage of households reaches nearly one-half in Atlanta and nearly 45 percent in Charlotte and Nashville. By comparison, it is less than 35 percent in Los Angeles, Boston, and New York. Latino homeownership as a percentage of households exceeds 50 percent in Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth but is below 30 percent in New York and Boston. Perhaps most revealing of all is how minorities are voting with their feet. Over the past two decades, the growth in the number of African-American households has been the lowest in San Francisco, along with New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and New Orleans. Where are black populations growing? Since 2000, among the larger metropolitan areas (over 1 million population), Phoenix, Las Vegas, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Orlando, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Atlanta have seen an increase of 70 percent or more in black households \u2014 that is more than four times the national 15 percent increase in the black population over the same period. Consistent with trends beginning even before the coronavirus pandemic, smaller metropolitan areas \u2014 some with very small black-population bases \u2014 have had even greater increases in black households: for example, more than 200 percent in Boise (Idaho) and Fayetteville (Ark.), and at least 150 percent in Provo (Utah), Portland (Maine), and Scranton (Pa.). Similar patterns exist for Asians, whose median household income is 28 percent above the national average, and Latinos. Like African Americans, no matter their politics these two groups are generally headed away from progressive America and toward red regions and states, where taxes are more reasonable, regulation is less oppressive, and housing prices are lower.

Since 2000, among the larger metropolitan areas (over 1 million population), Phoenix, Las Vegas, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Orlando, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Atlanta have seen an increase of 70 percent or more in black households   that is more than four times the national 15 percent increase in the black population over the same period. Consistent with trends beginning even before the coronavirus pandemic, smaller metropolitan areas   some with very small black-population bases   have had even greater increases in black households: for example, more than 200 percent in Boise (Idaho) and Fayetteville (Ark.), and at least 150 percent in Provo (Utah), Portland (Maine), and Scranton (Pa.).

Even if Trump is somehow reelected, the wielders of power and influence \u2014 academia, media, Wall Street, Hollywood, the big-tech oligarchs, the dominant nonprofits, and the governmental apparat \u2014 will remain deep blue for the foreseeable future.    The prospect of untrammeled progressive power, particularly with a malleable Joe Biden in the White House, may seem depressing for conservatives or even old-style liberals, who are concerned by the Left\u2019s increasingly censorious and authoritarian bent. But there is also a silver lining of sorts. Everywhere blue policies \u2014 generally now referred to as \u201cprogressive\u201d \u2014 have prevailed, they have failed miserably, particularly for those parts of the population, such as the working class and minorities, that they purport to serve.    Over time, these failures will open up an opportunity perhaps not for a resurgence of traditional conservatism but for a reshuffling of political loyalties away from those whose policies don\u2019t work. Many core constituencies associated with blue politics may become aware that their interests, prominent on the progressive menu, will never in reality be served. Ultimately, results, not memes, matter most. Progressives have demonstrated monumental incompetence in addressing everything from social equity to education, culture, and energy policy. Even in postmodern America, failure cannot forever be sold as success.    The cry for greater equality, particularly for minorities, dominated the rhetoric of the 2020 Democratic National Convention. Hollywood, the corporate world, professional sports, academia, and the mainstream media are all being lured by the siren song of \u201csocial justice,\u201d but that song sounds nice and empathetic only until you look at the results.    In analyzing the nation\u2019s 107 largest metropolitan regions (populations over 500,000), Wendell Cox, a demographer at the Urban Reform Institute, found that the worst places for minorities \u2014 judged by where ethnic populations are growing and how minorities do compared with whites in such areas as educational attainment and homeownership \u2014 are generally those metros that are bluest. The best, Cox found, are generally reddish or purple metros mainly in the South, Midwest, Great Plains, and desert Southwest.    African Americans, for example, generally do best, as compared with whites, in southern metro areas, led by Atlanta, McAllen (Texas), Raleigh, El Paso, Nashville, and Virginia Beach. The other best places are Sun Belt cities such as Phoenix and heartland areas such as Des Moines and Kansas City. Among the large metros, only the Washington, D.C., metro, which includes parts of Virginia, Maryland, and West Virginia, and the Baltimore metro, with their large numbers of federal employees, make the top 20 for black progress. At the bottom are mostly deep-blue metropolitan areas such as New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Jose, Chicago, and San Diego.    Much the same pattern is seen with Latinos, for whom midwestern cities such as St. Louis, Columbus, Omaha, Kansas City, and Grand Rapids, and southern ones such as Atlanta, Virginia Beach, and Fayetteville (Ark.) all rate in the top 20. In contrast, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, San Jose, and Boston fall way to the bottom. Asians, although doing better generally, follow a very similar pattern, with Atlanta, Fayetteville (Ark.), Kansas City, St. Louis, and Cincinnati in the top five. New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco \u2014 long the Asian-American population centers \u2014 all cling to the bottom.    One critical difference can be seen in homeownership, arguably the most essential mechanism for entering the middle class. African-American homeownership as a percentage of households reaches nearly one-half in Atlanta and nearly 45 percent in Charlotte and Nashville. By comparison, it is less than 35 percent in Los Angeles, Boston, and New York. Latino homeownership as a percentage of households exceeds 50 percent in Houston and Dallas\u2013Fort Worth but is below 30 percent in New York and Boston.    Perhaps most revealing of all is how minorities are voting with their feet. Over the past two decades, the growth in the number of African-American households has been the lowest in San Francisco, along with New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and New Orleans. Where are black populations growing? Since 2000, among the larger metropolitan areas (over 1 million population), Phoenix, Las Vegas, Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul, Orlando, Dallas\u2013Fort Worth, and Atlanta have seen an increase of 70 percent or more in black households \u2014 that is more than four times the national 15 percent increase in the black population over the same period.     Consistent with trends beginning even before the coronavirus pandemic, smaller metropolitan areas \u2014 some with very small black-population bases \u2014 have had even greater increases in black households: for example, more than 200 percent in Boise (Idaho) and Fayetteville (Ark.), and at least 150 percent in Provo (Utah), Portland (Maine), and Scranton (Pa.).    Similar patterns exist for Asians, whose median household income is 28 percent above the national average, and Latinos. Like African Americans, no matter their politics these two groups are generally headed away from progressive America and toward red regions and states, where taxes are more reasonable, regulation is less oppressive, and housing prices are lower.

Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, welcomed Facebook's announcement it will remove misleading platform content about the U.S. census (see 1912190059). Senate Commerce Committee ranking member Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., said more needs to be done.</p><p>Facebook's decision is \"a good thing,\" Blumenthal told us. \"It is definitely a positive step.\" CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently testified that the platform doesn't fact-check political ads, so his census decision is seen as a shift in content moderation attitude. Facebook's decision came weeks after Twitter banned all political ads (see 1911010041) and Google announced limitations on political advertising microtargeting (see 1912020041).</p><p>Spotify announced Friday it will \"pause\" certain political ad sales starting in early 2020. This includes the company's content in its ad-supported tier and in Spotify original and exclusive podcasts, a spokesperson said: \"We do not yet have the necessary level of robustness in our processes, systems and tools to responsibly validate and review this content. We will reassess this decision as we continue to evolve our capabilities.\"</p><p>Zuckerberg's announcement isn't \"sufficient\" in itself, Cantwell told reporters: \"Facebook should be just like any other broadcaster. They should follow the same political advertising and messaging rules that a TV broadcaster has to follow.\"</p><p>\"It was a very good step, absolutely in the right direction,\" said Schatz. \"I like Google's policies with respect to this. I like what Twitter's doing. We have a long way to go, and I think we have to trust but verify. But I've been a real critic of these internet platforms and so let me take this opportunity to say that in this instance, they appear to be doing the right thing.\"</p><p>Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said he has \"grudging respect\" for Zuckerberg's attempts to \"support\" free speech. \"I still believe that government should not be put in charge of what people can post on the internet,\" he said. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., introduced legislation in June to remove Section 230 immunity for big tech companies unless they prove to the FTC every two years that content removal decisions are politically neutral (see 1906190047). Kennedy repeated his call for social media companies to form an independent body of respected, impartial experts to make decisions about content moderation.</p><p>\"You're not going to make everyone happy, but as long as people understand it's a fair, impartial, good-faith effort, they'll be a lot more supportive than the ad-hoc approach we're doing now,\" Kennedy said. \"And I think they'll certainly be more supportive than having the government involved.\"</p><p>Blumenthal told reporters he's aware that House Commerce Committee staffs released a privacy discussion draft (see 1912180052). \"Any of these ideas that add to the mix of very plausible and important proposals are welcome,\" he said.</p><p>The Senate's passage of robocall legislation the day after a House impeachment vote (see 1912190068) shows compromise is possible on privacy legislation, Blumenthal said. \"Bipartisanship still can work, even literally on the day after impeachment,\" he said, noting it took years to raise the issue of robocall legislation, which was \"equally controversial\" to privacy. Draft legislation ultimately drew bipartisan support and passed the Senate with a voice vote, he said.</p><p>Congress needs to continue working, not necessarily toward a date, Blumenthal said. It's only a matter of time with states moving forward with bills and industry not wanting to face a \"nightmare\" patchwork of state laws, he said. Asked if a new privacy agency would get support from Senate Republicans, Blumenthal said, \"I'm not sure it would get support from Democrats.\" An FTC with stronger resources, authority and oversight is the best outcome, he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWJ-Y5K1-DYRJ-017S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"637\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 30, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

I remain deeply troubled that federal regulators responsible for cracking down on anti-competitive practices seem asleep at the wheel, at great cost to American innovation and consumers. The DOJ and FTC must begin aggressively investigating Big Tech's potential antitrust violations and take necessary enforcement actions to deter more harmful behavior.\"</p><p>Blumenthal has repeatedly called on Amazon to take this step and demanded that federal regulators investigate the provisions used by Amazon and other online marketplaces. On December 20, 2018, Blumenthal wrote to the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice to demand an immediate investigation into price parity provisions in Amazon's contracts, and just last week, Blumenthal raised Amazon's price parity provisions and their impact on stifling competition at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on competition in the U.S. economy.</p><p>Prior to Amazon's decision today, the company required third-party merchants who sell products on its site to agree to price parity provisions - also known as most-favored nation clauses - that prohibited merchants who sell on Amazon from offering a lower price on other online marketplaces. As a result, merchants who sold their products on other sites with lower transaction fees were unable to pass on these savings to consumers. For example, if a competitor to Amazon charged lower commission fees to third-party merchants operating on its site, Amazon's price parity provision prohibited those sellers from reducing their prices to reflect the lower cost of selling through Amazon's competitor.

BNY Mellon on Thursday declined to say how widespread the problem was. Officials at the Federal Reserve were not available to comment. The bank provides payment services in more than 100 currencies through more than 2,000 correspondent bank accounts worldwide. </p><p>Known as a trust bank, BNY Mellon safeguards and keeps track of nearly US$26 trillion in assets for clients that include the largest asset managers, pension plans and corporations around the globe. The breakdown is the second major technology glitch to happen at BNY Mellon in the past 18 months. In August 2015, the mutual fund accounting system the bank relies on broke down and delayed how billions of dollars in assets were valued. The bank in March agreed to pay US$3 million to settle an investigation by Massachusetts' top securities regulator related to BNY Mellon's problems calculating net asset values on some 1,200 mutual funds. On Sunday afternoon, BNY Mellon began having problems processing clients' payment instructions, the bank confirmed on Thursday in a statement. BNY Mellon blamed the problems on its connection to SWIFT, a global financial messaging system that banks use for money transfer instructions. BNY Mellon processes about 160,000 global payments each day totaling an average of US$1.6 trillion, according to its financial disclosures. \"We became aware of an issue that impacted our ability to send messaging to and from the SWIFT network on Sunday afternoon, which we resolved by Monday morning,\" the bank said in a statement. BNY Mellon said on Thursday its system is fully functional and additional backup has been established to reduce the risk of future disruptions. The bank declined to comment on what caused the problems in the first place. Nancy Atkinson, senior analyst for Aite Group, said the outage at BNY Mellon would be considered a serious problem at any large financial services company. But investors seem to have shrugged off the problem as BNY Mellon shares have risen 2 percent this week. In a recent research paper, BNY Mellon executives noted how it has been more than 40 years since there has been a significant improvement in how U.S. domestic payments are processed. Earlier this year, SWIFT, which is known for handling international payments, was used by hackers to transfer US$81 million from Bangladesh's central bank to a bank in Manila. SWIFT officials were not available to comment about BNY's recent problems. \"While generally reliable, the process long used to move funds globally is fraught with familiar challenges related to timing, cost and transparency,\" BNY Mellon executives Tony Brady and Chris Mager wrote recently in a paper on modernizing global payment systems. The executives said cross-border payments may occur in the same day but can take up to four days to complete. And there's also a transparency problem for clients, they said. \"Generally, banks in the network cannot provide clients with real-time and precise information about payment status, including updates on when funds reach beneficiaries and the exact costs involved in end-to-end execution,\" according to the BNY Mellon research paper. For its part, BNY Mellon's senior executives have told analysts and investors on conference calls that it has been taking the lead to spark innovation in the global payments industry. The bank, for example, is participating in SWIFT's global payments innovation initiative to improve how money is moved across borders. The initiative is expected to go live early next year.

The revelations in the veteran reporter's new book are so stark and shocking because they flesh out a narrative that the president's critics have long advanced -- that he is simply not fit, by intellect, temperament, and knowledge, to be the most powerful man in the world. After yesterday's partisan turmoil over process, today democrats will dig in on the issues and don't plan to keep interrupting Chuck Grassley at today's Kavanaugh hearing. Instead, Democrats will grill Kavanaugh on abortion, the affordable care act, and executive power. Senator Angus King of Maine weighs in. Big Tech executives are coming to Capitol Hill today to testify about election meddling. Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Jack Dorsey, the CEO of Twitter, will appear before the Senate Intelligence Committee to discuss actions their companies have taken to thwart foreign influence campaigns targeting the 2018 midterm elections. President Trump is blasting Attorney General Jeff Sessions for indicting two Republican congressmen with financial crimes. Those Republican congressmen happen to be two of President Trump's biggest supporters.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">[07:30:00] MARC SHORT, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR, FORMER WHITE HOUSE DIRECTOR OF LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS: -- do I think want to portray something that sometimes isn't reality.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I think that this president operates --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: Yes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHORT: -- in a different. I don't think there's any doubt about that Alisyn, and he has a different operation structure.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But I think somewhere where the narrative is there's a chaos and there's dysfunction --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CAMEROTA: Yes.</p><p>SHORT: -- and it has to reconcile with the fact that you have a 4.2 percent GDP. You have the lowest unemployment rate in years.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Understood -- I understand all those accomplishments.</p><p>SHORT: You have --</p><p>CAMEROTA: But I mean, I'm just saying that --</p><p>SHORT: But, you don't. But, you don't, Alisyn because you're --</p><p>CAMEROTA: The thing -- because here -- hold on one second. I just want to focus on one thing that you just said. You're putting Bob --</p><p>SHORT: I know, you don't want to focus on accomplishments.</p><p>CAMEROTA: You're putting Bob Woodward in the same category as Omarosa.</p><p>SHORT: I'm saying there's been a series of books. I don't think there's any denial of that, right? There's been a fire --</p><p>CAMEROTA: Is Bob Woodward's book in a different category?</p><p>SHORT: I think that Bob Woodward's an acclaimed author. I don't think there's any doubt about that, Alisyn. CAMEROTA: And journalist.</p><p>SHORT: But I also think that there is a series of stories coming out that say here's a chaotic White House and there's a lot of discussion about the process.</p><p>And, in fact, when you have 99 percent of ISIS' territory that's been reclaimed --</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yes.</p><p>SHORT: -- a record number of regulations have been repealed. There's another Supreme Court justice that's about to be confirmed.</p><p>Unemployment at record lows. Taxes that have been reduced and the economy growing at a record rate.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Are you saying that all of the -- that the -- I understand.</p><p>SHORT: There has to be a reconciliation to say hey, maybe this is working OK.</p><p>CAMEROTA: OK, so the end justify the means to you.</p><p>SHORT: No, no. The end does not justify the means but perhaps there's a different process that people in this town are not used to seeing.</p><p>This is a president who is a non-traditional president. He does things a different way. That does not mean the end justifies the means --</p><p>CAMEROTA: OK.</p><p>SHORT: -- but I think there has to be reconciliation when there's all these stories about the chaos without saying hey, actually, there's significant accomplishments as well.</p><p>CAMEROTA: I hear you and you've made that point, but it's not just chaos. It sounds like there are people inside the White House very close to the president who were truly worried. Who have anxiety about the president's impulses and what it could mean for the country.</p><p>The staff secretary Rob Porter, whom you worked with, stole or hid documents, according to the quotes in this, from the president's desk on multiple occasions to protect national security.</p><p>Here's the quote from Rob Porter. \"A third of my job was trying to react to some of the really dangerous ideas that he had and try to give him reasons to believe that maybe they weren't such good ideas.\"</p><p>Are you saying Rob Porter is not telling the truth?</p><p>SHORT: I don't know that firsthand, Alisyn.</p><p>But here's -- last hour, you had a great segment with you and David in which you were talking about the South Korea element in this story and I think there's an important detail there.</p><p>This president does have a way of having -- putting out a position that's out here -- it's an outlier -- and having his staff argue out that position.</p><p>So he might say why are troops still in South Korea? Why, when they have a trade imbalance? Why are we protecting them when they aren't helping us out?</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yes.</p><p>SHORT: And it forces his staff to come say here's why we've been there since the Korean War. Here's the benefit to the United States.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yes.</p><p>SHORT: And it gets us to a good position.</p><p>CAMEROTA: I think that that -- look, ideally, that makes perfect sense -- the Socratic method of asking questions --</p><p>SHORT: Right.</p><p>CAMEROTA: -- but it doesn't sound like the people closest to the president think that's what's happening.</p><p>Here's what John Kelly has said. Quote, \"He's an idiot. It's pointless to try to convince him of anything. He's gone off the rails.</p><p>We're in Crazytown. I don't even know why any of us are here. This is the worst job I've ever had.\"</p><p>This is not what you're describing, Marc, of just a president who is knowledgeable and informed asking questions.</p><p>SHORT: No. What I'm saying is he puts out a position and has the staff argue out the position, and that's the way, often, he gets informed of a decision.</p><p>There's no doubt that John Kelly has an incredibly difficult job. I think we would all acknowledge that. And I know he's been frustrated many times.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Do you doubt that he has said these things?</p><p>SHORT: I have never heard -- I have never heard John Kelly call the president an idiot. I've certainly heard him express his frustrations in the job.</p><p>And he's a guy who has sacrificed an enormous amount for this country.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Yes.</p><p>SHORT: -- and he loved being in active service in the Marine Corps.</p><p>CAMEROTA: I have a question.</p><p>SHORT: So I know this is frustrating.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Did you know that Bob Woodward was working on a book?</p><p>SHORT: I had heard that Bob Woodward was working on a book. Bob Woodward never reached out to me. I didn't participate in the book.</p><p>CAMEROTA: Do you know if anyone mentioned this to President Trump and asked him if he wanted to participate because there's a dispute about this now?</p><p>SHORT: I don't know if anyone did. I don't think it's usually productive for the president to participate in these sorts of books because I don't think they ever turn out well for him.</p><p>But as far as information, I think he likes to be the decision maker and so there should have been a discussion to say he is writing a book. We suggest you not, but what do you want to do?</p><p>CAMEROTA: Well --</p><p>SHORT: That's usually the way I would handle it in legislative affairs. Like, here's my recommendation, Mr. President. What do you want to do?</p><p>CAMEROTA: And it sounds like that's what President Trump would have wished.</p><p>Here's a moment -- it's very fascinating to listen to this phone call between Bob Woodward and President Trump where President Trump says I wish I had known about it, I would have participated. And, Bob Woodward was making the case that he had told about a half-dozen people and asked for the president's participation.</p><p>And, President Trump saying what he thinks of Bob Woodward's reputation.</p><p>So listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It's really too bad because nobody told me about it and I would have loved to have spoken to you. You know I'm very open to you. I think you've always been fair. But we'll see what happens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAMEROTA: That's President Trump saying that he would have spoken to him and he's always been fair.</p><p>So do you believe what is in Bob Woodward's book?</p><p>SHORT: Alisyn, I've not read the book. I can't comment as to what I believe what's in there or not. CAMEROTA: But what you've heard, do you think that this is a -- that Bob Woodward is not in the same category as Omarosa and this is --</p><p>[07:35:04] SHORT: Of course not. Of course not.</p><p>Bob Woodward is an acclaimed author. I don't mean to make that accusation.</p><p>But I do think that there's been a series of books that come out that talk about the chaos and dysfunction without saying well, maybe this is, in fact, a different management style that is producing results.</p><p>CAMEROTA: OK.</p><p>Marc Short, we appreciate your insider's take on all of this. Thank you.</p><p>SHORT: Thank you, Alisyn.</p><p>CAMEROTA: John --</p><p>JOHN BERMAN, CNN ANCHOR: Interesting discussion there.</p><p>So what's the reaction of Bob Woodward's explosive new book on Capitol Hill? We're going to ask a U.S. senator about that and the Supreme Court confirmation process. That's next.</p><p>BERMAN: Bob Woodward's explosive new book \"Fear\" undeniably gripping the White House. The president and his allies trying to attack the credibility of award-winning journalist Bob Woodward.</p><p>CNN has spoken to at least a dozen former and current White House officials who tell us that they spoke to Woodward for his book.</p><p>Joining us now to discuss this and much more of what's going on on Capitol Hill, Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine. Senator King, thank you so much for being with us.</p><p>I want to talk about the Supreme Court confirmation process in just a moment, but I do want to get your reaction to what we've all seen and read over the last few days in this Bob Woodward book. It paints a picture of White House officials -- again, mostly in their words -- trying to protect the country from the president.</p><p>There's an episode where Gary Cohn, former financial adviser to the president, steals papers off his desk.</p><p>He says, \"I stole it off his desk. I wouldn't let him see it. He's never going to see that document. Got to protect the country.\"</p><p>What does it tell you that there are people close to the president that feel like they need to keep him from the country somehow?</p><p>[07:40:04] SEN. ANGUS KING (I-ME), MEMBER, SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTELLIGENCE: John, I'm afraid I'm going to disappoint you because I spent most of last night preparing for an important intelligence committee hearing today on Russian interference in the election and also trying to figure out what kind of judge Brett Kavanaugh is going to be.</p><p>So I haven't -- obviously, I haven't read the book. I haven't even looked at all the excerpts. I'm going to let you talk to other people, as you have been all morning, about that.</p><p>But I'm trying to keep my head down and do my job right here.</p><p>BERMAN: I appreciate that very much. Just before I go off this subject, Bob Woodward -- you know, you certainly have read his work for a long time.</p><p>KING: Sure.</p><p>BERMAN: I don't know if you know him or not, but any reason to doubt his reporting?</p><p>KING: Well, he certainly is -- as Marc Short just said, he's a distinguished reporter and a serious journalist. The only thing I can tell you for sure is I didn't get interviewed for the book.</p><p>So other than that, I think we're going to have to judge the book on its merits and see how it -- how the -- those people who are mentioned in the book respond and add it to the canon of literature about this presidency.</p><p>BERMAN: I understand you're going to sit in in the judiciary hearing today for the confirmation process of Judge Brett Kavanaugh.</p><p>You weren't there yesterday. I am sure you had a chance to see what happened, particularly at the beginning of the hearing with Democratic maneuvering to try to get the hearing stalled.</p><p>What did you make of that?</p><p>KING: Well, you know, it was unfortunate the way it unfolded yesterday but I really am sort of puzzled by the way this is -- this is being played out in terms of documents being produced.</p><p>I was in Maine over the weekend, as I always am, talking to people and people are starting to get suspicious. They're saying why aren't they releasing documents? What -- are they worried that something's in the documents? Do they know that something's in the documents?</p><p>I mean, we've got about 10 percent of all the material that this fellow had his hands on and wrote and produced, particularly during the period when he was in the Bush White House, and I don't think anybody watching us would do a job interview with somebody when you only had 10 percent of their resume and they said well, I'm not going to show you the rest of it.</p><p>It just -- there's something fishy here and it's the way the process is being rushed. I understand the frustration yesterday of a number of the senators given 42,000 pages of documents less than 24 hours from the hearing. I mean, the whole is just if you step back a minute makes no sense.</p><p>And what bothers me is this could be the precedent for future considerations of Supreme Court justices and I think that's a real mistake.</p><p>BERMAN: Let me ask --</p><p>KING: This is one of our fundamental responsibilities is advise and consent and I don't see how we're supposed to be able to do it without the records.</p><p>BERMAN: Let me break this into two parts, first of all on the issue of transparency.</p><p>So, when Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the committee -- Orrin Hatch, who is a senior member of that committee say this is the most transparent confirmation process they have ever seen, you're not buying it.</p><p>They also say that what matters here is Brett Kavanaugh's judicial record and you have a full record of the some 300 cases that he decided on in the appeals.</p><p>KING: I don't know if that's all that matters because those 300 cases were the cases that happened to come before his court. They don't necessarily reflect the breadth of his judicial thinking.</p><p>So I think you do need a broader record and you particularly need -- what was he thinking about, for example, presidential privilege, about torture, about detention of -- all of those issues that arose during the Bush administration. How did he approach those?</p><p>And that's -- this is our -- this is our fundamental job and I'm -- you know, I'm standing in the shoes of the people of Maine who want to know who is this guy.</p><p>He's -- this is a 30-year appointment. This is -- this guy's position on this court is going to be here when most of us are long gone and it's going to affect the country. This isn't a member of the cabinet.</p><p>BERMAN: Let me --</p><p>KING: This is a lifetime appointment and therefore, it's doubly important in my view.</p><p>BERMAN: Do you feel it was appropriate for the Democrats to try to slow down the hearing with as many interruptions as they had at the outset yesterday -- that chaotic hour?</p><p>KING: Well, you know, I'm a guy that believes in civility. But they weren't being given a chance to make the case and I think they had to raise this question.</p><p>In my view, the hearing should have been postponed. What's the rush? What is it that they're trying to move through to fast?</p><p>I've read, credibly, that Mitch McConnell warned the White House about Brett Kavanaugh because of the breadth of his record, because of the length of the time it was going to take to get all the materials together. And yet, they appointed him anyway.</p><p>But now they're starting to short-circuit the process by not producing all the information that I think we need in order to make a good decision.</p><p>BERMAN: So not only are you going to that hearing today but there's also a hearing in your committee, as you noted, about social media and the elections. Executives of Twitter and Facebook -- they're going to testify in relation to foreign actions and use of their platforms to influence the elections.</p><p>[07:45:02] What questions do you think are the most important to ask here?</p><p>KING: Well, I think the most important questions are how can the platforms navigate the First Amendment free society open information as opposed to the misuse of their platforms as they were, we now know, in 2016 to inform the American people about an upcoming election.</p><p>Our whole system is based upon information. The whole idea of democracy is that citizens can make decisions based upon information that they're given.</p><p>If the information is distorted, incorrect -- just outright lies -- then we end up with not being able to make the right decisions. So we need to understand and talk to these companies.</p><p>I don't want to regulate the Internet. I think that should be the last resort.</p><p>The question is what can the companies do to protect the integrity of their own platform, and I think that's what we're going to be talking about today.</p><p>BERMAN: Right.</p><p>KING: This is one of those rare congressional hearings where it's not rogue and everybody doesn't know the answers, and the members are going to just ask rogue questions. We're really looking for information here on how we can protect the American democratic system going forward.</p><p>BERMAN: All right. You have a busy day ahead of you.</p><p>Senator Angus King of Maine, thanks so much for being with us.</p><p>KING: Thank you, John.</p><p>CAMEROTA: OK, John.</p><p>President Trump ripping Attorney General Jeff Sessions for investigating two Republican congressmen who happen to be the president's first two supporters.</p><p>Has the Justice Department ever seen something like this before? We get a reality check.</p><p>[07:50:14] CAMEROTA: All right.</p><p>So, President Trump is blasting Attorney General Jeff Sessions for indicting two Republican congressmen with financial crimes. Those Republican congressmen happen to be two of President Trump's biggest supporters.</p><p>So what can history teach us here about this episode?</p><p>John Avlon is here with a \"Reality Check\" -- John.</p><p>JOHN AVLON, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Alisyn, yes, a short spoiler alert -- none of this is normal.</p><p>But we all know that President Trump spends a lot of time attacking his own Justice Department, but this recent tweet you mentioned rips up the principle of justice in a much more fundamental way.</p><p>Here's what he wrote.</p><p>\"Two long-running, Obama era investigations of two very popular Republican congressmen were brought to a well-publicized charge, just ahead of the midterms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department. Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time. Good job, Jeff.\"</p><p>Now, Trump is referring to the indictments of Congressman Chris Collins and Duncan Hunter on charges of insider trading and misusing campaign funds. Now, coincidentally, they are also the very first congressmen who endorsed candidate Trump.</p><p>Now, he's factually wrong here on this end, at least. Chris Collins' insider trading allegedly occurred in late June 2017, not exactly the Obama era.</p><p>But that is small ball compared to the much bigger problem. Trump seems to be again taking aim at the concept of impartial justice itself, suggesting that his Justice Department should take partisan politics into account.</p><p>Republican Sen. Ben Sasse raises the same red flag, writing, quote, \"The United States is not some banana republic with a two-tiered system of justice -- one for the majority party and one for the minority party.\"</p><p>But a quick look back shows that past Justice Departments were equal opportunity indicters when it came to corrupt members of Congress. It's not a complicated concept, folks. A Democratic crook should be the same as a Republican crook. For example, Democratic Representatives Jesse Jackson Jr., Chaka Fattah, Corrine Brown, and Anthony Weiner were all investigated during the Obama administration and convicted of various crimes ranging from tax fraud to sending obscene selfies to a minor -- charming stuff.</p><p>And how about the last time we had a Republican in the Oval Office? The same principle applied.</p><p>George W. Bush's administration saw arrests and convictions of Republican representatives Bob Ney, Duke Cunningham, and Bill Janklow.</p><p>And who could forget this guy?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JAMES TRAFICANT, JR. (D), OHIO: And what really frosts my pumpkin, experts around the country say to solve the problem, Congress should give them more money. Beam me up.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AVLON: Beam me up. I mean, what's not to love about Jim Traficant -- the hair, the jean blazer, the frosting of pumpkins? The 10 conviction counts, however, of bribery, racketeering, and tax evasion ultimately beamed Democrat Jim Traficant of Youngstown up to eight years in prison.</p><p>And just around this half of the last quarter-century, Bill Clinton's administration saw the conviction of Democrats like powerful Rep. Dan Rostenkowski for his role in the congressional post office scandal.</p><p>You get the idea. There are indictments and convictions of Republican and Democratic members of Congress all the time, unfortunately.</p><p>The Justice Department operates independently from partisan politics and electoral considerations. That's what helps keep our confidence in our system.</p><p>Now, other than guilty or professing their innocence, nowhere in any of these stories did anyone of real significance suggest that the wheels of justice should simply stop turning for political purposes, until President Trump.</p><p>As our own Jeff Toobin put it --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFFREY TOOBIN, CNN CHIEF LEGAL ANALYST: You know, this tweet alone may be an impeachable offense. This is such a disgrace. This is so contrary to the traditions of the Department of Justice.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>AVLON: And that's your \"Reality Check.\"</p><p>BERMAN: This is new, this is different. That's a great point. John Avlon, thanks so much.</p><p>Back to the negotiating table for the United States and Canada. Can they get a NAFTA deal done?</p><p>[07:58:18] BERMAN: Time for \"CNN Money Now.\"</p><p>The Trump administration set to sit down for an important round of trade talks with one of the U.S.' closest allies.</p><p>CNN chief business correspondent Christine Romans with that now -- Romans.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, CNN CHIEF BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT, ANCHOR, \"EARLY START\": Hey, John.</p><p>It's a critical day for the future of NAFTA. Talks resume between Canada and the U.S. The Canadian delegation heads to Washington with both sides dug in here.</p><p>President Trump has threatened to retaliate if Canada doesn't move quickly on U.S. demands. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau insists he will not sign a deal that's bad for Canada.</p><p>The U.S. reached a preliminary deal with Mexico last week but talks with Canada failed.</p><p>President Trump has said there is quote, \"No political necessity to keep Canada in NAFTA\" and warned Congress \"don't intervene.\"</p><p>U.S. business groups say the future of NAFTA needs to be a trilateral deal.</p><p>Among the disputes here, the U.S. demands more access to Canada's dairy market which, by the way, is a relatively small part of overall U.S.-Canadian trade.</p><p>But, Canada wants cultural exemptions for industries like dairy, and Canada wants a dispute resolution mechanism.</p><p>The U.S. has set on October first deadline to renegotiate NAFTA.</p><p>And ironically, John, a lot of trade experts point out many of these things that really bother the Trump administration or Donald Trump about the U.S.-Canada trade situation were resolved under TPP but the U.S. withdrew from that.</p><p>BERMAN: All right, Christine Romans, TPP looming large, even if in the rearview mirror.

A Lion Air flight went down in Indonesia in October killing 189 people. Boeing has been working on the automated anti-stall system that is believed to have caused that accident, but the inquiry into what led a second MAX 8 to nosedive on Sunday in Ethiopia is just beginning.</p><p> \"I believe that whatever the problems are will be temporary in nature provided Boeing acts quickly and decisively once the problems are known,'' says Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with Atmosphere Research Group.</p><p> But Boeing still has to work with investigators to come up with the definitive causes of both accidents, Harteveldt says, how they differ or mirror each other \"and then determine what can they do . . Is it an engineering problem? Is it a software problem? Is it a training problem?''</p><p> Black techies head south: Goodbye, Silicon Valley, hello, Atlanta: Black entrepreneurs part of new migration to South</p><p> Deals could bring on March Madness: March freebies: Your monthly guide to food specials, meal deals and more</p><p>Facebook strikes back: Facebook temporarily removes Elizabeth Warren ads about breaking up big tech</p><p> The most recent accident has led several countries and regions including the European Union and the United Kingdom to ground the jet, though the FAA has not issued a similar order in the U.S. And so far, U.S. carriers with the most Max's in their fleet are saying they plan to keep them in the air.</p><p> The 737 Max came on the scene in 2015, and though only 350 of the planes in its different variations are in service right now, more than 4,660 are in the pipeline as it has become Boeing's most coveted jet.</p><p> \"I would say it's the single most important product that Boeing has right now.'' Corridore says. \"It's the largest portion of what's in Boeing's backlog and on its production schedule . . . Nobody's ordering 737s any more. It's all 737 Max 7, 8 or 9.''</p><p>Boeing has rebounded from a crisis before. It's long-awaited Dreamliner, the first commercial jet to be primarily made of lightweight carbon composites instead of aluminum and steel, was grounded in January 2013 after a battery caught fire on one jet, and a smoldering battery forced an emergency landing of another.</p><p> But Boeing \"found a way to fix the problem and the 787 Dreamliner has continued to fly without incident,'' Harteveldt says</p><p> Southwest which operates 34 MAX 8 jets in its fleet of over 750 Boeing 737s remains \"confident in the safety and airworthiness of the MAX 8,'' said spokesman Dan Landson. \"We don't have any changes planned to our MAX 8 operations,''</p><p> American said Tuesday that it also continues to fly its 24 MAX 8 jets, and is waiting on the delivery of 16 more this year. Another 20 should be delivered in 2020 and 2021, and 40 are slated to join its fleet in 2024 \"and beyond.''</p><p> \"At this time there are no facts on the cause of the accident other than news reports,'' the airline said in a statement, adding that it is staying on top of the investigation into the Ethiopian crash, as it would any airplane accident. \"We have full confidence in the aircraft and our crew members.''</p><p> United doesn't fly the 737 MAX 8, but does have 14 737 MAX 9 jets which it says remain in operation.</p><p> Still, U.S. lawmakers such as Senator Elizabeth Warren (D- Mass.) and Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) have called on U.S. regulators to halt flights of the MAX 8, '\"so the pressure on Boeing and on Southwest is going to be immense,'' Corridore says.</p><p> Shares in Boeing were down 6.1 percent to $375.41 a share when markets closed Tuesday. But in after- hours trading, Boeing's stock price had a slight uptick to $376.20.</p><p> Even with its earlier dip, Boeing's stock price continued to outpace its performance at the end of 2018 when investors were worried about a looming trade war with China.</p><p> \"The stock was much lower and in fact it's still up for the year. year to date,,'' Corridore said.</p><p> This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Boeing 737 Max crash is latest crisis for plane maker, but it's rebounded before</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKMD-3290a54a7744a447ca986c31e838d0a0e4944a82</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C5FFB38D3AE NWBKMD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VMV-R0M1-DXVP-V0Y8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409144</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"775\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Herald-Mail.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

A Lion Air flight went down in Indonesia in October killing 189 people. <person><nameText>Boeing </nameText></person>has been working on the automated anti-stall system that is believed to have caused that accident, but the inquiry into what led a second MAX 8 to nosedive on Sunday in Ethiopia is just beginning.</p><p> \"I believe that whatever the problems are will be temporary in nature provided <person><nameText>Boeing </nameText></person>acts quickly and decisively once the problems are known,'' says Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with Atmosphere Research Group.</p><p> But <person><nameText>Boeing </nameText></person>still has to work with investigators to come up with the definitive causes of both accidents, Harteveldt says, how they differ or mirror each other \"and then determine what can they do . .

It's long-awaited Dreamliner, the first commercial jet to be primarily made of lightweight carbon composites instead of aluminum and steel, was grounded in January 2013 after a battery caught fire on one jet, and a smoldering battery forced an emergency landing of another.</p><p> But <person><nameText>Boeing </nameText></person>\"found a way to fix the problem and the 787 Dreamliner has continued to fly without incident,'' Harteveldt says</p><p> Southwest which operates 34 MAX 8 jets in its fleet of over 750 <person><nameText>Boeing </nameText></person>737s remains \"confident in the safety and airworthiness of the MAX 8,'' said spokesman Dan Landson. \"We don't have any changes planned to our MAX 8 operations,''</p><p> American said Tuesday that it also continues to fly its 24 MAX 8 jets, and is waiting on the delivery of 16 more this year. Another 20 should be delivered in 2020 and 2021, and 40 are slated to join its fleet in 2024 \"and beyond.''</p><p> \"At this time there are no facts on the cause of the accident other than news reports,'' the airline said in a statement, adding that it is staying on top of the investigation into the Ethiopian crash, as it would any airplane accident. \"We have full confidence in the aircraft and our crew members.''</p><p> United doesn't fly the 737 MAX 8, but does have 14 737 MAX 9 jets which it says remain in operation.</p><p> Still, U.S. lawmakers such as Senator Elizabeth Warren (D- Mass.) and Sen.

The controversial extradition bill that sparked the ongoing protests formally withdrawn. Reports now say that China is looking into replacing leader Carrie Lam. All the latest coming out of Hong Kong this morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then the NBA versus China. The season tips off with protests, while games remain off the air in China. And Shaquille O'Neil sounds off on free speech.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BARTIROMO: And we've got a big show this morning. Joining the conversation, Fox Business' Dagen McDowell, National Securities Corporation Chief Market Strategist Art Hogan, and Farvahar Partners founder and CEO Omeed Malik.</p><p>Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, NATIONAL SECURITIES CORPORATION: Good morning.</p><p>OMEED MALIK, FOUNDER AND CEO, FARVAHAR PARTNERS: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How are you?</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN CONTRIBUTOR: Great.</p><p>MALIK: Good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good morning.</p><p>Earnings, obviously, driving these markets and we are waiting on Boeing today.</p><p>Art, got to get your take on this. The Dow Industrials down 25 points. But this is a Dow component. The company's -- Boeing's much anticipated third quarter earnings report will be out in about an hour and a half. The company ousting a top executive yesterday. It looks to rebuild its image and its confidence amid the 737 Max controversy.</p><p>What would you expect today?</p><p>HOGAN: I can tell you this, the earnings aren't going to matter at this juncture. What matters in this story is finding out if there's another shoe to dropped. And then how much information was inside this company that didn't get released. Unless and until we sort of get to the bottom of that, people aren't going to care about their earnings. They're not going to care about the dividend. They're not going to care about what the order book looks like. They really want to know, OK, how long did we know that was a problem with the new -- with the airplane and then when do we think this thing is ever going to fly? It's not going to be this year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So they're replacing the head of the jetliner business. Is this going to be a big enough step in terms of sort of the perception that, yes, this is a new day at Boeing, new leadership?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I want to answer -- why now, though?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Again, this this is the first major ouster of an executive since that crash that caused the groundings earlier this year. It looks like, at least from the outside looking in and McAleenan (ph), the CEO, not -- no longer the chairman, is going to have to explain this. Why are you making these changes now? It seems like that the company doesn't have their arms around it yet?</p><p>HOGAN: Right. And I think that's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I didn't mean to interrupt you.</p><p>HOGAN: No, no, no, I think you're right. But it's also the new revelation of, OK, this test pilot, in this simulation, not feeling comfortable with the new electronic system, the new electronic (INAUDIBLE) and -- and -- and somehow that text (ph) was either sitting within the company or not, but that information coming out right now I think was what jettisoned that particular executive. Will there be more? That's hard to know. At the end of the day, Boeing's scrambling to get something accomplished so they can get the -- you know, the most important, new product back in the air. But I just don't think it's this year's business.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You've pointed this out, though, because the biggest worry hanging over these markets, not just the China trade deal, but is the manufacturing sector in this country. And the GM strike and the grounding of this jetliner by Boeing, people need to know, what is the overall impact on -- because, again, contraction in August and September for the ISM, that's why this needs -- bigger picture, it needs to get resolved.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and I -- and I think the more we see these PMI's coming in and ISM's coming in weaker than expected, it paints this pictures that things are really slowing down sharply in manufacturing, and yet these are two major stories that is actually part of it, the Boeing situation and the GM situation. So maybe -- the manufacturing sector is slowing down as sharply as it may appear.</p><p>Yeah, look, I wrote a few analysts reports I'm sure you have too, buying opportunity, aggressive traders may look at that way, there's a lot of tail risk, though, as you start to allude to, companies like southwest getting fed up and taking business to air bus, obviously things like that that could really affect the stock.</p><p>MALIK: Yes, look, I've read a few analyst reports, I'm sure you have too, that this is actually a buying opportunity for Boeing. I think aggressive traders may want to look at it that way. I think there's a lot of tail risk here, though.</p><p>As you started to allude to, they may be concerned about companies like Southwest getting fed up and taking their business to Airbus. So, obviously, things like that, that could really affect the stock if you lost a major customer like that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I can tell you for sure, I saw Dennis Muilenburg recently and I was struck by how strong and tough and aggressive he appeared to me. I said, wow, he's really riding this and he's going to survive and grow this company. That was just my instinct --</p><p>MALIK: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: After meeting with him. But, you know, we'll see.</p><p>MALIK: We'll see. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So that -- it sort of it --</p><p>MALIK: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It sort of dovetails onto what you were saying, buying opportunity. I don't know, but he certainly appeared to have a solid plan in place to get through this and grow this company on the other side.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right the ship and stop this jetliner from yawing (ph) (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's exactly right.</p><p>All right, Hong Kong changing course. Let's talk there for a second. The city withdrawing that controversial bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China. This as former NBA superstar Shaq O'Neil is speaking out about the current tensions between China and the NBA.</p><p>Here's Shaq.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAQ O'NEIL, FORMER NBA SUPERSTAR: One of our best values here in America is free speech. We're allowed to say what we want to say and we're allowed to speak up about injustices. And that's just how it goes. And if people don't understand that, that's something that they have to deal with. But, you know, I just think that it was unfortunately for, you know, both parties and then you've got people speaking when they don't know what they're talking about. But, you know, Daryl Morey was right.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bingo. Thank you, Shaq O'Neil. I mean it's nice to hear some refreshing comments about the obvious.</p><p>The NBA tips off the season last night, the protests by fans were there supporting the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement,</p><p>Dagen, what you say?</p><p>MCDOWELL: I love this. But the NBA needs more of this. I keep calling it. It's a tire fire. And it's still burning. So they need to get only message. And Adam Silver tried to do this after the uproar, but then you had LeBron James. And LeBron James, quite frankly, is the NBA. He drives policy. He drives the sport. And mixed messages, not supporting free speech, not supporting western values, not supporting, quite frankly, this country that has -- that gave life to basketball and lets it breathe and lets these players speak their mind.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I don't want -- I don't want (INAUDIBLE). I don't want the league rolling over because of China's bullying. It bothers mean. I mean can you imagine the stink that this has made in America. Yes, that's right, exactly what Shaq said, we -- we have free speech. And if Maurey wants to support the protestors, go for it.</p><p>MALIK: So, personally, I couldn't agree more with you, as you know. What is philosophical question here is for me is how do you balance the desire for free market and capitalism business, which we value in this country as well, with free speech? And that's the tension we're starting to see play out, unfortunately, that some of these people have financial motivations for why they're talking the way they are. I mean they -- LeBron James has a new movie, \"Space Jam 2,\" that's probably going to want to play in China. So you have to think about why people are speaking the way they are.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, you talked -- well, you've talked about how Hollywood has cut virtually every movie for the Chinese market.</p><p>MALIK: Yes. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And how, if you notice, back during the Cold War, that the villains were -- where were they from? They were from then Soviet Union.</p><p>MALIK: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But you don't see that in Hollywood. And you've got to give Quentin Tarantino --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MALIK: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Credit for coming out. He talked to Kennedy the other night on Fox Business --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Love it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And said, I am not re-cutting \"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" for the Chinese market. I am not changing one frame of it. And that's more of what you need to hear is, I'm not going to sacrifice my -- and this -- it's art. I'm not going to sacrifice my voice just to get access to a market. They're Chinese people, but it's controlled by a communist government.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and don't come here and say you have all of these fantastic things about stakeholders and, you know, human rights abuses are number one, doing well in the community is our number one priority, not profits, and then just go and, you know, open up shop in China and play by their rules that you can't even Google Tiananmen Square.</p><p>MALIK: So true. It is so true.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean it's -- you know, this is a serious situation and I'd like to see companies push back and say, no, this is the way we operate. But it's -- you're right, it's the money.</p><p>MALIK: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, like \"South Park\" does so well. I -- I keep going back to \"South Park\" because they've done such a good job.</p><p>Let's talk 2020. The Democrats. \"The New York Times\" this morning highlighting some concerns about the candidates. Donors are talking about whether people who aren't in the race could get in. Names that keep popping up, Sherrod Brown, Deval Patrick and, of course, Michael Bloomberg and Hillary Clinton.</p><p>Omeed, this coming as tensions between Tulsi Gabbard and Hillary Clinton escalate.</p><p>You are a supporter of Tulsi. Wow, she came out aggressive after Clinton called her the Russian asset. And good for her.</p><p>MALIK: Yes. So overdue. This is effectively neo-McCarthyism what we're seeing now on behalf of the Democrat establishment. If you propose new philosophies or new ideas that doesn't jive with the way that they're thinking, they're basically going to slander you.</p><p>We saw some of this behavior from the right wing back in the days during the Iraq War. If you opposed the Iraq War in 2002 or 2003, certain right wing elements used to say, oh, you're a friend of Saddam's. And we saw how that stifled debate.</p><p>Now, the pendulum has swung all the way to the other side, that if you challenge Democratic orthodoxy, you're basically labeled a trader. This is someone who served our country. It's preposterous, repugnant and it is actually a slippery slope to a very dangerous environment if we don't speak out against that. So that's why I'm so happy that Tulsi spoke out so forcefully against Hillary Clinton and what her and her cronies were doing to her.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: If you listen to that podcast that Hillary Clinton did with David Plouffe, she longed for the day when there were just three television networks and a few newspapers. And she essentially said, when they -- we could educate -- she didn't use the word educate, but when we could control the message.</p><p>And what she -- and James Freeman wrote about this over the weekend. What she seems to be saying is, she's not upset with foreign actors interfering in the media and with the message that gets out to the American. She's more worried about her and her corrupt cronies not being able to control what Americans hear. And she did, of course, take a shot at Fox in it. But and - - but she -- and she's bitter. She's bitter. Again, bitterness is her favorite shade of lipstick. I said that the other night. She's bitter about Tulsi Gabbard resigning as the vice chair of the DNC and supporting Bernie Sanders. So she carries a long list of people who have wronged her over her life, over her career, and she keeps it in her purse with her hot sauce, apparently.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And she's going to -- she will, you know, she'll get you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And this is evidence of that. But in terms of these -- these big names coming out, it's preposterous. Nobody -- nobody --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, would she ever -- would she ever run again?</p><p>MCDOWELL: No. No.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You don't think so?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It -- people in the Democratic establishment think that the idea that Mike Bloomberg is going to jump in at this point is laughable.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-huh.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He's just -- he's -- he's not ready to hit the campaign trail.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So then --so then they're nowhere.</p><p>MCDOWELL: With money, yes, but --</p><p>BARTIROMO: They have to just go all in, like they are, on impeachment and try as hard as they can to remove Donald Trump because they -- they don't have a candidate.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The biggest problem is they don't have an economic message, because the economy is so good.</p><p>MAB: Aside from Tulsi.</p><p>MCDOWELL: They don't have an economic message.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>MALIK: Yes, I mean, heaven forbid you actually try to have new ideas the way that Trump did in 2016 where they elect or nominate a milquetoast Democrat, they're going to get destroyed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. By the way, she would like the control of an election the way they tried to control the election in 2016.</p><p>MALIK: Right. Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The way that cabal of individuals tried to frame Donald Trump --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Here's the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And we should point out, in that -- in that story this morning we'll have more news, Fox News confirming that, in fact, William Barr's investigation is expanding and they're going to -- and John Durham is going to talk to John Brennan and James Clapper, something I've been predicting for two years.</p><p>MCDOWELL: After the recent -- after the recent trip the Italy, apparently is what triggered it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: By the way, I want to point out that, that Dick's Sporting Goods CEO is quietly testing a presidential bid. Who -- people -- the American people can't even name who that is, with no offense. They know Dick's. They don't know the CEO.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So I don't know -- if you don't have -- even Mike Bloomberg, he's got billions of dollars to burn and --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And some decent name recognition, but this is Ed Stack, the CEO of Dick's Sporting Goods, this is according to \"Politico,\" testing the waters for a possible third party presidential run, which could scramble the dynamics. Let's see if Hillary goes after him.</p><p>MALIK: As a Russian agent.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right, as a Russian agent.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Say it again?</p><p>Yes, Howard Schultz didn't do much, right? I mean Howard Schultz tried it and he sort of back peddled out of it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I don't get -- that was very -- that was very -- well, he had --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Had a back problem. He had a back problem.</p><p>MCDOWELL: He had a back problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But I think at -- it was a little more than that, frankly, I mean because he wasn't getting past go because he was trying to be a moderate in a field that they've got all progressive on everybody.</p><p>MALIK: Right. And what's the message? That's what -- the American people are yearning for new ideas on immigration, foreign policy. We need to see those being espoused on the Democratic side. And right now, as you suggested, by and large that's not happening.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>All right, let's take a break.</p><p>When we come back, also on deck this morning, the CEO of Eli Lily is here, Dave Ricks, to talk earnings and the future of the company there. We're going to find out where the growth is. Then we're talking with the CEO of UPS, David Abney, a big day yesterday after his earnings. We are getting ready for the peak shipping season, so we've got a lot to find out from Abney from UPS.</p><p>Georgia senator and member of the Senate Budgets, Banking and Armed Services Committees David Perdue is here on the Syrian-Turkey conflict. And Hayman Capital Management founder and CIO Kyle Bass on the Hong Kong protests. Plus, my exclusive interview with Energy Secretary Rick Perry on the president's trip to coal country. All that coming up. Stay right here.</p><p>Plus, fast-tracking Brexit this morning. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson still looking for a vote on Brexit before that October 31 deadline.</p><p>Also, one in the books. The Washington Nationals clinched game one of the World Series last night, squeaking past the Houston Astros. All the highlights right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Another speed bump in Britain's struggle to leave the European Union.</p><p>Cheryl Casone on headlines now.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, Maria, parliament approve Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit plan, but they blocked his timetable to meet the Halloween deadline. Lawmakers say that three days wasn't enough time to debate the 435-page bill. Johnson apparently now is pushing for an early general election there. The European Union is weighing whether to grant a Brexit deadline extension.</p><p>Well, the pharmaceutical company Biogen is reversing course. They've decided to seek FDA approval for their experimental Alzheimer's drug. The company had stopped testing the drug months ago, but a second look showed that the drug actually may be effective if used in higher doses.</p><p>Take a look at the stock in the pre-market. It's actually up more than 2 percent right now.</p><p>And the Washington Nationals beat the hometown Houston Astros last night, 5-4, in the opener of the World Series. Juan Soto recorded three hits and drove in three of Washington's five runs.</p><p>Meanwhile, guys, I want you to listen to this and tell me if it sounds familiar.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(MUSIC)</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Any idea what that is?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: It's \"Baby Shark.\" It was being played on the Washington Nationals Cathedral organ. It started as outfielder Gerardo Parra's walk-up song. It's now surprisingly being used to celebrate his team for making the World Series. The Nationals now hold a 1-0 lead in the best of seven series. They're heading into game two tonight. That's also going to be taking place at Minute Maid Park in Houston. Yes, Maria, tonight it's going to be on Fox. Good job. You know your baby shark, Maria. Good job.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That was an exciting game, actually. I watched it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I did too. I really -- I was like --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I enjoyed it.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I got to get in the spirit of things.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I watched -- well, I watched the first few innings before I --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, for a few innings.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Passed out ugly on the sofa.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And the first few innings were not -- were not good for the Nationals. So, you know, it was fun.</p><p>Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>We'll take a break.</p><p>When we come back, a big week for earnings. Tesla, Ford, Caterpillar and Boeing among the heavy hitters reporting today. We'll have those numbers, tell you how they're impacting markets.</p><p>We're standing by for AT&amp;T, out any moment now. Stay with us for that.</p><p>And then spooky Starbucks. The coffee giant reveals its phantom Frappuccino. Check it out. Why you may have to wait to take a sip of that one.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Another big day for earnings this morning. Dow components Boeing, Caterpillar reporting next hour. Microsoft is after the close tonight. We'll also hear from Tesla after the close.</p><p>We got AT&amp;T coming out eminently, 93 cents is the estimate on $45 billion in revenue at AT&amp;T. We'll get you those numbers as soon as they come out.</p><p>But look at markets really flat as we await earnings news to really drive the story.</p><p>Joining us right now is the president of Pacer ETFS Distributors, Sean O'Hara.</p><p>Sean, good to see you.</p><p>SEAN O'HARA, PRESIDENT, PACER ETFS DISTRIBUTORS: Good morning. Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, do things get busier during earnings season? Do you see more interest in, you know, in trading and in markets, ETFs, at this time of the year or no?</p><p>O'HARA: I would say generally in the ETF business overall that's probably true. Not as much for us in terms of where we fit in that infrastructure. We're not building trading type of ETFs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Of course.</p><p>O'HARA: We're building long-term sort of mutual fund like ETFs that are built on strategies that should be part of portfolios and not necessarily traded.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Where's the flow these days?</p><p>O'HARA: We're continuing to see flows in a couple of areas that are kind of interesting. One is in some of the risk management strategies that we have. Everybody, I think, is acknowledging this has been a fairly long expansion and a long bull market. And I think folks mostly are trying to think about, you know, how do I protect these profits that I've made over the last ten year or so.</p><p>We're seeing flows into infrastructure, technology, primarily in the real estate space, for example, with a product we have called SRVR, s-r-v-r, that owns the data centers and the cell phone towers as a big buildout for these five big technologies. You've got streaming. You've got AI. You've got the Internet of things. You've got e-commerce. Those things take an enormous amount of computing power. And so that computing power is going to be delivered via the data centers and that publically traded real estate names that do that. And that -- and their -- and that product is actually one of our best performers here, the sourcing (ph) good flows into things like that.</p><p>HOGAN: There seems -- people trying to express an opinion in things on the other side of that, so I think that that's all great. And then, in technology and the direction we're going into 5G and that rollout. But how about the things people are nervous about? You know, are they -- is there a way, an ETF, to express an opinion saying, hey, I think office space is in a bubble right now and WeWork isn't about to exploded (ph) or anything along those lines?</p><p>O'HARA: I mean there's an ETF for everything today, Art, you know, so you can pretty much find what you want to find if you're an active trader or if your -- if you've got a computer you can Google search. You can pretty much express almost any view you want in ETFs, which is one of the great things about the business is, you know, there's some criticism perhaps that it's getting a little too finely cut in places, but -- but it really does allow somebody to really to express any view they want in their portfolio.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was -- that was the criticism, though, when the first -- the i-shares (ph) were first launched. Nobody had -- you know, covering those ETFs back then, it just seemed like, who wants to own -- dice up the market that much.</p><p>HOGAN: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I think every -- virtually everyone was wrong about the possibility and opportunity in exchange traded funds. And, again, you don't have to trade them. You can buy them and hold them. That's really the message.</p><p>O'HARA: Yes, I mean, they're less expensive, more -- slightly more tax efficient proxies from mutual funds. There are passive strategies where you can own a whole index or a whole -- like the S&amp;P 500. And then there are ETFs that are sort of fundamentally weighted where you can put a twist on a portfolio. We use, for example, free cash flow yield. We has a nice little pop yesterday out of Biogen. It screened into one of our ETFs because it has such a high free cash flow yield. And so --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and they also have an Alzheimer's drug, Biogen.</p><p>O'HARA: Yes, and so we -- we had a nice little surprise yesterday in that one in terms of performance.</p><p>MALIK: So we've seen some folks talking about ETFs in the cannabis space. Have you seen any interest there?</p><p>O'HARA: Yes, there's a lot of interest in it. We don't have a product there. The closest we come to the cannabis exposure in our ETF family is in -- in a product called INDS, which is a distribution center ETF. It's, again, publicly-traded real estate where we own one name that's primarily focused on the development and storage of cannabis products. And that's actually sort of a circuitous way to get to it.</p><p>MALIK: Right.</p><p>O'HARA: But we don't have a cannabis part per se. There are a lot out there in the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There is one. I just saw one yesterday. It's POTT, p-o-t-t, right?</p><p>MALIK: Yes. Yes, exactly.</p><p>O'HARA: Yes, there's quite a few actually out there. And I think it, you know, for those who want to get exposure to that, I think they'll continue to see some proliferation in those (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, so you still feel good about markets right here in terms of where -- I mean valuations are pretty high. You're still seeing sort of interest and sentiment strong in terms of consumers or are people worried about a recession, real quick.</p><p>O'HARA: I think, you know, the market will be 29 out of 29 time where we've surprised on the upside on earnings. I think low interest rates, low inflation, high employment, wage growth are all tailwinds on the market and they're overwhelming the trade talk and potentially the negatives. I think we'll slow but not go negative. And I think next year we'll see things improve.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Sean, great to have you. Thanks so much.</p><p>O'HARA: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Sean O'Hara joining us there.</p><p>We're going to take a break.</p><p>When we come back, investigating FaceBook. Dozens of attorneys general readying to do an anti-trust investigation. Google could be next. We're going to get into it.</p><p>Then WeWork's woes. The company's chairman ready to lay out the future to employees. That's next.</p><p>Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, October 23rd.</p><p>Your top stories right now, 6:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Another big day for earnings. That will drive markets. Eli Lily just out with their third quarter reporting mixed results. The company did raise its profit guidance, however. We are waiting on AT&amp;T this morning any minute. Investors are also watching for Dow components Caterpillar and Boeing due out with their third quarter numbers in the next hour. We'll have all the numbers and full analysis coming up.</p><p>Markets this morning are flat, looking for some direction. Take a look, Dow Industrials actually just took a step down, down 53 points right now on the Dow. The S&amp;P futures are down 1 point. The Nasdaq is up by 2 points, as you can see there.</p><p>Earnings and uncertainty over the timing of the U.K.'s exit from the EU weighed on markets yesterday with the Dow Industrials finishing down about 40 points at the close. It was a fractional move. The S&amp;P was down 10 and the Nasdaq was down 58. That was three quarters of 1 percent.</p><p>Caterpillar is coming on the tape right now. A revenue miss.</p><p>This morning, as you can see, the S&amp;P 500, by the way, is just 1 percent away from its all-time record high. Global markets this morning look like this. Take a look at European indices right here where obviously Caterpillar is a global story, and that's going to impact Asia, as well as Europe. All of those economies going to impact Caterpillar's quarter.</p><p>FT 100 right now is up 32 points. The CAC quarante in Paris is down 20 and the DAX index in Germany is up 28. as you can see.</p><p>Brexit drama continues this morning. Parliament approved Prime Minister Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement, but not agreed -- they did not agree to his speedy timetable. Now it is up to the EU to allow an extension. Obviously the expectation was for the 31st of this month. Now we're talking about looking into next year.</p><p>Growing concerns over Hong Kong put some pressure on markets in Asia overnight. As you can see there, Shanghai composite down half a percent.</p><p>Caterpillar is out. We want to get right to it. It missed on the earnings and the revenue line.</p><p>Let's get to Jackie DeAngglis, right, she's got the numbers.</p><p>Jackie.</p><p>JACKIE DEANGELIS, FBN CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Maria.</p><p>Yes, that was a double meet. The actual revenues for Caterpillar, 12.8 billion. That was well under the $13.5 billion estimate. EPS, 2.66 adjusted. That was well under the 2.88, expected EPS as well. Now the company has cut its earnings guidance. That's the forecast going forward. And apparently there seems to be an issue here -- we have to dig more into these numbers -- but there seems to be an inventory issue, or at least that's what the company is citing. You can see the stock is trading down 6.5 percent in the pre-market.</p><p>As we have more, we'll certainly get back to you with it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Jackie, this is also a story of China. Caterpillar is, obviously, deriving a significant amount of money in Asia. You go to places like Shanghai, you see there, Caterpillar cranes all over the place.</p><p>But, Art, you have (INAUDIBLE) slowdown in the Chinese economy and you're seeing that show up in the Caterpillar quarter, no doubt about it.</p><p>HOGAN: Right, a hundred percent. And when we think about, you know, when -- what's going to be affected by the U.S.-China trade war, Caterpillar's the first name that comes to mind, right? And we've talked about the ABC's of the China trade war, it's Apple, Boeing and Caterpillar.</p><p>Caterpillar, more than any other names, has been affected, not just in this particular quarter, but since this thing started. So -- and this has been a year-long drag. And the -- and when we talked about at the beginning of the show, manufacturing has slowed down globally. And if manufacturing is slowing down globally, that's going affect Caterpillar.</p><p>The amazing thing to me, though, is that, you know, why do companies the size of Caterpillar wait until earnings day to let us know this bad news when they've had a month to pre-announce? And they know what their order book look like. They know what their inventory levels are. So I'm always shocked when a company the size of Caterpillar doesn't pre-announce because (INAUDIBLE) --</p><p>BARTIROMO: It is cutting its full-year guidance now.</p><p>HOGAN: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We've got the expectations that this slowdown continues then at Caterpillar, Art.</p><p>HOGAN: Right. And you've got a triple miss. So you've missed on earnings. You missed on revenue estimates and you guide lower. You're going to, obviously, see what's going to happen. And the company's down about 7 percent right now. That's probably -- that's -- that's probably the magnitude of the move that we should be seeing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you see value here, Omeed? When you look at a story like Caterpillar that's right in the middle of this global slowdown in manufacturing, and getting the impact of the China slowdown in particular.</p><p>When -- when do you start looking at this and saying, OK, maybe there's some value here? A 6.5 percent selloff right now.</p><p>MALIK: This is a macroeconomic play if you were going to try to trade this name.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>MALIK: You have to be bullish on what's going to happen with China in order the see an uptick in this stock, otherwise it's going to continue to be challenge, as you pointed out, for a lot of macroeconomic concerns.</p><p>So I think we're still very unsure about how this China thing is going to play out. A lot of people don't think it goes far enough. So -- and you and I have spoken about this, is it deal just going to be piecemeal, or is this going to be a holistic reevaluation of our relationship with that country.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MALIK: And the way that answer is determined is how you look at this company.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow.</p><p>Dagen, this is going to cut about 60 points off the Dow Industrials this morning. Caterpillar, 6 percent selloff right here.</p><p>MALIK: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And I think that the renew miss is really notable here because, again, it seems like that based on -- so about one-fifth of the S&amp;P is reported so far as of -- before this morning and you have earnings are up half of a percent. They were expected to fall a little more than 2 percent, 2.2 percent.</p><p>MALIK: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So earnings are coming in better than expected to the plus side, but revenues have only -- 63 percent have beaten revenue estimates of those reporting and the revenues they are up 3.7 percent so far this period, but that's right in line. So I think that it's -- we always talk about earnings, but it's that revenue growth and how -- and ultimately how that weighs on the business going forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you can't fudge revenue growth, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. Exactly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You could mix your earnings around and --</p><p>MALIK: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And change the way the quarter looks in terms of the profitability line, but you can't change revenue.</p><p>MALIK: Yes. No.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. And what do you -- and what are you doing to get those earnings up --</p><p>MALIK: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Whether it's accounting or whether it's cost-cutting and cost- cutting is never good for the broad economy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>MALIK: For WeWork you do a community adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: We'll get to that later.</p><p>BARTIROMO: This is the market headline of the day, Caterpillar down 6 percent.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's talk about big tech for a second because 46 state attorneys general joining New York's investigation into FaceBook amid allegations of anti-trust and privacy concerns. As the attorneys general investigating Google plan to meet in Colorado next month to decide and discuss whether the tech giant has broken anti-trust laws itself, that's according to Reuters.</p><p>Joining us right now to talk more about that is Fox News senior judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano.</p><p>Judge, good to see you.</p><p>JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO, FOX NEWS SENIOR JUDICIAL ANALYST: Good morning.</p><p>So, look, the states have anti-trust laws that are almost identical, literally word for word, to the federal. And the state attorney's general sometimes pick up this cajole before the federal government does. I mean that's one way to look at it.</p><p>The other way to look at it is, the state attorneys general become very adept at wealth transfer. They did it to the tobacco industry. They're doing it to big pharma. Downtown here, as we speak, or in a few hours, they're doing to Exxon, to big oil, and big tech is the next -- is the next target.</p><p>So the question is, is this a legitimate inquiry for the violation of privacy -- it's kind of silly that the government is investigating people for violating privacy, because the government is the biggest violator of privacy on the planet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Is this a legitimate inquiry or is this just an effort to get to -- is it a shakedown? It is an effort to get money from big tech? We'll see where it goes. But rarely are the states out ahead of the Feds in an area like anti-trust, which is almost exclusively federal domain.</p><p>MALIK: Well, look, I mean, I think this is a very interesting legal issue. So from an anti-trust perspective solely, it's difficult to see where that is because there's isn't an explicit cost concern to the consumers of these products, so they don't pay anything. However, on the advertising side --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Right.</p><p>MALIK: There definitely is one because they're driving costs up potentially.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: It would have to be on the advertising side because the essence of anti-trust is a contract or a combination that interferes with interstate trade and harms the consumer. Now, when the consumer gets the product for nothing --</p><p>MALIK: Yes.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: As you pointed out, and as we all know, there's no harm to the consumer. But where does their revenue come from? From advertising. So if there is evidence that they fixed advertising rates, that would be a classic, classic case. That would cost them a fortune. A classic case of an anti-trust violation. But why are the attorneys general going after it instead of the feds? The feds are looking to regulate. The attorneys general are looking for cash. They go away if you give them enough cash. I'm sure that Zuckerberg and the others don't need me to tell them that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: They've given a lot of cash to Congress, by the way, already.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And a lot of those people are getting -- are big donors, which is why I think maybe they weren't as aggressive in the past. But they seem to be more aggressive now and they're pinpointing the issues on big tech.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, 20 years -- 20 years ago big tobacco gave them 55 billion. There's -- is there less smoking now as a result of it? I don't know. Where did that money go? Probably to fill hole -- plug holes in their state budget shortfalls.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Very good point.</p><p>Will the U.S. ever look like the EU in terms of the government bite on big tech?</p><p>MALIK: Well, there they have the right to be forgotten. That was one of the biggest things that they established. Here we do, as you know, have a right to privacy that's not explicit in the Constitution. But, as you know, it's in the number of the Constitution.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>MALIK: So if you establish that there is a right to privacy, then that's another angle that you may be able to have a constitutional claim outside of anti-trust.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Well, the right to privacy restrains the government, it doesn't restrain private industry. There are statute that prohibit private industry. I mean the -- technically, if I put information in here about my banking, just detailing -- something with my own bank, and Apple doesn't keep it secure, they've violated a contract with me. That's not a constitutional violation, that's a common law contractual violation. But if the government gets their hands on this without a search warrant, there's the constitutional violation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Judge, real quick on J and J, Johnson and Johnson. CEO Alex Gorsky saying in a deposition --</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Earlier this month that the company's baby powder is safe, but then, less than two weeks later, the FDA announced that it actually found asbestos in the baby powder?</p><p>NAPOLITANO: All right, so when you are suing a large company like J and J, J and J has the right to name a human being who will give a deposition and knows the most about it. Rarely do they name the CEO. They name somebody a couple of rungs lower who has a better grasp at what's going on. You name - - you name the CEO, he gives a deposition that sounds like it's a commercial for the company, 13 days later it's absolutely defied by indisputable, scientific evidence in the hands of the Food and Drug Administration, it's a huge embarrassment -- embarrassment for them and the share price showed it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it sure did. Later we're going to get to the college admission scandal.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We wanted to get that with you as well. But we're going to come up with it later because there's news there as well.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: Yes, there is.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Judge, good to see you. Thank you so much.</p><p>NAPOLITANO: All right. A pleasure, guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Judge Andrew Napolitano joining us.</p><p>Coming up, getting WeWork on track. The company's chairman ready to lay out the future to employees. We're going to tell you what we're expecting there.</p><p>Then, spooky Starbucks. Check this out. The coffee giant revealed its scary and sweet phantom Frappuccino. You will have to wait to take a sip, though. We'll tell you why.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, some shuffling in the CEO ranks to report.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the details.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Ah, so, Maria, the changes started at Nike. The company announced that Mark Parker is stepping aside as chief executive. So he's going be replaced by tech veteran John Donahoe, who's currently the president and CEO of Servicenow. Now stepping in to take Donahoe's job, former SAP CEO Bill McDermott. It has been a record year for CEO turnover, we should add. Step-in from Challenger Gray and Christmas says more than 1,100 CEO's have stepped down just this year.</p><p>Well, employees at WeWork, many facing the possibility of losing their jobs, are reportedly expressing outrage after a deal would give former CEO Adam Neumann, if approved, nearly $1.7 billion. Under that deal, Japan's Softbank is going to take a roughly 80 percent ownership stake in WeWork. Now, Neumann, who has remained chairman of WeWork parent We Company, is going to step down from the board. Softbank shares have dropped about 30 percent from their July peak. A lot of folks say that's because of its major stake in WeWork.</p><p>And then, check this out, Starbucks has unveiled its new Halloween-themed drink. It's the phantom Frappuccino. It looks pretty scary. It's got coconut milk, lime, mango and pineapple in it. There's also an option to get a dark coconut whipped cream on top. Here's the problem, folks, it's only available in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Thanks, Starbucks.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you so much.</p><p>By the way, Morgan Stanley this morning is calling Caterpillar's quarter a mild earnings recession. That is from Morgan Stanley this morning on the weaker than expected earning, weaker than expected revenue, and they're cutting their outlook for the year, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I just wanted to point something out because this is something that all -- that like everyone wants to know. Caterpillar's stock has wildly underperformed this year already.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: So it was only up 8 percent. That is -- that's a total return. So that includes dividends. It was --</p><p>BARTIROMO: I think last year too.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It underperformed farm and construction equipment by almost 6 percentage points. And then the broad market, so Caterpillar, total return, up 8 percent. The broad total stock market is up 21 percent total return. So, again, it's been a loser. We haven't lost money in it this year, but -- so this -- people were expecting bad news, quite frankly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And I would argue it's partly because they were expecting weakness out of China. One of the key heres.</p><p>I want to talk about WeWork and get your assessment of this real comedown in terms of the valuation. What was Softbank valuing it at its peak, $40 billion?</p><p>MALIK: $47 billion.</p><p>BARTIROMO: $47 billion, and now they want to valuate it at $8 billion.</p><p>MALIK: Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You also have, to connect the dots for us in terms of the notable wealth tax.</p><p>MALIK: Sure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What does that mean in terms of a WeWork shareholder?</p><p>MALIK: So, absolutely.</p><p>I look at the ramifications for Elizabeth Warren's proposed wealth tax, where she suggests that net worth will be taxed if you're over 50 million. So if you owned less than 1 percent of WeWork when it was valued at over $47 billion, think about what would happen to you. And it also has a host of other unintended consequences. How do you value something that has no liquid market for it or isn't earned income? So we already have this issue with property taxes and we know how much we don't like bureaucrats telling us the -- how much our home is worth. Imagine going to your private stock portfolio and trying to tell you how much WeWork -- the investors didn't even know how much WeWork was supposed to be earned. So this is very dangerous.</p><p>And what actually stifled growth and innovation that people had to pay these taxes. So this is something that Warren and Sanders need to think about before they propose taxes like this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Such a good point because what are you going to get taxed on, the $47 billion valuation or the $8 billion valuation. How do you value a private company?</p><p>HOGAN: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Who's in charge?</p><p>HOGAN: And even at $8 billion, that's not a liquid valuation, right?</p><p>MALIK: Correct.</p><p>HOGAN: Unless and until it comes into the public market, you can't say it's even worth that $8 billion. So you can't tax that piece either. So that's why that wealth tax is so nice to say because it's out there. It's ephemeral. But what you can't do is like, OK, how do you implement that?</p><p>MALIK: Right.</p><p>HOGAN: You know, who's going to -- who's going to be in charge of saying, this is exactly how much your art work is worth, this is how much your --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>HOGAN: Property is worth. And --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, but the --</p><p>MALIK: It's to codify morality.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But the fact this guy walks away with what was the final figure, $1.7 billion --</p><p>MALIK: $1.7 billion.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And -- which is hundreds of thousands of dollars per employee who lost their jobs. Again, in terms of marketing and message, that --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That is --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Elizabeth Warren is preaching and selling and Bernie Sanders, it could resonate with people because they don't understand that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Uh-huh. Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: I mean it makes them angry.</p><p>MALIK: But, I mean, I hate to take a contrarian perspective, it's just that --</p><p>MCDOWELL: No, no, please.</p><p>MALIK: You know, just that the WeWork thing, as pathetic as it is, it actually shows that public markets work, I mean, because it stopped it before it went public.</p><p>HOGAN: Right.</p><p>MALIK: Private market is for where these things are supposed to shake out and, you know, it's embarrassing, but it's the private shareholders that are caught holding the bag.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Yes, foreign private shareholder.</p><p>MALIK: Those too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MALIK: Even better.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We're all private shareholders.</p><p>MALIK: Yes.</p><p>HOGAN: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And then you're going to be faced with this wealth tax and you don't know how to value anything.</p><p>MALIK: Correct.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll take a break. When we come back, his father's legacy. Daniel Krauthammer joins us next to talk about his father Charles' final book. We will talk about that when we come back.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Well, it has been more than a year since we lost the great Charles Krauthammer. And shortly after his death, Krauthammer's son edited and finished his father's final book, which just debuted in paperback.</p><p>Joining us right now the son of the late Charles Krauthammer, editor of his dad's final book, \"The Point of it All: A Lifetime of Great Loves and Endeavors,\" Daniel Krauthammer.</p><p>Daniel, it's great to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>DANIEL KRAUTHAMMER, EDITOR, \"THE POINT OF IT ALL\": Oh, thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How important was this in terms of doing this in paperback? And I guess your new preface included what you heard from readers about what your father would say about it.</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: Exactly. I mean putting the book together as a whole was the most important thing to me this whole past year. And that was the number one priority in my life. But after the hardcover came out, as you say, I traveled around promoting the book and meeting the people who followed his commentary and looked to him as really kind of a guide for how to figure out what's going on in the world. And the question I got from almost everybody was, you know, what would your dad say about this, about what's going on now? And so I tried, in this new preface for the book, to distill that down to a few key principles of, you know, I can't say what he would say now, but I know how he would say it and how he would go by these, you know, real, fundamental principles of truth and logic and persuasion and good faith in the opposition. And I talk about all of that in the book.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I would love to have a conversation with him today to ask him about this impeachment inquiry.</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: Yes. I get that question a lot too. And I think, you know, it's complicated, but I -- and I don't know what he would say. But, again, I know that he would say something that would not be predictable. He always worked from principles all the way out to the logical end point, whatever side that would land on. And in looking at what he said in the past about President Trump, and also what he said in Clinton impeachment, he would often say, you know, look, the truth can be two things at once. You can have something that's morally wrong but that's not a crime. You can have something that is a crime, but that doesn't rise to high crimes and misdemeanors.</p><p>So, you know, I think he would chart a path that would clear a lot of the noise and a lot of the emotion out of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, yes.</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: And get to the core of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: He sure would.</p><p>MCDOWELL: And remind us of what's important. I -- the first time I got to met your dad, thank -- I'm thankful for that every day -- was at the Republican Convention. And we talked about dogs. And so I always go back and read some of the essays he wrote about dogs, because, again, it just crystallizes how we all feel about our animals.</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: Yes. Yes, and that in -- in this book and his other book, \"Things That Matter,\" that he, you know, he talks about, you know, his passions and his loves in life. There's tons of, you know, politics and history and the big questions, but also, you know, articles on dogs, baseball, fatherhood. Really kind of spanning the whole gamut of life. And I mean the most incredible thing to me was that, across these disparate subjects, there is a real through line and a philosophy that comes out. And that was what I wanted to capture in the book.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I bet he would be talking about beloved Washington Nationals this morning.</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: Oh, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Get their first World Series title winning game one last night.</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: Yes, no, I was up late watching that. And I know he would have been too. Yes, he went -- he was a huge Nats fan. And he writes about that extensively in the book, actually. And, you know, he went to almost all the home games and I kept his tickets, actually, and I've been going to all the playoffs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Fantastic. Lucky you.</p><p>Daniel Krauthammer, congrats. Thank you so much, sir.</p><p>KRAUTHAMMER: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We will be right back. Stay with us.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2019102301cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBD-CCB1-DXH2-61NM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8283\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 23, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001Q6L</classCode><className>NATIONAL SECURITIES CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0009Q46</classCode><className>NATIONAL HOLDINGS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC6211 SECURITY BROKERS, DEALERS, &amp;

Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 29th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Bulls fight back this morning, futures are pointed to gains at the start of trading, on this the final trading day for both the month and the quarter. Dow Industrials expected to be up of 80 points right out of the gate today. NASDAQ expected to be up 50. Follows yet another day in the red for the major indices yesterday even though it was just fractional moves. The Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the NASDAQ all on pace for the worst March -- month of March in nearly 20 years.</p><p>The big concern technology, shares of several big names under pressure of its fears of a regulatory crackdown. Both Facebook and Twitter are in bare market territory while Alphabet, Netflix, and Amazon are in correction territory those are trading higher this morning. In Europe this morning, stocks are higher. Take a look, Ft-100, CAC quarante, DAX Index all up with the German Index, the DAX up almost one percent. In Asia overnight, green across the board. It was fractional moves for the most part but Shanghai Composite in China was up better than one percent. Rebuilding America, President Trump is set to pitch his highly anticipated infrastructure plan today in Ohio in an effort to fulfill yet another campaign promise.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're trying to build roads and bridges and fix bridges that are falling down. And we have a hard time getting the money, it's crazy, Washington will no longer be a roadblock to progress. Washington will now be your partner.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: What to expect from the big push coming up this morning. And then protecting our borders as President Trump unveils new pictures of construction of the wall, hundreds of law enforcement officials are throwing their support behind that billed out. Then hacks planes ransomware reportedly strikes Boeing. What you need to know as the company becomes the latest to be hit by the WannaCry virus.</p><p>Then this. From self-driving SUV to a million-dollar car, we've got all the highlights from the New York auto show. Wait until you see some of the hot wheels there this week. And then to infinity and beyond. We're taking you to outer space where astronauts are preparing for a spacewalk just moments from now. All those stories coming up this Thursday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, Forbes Media chairman and former Republican Presidential candidate, Steve Forbes. And CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell. Great to see you.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Great to be here.</p><p>STEVE FORBES, MEDIA CHAIRMAN, FORBES: Good to be here this morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. A lot on the -- on the table to take up.</p><p>FORBES: Yes, there is.</p><p>BELL: A lot on the docket, infrastructure spending is huge. We're going to talk about that, I know. It will be interesting to see what the next step has to say.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And then of course, the final day of the -- of the quarter. We're going to start getting earnings in about two weeks from the first quarter, Dagen.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FBN ANCHOR: Tech sell-off and it's not just Facebook, let's talk about Tesla and kind of dire financial straits and maybe I'm going to teaser up. Coming up guest, Greg Ip from the Wall Street Journal has an incredible article about our fiscal future as a country, won't be as care free as it was in the past and he's talking about the ability to borrow.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: The nice thing -- nice thing about earnings though is to get things back to reality. Markets been worried about what might happen. Earnings are what has happened, companies most of them are performing.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That's a good point. We're going to get back to what's happening in terms of the fundamentals. We have this breaking news, the President just tweeted, here is what he said this morning. I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the election. Unlike others they pay little or no taxes to state and local governments. Use our postal system as they -- as their deliver boy causing tremendous loss to the United States and -- or putting many thousands of retailers out of business. The President just tweeted that about Amazon. Now, the President is taking his pitch, as well, for a trillion-dollar infrastructure plan to Ohio today as a proposal stalls out in Congress. Adam Shapiro covering the story from the White House with the very latest. Adam, good morning to you.</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, FBN REPORTER: And a good morning to you, Maria. The issue will be infrastructure when the President heads to North Coast Cleveland just outside, he will be speaking in Richfield, former home of Richfield Coliseum. He is going to talk about his infrastructure proposals because the bill essentially is going nowhere at this point up on Capitol Hill. There is no one comprehensive bill. What the President wants is $200 billion from Congress in seed money to actually spur a private/public partnership for 1.5 trillion worth of infrastructure spending over the next 10 years.</p><p>And what he's promising is that 1.5 trillion would have an impact of creating one-tenth of a percent to two-tenths of a percent GDP annually. It would create he says anywhere from 290,000 to 414,000 jobs for people over the next 10 years. And it would also help improve access to education and workforce development programs for people who would be working on the infrastructure projects. Now, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, he said, well, there may not be one with huge comprehensive bill for infrastructure, there will be separate different building or infrastructure funding proposals in separate legislation. But here's what Sarah Sanders said yesterday about all of this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SARAH HUCKABEE SNADERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Following on success of tax reform, infrastructure is the next piece of the President's successful economic agenda. These workers represent the hardworking Americans across the country who will participate in the rebuilding of our nation's infrastructure, sparked from the President's vision and it will definitely be worth tuning in to see the President lay out that vision.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO: So the infrastructure speech around 2:00 this afternoon from Richfield expected to get a lot of headlines. The other headline this morning in Washington has to do with firing of secretary of Veterans Affairs David Shulkin. Dr. Shulkin has published an op-ed in The New York Times in which he said it should not be this hard to serve your country. He goes on to criticize Washington, D.C. saying in recent months, the environment in Washington has turned so toxic, chaotic, disrespectful and subversive that it became impossible for me to accomplish the important work that our veterans need and deserve. Maria, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Adam. Thanks so much. Adam Shapiro at the White House. Joining us right now to weigh in on all of that. Former Reagan budget director, David Stockman. David, good to see you.</p><p>DAVID STOCKMAN, FORMER DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Infrastructure plan is the focus today from the President, now the White House is talking about $200 billion in Federal money, the rest private money. Your thoughts on infrastructure funding.</p><p>STOCKMAN: I think he should forget it. We don't have $200 billion to spend. We have -- the government is actually flat-out broke, we have gone through a fiscal irresponsibility orgy in the last 90 days like I've never seen before. We are heading into the 10th year of a so-called recovery and we're going to have a 1.2 trillion deficit because they cut taxes by 300 billion and then they have this omnibus spending bill that raised it by 200 billion, it was bad enough what they inherited from Obama and now we are in the soup like never before. So they need to focus on getting the fiscal situation under control.</p><p>Infrastructure will take care of itself, 90 percent of infrastructure is state and local. 90 percent of infrastructure can be funded with user fees. We don't need to be, you know, hitting the Federal budget which is bleeding red ink and in time when the Fed is now going to stop printing money and actually going to be selling bonds. This is the worst time for him to be thinking about this. Now he is sleepwalking. He needs to wake up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What do you say, Steve?</p><p>FORBES: Well, the 200 billion is not going to be one year, that's going to be the way Congress works, going to be over several years by the time these things get off the table. But in terms of infrastructure, 1.2 to make use for the state and local level, are they up to it? Are they willing to put fees in? And by the way, just for the record, you don't have an infrastructure problem when the private sector is involved. FedEx, UPS, no shortage of delivery trucks. Railroads, best in the world after deregulation in 1980. So the government is involved, they always have a maintenance problem.</p><p>STOCKMAN: I agree with that. That's why they should forget this. Let the private sector take care of it r or recognize that sewer and water is local, streets and highways are local, buses and subways are local. If the local people are unwilling to put it in the fair box or tax themselves, that's their choice, let them live with the consequences. When we take it to Washington, it becomes one giant pork barrel. We're already spending more on highways than ever before. We have 45 billion gas tax, less than 20 billion that goes to the interstate. The rest of it is --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: When did that start because when the trust fund was originally created, it was supposed to be just for the interstate highway system, period.</p><p>STOCKMAN: Steve --</p><p>FORBES: Where did it all go? You were there for a while.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But it goes for things like bypass, right? It goes -- this money that you said isn't spent on the highway.</p><p>STOCKMAN: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's spent on things that are related to transportation, because in fact, because the gas tax at the Federal level hasn't gone up in more than 20 years. The highway trust fund borrows from general revenue so you have people who pay income tax but don't drive that much, actually funding the repair of roads. That's unfair.</p><p>STOCKMAN: I agree with that one hundred percent. And that's the problem with putting it on Capitol Hill in Congress. It's a logrolling situation. So, the beautification people get money, the bicycle people will get money, the mass transit people get money. It goes everywhere. Even to local roads and highways in the interstate system gets, you know, what's left over. So the lesson, it is so clear, the lesson is infrastructure. If you hear infrastructure coming from Washington run the other way because it 's really a boondoggle.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, just to point out, there was $21 billion in additional infrastructure spending in that that omnibus bill, right? Omnibus spending bill. So you can talk about hundreds of billions of dollars for infrastructure, well, they're getting plenty of money in that spending bill.</p><p>STOCKMAN: Yes. Let me give one example of that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, where is that money going if not -- I mean, that is part of the money that they're going to use.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right.</p><p>STOCKMAN: Of course. Obama had this ridiculous program called Tiger. It was another, you know, transportation, boondoggle going to local governments for, you know, mass transit systems and so forth. The Republicans tripled the budget that they inherited from Obama when actually Trump wanted to zero it out which he should have. If you look at this bill, it is the worst thing I've seen in my life. Obama -- I mean Trump tried to cut the domestic appropriations by 50 billion, these hypocrites and cowards in the Republican Party on Capitol Hill raised it by 63 billion. In other words, by the time the bill came to Trump, it was 100 billion higher for domestic spending than he wanted and he had to sign it so he could get his 80 billion for defense that he didn't need.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about the -- what about the border wall? I mean, that's another priority of the President. And the President tweeted out, photos of construction work along the U.S.-Mexico border yesterday. 380 sheriffs, meanwhile, David in 40 states are calling on Congress to fund this wall. It's coming a day after the President floated the idea of using part of the Pentagon budget to pay for the wall, about $1.3 trillion spending bill signed last week included, you know, $1.6 billion in border wall spending. But much of that money can only be used to repair existing stretches of the wall not install a new one.</p><p>STOCKMAN: Well, I think the wall is the dumbest waste of money I heard in my entire career when I started in 1970. People come across the border for two reasons, to distribute drugs, they are criminals, you solve that by cancelling the war on drugs. They come here to work, you solve that by giving them work permits. If we did that, we wouldn't need any wall, we wouldn't have a border problem and the heart of the whole crime thing they're worried about is the war on drugs, it doesn't work, it simply drives it underground, creates a criminal distribution and that's the problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what do you do then?</p><p>STOCKMAN: You repeal the war on drugs.</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you get the drug dealers then from coming --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOCKMAN: All you do is you call Phillip Morris and say, you're in charge of distributing drugs in the normal civil way of commerce that everything else is distributed. Making drugs illegal is what has created this problem.</p><p>FORBES: That's another subject for another time. (INAUDIBLE) extra billion, did you say was not necessary --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOCKMAN: Absolutely not necessary.</p><p>FORBES: Or defense spending?</p><p>STOCKMAN: Absolutely not. We have -- we have a 600 billion defense budget, now it's 700 billion. The problem is not too little money, it's too many missions.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But the military has been pummeled, you know because of the sequestration.</p><p>STOCKMAN: No. They have --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We have 50 percent of the planes in the Navy, they can't even fly.</p><p>STOCKMAN: Well, but --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We haven't asked it (INAUDIBLE) in the military.</p><p>STOCKMAN: Maria, we've argued about this but let me tell you. If they didn't have so many missions, that they weren't buying 144 billion new stuff we don't need if we were actually repairing to defend the homeland and not try to please the world, they would have more than enough money out of 600 billion.</p><p>FORBES: So we shouldn't have troops in Korea?</p><p>STOCKMAN: No, we should be -- out of Korea, we should be --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOCKMAN: Absolutely, no. If Europe can't take care of itself by now with 17 billion -- trillion GDP, you know, where are we after 60 years? Japan can take care of itself, Korea needs to be, you know, the peninsula needs to be demilitarized and denuclearized and let the Koreans solve --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: How do you denuclearize if you don't have support, if you don't have the troops? You're saying, yes, let them denuclearize, that doesn't happen by an accident.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>STOCKMAN: No. The reason that they have -- they're trying to get a nuke in the north as they saw what happened to Saddam Hussein who didn't have one. They saw what happened to Gaddafi who gave his up.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>FORBES: The Koreans began their program long before Libya went down the tubes.</p><p>STOCKMAN: Well, the point is that's why they're continuing it now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We got to jump. David, great insights. Thank you. David Stockman there. Coming up. Boeing reportedly hit by the WannaCry computer virus. How the company is responding this morning amid alarming concerns that the malware could spread through airplane equipment. That's next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Boeing says it's been bit by a WannaCry ransomware attack. Cheryl Casone on headlines now. Cheryl?</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN ANCHOR: That's right, Maria. The company says the virus affected a small number of systems and a production plant in Charleston, South Carolina and despite some initial reports, the virus was spreading. Boeing said it did not cause any major disruptions. And they recall that WannaCry is the ransomware that struck thousands of computer systems in more than 70 countries around the world last year. Taking a look at shares of Boeing, stock higher in the premarket, up almost one percent.</p><p>Well, Adobe launching a new service to help companies track people across devices. Yes. The new initiative can track you on a home computer, a work laptop, a phone and a tablet by analyzing your activities . About 60 companies including Subway, Sprint, even the NFL are joining the initiative. Adobe says the service can help companies offer more personalized experiences and make advertisements less annoying. But yes, this comes as Facebook is facing mounting criticism over its handling of user data, interacting abuser. So we'll let you decide on this one. Shares of Adobe up more than 20 percent so far this year.</p><p>OK. Talk about a walk us out of this world, yes, just days after arriving at the International Space Station, two NASA astronauts are about to start a spacewalk, that's expected to last 6-1/2 hours. They're going to install new wireless communications equipment, so we're happily watching this for you, Maria. We're going to keep watching. And then finally there is this. Roseanne's return to the small screen brought in massive viewership for ABC in a breakout premier and it show wasted no time taking on politics.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROSEANNE BARR: And most of all, Lord, thank you for making America great again.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: This show racking up 18.2 million viewers over two back-to-back episodes. That makes it the second most watched entertainment program of the season, behind the post Super Bowl episode of This Is Us. And also President Trump gave Roseanne Barr a call to extend his congratulations on the show's early success. Here is what she said about that call on Good Morning America.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARR: It was, you know, just very, very sweet of him to congratulate us. It was just a friendly conversation about working and, you know, television and ratings.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He does focus a lot on ratings.</p><p>BARR: Oh, yes. He really understands the ratings and how they measure things. And that kind of an interest of mine too.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Yes. Interesting ratings sure especially when you're talking about states that are between New York and Los Angeles, big audience out there for Roseanne and the message of that show, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. 18 million, that was incredible audience. And earlier we said --</p><p>FORBES: Rosie O'Donnell that he took after the first debate --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right. The President and Rosie O'Donnell have had a fight for years.</p><p>FORBES: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But Roseanne Barr President Trump likes and has liked.</p><p>FORBES: Yes. And she shows there's a constituency out there, the Hollywood is not facing up to yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That's a -- that's a good point, Steve. I agree. All right. Coming up. I'll talk with the White House National Trade Council Director Peter Navarro. We're going to get in to the trade issues. He'll weigh in on the upcoming meeting between North and South Korea as well. President Trump's trade agenda of course and a lot more. Stay with us for that. Then the hottest cars are unveiled at the New York auto show. We're taking you there. Giving you a behind-the-scenes look before the official opening tomorrow. Back in a moment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Now, to the latest on the Korean peninsula, North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in have decided to meet on April 27th. This led mark meeting will emphasize improving inter-Korean relations and denuclearizing the peninsula. Setting the date for these historic talks will pave the way for discussions between President Trump and the hermit kingdom.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SANDERS: We would like to see this obviously, this is something of a global importance and we want to make sure that it's done as soon as we can, but we also want to make sure it's done properly and we're working towards that goal. As we've said before, the North Koreans have made that offer and we've accepted.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: This comes as senior officials revised a U.S. and South Korea trade deal that went into effect in 2012, keeping the tariffs agreed upon in the original initiative but lifting existing limits on car manufacturers. Joining us right now is the White House National Trade Counsel Director Peter Navarro. Peter, good to see you. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE NATIONAL TRADE COUNSEL: Yes. Good morning. A lot of excitement around here today. The Easter Egg hunt this weekend. So, you know, matters in state are really important here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. That sounds great. So, Peter, what do you think the significance is when you look at this meeting between North and South Korea and what that might mean for the President's trade deal with South Korea?</p><p>NAVARRO: Well, Maria, I like to stay in my lane very tightly. I can tell you two things. One is that President Trump is very actively engaged in as the head of the negotiations that will take place. My role here has been simply to operate on the trade side and I can tell you that this historic deal with South Korea will do two things. One, it will eliminate the economic tensions that we've had between our countries because of the trade deficit. And two, it will allow us from a National Security point of view that work much closer together and we've been very close for many, many decades now. I think what I find most interesting on the home front about this deal is how it affects working men and women here in America.</p><p>If you think about for example one of the elements of the agreement is this thing about light trucks. We were able to extend the ability to levy a tariff on light truck through 2041. And that means, real jobs and you got the ford F-Series, you've got the -- you got the Ram truck, you got the Chevy Silverado and all these things and building places like Flint, Michigan, Dearborn, Michigan, Warren, Michigan. And who says tariff don't work because that tariff that was put in place actually by President Lyndon Johnson has been one of the most successful in terms of building the vibrant auto industry that's important not just for manufacturing base but for defense industrial base. So President Trump visionary saw a problem coming that was going to hammer Michigan and other states making these trucks and parts, and he solved that problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>NAVARRO: And the rest of the deal of course has all sorts of great things in it looking forward that are innovative and we think it's really way to keep the trade peace as we say.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The pushback has been that it's a managed deal, it's not necessarily opening new trade with South Korea or free markets but more so managing an existing relationship.</p><p>NAVARRO: Yes. I've heard that. Two things there. One is that countries around the world have used tariffs very effectively to keep us out and to build up their own manufacturing base. And in the case of light trucks, it's a poster child for how tariffs can be good. In January we put tariffs on solar and washing machines to President Trump's leadership and what do we get? We got to flood new investment. But we're also really strongly committed to free markets and fair and reciprocal trade. And the biggest problem we've had with Korea on the trade deficit is autos and auto parts. It's 80 percent of the deficit. And so what we've done there is a combination of get the South Koreans to lift their quotas on the cars we that can send to them. At the same time they're going to lower these nontariff areas which are really insidious in the world trade environment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>NAVARRO: They used things like bogus safety standards, bogus environmental standards to keep out cars in the United States that fully meet our own safety standards which are probably higher than theirs. So it's a great thing. And of course, we've got -- we've got a currency provision and the side agreement and we got a great agreement mutually with South Korea on steel. So, it's all good.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you about -- let me ask about China, Peter, because China is obviously wishing -- issuing a warning to the United States not to start protectionist practices across the globe by increasing tariffs and we know that it is being written right now in terms of concessions that we might see. What is the list of products that will be eligible for tariffs as it relates to China?</p><p>NAVARRO: Well, again, I want to stay in my lane there and that's the purview of the Ambassador Robert Lighthizer but I can tell you that what we're doing is a matter of policy, is targeting what's called the China 2025 industries of the future which China has specifically targeted in government documents and they said hey to the rest of the world. We're taking those industries from you and we're going to do it through a bunch of industrial policies that violate free market principles. And what we're doing with the Section 301 investigations to the vision of President Trump and Ambassador Lighthizer is defending ourselves against that. So that's the thrust to that policy and we believe we can move forward with the Chinese and have a stable international trading environment but we're a long way from that because they do things like steal our intellectual properties.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me -- let me ask --</p><p>NAVARRO: Of course, the technology transfer.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me ask you this. I know that technology transfer, we've talked a lot of that on this program, Peter, and a lot people get that that China is trying to acquire out technology and be better at it than us frankly for all of these industries. But when you're looking at the investment restrictions that are to come out and I know they're being written right now in terms of China investing in United States. I mean, China has 10 sectors that are off limits to foreigners. Are we going to have something similar like that? Are we going to have restrictions in terms of financial services, semiconductors, and restrictions of how much China can acquire?</p><p>NAVARRO: Yes, I think it's important to remind American people why China is so different from everybody else. Every other country that goes in and invests in foreign countries goes there to basically earn a fair profit and a fair rate of return for their shareholders. What China does is it uses its state money, brings in trillions of dollars in the United States, in Europe, and other countries. They don't care about earning a return, they just come here pay high premium, basically take our technology through acquisitions, mergers, and other means -- venture funding.</p><p>Silicon Valley right now, they're just going in there and buying up really key technologies not just for economic future but for our military defense. And so, we need to be very careful about that. And the Chinese, unfortunately, have been transparent dating back to 2006. They've told us what they're going to go after, they told us how they're going to do it. A lot of ways going you're going to do it basically don't fit to rules of the trading environment. And President Trump, unlike every other president before him dating back to end of World War II, is actually standing up not just for the American people but for American business in our defense. So, this is important.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It sounds like we will see restrictions. It sounds like we will see restrictions on investments in those industries.</p><p>NAVARRO: That is the purview of Secretary Mnuchin and I want stand my own. What I'm saying here simply to you, Maria, is that we've identified the problem that's significant that raises issues of both economic security and national security. And we have to ask ourselves: I mean, do we want Chinese state-owned enterprise to come in and buy our artificial intelligence starts-ups in Silicon Valley, take them back to China and use them?</p><p>BARTIROMO: I was asking specifically about financial services and semiconductors, Peter.</p><p>NAVARRO: Sorry, I didn't hear that. Those are those are all sectors that are on the table for discussion, and Ambassador Bob -- Robert Lighthizer and Secretary Mnuchin are leading those discussion, and I stay out of their lane.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And I know that Ambassador Lighthizer is also working on the NAFTA deal. But Peter, let's face it, we've got elections in Mexico a couple weeks. The U.S.-Canada-Mexico, still into throws of these NAFTA negotiations. It's hard for me to expect a deal on NAFTA this year. You got the Mexican elections and then you've got that midterms elections in the U.S. Are we basically going to see a NAFTA redo after the midterms?</p><p>NAVARRO: Well, there've been six or more meetings with the three principals involving literally hundreds of negotiators. And I agree with your assessment that it's going to be very difficult as closer we get to Mexican elections.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>NAVARRO: But there's optimism. And I can tell you this: Ambassador Robert Lighthizer and President Trump would get a good deal. They're the two people that'll get it for us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Peter, good to see you, sir. Thanks so much.</p><p>NAVARRO: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Peter Navarro. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Thursday, March 29th. Your top stories right 8:35 on the East Coast. Stocks looking to rebound this morning. Take a look, futures indicating the Dow will open up 70 points, about a third of a percent higher; the NASDAQ up two-thirds of a percent higher, 39 points higher; and the S&amp;P, up a third of a percent as well.</p><p>Breaking news on the economy right now: personal income and spending both rising, that was in line with expectations, up four-tenths of a percent and two-tenths of a percent respectively. Initial jobless claims were down in the latest week to 215,000. And today marks the final trading day of the month and the quarter. The Dow and S&amp;P500 are on track for their first quarterly decline in more than two years. Stocks closing today; yesterday lower, fractionally so. The NASDAQ was worst performer, it was down nearly one percent.</p><p>We are watching market reaction to latest round of economic data. As you just heard, personal income coming in, up four-tenths, and personal spending up two-tenths of a percent. And the core PCE rate, which the Federal Reserve watches closely was up 1.6 percent again, in line with the expectations. Joining me right now is Rick Rieder, Blackrock's Global Chief Investment Officer of fixed income with $1.7 trillion in assets under management. Great to see you, Rick.</p><p>RICK RIEDER, GLOBAL CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BLACKROCK: Good to be here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. So, we just had some economic data. Do you one of PCE? I mean, how focused are you on that in terms of what it tells us about inflation?</p><p>RIEDER: Very, very importantly. In fact, as you described on air, the Fed is -- that's the Fed's number one metric. And one of the things that I think people don't recognize enough, the Fed's not really that far behind curve -- that 1.6 percent, the Fed's target is two. So, the Feds said, no raise -- core CPI is about 1.8. So, we watched Core P.C. very, very closely. If you start, which we think will happen this year, they'll accelerate over to, but when you think about that, you put that in a historic context, that's scary a number. So, the Feds are going to keep moving, but there are no raise, and there are no rush to do it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, let's talk about that, because yesterday, I was surprised to see this new speculation that the fed might raise rates five times this year, is that what you think?</p><p>RIEDER: No, no. I mean, part of this number -- the fed's going to keep going, they're going to move in the dots, there are some ambiguity around there; they go three times, four times. You know, I think one of the things that the markets are focused on is not necessarily the speed, it's where is the ultimately destination they're going and how restrictive are they going to be. And one of the things that markets got nervous about is they'll keep moving, they'll keep moving on a steady pace. They don't need to pick up pace and they don't need to go five times and pick up the pace. But it's what is the destination and that's one of the things that the markets are focused on, but they don't need the race.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, this is what -- I mean, there's been so much upset about higher rates, about the possibility of inflation, has this been all overdone? You like equities here, don't you?</p><p>RIEDER: I do. I think they will ultimately go higher. There's something -- I don't know if I have chart that we can show.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Let's bring up Rick's chart.</p><p>RIEDER: There's something that's really powerful today and what people, I don't think, considered enough is that the last five years, we've been in this environment where we've been at zero interest rates. The funds rate is set at zero. The front end of the yield curve, so two-year treasury has been at zero. So, where do you go to get your yield? You've had to go -- I mean, this chart extraordinary. By the way, if you look at this chart versus history and go back to '06, '07. (INAUDIBLE) you think about what's happening, you can now buy the front end of yield curve cheaper than dividend and the dividend payout. You look at -- I mean, it's pretty ominous when you at 06, 07. By the way, I don't think when an ominous period today, but the alternative for other -- for equities, the alternative for how you do a credit risk, or how you think bonds, high- yield bonds, et cetera. All of a sudden, you could buy the front end of the yield curve. And if you don't think the Fed is going to run faster, it's incredibly a trap today. When people -- when we finished the year, I don't think rates are moving that much higher. But I do think you can move up 10 and go to three and quarter 3-1/2. With that front end to the yield curve is all of a sudden, an alternative investment to other things that I carry really well. If I'm individual investor, I can just buy two-year treasuries. And for the first time in five years, I actually get above the rate of inflation, which is terrific.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Above the rate of inflation but not out of this world high rates. You're still -- low rates?</p><p>RIEDER: Totally.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>RIEDER: Totally. And the point being, people focus on the 10-year treasury, and I say if we get three percent 10-year, my God, it's all over. The 3-year -- you know, the 10-year treasury, we think, will probably go to three and quarter this year, but we think of more in the second half of the year, but it's not that scary -- we're not talking about historically high rates.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, 2.76 percent is where we are right now, and any time we get close to three percent, this market sells off.</p><p>RIEDER: Yes, I don't really understand. It's like, 2.95 is OK, but don't get three.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>RIEDER: Yes, I don't really understand that. I mean, there is a difference. By the way, the front-end yield curve is a big difference because it means that now I don't take any risk, I don't have to take 10- year treasury risk. That is a big deal. But listen, if rates move up gradually, then markets will be fine.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, you think there are values in equities right now?</p><p>RIEDER: I do, I do. I think.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Tell us about that.</p><p>RIEDER: So, I think what ends up happening is, you know, people, whether it's tech or tariffs, there is the short-term data that I think spooks people in terms of how much risk. And people have taken a lot of risk in January; people were building a lot of risk. Evaluations in the equity market today are not that bad. I mean, there are places, I would argue, you know, I'm not in, you know, fixed income. But when you think about, you know, somewhere where the financials are, and some of the multiples, and some of these. They're actually pretty attractive today. You know, so some complement: I could buy treasuries in the front end carry well, and then there's parts of the equity market and I could take some risk to build a balanced portfolio.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Especially going into the reporting season, which we are about to enter. The first quarter reporting is: we were expecting corporate earnings to be up 16.5 percent for the first quarter.</p><p>RIEDER: Not only earnings. I mean, we focus, we look a lot of revenues to get a sense for what is the forward growth. The revenues are going to be pretty substantial. Meaning, you're going to have what we think will be durable earnings. And I'm a big believer of this tax bill which people talk about enough the ability to write off your direct expensing. And I could, some said, company you're seeing capex surge, it means growth will continue to be good, earnings will continue to be good. And by the way, 21 percent tax rate means that these numbers going to look pretty positive for a while.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, yes. I mean, going from a corporate rate of 40 percent -- close to 40 percent to 21 percent is a huge deal. And you think this is going to have legs? It's not just going to be an overnight success, but we're going to see an impact to corporates for a year or two.</p><p>RIEDER: I think people underestimate the cash flow benefit for companies, particularly financials, particularly health care, managed care, et cetera. The flow-through because Capex writing off interest, writing off (INAUDIBLE) is a big deal, and I will spur spending. Now, that being said, there's one that I think is a concern. The amount of debt we're putting in the system is a lot.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and treasury is going to have to borrow a trillion dollars this fiscal year to cover government spending, lower tax revenue. How does that impact the bond market?</p><p>RIEDER: It's a big deal. By the way, (INAUDIBLE) and then ultimately the equity market. You know, listen, there is some part which have driven short term rates -- worth pumping so many treasury bills. We're going to do bills. We get two years, three years, five years. It's a lot of debt. For the next three years, the trillion dollars of additional net debt that has to be funded by marketplace, it's a lot. It's what will push -- you know, inflation is not scary. It's what is going to push rates moderately higher. You know, what will be key is we're going to absorb that various ways to make money and fixed income, you've got be really careful with how much interest rate exposure you have with this much issuance is going to come out of the market.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, how do you make money and fixed income right now?</p><p>RIEDER: So, first of all. I mean, you know holding the front of the -- so then, emerging markets are, you know, people have been blown away. Why would all this volatility? Emerging markets aren't moving around that much. It's because they don't have leverage to use at. And they're giving you substantial yield. So, we like only that -- we like buying a lot of secured assets. So, commercial mortgages, not agencies, carry really well, don't take a log of yield curve for us. You can make in fixed income.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let me get your take on the Libor. The journal is reporting that the race, \"Rapid Rise\", they're highlighting that. What do you think are the implications of that?</p><p>RIEDER: It's huge. I mean it today, it is the financing of the market poise. Some of them has to do with the patriation, it's a short term in Fox. I know that it has to do with the treasury bill, which and set anything done. And then, they're also financing as some of the foreign banks, because the tax bill, some impact to that. It's incredibly important because it's the gearing of how financial system works. It doesn't get focus on enough. Our senses, it'll start to stabilize here. We don't think it's come back a lot, but it will stabilize. And a lot of the pressure is from the village who slaughtered the pressure from the repatriation. We'll shut to stabilize. But people underestimate how big a deal. There's so much important (INAUDIBLE) in the financial system.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Rick, thanks so much for your insight.</p><p>RIEDER: My pleasure.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'll see you on Wall Street this weekend. Rick Rieder of Blackrock. We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Technologies got a bid this morning. Tech stocks are higher after the sell-off recently. Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange watching that and what should be boomer opening this morning, Nic.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FBN ANCHOR: I know, Maria, well, this is the last trading days you've been hinting and all the last quarters were so great, there were so much window dressing happening now because they didn't have to do that in all those prior -quarters. I got a note from over at Wedbush, Joe Colina who said as far as tech, the triple Qs were looking to the upside this morning but they were held hostage yesterday. But they expected this move and they're going to be watching the FANG Index, NVidia, Netflix, Facebook, Google, and the triple Qs need to reclaim the 100 days sooner than later. Quick look at some of the details here. So, Facebook in the premarket is up one percent.</p><p>Snap is looking higher, Amazon to the downside, Facebook cutting ties with some of the data brokers, this -- those data brokers gather your information for advertisers, they're making all kinds of changes. Before the month, Facebook is down 14 percent, and then Snap is cutting 100 employees. They've been -- it's their latest round of downsizing. Snap over the last 52 weeks, down 30 percent roughly.</p><p>And then there is Amazon, and look at the tweet from our president, President Trump, stating his concerns once again about Amazon's -- he's been saying it since the election, that they pay little or no taxes, they use the postal system as their delivery boy. Amazon a bit to the down side this morning. Before the month, it's down five percent, but certainly, we feel the White House steeping in to try and curb the dominant growth that we've been seeing for Amazon. But big picture, tech have been the story of this month. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Nic, thank you so much. Amazon not catching a bid, stock is down as you just told us, Nic. Joining us to weigh in \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" host, Stuart Varney. Stu, good to see you.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FBN HOST: You, too, maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The President says Amazon is putting thousands of retailers out of business and that's just one part of the problem he has with Amazon.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, he's clearly going after them, and that's a fact on taxes, on retailers, et cetera, et cetera.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We knew that would come, right, Stu?</p><p>VARNEY: I don't know whether it would -- I knew it would come from the President. I'm not surprised by it. After all, The Washington Post which is a principal Trump-hating vehicle is owned by Jeff Bezos, who runs Amazon. So, there is sort of a nasty connection there between the two, so I'm not that surprised, but I think this is all a precursor to a reworking of our antitrust laws. I think that the big tech companies have created quite a few enemies and a lot of concern about their power in all kinds of industries. And I think those concerns are going to come to a head with some kind of antitrust action against one or all of them. What form it takes, I don't know, because you'll have to rework the antitrust laws to take account of the 21st century as opposed to the late 19th century or early 20th century, but I think that's what's coming. And I think that's what's spooking the markets because if you really do apply some form of antitrust law to these giants, they're going to pay a price.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, well, they're more -- they're more powerful and more influential than they've ever been.</p><p>VARNEY: Oh, absolutely so, yes. I mean, look how much of the stock market rally is concentrated in the five tech stocks. It's 40 percent, something like that. Extraordinary.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, exactly. And tech is 25 percent of the S&amp;P500, right?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It's 27.</p><p>BARTIROMO: 27 percent. Stu, we'll see you in about 10 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY: Yes, you will.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins top of the hour at 9:00 a.m. Eastern right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. But first, excitement revs up for the New York auto show. We've got a sneak peek at the coolest wheels hitting the road. That's next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. NissanRenault looking to make their marriage official. The automakers have had an alliance for two decades and reports say now they may officially merge. This comes, as car companies show off their new models at this year's New York auto show. That's where we find foxnews.com Automotive Editor, Gary Gastelu. Gary, good morning to you.</p><p>GARY GASTELU, FOXNEWS.COM AUTOMOTIVE EDITOR: How you doing, Maria? You know, if you've been in the mall parking lot lately, you may not be surprised that pretty much all the cars here that are being revealed are SUVs. There's a new Subaru Forester, new Toyota RAV4 which was the best- selling vehicle in America last year that's not a pickup. And the showstopper was a pickup based on an SUV, it's the new Volkswagen Atlas Tanoak concept. And this is one that they're going to be thinking about making in Tennessee if enough people like it. More car-like than a pickup truck is going to be, it's more for lifestyle buyers, but if enough people raise their hand, they are going to go ahead and make this car because there's definitely a market for this sort of thing. And based on the attention it's been getting here, it's certainly a big hit.</p><p>You know, it's almost more unusual to see a car at a car show these days, and I've got the most unusual car at this show right now. It's the Rimac Concept Two. This is an all-electric super car that's made in Croatia of all places. It has 2,000 horsepower, which means it's about three times more powerful than the most powerful Teslas, it had a top speed of 258 miles an hour, will be the quickest car in the world when it goes on sale. And it can drive itself, at least the company says it can. We'll see about that. It is the Concept Two. They've made the Concept One which they have already sold. So, this one is definitely the real thing, 150 of them for about a million dollars a pop.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. That is -- you know, that is funny though that you would say that. It's hard to see a car at a car show but that certainly a hot wheels there. But the trend has once again been big.</p><p>GASTELU: Absolutely, Cadillac has got the new XTS, it's the Lincoln Aviator which is probably going to be one of its best-selling vehicles coming up soon. You know, the fuel economy is better, they ride better, people are moving up into the bigger vehicles. And there's no stopping that right now from what the people here are saying.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Gary, thanks so much. Gary Gastelu is up the New York auto show. We're going to take a break, then we got final thoughts from this all-star panel. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Final thoughts from our all-star panel right now. Lindsey Bell?</p><p>BELL: That's 16-1/2 percent cue on earnings numbers we're talking about. We need to remember this is the first quarter that we're going to have tax reform in those numbers. We'll see is it enough, did they move the numbers enough or not?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. And then we're going to watch guidance, obviously. We're expecting 18 percent growth in earnings for 2018. Steve Forbes?</p><p>FORBES: We should have relief that we haven't had a trade war. That South Korean agreement, not great but we didn't blow it up. Big thing, next thing we look at is NAFTA. We get the same kind of agreement there. Wipe your brow. Please stake a big one.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not going to happen before the Mexican elections.</p><p>FORBES: That's going to be huge and who's going to win that in Mexico? We could have a bad actor there, another (INAUDIBLE) type.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's right, the lefty guy. Dagen?</p><p>MCDOWELL: So, instead of going on Facebook and liking some Hillary Clinton meme that your mother posts, call her on the phone and tell her you love her. I think that -- maybe this is a warning sign that the relationships that we build and develop online are not the healthiest.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, a good point. Great panel, everybody. Thanks for being here. Wishing everybody at their happy Easter. Dagen's got you covered tomorrow. \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY\" begins now. Stu, take it away.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018032903cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S09-SBD1-JB20-G2BH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8121\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 29, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0001S8A</classCode><className>FORBES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;
