I'm Gerri Willis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight who's got billions of dollars in cash and won't spend a dime? My \"Two Cents\" in just a minute and as Dodd-Frank turns a year-old I'll be joined by the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee. He says the law killed American jobs. And he tells us how we can fix it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Another bad jobs report today. Why is the economy acting like this? We'll investigate how to break out of that cycle and \"Oh Canada\", what are they doing so right that we seem to be doing oh so wrong? All that and more tonight on THE WILLIS REPORT.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Deal or no deal? That's what we've been focused on all week, waiting for, hoping for some resolution to the debt ceiling debate and we're all praying it happens before we trip a default or a credit downgrade. We're paralyzed, not just in Washington but all over the country. A report today, major companies are sitting on piles, piles of cash, money they haven't deployed for any productive use.</p><p>GE, that's the company whose CEO advises the president on jobs, has more than $83 billion at its disposal, just sitting there. Johnson &amp; Johnson with nearly 22.5 billion, tech companies too, Apple and Oracle each sitting on $16 billion, Dell with 14. All money that could go to reinvestment, finding new cures, new technologies putting people to work, but we, we're stuck in a rut with no plan to go forward on jobs or the debt and today the final space shuttle mission, Atlantis, returned to earth, capping a 30-year, 135-mission lifespan.</p><p>No plan for how we might pursue the next frontier or even whether we want to. Deal or no deal, it's time we found one for jobs and the economy before one is forced on us that we might not like, but that's my \"Two Cents\". More on the debate on the debt coming at the bottom of the hour, but first a not so happy birthday today, the financial regulation law known as Dodd-Frank is celebrating its first birthday today and with it comes a new consumer financial protection bureau that Republicans are fighting tooth and nail.</p><p>One of those opponents, the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, Richard <person><nameText>Shelby of Alabama </nameText></person>joins me now -- great to see you, Senator.</p><p>SEN. RICHARD <person><nameText>SHELBY (R</nameText></person>), ALABAMA: Thank you, Gerri.</p><p>WILLIS: Well we listened in on you a little today in your meeting, your committee meeting on the Dodd-Frank bill and particularly interested in the conversation you had with <person><nameText>Barney Frank </nameText></person>who helped author that bill. Here is what the two of you had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you remember and I remember that in 2005 and six (INAUDIBLE), but as I remember the major opponent at that point was my Republican (INAUDIBLE) Mr. Oxley (ph) that he had a very different bill and there was a -- Mr. Oxley --</p><p>SHELBY: He had a weaker bill.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Right. In fact Mr. Oxley said --</p><p>SHELBY: You might have helped him with it?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: All right, so tell me what you made of that hearing. And did anything get done or was it just an opportunity to go over the bill itself?</p><p>SHELBY: Well, I think it was a good opportunity to go over the bill itself. Actually nothing done yet but a lot of things need to be done to the Dodd-Frank act. I pointed that out before. It was rushed to judgment and rushed to passage. Now they're rushing to put forth a lot of regulations. It is going to affect the whole economy in this country. I think we need to go back and look at it, especially the structure of how the top bureaucrat was put together.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, you know, it's interesting, Tim Geithner not too long ago said that the purpose of this law, get this, it was designed to lay a stronger foundation for innovation, economic growth and get this, job creation. How's that working out?</p><p>SHELBY: Well, as I pointed out this morning, I took Secretary Geithner's own words, and used them for a few minutes. It certainly has not spawned economic growth or job creation. It has spawned a huge bureaucracy and it is going to be interfering with the market. It is going to impede the creation of jobs. And we don't know how much power these people are going to have in the future. What we need are honestly, good consumer rules and so forth.</p><p>We all advocate that. We're all for that, but we don't need to create a czar, a consumer czar that is accountable to nobody. This is horrible. Not accountable to the Congress for funding. Not accountable to a board of governance or anything. So that's what we're trying to change. And we have sent the word, the 43 Republicans, so we're not going to confirm anybody to that job unless there's a change in this structure. I hope that the administration is listening to that.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. Well just to synopsize the changes that the GOP wants in the consumer bureau which is sort of the heart of your criticism here, establish a board of directors, subject the bureau to an appropriations process because right now they can get pretty much any money they want. Establish a safety and soundness check --</p><p>SHELBY: Absolutely.</p><p>WILLIS: So you really want controls in place. You don't want this bureau to just go off willy-nilly and do whatever they want. Right now, still a system of checks and balances.</p><p>SHELBY: Absolutely. All we're talking about is a common sense balance to this huge, powerful bureaucracy. We should have had it last year. We didn't have the votes but we're getting toward it now. And we're saying to the administration, we'll work together with you on this. We're not trying to change the mission of the consumer agency. We're trying to change the structure and to make it accountable.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, it's been laughable when you look at the entirety of Dodd-Frank how long it has taken to implement. It is not implemented in any way yet. Some 122 deadlines have been missed. Only 12 percent of 400 rule-making requirements have been completed. What does that tell you?</p><p>SHELBY: Well, it tells you that what Dodd-Frank basically is, is a horror movie, a horror movie for the American economy, a horror movie for if people are interested in taking risks and creating jobs because there is so much uncertainty out there because of what this through regulatory process this could mean to every business, financial, non-banks and so forth in this country.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. If you look at the cost, General Accountability Office just came out with estimates of the cost of implementing this thing. And it looks like it's going to be about a billion dollars, the biggest cost, bar none, that Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that you mentioned. It will cost almost 500,000 to put into place. Tell me, are you opposed to protecting consumers or do you just not like the structure of this organization?</p><p>SHELBY: Gerri, we're all consumers. We want to protect the consumers and also create products for consumers, but we don't want to create a bureaucracy that is unaccountable to the Congress for its funding, unaccountable even in governance to anyone. Creating a bureaucracy with a powerful czar there that could really impede the growth of our economy in the future.</p><p>WILLIS: You know, just to underline your points about the bureaucracy on this thing, if you look at all of Dodd-Frank, if you took all those pages it would fill 2.5 times an Empire State Building, all the paper from this thing. And it is 16 times -- it would take 16 Moby Dick novels to contain all of the Dodd-Frank rules and regulations. This thing is huge. It is leviathan. Do we really have any idea what the ultimate impact of these law changes will be?</p><p>SHELBY: Gerri, you say it very well. This is going to be a nightmare. Already it is beginning to be a bad dream but it will be a nightmare for American business.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, Senator Shelby thanks for your time today.</p><p>SHELBY: Thank you, Gerri.</p><p>WILLIS: We really appreciate it. And our coverage of the Dodd-Frank anniversary continues later in the hour. John Ulzheimer will be here with how the law impacts your credit score.</p><p>And when we come back, jobless claims were up again today, so when can our economy break out of this losing cycle. And take a look at the stocks today; you're not going to believe it. No recession there. The Dow up 152 points -- why -- strong corporate earnings. We'll be right back.</p><p>WILLIS: More disappointing news on the jobs front today. Jobless claims unexpectedly jumped as companies lay off employees at a level not seen in nearly a year. Also which major companies are sitting on almost a trillion dollars in cash, when they could be, oh, you know, using it to hire and grow the economy? Stay tuned.</p><p>WILLIS: The latest jobs report released today -- surprised -- not a very good report. Also companies laying off employees at a level not seen in nearly a year. New claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last week by 10,000, to 418,000. It isn't until weekly claims figures fall below the psychologically important 400,000 level that the economy is considered to be on the right track.</p><p>Lakshman Achuthan is the cofounder and COO of the Economic Cycle Research Institute, specializing in forecasting recessions and recoveries. We'll get to that in a second. But you know I just said the psychologically important level of 400,000.</p><p>LAKSHMAN ACHUTHAN, ECONOMIC CYCLE RESEARCH INSTITUTE COO: UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p>WILLIS: Why? Why is it so important and why can't we get below that.</p><p>ACHUTHAN: Well I think it is important, it's a nice round number and the market likes to fixate on something and you know make all kinds of nice charts. I wouldn't put too much stock in the number but that doesn't mean I'm not worried. I'm worried. I think a lot of the story that you're hearing is that there's going to be the second-half rebound after we get past the disruption of the Japanese earthquake. And to be sure you're going to see a little firming in some factory jobs but the problem is most of us don't work in factories. Most of us work in the service sector. You know the vast majority of us work --</p><p>WILLIS: And that's not coming back right now.</p><p>ACHUTHAN: It's not. In fact in the last couple of months we've got jobs growth in services at one-third the pace of what it was last spring.</p><p>WILLIS: Wow.</p><p>ACHUTHAN: And so that's a problem that you, you've got to -- it's a stretch to blame that on an earthquake in Japan. There is something more going on. And that's why your claims numbers are up in the 400's.</p><p>WILLIS: And what we've seen of course is that economists all over the country are ratcheting down their expectations for growth for the second half. So you've got to think it's going to be very difficult for employment to do much better. I want to ask you about one of the trends that we're seeing out there. People are unemployed longer and longer.</p><p>ACHUTHAN: Yes.</p><p>WILLIS: And in several states across the country now we have numbers on people who've been unemployed for -- out of work for more than a year. There are states where more than a third of the people fit that bill. And New Jersey, Georgia, Michigan, South Carolina, North Carolina, Illinois, Florida. What does this tell you?</p><p>ACHUTHAN: Well, first the slowdown is making those jobs claims numbers stay high. The long duration unemployed, over a year or more, this stuff is more related to -- we have a bubble burst. You know the housing sector bubble burst, so those construction jobs, you know, financial sector related housing stuff, that's not coming back anytime soon. And then, during this, in the panic that followed the crisis, you know, businesses were in survival mode. So they were just slashing jobs left and right. And what they found out is that they can get by using technology instead of people. And so today we have almost two million less clerical workers than we did just a couple of years ago. They have been replaced largely by technology.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, you know, we talk about unemployment. One of the cures of course would be if some of these big companies would hire people. But right now in fact we're seeing just the opposite. We're seeing tons of layoffs, this despite the fact that a lot of these companies are sitting on a ton of dough.</p><p>ACHUTHAN: Yes.</p><p>WILLIS: Let me give you some numbers here and I mentioned this at the top of the show. General Electric has $82 billion in cash --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS: Johnson &amp; Johnson, 22; Oracle and Apple -- two big tech companies here -- 16 billion in cash; Dell, 14. I don't understand --</p><p>ACHUTHAN: Yes.</p><p>WILLIS: -- why these companies are so reluctant to go out, reinvest, invent new things, find cures for diseases. Why are they so skittish, scared? Why are they such wusses?</p><p>ACHUTHAN: Well there are two pieces to it. One is we're producing a lot more with a lot less people, right? So GDP, the size of the economy is bigger than it was just before the recession. However, seven million less people are working. And so the difference in there is part of the reason they have this pile of cash that they're sitting on and they would invest it I believe if they were afraid of business beating down their doors. And right now they're not afraid of that at all.</p><p>WILLIS: Yes.</p><p>ACHUTHAN: To the contrary, you know so if they were scared of like I can't meet my demand then they would invest in people. They would invest in factories, but to the contrary you have no less an authority than the Fed chairman. And I'm going to quote him here.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ACHUTHAN: He says, when he is talking about the economic outlook he says, you know, there's an awful lot of uncertainty. That is the Fed chairman a couple of days ago. So if you're one of these companies, you say, I think I'm going to hang on to my cash for a little while just in case.</p><p>WILLIS: Yes, maybe he should be having those big press conferences. You know I know they're really popular but --</p><p>ACHUTHAN: More transparency, but --</p><p>WILLIS: All right, I have to ask you this quickly --</p><p>ACHUTHAN: Yes.</p><p>WILLIS: -- not a lot of time left. Are we going into another recession right now?</p><p>ACHUTHAN: Right now --</p><p>WILLIS: You're the expert --</p><p>ACHUTHAN: -- definitely go into another one. Right now that is the focus of all the work that we're doing. I don't have anything to report on that yet. I think it may be too early to tell, but we're working on it and I think we can make a call one way or another in the fall.</p><p>WILLIS: All right, we'll --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ACHUTHAN: -- the slow down -- here's the bad part. The slowdown is going to continue. It is not a soft patch.</p><p>WILLIS: Right.</p><p>ACHUTHAN: It's going to persist I think at least through the end of the year.</p><p>WILLIS: All right, well Lakshman you've got to come back --</p><p>ACHUTHAN: I will.</p><p>WILLIS: -- and continue to report on this for us. We really appreciate hearing from you.</p><p>ACHUTHAN: Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS: Coming up, what is Canada doing so right that we're apparently doing so wrong? And can we learn a lesson from one of our northern neighbors? We absolutely can. That's coming up next.</p><p>WILLIS: If President Obama needs more proof spending cuts, not higher taxes are the way to get this economy moving he doesn't have to look very far. Canada now has faster growth rates than the United States and a lower unemployment rate as well. There is something even more amazing about Canada's turnaround. Stay with us.</p><p>WILLIS: What's the old saying, history repeats itself? Well that is especially true when it comes to politics. And it's what we take from that history that counts. And people in Washington, they have short memories. They're either not familiar with our friends to the north or they don't care. I'm talking of course about Canada.</p><p>That country has been through what we are struggling through now and survived. Let's do a compare and contrast. We'll look at Canada circa 1993 and the U.S. today. According to Fred Barnes of \"The Weekly Standard\" who is going to join us in just a couple of moments back then Canada's government spending skyrocketed to more than 50 percent of the economy up from under 30 percent back in 1960.</p><p>Here it is more than 60 percent and could top 70 percent next year. And government debt in Canada was nearly 70 percent of GDP. Here we're topping 90 percent. The newly-elected government at the time had a conundrum. What did they do? But they did the unthinkable. They listened to their people and they actually cut spending and left major tax hikes on the cutting room floor.</p><p>Here's what that's done -- unemployment benefits cut by nearly half. Federal workforce was reduced by 14 percent. And the nation handed over their railway and air systems to private companies. I know it is all pretty radical. All in all the ratio of spending cuts to tax hikes, 7-1. And the results say it all. By 1998, Canada had -- Canada that is had gone from a nearly $37 billion deficit to a $3 billion surplus. The growth continues today.</p><p>Last year, their economy grew at a rate of more than three percent and hey, we didn't even get close to that -- unemployment closer to seven percent last month. We're still above nine percent. The facts seem pretty crystal clear. Cut and dry. Spending cuts saved their economy and it would do the same here. But President Obama and his fellow liberals refuse to face reality. They're having daily meetings on the debt, but refuse to address cuts in health care, rail projects and the ever popular green jobs not to mention the politically unpopular entitlement programs.</p><p>If you want a slap in the face here is a quote from the new book \"The Canadian Century\". Quote, \"If we want to see what would become of Canada had we not lived through the difficult changes we need to look no further than Washington, D.C.\" Look, I can't believe I'm going to say this. Don't blame Canada. We have to emulate them.</p><p>What do you think about this? Does Canada have it right? Are we going about it all wrong? Here is what some of you are tweeting me @GerriWillisFBN. This person would rather live in the U.S. \"Not even close for me. I don't want to pay high taxes to take care of my neighbor who doesn't take care of himself.\"</p><p>But Bob says \"The U.S. for now, if Obama wins in 2012, Canada for sure.\" Here is your chance to weigh in on this, our poll question tonight. Would you rather live in the U.S. or Canada? You've got to tell us what you think here. Log on to GerriWillis.com.</p><p>Take the poll on the right-hand side of the screen and I will share the results at the end of tonight's show. And like me on Facebook. I had some interesting conversations with some of you there today and it is great to hear what you have to say, always love hearing from you. And of course you can write me an e-mail <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:WillisReport@FoxBusiness.com\">WillisReport@FoxBusiness.com</email></p><p>ANNOUNCER: Coming up on THE WILLIS REPORT, as the deadline for default gets closer and closer, is it time to get behind the \"gang of six\" plan? We'll ask our \"Thursday Talkers\" next.</p><p>Jobless claims are on the rise again. Our experts analyze America's economic crisis and if high unemployment is something we're going to have to just get used to.</p><p>Kids playing playhouse in six-figure flats while homeownership is on the decline, these rich youngsters are kicking back in posh cribs. Our \"Watchdogs\" bark about it. We're on the case next on THE WILLIS REPORT.</p><p>WILLIS: The White House today saying the economy vastly improved since President Obama took office. Let's see under eight percent unemployment rate (INAUDIBLE) to 9.2 percent today, what kind of voodoo economics is this administration playing with? Our \"Thursday Talkers\" Joe Trippi and Fred Barnes, they're here next.</p><p>WILLIS: Stories tonight that are making news tomorrow. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood says the government will lose about $200 million a week in airline taxes and 4,000 workers will be furloughed if the Federal Aviation Administration is forced to shut down. LaHood also warns $2.5 billion in construction projects would be halted.</p><p>A shutdown looks increasingly likely because Congress hasn't been able to come to an agreement on legislation to extend the FAA's operating authority by midnight tomorrow. ISH (ph), an energy research group, says if the U.S. increased drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico it would create nearly a quarter of a million jobs and add $44 billion to the economy next year.</p><p>The U.S. would also produce more tax revenue and more than 400,000 barrels of oil more per day. They say regulations in the wake of the Gulf oil spill have slowed down company profits. And Google cuddling up to D.C. -- no surprise there -- the tech giant spent more than $2 million on lobbying last quarter, surpassing the milestone for the first time. The 54 percent increase came and government scrutiny into Google's business practices. In another first, Google is now spending more on lobbying than Microsoft -- surprise there.</p><p>President Obama claims America is on his side in the debt debate.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA (D-IL), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You have 80 percent of the American people who support a balanced approach. Eighty percent of the American people support an approach that includes revenues, it includes cuts.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: All right, he's right on the numbers. A Gallup poll shows the vast majority of folks want at least some tax increases. But there are an awful lot of ways to cut the numbers on a very complicated issue.</p><p>So here's a simpler question with a simpler number. The president's latest approval rating -- hey, it's under 47 percent. He's been below 50 percent for a year-and-a-half. Can you still say America is on your side?</p><p>Let's turn to the \"Thursday Talkers.\" Fred Barnes is the executive editor of The Weekly Standard and Joe Trippi is a Democratic strategist. Welcome to you both.</p><p>JOE TRIPPI, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Good to be with you.</p><p>FRED BARNES, WEEKLY STANDARD, FOX CONTRIBUTOR: Thank you.</p><p>WILLIS: All right, I want to start with \"cut, cap and balance\" because that seems to be the thing everybody's talking about. Democrats have taken a hard line against this legislation. The president says he'll veto it. Senator Conrad described its chances on the Senate floor today. Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. KENT CONRAD (D), NORTH DAKOTA: This legislation that has come over from the House cannot be the answer. It is not bipartisan, it is superpartisan. It is totally done on one side of the ledger. And Mr. President, it will not pass, it will not become law, and it should not.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIS: Well, I think a lot of people agree it's DOA. Fred, to you. Is the ball out of the Republicans' court, or should they make other proposals now?</p><p>BARNES: Well, they're going to have to. It won't pass the Senate, and so they'll come to something else. Gerri, we're going to be hearing a fresh proposal practically every hour over the next few days, and something's going to wind up passing, and it may be a short-term thing while they're still negotiating.</p><p>And you know, the press reports have been not believable, to tell you the truth, the idea that they're still going to have a huge, grand bargain, which I think is not possible, that the \"gang of six\" thing is really catching on all over Washington, and it has no chance of passing the House.</p><p>So we're at square one. But at the end of the day, the ceiling on the debt limit is going to be increased. We're not going to have a default or bar the president from borrowing any more.</p><p>WILLIS: All right, Joe, are you as downbeat about the possibility for, say, a grand bargain or some other kind of solution that people get on board and get on board quickly?</p><p>TRIPPI: No, I think Fred's exactly right here.</p><p>WILLIS: Yes?</p><p>TRIPPI: I mean, we have an abundance of agreement. There's going to be -- there's going to be some agreement. They're not going to -- they're not going to default on anything. It's going to happen. What it is, I don't know because I agree with Fred, we're going to see something every hour here coming by.</p><p>And this thing is just dead on arrival from the House going over to the Senate. The Senate's not going to vote for it. The president's going to veto it. There will be something, but I don't think anybody can put their finger on what exactly that's going to be right now.</p><p>WILLIS: Let's talk about the \"gang of six\" proposal for just a second, and we'll look at some of the details. It would immediately cut $500 billion from the deficit. It would compel the Senate to make $3.7 trillion in cuts over 10 years. They've got to go and find those cuts. It would add a trillion in revenue, net tax relief of $1.5 trillion.</p><p>Fred, to you. You know, you said you didn't think that's going to go anywhere...</p><p>BARNES: Yes...</p><p>WILLIS: ... but could some elements of it survive?</p><p>BARNES: I don't believe -- look, the one thing that will survive from the \"gang of six\" is kicking the can down the road on entitlements and tax reform. Those are not going to get in any agreement now. And they'll -- and we can have something involving the president and Republicans. It'll say, We'll get to those things later, and here's a timetable for doing it in Congress. That's the most that's going to come out of the \"gang of six\" thing.</p><p>And look, the idea that it's a net tax cut -- it's a huge tax increase. Republicans have looked at it, and it's just not going to happen.</p><p>TRIPPI: You're not going to get a tax increase. Freshman in the House are not going to let that happen, and Boehner would have problems if he did, so that's going to be a problem there. And then spending -- any touching of entitlements is going to be a problem on the Democratic side in the House and the Senate.</p><p>So I think a grand bargain may be possible, but it would take some sort of quick-fix thing that does kick the can down long enough to figure it out. And the only -- you know, this new report that Boehner and the president are working on a $3 trillion cut, spending cut, with no tax increases sounds to me like something Boehner would definitely want.</p><p>BARNES: It does.</p><p>WILLIS: Right.</p><p>TRIPPI: It gets conservatives off of his back. I mean, the Tea Party people, gets the tax increase off, but I don't know how the president gets that done. We'll see (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>BARNES: There has to be something -- there has to be something in there for Democrats and for president Obama, you know, because they both have to go along with this. You know, look, the hardest thing to find, Gerri, is an agreement that both the Senate and the House can pass.</p><p>WILLIS: But Fred, they want...</p><p>BARNES: They haven't found that yet.</p><p>WILLIS: They want opposite things. I mean, how do you find...</p><p>BARNES: Well, that's why it's...</p><p>WILLIS: ... common ground when one side says raise taxes, and the other side says don't raise taxes?</p><p>BARNES: Well...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARNES: You might have to raise taxes...</p><p>TRIPPI: Two trains coming right at each other (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>WILLIS: Listen, one quick follow-up question, and I'm going to give it to you, Joe. President Obama -- I said in the intro here that his approval rating is falling. Does he have the standing to put forward -- to see through what he wants to have done?</p><p>TRIPPI: Well, that's actually the fascinating thing about this because he's not wrong about that. I'm not talking about his approval ratings, but it's clear and a lot of recent polling says that the American people are starting to blame Republicans more than him for not coming to an agreement. I'm not saying he's going to -- we'll have to see what the agreement is to see if that carries forward, but right now, they're blaming the Republicans more than the president.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, that's our last word there. Sorry about that, Fred. You've got to come back to talk more. Appreciate your time.</p><p>BARNES: All right.</p><p>WILLIS: Both of you today, great job. Thank you.</p><p>All right, still ahead: Remember those treehouses you used to build as a child? Now kids these days are playing in replica mansions that sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars. You're going to want to see this. The \"Willis Watchdogs\" bark about it next.</p><p>WILLIS: A local TV station in Florida has been reporting the state has been selling personal information to private investigators for years, raking in almost $63 million. Now, the information comes from drivers' licenses, including numbers and birth dates. It's sold for 1 cent per file, and it adds up quickly.</p><p>Time to let the \"Willis Watchdogs\" out. George Jarkesy is the chairman and manager -- managing member, that is, of the National Eagles and Angels Association in Austin, Texas. Ben Ferguson is a radio talk show host in Memphis. And Susan Solovic is the CEO and co-founder of Itsyourbiz.com.</p><p>Susan, let's start with you.</p><p>SUSAN SOLOVIC, ITSYOURBIZ.COM CEO AND CO-FOUNDER: OK. Well, actually, here's what I have to say about this situation. It's public documentation. It's been available everywhere for many years. When I practiced law, I had access to it. So many professionals have had access to that information.</p><p>But I have to applaud the state of Florida because everybody's got a budget crisis right now, applaud them for figuring out a creative way to raise some money. And a lot of states right now, because of the housing crisis, are, you know, losing revenue base with their property taxes. So what are they doing? They're slapping small businesses with more taxes.</p><p>But Florida is ranked 18th in the most entrepreneurial-friendly state. So good for them.</p><p>WILLIS: All right...</p><p>SOLOVIC: They're figuring out a way to fund their budget.</p><p>WILLIS: But Ben, my information -- if you can sell my information, give me the money, you know what I mean?</p><p>BEN FERGUSON, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Look, I'm worth more than a penny, my information on my driver's license, for goodness sake! I mean, if you're going to -- if you're going to whore out my information, at least get a dime for it or a nickel, for goodness sakes! I don't call that good entrepreneurship. I think they need to go for some more cash, or at least let me have the option to give you one penny so you don't sell my information. Give me 5 cents! I guarantee you, people would go and pay 5 cents to not have you sell their information!</p><p>WILLIS: That's a good point.</p><p>FERGUSON: I just think this is a bad idea!</p><p>WILLIS: All right, George, so is it innovative on the part of the state, or are they actually just, you know, ripping us off?</p><p>GEORGE JARKESY, NATIONAL EAGLES AND ANGELS ASSOC. CHAIRMAN: Look, it's innovative. And if you look at it, that's $60 million that the taxpayers didn't have to come up with. Not only do I agree with it, all of that information that you have and that they're selling is available on the Internet. I know people that think that they have private data on the Internet or that they're not listed, but if you want the data, you can find it.</p><p>It's innovative. And not only that, other states should try to do that and make money for their state.</p><p>WILLIS: Boy, oh, boy, you people would sell anything!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS: All right, the Federal Election Commission says John Edwards -- John Edwards needs to repay the U.S. Treasury more than $2 million. The FEC said his 2008 presidential campaign understated its cash and overstated its expenses. The campaign got nearly $13 million in federal matching funds.</p><p>Ben, want to have a little fun with this story?</p><p>FERGUSON: Yes. John Edwards should have learned to spend more of his own campaign money real quick (INAUDIBLE) '08. No, he was already doing that, paying women to not talk about his love child! So I think he maxed out his money. I think he just screwed up, and it's time to pay back the taxpayers. And you know what? He is a lawyer. I think this could take a while until we get our money back.</p><p>WILLIS: George, what do you say?</p><p>JARKESY: Well, it was a unanimous decision, and I think he should pay the money back, and not only pay the money back but pay it with interest. He owes our government. And if you or I owe the government, we pay them, and he should pay us, and pay us as quickly as possible.</p><p>WILLIS: Pay early, pay often, Susan.</p><p>SOLOVIC: Well, actually, you said John Edwards -- he's a lawyer -- He's a good trial lawyer. If he were on the other side, he'd be aggressively fighting this situation. And here's what I think. During his campaign, you know, he really wasn't thinking with his head, he was thinking with another part of his anatomy. He took it...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>WILLIS: ... going to say what that was!</p><p>SOLOVIC: (INAUDIBLE) not to get that technical, but he got the eye off the ball (INAUDIBLE)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>SOLOVIC: He needs to pay the money back. It's that simple.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. OK. I think we'll move on.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS: You get the picture, right? All right, The New York Times is reporting on a new status symbol among some parents, some really, really wealthy parents, posh playhouses. Reportedly, some of these parents are spending upwards of $200,000 on high-end replica mansions for their kids to play in. And many of the companies that produce these make-believe palaces say their profits are booming, despite the fact that we're still in recession. George, what do you say?</p><p>JARKESY: Well, I read the article there today in \"The New York Times,\" and you know, the gentleman that they were talking about there runs a big company. He's built a company. He's made a lot of money for his investors. If that's how he wants to spend the money of his princess (ph), then that's great.</p><p>But you know, what people really need to think about is how many jobs were generated by that expenditure. So I'm for it.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, Ben, I mean, you know, good on you if you can start a business to do that. But I mean, my mother would have said, You know, there are kids starving out there. What are you doing spending $200,000 on a playhouse?</p><p>FERGUSON: Yes, I'm going to make -- I'm going to make a -- I'm going to make a prediction. There's going to be some back property taxes on this poor little girl one day.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>FERGUSON: Barack Obama's now going to be calling out these people with playhouses. And oh, by the way, the tax -- the guy's flying those private jets. So I'm telling you, I wouldn't have done the article because somebody's going to want some money off this! At the same time, look, it's his little daughter. He's got the cash. He wants to spend it. More power to him, you know?</p><p>WILLIS: All right. OK. Well, Susan, I'm sorry, we've got to go.</p><p>SOLOVIC: OK.</p><p>WILLIS: We're out of time. You've got to come back.</p><p>SOLOVIC: I'll be back.</p><p>WILLIS: All right, George, Ben, Susan, thank you so much. Great job.</p><p>And up next, more on today's the Dodd-Frank anniversary. How is the new law impacting your wallet and your credit score. John Ulzheimer -- he's coming in. He's going to tell us next.</p><p>WILLIS: As part of the Dodd-Frank bill we've been talking about, the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau officially opens today, and they're rolling out new rules intended to give consumers better insight into their own credit situation. And that includes sending you a copy of your credit score any time you're denied credit. But not all credit scores are alike, and there are things you need to be aware of.</p><p>John Ulzheimer is the president of consumer education at Smartcredit.com. John, great to see you again.</p><p>JOHN ULZHEIMER, SMARTCREDIT.COM CONSUMER ED. PRES.: Thank you for having me, Gerri. I appreciate it.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, you know, look, the credit score is the big kahuna for consumers. It is the number. It's the thing you've got to have. You used to have to pay for it. Now it's free. I've got to say, that's a good thing from Dodd-Frank.</p><p>ULZHEIMER: It's absolutely a good thing. Look, this is a very, very complicated provision of Dodd-Frank that's going to get a heck of a workout right out of the gate. Over a half a billion -- with a B -- half a billion credit applications are either denied or adversely approved, meaning approved but with less advantageous terms, every single year.</p><p>And every single one of those that's based on a credit score from this point going forward is going to require or trigger a notice from the lender, a letter to the consumer that tells them they've been denied based on the score. And they're going to have to include the score with that letter.</p><p>WILLIS: All right, so when am I due that? When, where are people going to say, OK, Gerri, you can have that credit score?</p><p>ULZHEIMER: You can have it if you're denied credit based on the score, if you're approved but with poor terms based on a credit score, if you have an APR on a credit card go up because of your credit score, or -- and this is important, this one has kind of flown under the radar -- if your insurance premiums go up or if your utility provider requires a deposit. If they're using a legitimate credit score, per the definition of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, then a credit score is required there, as well.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. I want to remind people how these things get used. It determines whether you get a mortgage loan, car loan, determines the rate on you credit cards, cell phones, insurance, utilities -- I mean, anytime you go out and buy something, right?</p><p>ULZHEIMER: Everything. Oh, yes.</p><p>WILLIS: They're looking at your credit score right over your shoulder.</p><p>ULZHEIMER: Other than applying for a job, your credit score is used almost across the board for almost every other transaction that you execute with a lender.</p><p>WILLIS: All right, now, here's the crazy thing that you want to talk about which I think is critical and surprising. You say that credit scores sold to consumers are different from the ones that companies may use. How so?</p><p>ULZHEIMER: Yes. And this is one of those things that people kind of in the know in the credit world already knew this. But the CFPB released a study earlier this week that kind of quantified what a lot of people already knew, which is that the scores that are being marketed aggressively to consumers on television ads, on the Internet, over the radio, at sporting events -- they're not really the same scores that are being sold to the lenders, which is problematic for a couple reasons.</p><p>First off, consumers are actually spending money on these things. They're not being given to them for free. They have to sign up for trial subscription services, then are being billed for them. So they're not getting the ROI out of their investment.</p><p>Second is, is the score in some cases could be misleading the consumer to believe that they're either a poorer credit risk than they really are or actually a better credit risk than they really are. And they walk into a lender's office with unrealistic expectations of how they're going to get treated, which is problematic because it can lead to significant embarrassment on the consumer's part.</p><p>WILLIS: But is that because we're just not educated about them, or is that because they're trying to mislead us?</p><p>ULZHEIMER: No, I don't think that they're purposely trying to mislead anybody. But let me give you a great example. Let's say that Gerri Willis's legitimate FICO score is 750, but the score that she gets on some Web site somewhere is 698. A 698 is very different than a 750, yet if you walk into a lender, you're going to expect to be treated like a 698, which is very different than how you're going to get treated because of your 750. That can cut both ways.</p><p>That's the biggest issue in some people's mind with respect to these artificial or educational credit scores that are being so aggressively marketed to consumers.</p><p>WILLIS: And, oh, by the way, it's 806, my friend, not 750. But I'll let you slide on that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS: Let's show folks...</p><p>ULZHEIMER: I had to be kind.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>WILLIS: There are a million companies out there that do this, and we all know Equifax, Experian, Transunion. You'll also see Affinion, Intersections, Vertrue and Fico. So at the end of the day, this is a private sector business, OK? I know you think you have to rely on this like you rely on information coming from the federal government, but the reality is, these are private companies selling your personal information, and it may be true, it may not be true.</p><p>ULZHEIMER: Yes. I think the takeaway from this is buyer beware. Buyer beware. If you find text on these Web sites that say these are educational scores, these may not be the scores that lenders are actually using, then you have to decide whether or not you want to cough up $14.95 a month to monitor your credit report and see that score all the time.</p><p>Conversely, if you want to, there are a lot of Web sites that will actually give you scores for free. They may or may not be the same ones your lenders are using, but they're out there. Credit Karma, Credit Sesame...</p><p>WILLIS: Right.</p><p>ULZHEIMER: ... Credit.com does it. So go there and get them for free, and at least you haven't given someone your credit card. And the expectation is, Look, I know this isn't my real score, but hey, I didn't pay for it.</p><p>WILLIS: Well, very good advice. Great to see you, John. Thanks for coming back in. Appreciate it.</p><p>ULZHEIMER: You bet, Gerri.</p><p>WILLIS: All right. We'll be right back with my \"2 Cents More\" and the results of our poll.</p><p>WILLIS: Earlier this hour, we told you how Canada got it right. When it slipped into its debt crisis it was spending cuts, not tax hikes that got the country back on track. So we asked on Gerriwillis.com, Would you rather live in the U.S. or in Canada? Sixty-five percent said the U.S. Yay! Thirty-five percent said Canada. Be sure to log onto Gerriwillis.com for our on-line question every weekday.</p><p>And finally tonight, remember Angelo Mozilo from Countrywide? His company was at the heart of the mortgage meltdown. Regulators eventually came in and forced Mozilo himself to pony up $67.5 million, and that was the biggest settlement of its kind at the time. But criminal charges were never made against the executive who was at the cutting edge of some of the most questionable mortgage industry practices.</p><p>Now the company finally paying $108 million to settle charges it charged excessive fees to consumers. The Federal Trade Commission brought the charge and the company agreed to pay a year ago, but Countrywide is just now beginning to pony up the money. Some 450,000 customers, a record- size group, will get about 240 bucks each, if you do the math. Cold comfort if you lost your home because of these practices. And that's my \"2 Cents More.\"</p><p>That's it for tonight's \"Willis Report.\" During the past hour, the national debt has increased to $14.522 trillion, and your share now nearly $130,000.</p><p>Thanks for joining us. And don't forget to DVR the show if you can't catch us live. We'll see you right back here tomorrow night.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WLSRPT-2011072101cb222</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WLSRPT2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:53CC-D651-DYG3-11PD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">373286</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7050\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>The Willis Report</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"07\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>July 21, 2011 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC00027GQ</classCode><className>JOHNSON &amp;

Facebook and Google are now among the world's biggest companies. However, their actions also have subjected millions of users to the threat of identity theft and loss of privacy, and record fines by the US government for privacy-related violations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And now members of both parties are in a regulating frame of mind, according to lawmakers and industry-watchers alike. Some lawmakers are calling for more aggressive antitrust enforcement against Big Tech. There's even talk of reviving the idea of Net neutrality, which requires that Internet service providers treat all data alike.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the idea that appears to have the best chance of success, these people say, is a law setting national standards for online privacy and data security.</p><p>Witness the similarity between a Massachusetts Democrat and a Tennessee Republican.</p><p>\"I think the American people now realize they deserve a privacy bill of rights,\" said US Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts. \"The day of reckoning has arrived for the Internet industry.\"</p><p>And from Senator Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee:</p><p>\"I agree with consumers who demand their privacy be protected in an Internet ecosystem where everybody is playing by the same set of rules,\" she said in a statement to the Globe.</p><p>Another Republican senator, John Kennedy of Louisiana, proposed a privacy bill last year, in tandem with Democratic colleague Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Kennedy told the Globe he plans to reintroduce the bill in the current session.</p><p>Even the tech industry's biggest companies \u2014 Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Apple \u2014 have come out in favor of a federal privacy and data security law. And in mid-January, the Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation (ITIF), a think tank funded in part by Big Tech, called for a \"grand bargain\" that would repeal all existing federal laws covering the privacy and security of various medical and financial data, and replace this patchwork with a single statute that covers personal data in all its forms.</p><p>But don't expect lawmakers to start crowing that they've finally brought Big Tech to heel.</p><p>Ernesto Falcon, legislative counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online civil liberties group, said the tech industry is getting on board because they fear tough privacy laws being enacted by the states, especially California. They prefer a single nationwide privacy standard\u2014and one that's as toothless as possible.</p><p>\"The idea would be to have a very weak federal law,\" said Falcon. \"That's an absurd proposition, and they'll have to walk away from that if they \u00adactually want legislation.\"</p><p>For instance, the proposed \"grand bargain\" from the ITIF would prohibit individuals from suing for privacy violations or data security breaches. And it doesn't include data minimization, the principle that companies may collect only the personal data they need to deliver specific services. \u00adData minimization would block apps from tracking your location when you're not using them. That would eliminate fat revenue streams for app makers that track you constantly and resell the data to marketing companies.</p><p>ITIF vice president Daniel Castro said companies use the vast amounts of data they \u00adcollect to devise new services for consumers; force them to collect less data, and you can expect less innovation.</p><p>\"There are lots of things you can do that protect consumer privacy but that's bad for \u00adinnovation,\" Castro said.</p><p>Instead, the ITIF wants lawmakers to give companies wide latitude in what data, and how much of it, they can collect, while giving consumers the option to opt out if they choose.</p><p>ITIF's grand bargain would also include \"preemption,\" a feature that would overrule all state privacy laws. The federal law would become the national standard, making it easier and cheaper for companies to comply. \"Then you don't have the problem of companies having to fight a lot of lawsuits in different states,\" Castro said.</p><p>But the tech companies could use their clout in Washington to enact a federal law with few meaningful limits on their access to our data.</p><p>\"My fear is that the companies are going to arrive and try to get the lowest common denominator,\" said Markey. \"We need a federal privacy law that sets strong mandatory, not voluntary, standards. Then we can talk about preemption.\"</p><p>Democrat Ro Khanna, a congressman who represents Silicon Valley, has drawn up an \"Internet Bill of Rights\" full of limitations on Internet companies, such as data minimization, and a mandate that companies get permission before sharing customer data with any other person or organization.</p><p>At least there's general agreement that some kind of privacy and security protections are needed. But on other tech-law issues, consensus is harder to come by.</p><p>Net neutrality, for instance \u2014 the principle that all network traffic should be treated exactly alike.</p><p>The Federal Communications Commission under President Obama adopted Net neutrality rules that in principle would let the agency enforce equality among network traffic as well as the prices charged by Internet carriers, and their quality of service. The Trump administration moved swiftly to undo that approach.</p><p>Both Democrats and Republicans have said they would back a Net neutrality law. But Khanna, for example, wants a law based on the broader standard in place under Obama; Republicans such as Blackburn prefer a simpler, stand-alone law that would simply mandate Net neutrality, and do nothing else. Don't expect much progress here.</p><p>Khanna is also calling for a law to mandate \"data portability,\" requiring Facebook and other social networks to move a user's data to another host on request, just as a cellphone user can switch his phone number from one carrier to another.</p><p>Facebook has no serious competition today, but Khanna believes that with data portability, it would be far easier for smaller players to offer \u00adconsumers an alternative.</p><p>\"You make it the law,\" said Khanna. \"You have to allow people to move their data, just like they can move their phone number.\"</p><p>But data portability is a hugely complex issue, and raises privacy threats of its own. For example, do you have the right to port information about your Facebook friends to a different network without their permission? Until such questions are answered, data portability seems like a nonstarter.</p><p>And there's the simmering question of whether the federal government should use antitrust law to rein in giants like Facebook and Google, or even break them up, as Standard Oil was dismantled in the early 20th century.</p><p>Many economists argue that existing antitrust law doesn't apply to Google and Facebook because they don't charge for their products and therefore don't obviously create direct financial harm to consumers.</p><p>Democratic US Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island plans an antitrust bill specifically targeting Big Tech. It's might have a fighting chance, as quite a few Republicans have also been making antitrust noises of late. During the recent confirmation hearings for Attorney General-designate William Barr, Senators Josh Hawley of Missouri and Mike Lee of Utah both demanded tougher antitrust enforcement from the Justice Department.</p><p>Whatever the fate of these legislative proposals, you can expect them to keep coming. The era of \"light touch\" \u00adInternet regulation is probably over.</p><p>Hiawatha Bray can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:hiawatha.bray@globe.com\">hiawatha.bray@globe.com</email> Follow him on Twitter @GlobeTechLab.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-d81a0c1e-182b-11e9-9d8e-7e65ec8b66d0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V7X-XFH1-DYHJ-34MY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1304\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 22, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Carl Sullivan[1] June 12, 2020 8:38 am While the coronavirus-related shutdowns did wonders for Amazon.com Inc.'s (NASDAQ: AMZN[2]) e-commerce delivery business, the online retailing giant hasn't entirely abandoned the physical store format. In fact, the Seattle-based company is building out a new brick-and-mortar brand right now, even as America's retailers dig out from the COVID-19 pandemic.  The move is a sign of Amazon's dominance and innovation in retail sales. </p><p>Even as local businesses are suffering, Amazon is confident there's still a place for physical retail.And the stores offer Amazon another opportunity to market its digital devices, such as the Kindle. These retail stores are a tiny part of Amazon's overall business, but may offer important branding value over time.Overall, analysts have nothing but love[3] for Amazon lately. Many have boosted their price targets for the stock to over $3,000.Along with the overall market, Amazon dropped substantially Thursday. The stock closed at $2,557.96, down 3.4%. Investors were reacting to worrying signs about coronavirus cases and the broader economy. There was also late breaking news about an antitrust case against Amazon in Europe. Namesake Store Called Amazon 4-star, the new retail outlets have already opened in some cities while others are being built. Right now, stores are open in Colorado and Texas. Other locations, including New York City and Seattle, are closed temporarily due to the coronavirus.The company has announced plans for 30 locations in 17 states. Coming soon are stores in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey and North Carolina. Even the famed Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, will be getting a 4-star.As the name implies, the stores carry mostly products that have been reviewed four stars and above by Amazon's online customers. Store curators may include some items with lower ratings and new trending items.The stores will carry a limited selection of items sold on Amazon.com, including consumer electronics, toys, games, books, home items and more. Amazon sees 4-star as an extension of Amazon.com, and will mimic some popular online features such as 'Most Wished-For' merchandise and 'If You Like, Then You'll Love' sections.'Our team of curators looks at pre-orders, sales trends, customer reviews and ratings, customer wish lists, and what amazon.com editorial teams have curated online to select only the most-loved amazon.com products for our store,' the company said on its website.Amazon Prime members who visit 4-star shops will get special discounted prices, which will be displayed alongside the normal retail price. Amazon will use the stores to try to upsell Prime memberships, which will be offered in free 30-day trials in the stores.Amazon 4-star locations will also offer an opportunity for consumers to try out Amazon devices. Customers can test drive the Echo, Kindle, Fire TV and Fire Tablet. And Amazon employees will be on hand to answer questions, the company said.This isn't Amazon's first go at in-store sales of its own devices. After Amazon purchased the Whole Foods grocery store chain, it displayed and sold Alexa speakers alongside fresh produce and other staples.Amazon 4-star shouldn't be confused with Amazon Go or Amazon Books, which are separate retail stores. There are currently plans for 24 Amazon Books stores. Amazon Go, which sells food, has locations in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Seattle. Many of these are also temporarily closed.Amazon Go is the sophisticated prototype grocery store that the company is testing. Instead of using cash registers, high-tech scanners charge consumers for each item they remove from store shelves. They simply walk out when they've completed their shopping list. The technology could impact the entire future of in-person shopping.The company also has a handful of Amazon Pop Up stores that feature a 'try-before-you-buy' experience for products like AmazonBasics Bedding. Analyst Love Earlier this week, RBC Capital Markets boosted its price target to $3,300, the highest target currently set for Amazon. The average target sits at $2,623.53.Besides RBC, other analysts also boosted their targets this week: Jefferies Financial Group ($3,100), Bank of America ($3,000) and Robert W. Baird ($2,750).Amazon has a whopping 44 Buy recommendations, three Holds and one Sell. Wells Fargo &amp;#38; Co. and the Royal Bank of Canada reiterated their Buy ratings this week.In revising its price target, RBC Capital said its recent survey of online shopping behavior shows that 'Amazon is likely the best global play off of online retail.' Consumers surveyed by RBC said they were shopping more at Amazon.com.The survey also found more shoppers have become Prime members: 67% said they were Prime members, compared with 59% in 2019.Overall, RBC predicts that the COVID-19 shift to online shopping has permanently altered consumer behavior. The firm found that other online retailers, such as Walmart, eBay and Etsy are also doing very well in this environment.To meet the increased demand, Amazon hired 175,000 temporary workers this spring. Many of those roles are being converted to permanent status. By April, the company had over 935,000 employees. That's a lot, but Walmart employs more, 2.2 million worldwide and 1.5 million in the U.S. 24/7 Wall St. Is Antitrust Push a Real Threat to Facebook Stock? <url normalizedValue=\"https://247wallst.com/media/2020/06/11/is-antitrust-a-real-threat-to-facebook-stock/\">https://247wallst.com/media/2020/06/11/is-antitrust-a-real-threat-to-facebook-stock/</url> Antitrust Case In a rare bit of negative news for Jeff Bezos' company, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that an antitrust lawsuit is imminent.The newspaper said European Union officials are preparing to charge Amazon with abusing its power to squash smaller rivals. The action is expected in the next couple of weeks.Regulators are focused on the allegation that Amazon scoops up data from third-party sellers and uses that info to undercut them. An earlier Journal investigation, based on interviews with former Amazon employees, said the company sometimes used data on third-party sellers to develop its own rival products.Amazon didn't comment on the Journal report, but in the past has denied violating any antitrust laws.The EU case against Amazon is just the latest of many antitrust investigations[4] on both sides of the Atlantic against big tech companies, including Google, Facebook and Apple. European regulators have been more aggressive, and their case against Amazon could be one of their biggest.Last year, the EU fined Google 1.7 billion Euros[5] for abusing its power in the online advertising market. It was the third huge fine the Union levied on the search giant.

Well, with the escalating crisis, Zoom is now worth more than four airlines combined \u2014 United, Delta, American and JetBlue \u2014 with a market cap of just above $44 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With all due respect to Zoom, which makes a very good product that is very useful, sometimes problematic (do a search for \u201cZoomBombing\u201d) and even delightful (there has been a Zoom wedding): That\u2019s just insane.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How crazy? Well, along with its huge valuation, Zoom has seen its share price go from $62 about a year ago when it went public to close to $160 today. The company has an unheard-of price-to-earning ratio of 1,865 (this is usually considered a good measure of a company\u2019s true value; by way of comparison, Facebook\u2019s is 23 and Google\u2019s is 21).</p><p>This is Wall Street over-indexing to very dire problems \u2014 so it\u2019s a good time to assess how the coronavirus crisis will actually affect big tech. How will the most important industry in the United States emerge from a financial slump? How will government efforts to alleviate the pain of the crash affect the industry? Given tech\u2019s outsized role in both the stock market and the larger economy, how the industry fares will be important to the overall recovery.</p><p>Let\u2019s start on a positive note: Despite having lost big chunks of market value since the beginning of the year, nearly every company among the big five (Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook) will do just fine when this crisis eventually passes.</p><p>That\u2019s because all are larded up with cash, and some have a nearly monopolistic grip on their business arenas, such as online advertising (Google), e-commerce (Amazon) and social media (Facebook), that are not going away. That is a head start that lesser rivals \u2014 who will now have to eat up their seed corn to stay viable \u2014 cannot compete against.</p><p>There will be a culling of most competitors of these giants that will only strengthen the power and reach of the behemoths, eliminating pesky roadblocks to their further domination. This is obviously not a good thing in the long run.</p><p>As the economy returns to normal, the impulse will be toward bolstering our big corporations in hopes they will repair the unemployment problem. And those companies that are able to hire and protect their employees will be the most feted, and their success will be one of the key benchmarks of the economy\u2019s health.</p><p>Its main ad business will no doubt take a hit over the next few quarters, but Facebook is reporting a jump in video views, messaging and news consumption, as users try to connect online while sheltering in place. To generate good will, Facebook has been handing out extra pay to its employees, while also donating face masks it had bought last year for the California wildfires.</p><p>Alphabet\u2019s Google search service and YouTube video unit \u2014 also subject to the vicissitudes of the advertising market \u2014 have seen surges in use, while many of the company\u2019s other products and its cloud services are doing well. And that trend will persist: More Americans are using these services more intensely and becoming accustomed to their efficacy.</p><p>Amazon will be one of the main beneficiaries of the crisis as more consumers use its delivery and entertainment services, and as more companies move over to its cloud business, Amazon Web Services. So too for its analog Whole Foods Market, which has remained open during the slowdown for both delivery and walk-in customers. Amazon said last week it was looking to hire 100,000 warehouse workers to meet the increased demand, which is no surprise.</p><p>And so it goes: Apple\u2019s supply chain from China is being restored as that country recovers ahead of the rest of the world from Covid-19, and its diversification into other services like streaming has only been bolstered by the crisis. Microsoft\u2019s cloud service and Teams collaboration product have also experienced a spike in use.</p><p>And one major plus for all of them: Their questionable behaviors around competition, the spread of disinformation and hate speech, addiction and more will not be subject to the same regulatory scrutiny that had been building over the last year. In fact, it seems less likely that government officials \u2014 in the United States, at least, where their hands are full with more pressing issues \u2014 will be as enthusiastic to pass legislation or levy fines to thwart the growing power of tech.</p><p>Still, some big tech companies are vulnerable. Airbnb, the home-rental giant that has seen its listings drop precipitously, will likely not go public this year as planned. The company will probably need to raise more funds at less attractive terms to add to its $4 billion in liquidity, and need to do yeoman\u2019s work to re-convince its hosts and customers that high-analog-touch businesses are OK (side note: Their hotel rivals are even more exposed).</p><p>The same is true for the car-sharing leader, Uber, which was already struggling with increased costs as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/opinion/coronavirus-tech-facebook.html\">states seek to recategorize</url>their drivers from contract workers to employees entitled to benefits. And getting people back into the habit of using Uber cars instead of their own after the pandemic ends will be a heavy lift.</p><p>As for the scooter and other alternate mobility businesses that Uber has been building, along with competitors like Lime and Bird, it\u2019s going to be a bumpy ride. The only saving grace is that the onset of warmer weather could mean increased usage.</p><p>But there\u2019s one major thing that tech companies cannot avoid: taxes. As the well-known Silicon Valley investor Chamath Palihapitiya pointed out to me in an interview this week, \u201cIt\u2019s where the money is, so it is where governments are going to go when they need relief.\u201d He added that a federal role in backing businesses will make it a bigger player in tech and beyond. \u201cAll U.S. citizens will all become shareholders in a way,\u201d he said.</p><p>Governments are racking up ginormous deficits for stimulus packages, and they will have higher costs for health care \u2014 and as Mr. Palihapitiya noted, all of this has to be paid by someone. There is no question that governments will turn to businesses with huge profits to help foot the bill. That means big tech, more than any other industry, both here in the United States and abroad.</p><p>Because there are two things we can always rely on, during this horrible pandemic and in normal times: death and taxes.</p><p>The Times is committed to publishing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/opinion/coronavirus-tech-facebook.html\">a diversity of letters</url> to the editor.

Well, with the escalating crisis, Zoom is now worth more than four airlines combined - United, Delta, American and JetBlue - with a market cap of just above $44 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With all due respect to Zoom, which makes a very good product that is very useful, sometimes problematic (do a search for \"ZoomBombing\") and even delightful (there has been a Zoom wedding): That's just insane.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How crazy? Well, along with its huge valuation, Zoom has seen its share price go from $62 about a year ago when it went public to close to $160 today. The company has an unheard-of price-to-earning ratio of 1,865 (this is usually considered a good measure of a company's true value; by way of comparison, Facebook's is 23 and Google's is 21).</p><p>This is Wall Street over-indexing to very dire problems - so it's a good time to assess how the coronavirus crisis will actually affect big tech. How will the most important industry in the United States emerge from a financial slump? How will government efforts to alleviate the pain of the crash affect the industry? Given tech's outsized role in both the stock market and the larger economy, how the industry fares will be important to the overall recovery.</p><p>Let's start on a positive note: Despite having lost big chunks of market value since the beginning of the year, nearly every company among the big five (Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook) will do just fine when this crisis eventually passes.</p><p>That's because all are larded up with cash, and some have a nearly monopolistic grip on their business arenas, such as online advertising (Google), e-commerce (Amazon) and social media (Facebook), that are not going away. That is a head start that lesser rivals - who will now have to eat up their seed corn to stay viable - cannot compete against.</p><p>There will be a culling of most competitors of these giants that will only strengthen the power and reach of the behemoths, eliminating pesky roadblocks to their further domination. This is obviously not a good thing in the long run.</p><p>As the economy returns to normal, the impulse will be toward bolstering our big corporations in hopes they will repair the unemployment problem. And those companies that are able to hire and protect their employees will be the most feted, and their success will be one of the key benchmarks of the economy's health.</p><p>Its main ad business will no doubt take a hit over the next few quarters, but Facebook is reporting a jump in video views, messaging and news consumption, as users try to connect online while sheltering in place. To generate good will, Facebook has been handing out extra pay to its employees, while also donating face masks it had bought last year for the California wildfires.</p><p>Alphabet's Google search service and YouTube video unit - also subject to the vicissitudes of the advertising market - have seen surges in use, while many of the company's other products and its cloud services are doing well. And that trend will persist: More Americans are using these services more intensely and becoming accustomed to their efficacy.</p><p>Amazon will be one of the main beneficiaries of the crisis as more consumers use its delivery and entertainment services, and as more companies move over to its cloud business, Amazon Web Services. So too for its analog Whole Foods Market, which has remained open during the slowdown for both delivery and walk-in customers. Amazon said last week it was looking to hire 100,000 warehouse workers to meet the increased demand, which is no surprise.</p><p>And so it goes: Apple's supply chain from China is being restored as that country recovers ahead of the rest of the world from Covid-19, and its diversification into other services like streaming has only been bolstered by the crisis. Microsoft's cloud service and Teams collaboration product have also experienced a spike in use.</p><p>And one major plus for all of them: Their questionable behaviors around competition, the spread of disinformation and hate speech, addiction and more will not be subject to the same regulatory scrutiny that had been building over the last year. In fact, it seems less likely that government officials - in the United States, at least, where their hands are full with more pressing issues - will be as enthusiastic to pass legislation or levy fines to thwart the growing power of tech.</p><p>Still, some big tech companies are vulnerable. Airbnb, the home-rental giant that has seen its listings drop precipitously, will likely not go public this year as planned. The company will probably need to raise more funds at less attractive terms to add to its $4 billion in liquidity, and need to do yeoman's work to re-convince its hosts and customers that high-analog-touch businesses are OK (side note: Their hotel rivals are even more exposed).</p><p>The same is true for the car-sharing leader, Uber, which was already struggling with increased costs as states seek to recategorize their drivers from contract workers to employees entitled to benefits. And getting people back into the habit of using Uber cars instead of their own after the pandemic ends will be a heavy lift.</p><p>As for the scooter and other alternate mobility businesses that Uber has been building, along with competitors like Lime and Bird, it's going to be a bumpy ride. The only saving grace is that the onset of warmer weather could mean increased usage.</p><p>But there's one major thing that tech companies cannot avoid: taxes. As the well-known Silicon Valley investor Chamath Palihapitiya pointed out to me in an interview this week, \"It's where the money is, so it is where governments are going to go when they need relief.\" He added that a federal role in backing businesses will make it a bigger player in tech and beyond. \"All U.S. citizens will all become shareholders in a way,\" he said.</p><p>Governments are racking up ginormous deficits for stimulus packages, and they will have higher costs for health care - and as Mr. Palihapitiya noted, all of this has to be paid by someone. There is no question that governments will turn to businesses with huge profits to help foot the bill. That means big tech, more than any other industry, both here in the United States and abroad.</p><p>Because there are two things we can always rely on, during this horrible pandemic and in normal times: death and taxes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Times is committed to publishing </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a diversity of letters</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> to the editor.

But while MEPs have clamoured to stick the knife into big tech, they are in danger of ushering in legislation that could end up solidifying the hegemony of exactly the same US firms they are so keen to curtail.The controversial bits of the proposed Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market \u2013 as far as the online giants are concerned \u2013 come down to two articles that its critics say will fundamentally change the way the internet works in Europe and stifle online innovation in the process. Article 13 \u2013 sometimes called the \u201cmeme ban\u201d \u2013 would make online platforms (think YouTube, Twitter and Facebook) responsible for identifying and removing any\u00a0copyrighted content that appears on their services.Tech firms argue that this would require the use of automatic content filters to detect copyrighted content, which would mean that parodies \u2013 and memes \u2013 might be caught in the crossfire.Equally controversial is Article\u00a011 \u2013 the link tax. </p><p>The objective here is to get news aggregator sites \u2013 such as Google News \u2013 to pay publishers for using snippets of their articles on their platforms. Attempts to bring in similar rules on a national level have already been tried (and have failed) in Spain and Germany. Copyright experts have roundly criticised both articles as unworkable and incompatible with existing EU legislation.Platforms such as Google News control such a significant share of\u00a0traffic to online publishers, it makes sense that big publishers will be quick to sign royalty-free licensing deals that benefit them bothSo how did such a seemingly flawed directive get passed, last September, by the European Parliament? A statement given by the MEP who played the leading role in\u00a0shepherding the directive through the vote gives us one\u00a0clue.\u201cI am very glad that despite the very strong lobbying campaign by the internet giants, there is now a majority in the full house backing the need to protect the principle of\u00a0fair pay for European creatives,\u201d said the German MEP Axel Voss in the wake of the vote. Of course, what Voss neglected to mention is that \u2013 if the European Commission\u2019s lobbying records are anything to go by \u2013 it was actually the music and publishing industry lobbyists who were shouting the loudest during the run-up to the vote.But this didn\u2019t stop anti-GAFA triumphalism reigning in the wake of September\u2019s vote. The sad irony is that if the controversial directive ever makes it into law \u2013 and right now it is languishing in the EU\u2019s legislative long grass \u2013 it will only bolster Google\u2019s current online dominance to\u00a0the detriment of less well E'established competitors.If online platforms have to put in place filters to check uploads for copyrighted content, Google already has a\u00a0system it can sell them: content\u00a0ID. And since platforms such as Google News control such a significant share of traffic to online publishers, it makes sense that big publishers will be quick to sign royalty-free licensing deals that benefit them both. Legislators, take note: even when Silicon Valley loses, it\u2019s still winning.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RBIEGI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RBIEGI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFM-PK11-JCF2-H359-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">274985</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"633\"/><timeReceived>07:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Reed Business Information Ltd.

Over 750 companies, including Unilever and Coca-Cola, are taking part in a one month boycott of the platform, in an effort to increase the platform\u2019s accountability and combat hate speech.    Facebook is no stranger to controversy. Zuckerberg has been warding off criticism for years, most notably for allowing data to be harvested without consent. Facebook\u2019s behaviour modification technology has also been criticised. Silicon Valley investor, and one-time mentor to Mark Zuckerberg, Roger McNamee describes the \u201cpersuasive technology\u201d used by Facebook as a combination of psychology, propaganda and rewards linked to people\u2019s need for validation and approval. Sean Parker, Facebook\u2019s first president, said that \u201cwe need to give you a little dopamine hit once in a while, because someone liked or commented on a post or whatever\u2026it\u2019s a social validation feedback loop\u201d. He went on to say \u201c[this technology] literally changes your relationship with society.\u201d    If advertisers fail, will then regulators succeed?    Even though 98% of Facebook\u2019s revenues come from advertising, the senior management team seems confident that the current boycott will be a flash in the pan. However, an advertising drought is not Facebook\u2019s only problem. Zuckerberg, along with Bezos of Amazon and Pichai of Alphabet, is, later this month, set to appear before Congress at an antitrust hearing whose aim is to ascertain if smaller companies are being marginalised, stymying competition.    The thorny factor here is data. Like Facebook, Amazon is an expert in data collection and mining. In its dual role as a retailer and marketplace, Amazon gathers data from small, independent sellers, which is then used to promote its own products.    Could these antitrust hearings be the start of a wider pattern to rein in the powers of big tech? It\u2019s probably too early to say for sure, but there is an increasing political will to weaken them. Senator Elizabeth Warren, who\u2019s a contender to be Joe Biden\u2019s VP running mate in the 2020 presidential election, has been vocal about the need to bring such companies to heel, promising to break them up. For Facebook, that would involve reversing major acquisitions, such as Instagram and WhatsApp.    US tech titans have also drawn the ire of the Trump administration, so regardless of who wins The Whitehouse in November, there are likely to be numerous bumps in the road ahead. As investors, we\u2019ve been wary for some time about companies dependent on the use of big data . Recent developments have cemented that view especially as these high-flyers are priced for perfection, making them vulnerable to a change in sentiment.

The study is based on over 400 academic and journalistic pieces, and traces the emergence and consolidation of Big Tech companies in India, a trend that has been accelerated due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The competition for Indian markets is also heating up, with Google\u2019s plan to invest $10 bn in India and Facebook and Google\u2019s investments in Jio Platforms.  Key Findings    Big Tech firms are important for India\u2019s digital journey.  Google, with 95% of India\u2019s desktop search enquiries is a gateway to the internet for a vast majority of Indians. Amazon has been running its public sector programme in India since 2017, helping government agencies and offices to switch to cloud-based systems.  Foreign Big Tech firms dominate Indian markets:  With more than 400 million monthly average users (MAU), India is WhatsApp\u2019s largest market. Facebook has 328 million monthly active users (MAU) and a user base of 270 million users in India - the highest in the world. Amazon also has a large market presence, with at least 30% market share in e-commerce and more than 5.5 lakh sellers on its platform. Big Tech firms provide market infrastructure and innovation, but also have anti-competitive practices. This can sometimes crowd-out smaller players with less capital in the market. Addressing the market power of Big Tech companies requires updating competition policy, platform neutrality, and platform interoperability.  Big Tech firms affect India\u2019s civic life:  People in India increasingly rely on digital platforms\u2014search (32%) or social media (24%)\u2014as their main way of accessing news online. Political parties, candidates and other stakeholders spent $7.74 million to enlist the services of companies such as Google and Facebook in the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. Their platforms enable access to information and communication, but are also prone to misinformation and politicisation. To be responsible information gateways, Big Tech platforms should adhere to publisher ethics and open up their algorithms to external audit.  Big Tech firms lead to privacy concerns:  Like many other digital companies, Big Tech companies such as Google Pay and Amazon Pay often do not explicitly state what kind of sensitive information is being collected or what grievance redressal mechanisms are available. In 2019, France Data Protection Authority levied a fine of $57 Mn to Google for breaching GDPR. Personalised services provided by Big Tech companies are valuable for many users, but can undermine individual and group privacy. In addition to individual privacy rights, we need to establish collective data rights, develop models for data stewardship, and mandate Big Tech firms to privacy protecting business models.  Data, Taxation and Law Enforcement are big pain points:  14 out of the 15 data centres owned by Facebook are located in developed countries despite India being Facebook\u2019s largest market. Big Tech companies products and services are filling gaps in state capacity, but this raises concerns around democratic accountability and sovereign independence. Securing India\u2019s sovereign interests in the digital economy, requires investments in state and market capacity, fair taxation and better cross-better data flows.  Reliance Jio is India\u2019s likeliest Big Tech firm:  It increasingly resembles many of the markers of Big Tech. For example, in 2019, Reliance Jio set up Jio Platforms as an umbrella platform for all the Reliance-owned digital businesses. In May 2020, Jio Platforms was reported to be the fourth largest Indian company by market. With $10 billion Facebook investment, Reliance Jio is rapidly expanding. Jio Mart outlets across 200 cities in India. Reliance Jio is also expanding horizontally by adding new portfolios through mergers and acquisitions. Reliance spent nearly $1.33 billion in 2018 to acquire a diverse range of start-ups.  India needs a graded approach to Big Tech regulation.  Some policy pathways are implementable in the short-run, while others will require international coordination and are complex. Trying to solve the most thorny issues first might delay other, quicker fixes. For example, the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) establishes new norms for company accountability, allowing Californians to opt out of the selling of their personal information. To reinforce this right, businesses have to provide a clear link on their homepage titled \u2018Do Not Sell My Personal Information\u2019 that enables the consumer to opt out. Similarly, German regulators in 2019 ruled that Facebook will have to stop automatically collecting and combining data from subsidiaries like Instagram and WhatsApp. Instead, it needs to give German users a choice. Such a step prevents companies from building comprehensive user profiles for targeted advertising.

Bernie Sanders landing on a shared political opinion is a rarefied happening.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But it appears the groundswell of concern and actions focused on big U.S. tech companies - and the question of how much power is too much - is providing at least a temporary bridge across a partisan divide that has proven too large a span for virtually every other major issue. And Utah is in the mix on big tech antitrust concerns as Attorney General Sean Reyes appears poised to join other states in coordinated investigations focused on large tech companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump has been publicly critical of various big, domestic technology concerns and the power they wield, including a recent lambasting of Google, which the president claimed in a tweet last week has an inherent liberal bias and led millions of undecided voters to support Sen. Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. And Sanders, along with fellow Democratic presidential contender Sen. Elizabeth Warren, has made calling for a potential breakup of big tech companies like Amazon, Facebook and Google part of his campaign platform.</p><p>Even conservative Utah Sen. Mike Lee, who rode into office on a wave propagated by the Tea Party movement in 2010 - a political subgroup that embraces small government and light-touch regulation among its tenets - pushed back against recent criticisms that he's softened his stance on big tech thanks to campaign donations with ties to Google. A Lee spokesman told the Deseret News Utah's senior senator has not changed his stance on big tech and, in a recent blogpost, cited a 2011 letter to the Federal Trade Commission in which Lee, along with then-Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., called on the agency \"to investigate\u00a0the issues raised at our (Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competitive Policy and Consumer Rights) hearing to determine whether Google's actions violate antitrust law or substantially harm consumers or competition in this vital industry.\"</p><p>Those investigations appear now to be a functional reality, with the Federal Trade Commission and U.S. Department of Justice having divvied up responsibilities a few months ago, with the Justice Department taking investigative authority over a Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Apple, while the FTC has jurisdictional oversight of Facebook and Amazon. In a July 23 release, the DOJ announced it had begun \"reviewing whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation or otherwise harmed consumers.\"</p><p>UCLA professor Ramesh Srinivasan recently authored a Washington Post op-ed in which he critiqued the research performed by academic psychologist Robert Epstein, the basis of Trump's social media postings about Google's alleged influence on 2016 election results.</p><p>Srinivasan, a self-described progressive who has done policy consulting for both Sanders and Warren, argues that while Epstein's basis of fact is squishy, he agrees that Google's power has ascended to the point of deep concern.</p><p>\"We both agree that the digital systems we use every day are dangerous to democracy,\" Srinivasan wrote. \"This is because the voices that create and monetize them are extremely limited - paving the way for a few tech billionaires to create the empires that monitor us daily, giving them the potential to manipulate our behavior.\"</p><p>Srinivasan, whose forthcoming book \"Beyond the Valley\" looks at the power of big tech and potential paths forward to make innovation \"fairer and more democratic,\" told the Deseret News that antitrust actions are just one of a number of strategies that could be employed to restore some balance between the rights of individuals and the power of big business.</p><p>\"People have a right to understand what is known about them,\" Srinivasan said. \"I think that is something fundamental not only to a democracy but also to the free market.</p><p>\"The labor at these companies is done by machines ... algorithmic systems that can mine data, determine what you can see and make decisions for you,\" he said. \"Also, none of us are being compensated for the data we provide ... data that generates billions in profits and trillions in valuation for those companies that receive the spoils of that data.\"</p><p>An upcoming hearing of the Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, which Lee co-chairs with Minnesota Democrat and current presidential candidate Sen. Amy Klobuchar, is an example of the bipartisanship big tech antitrust concerns is fomenting among Washington politicians.</p><p>Originally scheduled for July, the hearing will put FTC Chairman Joseph Simons and Makan Delrahim from the DOJ's antitrust division in witness chairs on Sept. 17.</p><p>Lee and Klobuchar's joint statement about their respective goals for the inquiry reflect some of the differences in how Republicans and Democrats are approaching big tech antitrust issues.</p><p>Lee is after details of federal investigation pathways, likely stemming from his argument that the legal measure of antitrust investigations needs to stay focused on \"consumer welfare.\"</p><p>\"As the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division are apparently poised to begin investigations into possible antitrust violations by the tech industry, I am interested to learn more about the conduct the agencies will examine and the resources they will require to carry out this mission,\" Lee said in a statement.</p><p>\"I also intend to explore how and why the agencies are splitting the review of these tech firms between the two agencies.\"</p><p>Klobuchar sees possible anticompetitive practices as a necessary central focus.</p><p>\"In the wake of multiple reports that the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission may finally be initiating antitrust investigations into the largest tech firms, it's critical that we and the American people have a good sense of what the agencies are actually doing to protect competition in this important part of our economy,\" Klobuchar said in a statement.</p><p>\"We need antitrust enforcement that meets the demands of the 21st century economy and enforcement agencies that have the resources and the will to undertake aggressive enforcement whenever and wherever competition is under threat. I look forward to discussing these matters with agency leadership,\" she said.</p><p>University of Utah S.J. Quinney College of Law law professor and antitrust specialist Jorge Contreras said while California's Silicon Valley companies, which include Google, Facebook and Apple, have been generally supportive of the Democratic Party, and even funneled talent to staff positions for former President Barack Obama, each party has its own stable of big business supporters. Taking aim at big tech concerns - from both sides of the political divide - has become a politically expedient maneuver, Contreras said.</p><p>\"It's become politically fashionable for people on both sides of the aisle to call for investigations,\" Contreras said. \"I think the end point will differ significantly depending on which side is in charge and running the investigations.\"</p><p>Those remedies, Contreras believes, could range from \"a very tailored remedy\" should it come under a Republican controlled administration versus something much more sweeping should it occur under Democratic leadership. Remediation under a progressive administration could include \"big structural remedies, possibly breaking up a company\" or redefining how consumer data can be handled, perhaps via a nonprofit trust, Contreras said.</p><p>The bipartisan interest in investigating big tech companies by federal elected officials is also trickling down to the state level.</p><p>The Wall Street Journal reported last week that a \"group of states is preparing to move forward with a joint antitrust investigation of big technology companies,\" actions that have been expected for some months and may include the participation of the Utah Attorney General's Office.</p><p>Reyes and 42 other state attorneys general signed a 25-page document that was submitted to the Federal Trade Commission in June following a series of gatherings that included both Republican and Democratic attorneys general as well as FTC representatives. Those meetings included conversations focused on how such big tech businesses block out competitors by sheer size and scope, why the intersection of personal data privacy and competition requires scrutiny, and how current, outdated antitrust regulations fall short of being an effective tool.</p><p>Reyes' deputy and antitrust specialist, David Sonnenreich, said the analysis and discussions did not target any particular company and were intended to be a \"call for recalibrating the way we look at antitrust and big tech.\"</p><p>When asked this week if Utah would be participating in a coordinated effort among states to investigate, Reyes' office declined to comment. But in July, Reyes said he could not \"confirm or deny the existence of any specific investigations at this time,\" and said that it's typical for investigations to stay under wraps in complex cases.</p><p>\"As conversations about these issues develop, Utah will continue to actively participate,\" Reyes said in a prepared response. \"It is also worth noting that antitrust investigations into complex industries frequently take a year or longer before they become public or result in a lawsuit being filed.\"</p><p>Representatives for the tech giants argue the politicians are headed down the wrong path.</p><p>Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel for tech trade association NetChoice, testified before the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee in July in a two-part proceeding that included bipartisan grilling of witnesses about potential anticompetitive practices by big tech companies. NetChoice counts Facebook, Google, Twitter and others among its membership.</p><p>Szabo told the Deseret News there's a sentiment afoot at state and federal levels to weaponize federal antitrust law.</p><p>\"What you're seeing is an attempt to use antitrust as a weapon to intimidate tech companies into complying with the whims of politicians,\" Szabo said. \"And that's creating a dangerous precedent, not only for how we evaluate antitrust law for all businesses, but how we choose to treat issues of free speech for America.\"</p><p>Szabo said the \"lash outs\" from some elected officials have stemmed from \"tech businesses supporting or opposing the speech of a particular politician.\"</p><p>He also noted polling conducted by his group, and others, reflects a disconnect between the will of voters and the \"antitrust agendas\" coming from both sides of the political divide.</p><p>\"We did some polling and, not surprisingly, those making calls for anti-tech activity are out of touch,\" Szabo said. \"Polling conducted by NBC and the Wall Street Journal showed that Americans overwhelmingly like and support companies such as Google and Twitter and even companies like Facebook had a 50-50 breakdown.</p><p>\"Democrats and Republicans advocating for anti-tech activity puts them out of touch with their constituents.\"</p><p>EMAIL: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:araymond@deseretnews.com\">araymond@deseretnews.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESNWS-45684957</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WYG-J8Y1-JBRG-X2HV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1852\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Deseret News Publishing Co.</copyright><publicationName>Deseret Morning News (Salt Lake City)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 2, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0002JIM</classCode><className>ALPHABET INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

If they execute that well, they can better defend and potentially expand their franchises, and possibly offer new products or services. If not, their market positions and profitability could shrink.</p><p>Digital solutions will not only allow banks to attract more clients and open up new revenue channels, but also become more efficient, all keys to succeeding in tomorrow's digital environment. Such considerations form part of its assessment of banks' business positions.</p><p>In S&amp;P's view, the increased transparency and further commoditization of retail banking services will likely reduce banks' traditional revenue potential by more than 20 per cent, with more servicers competing for the same client pool. S&amp;P think revenues might be even more at risk in markets with high-margin consumers, where mortgage lending is being commoditized faster.</p><p>This situation represents a challenge for banks' business models, since retail banking generates on average about 50 per cent of total banking revenues.</p><p>What's more, technology is a leveller. S&amp;P believe the barriers to entering the banking market have reduced materially and are structurally altering the competitive landscape. The cost of launching a digital retail banking product for a fintech company is now marginal compared with that for a traditional bank operating from a brick-and-mortar branch network. It is against this backdrop that S&amp;P carried out its tech disruption survey to show where banking systems stand with respect to fits broad areas: mobile banking, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and blockchain.</p><p>Change has already begun</p><p>Traditional banks are already bracing themselves for disruption. According to KPMG, 73 per cent of the $100 billion poured into fintech investments over 2012-2017 were for innovation in banking services for retail and small and midsize enterprise (SME) clients. Fintech and Big Tech companies have already spotted the weaknesses of traditional banks, many handicapped by complex legacy systems, limited capacity to invest, and low customer confidence. On the other hand, some tech players are using their readily available know-how and material budgets to enter the financial services market.</p><p>Although the environment for banking systems varies across the globe, S&amp;P believes banks will increasingly adopt new technologies, and all will eventually go digital. In its view, new technologies will enable currently unbanked or underbanked individuals and SMEs to better access banking services, particularly in emerging markets.</p><p>This trend is already visible in China and many developing economies, where smartphones are spurring greater financial inclusion, opening up access routes for bank service providers and for society as a whole by serving residents that previously had no access to banking services. At the same time, S&amp;P expect banks in Europe and North America to first seek to reduce costs and only then increasingly invest in digital banking solutions to create additional revenue streams.</p><p>Technologies at the forefront</p><p>S&amp;P believes the availability and fast development of technology will lead to a structural shift in the banking industry. S&amp;P expects four technology types will gain in importance and represent important considerations in determining the winners and losers in retail banking over the next few years.</p><p>Mobile banking</p><p>Fully digitized and convenient ways to offer and execute services and products will enable banks to onboard and retain existing clients. Simultaneously, banking will be more easily available to the unbanked or underbanked population and to SMEs, facilitating greater financial inclusion. The comparably lower incremental investment versus running a large branch network will further lower barriers to entry for new competitors.</p><p>Cloud computing</p><p>This is a prerequisite for the storage and processing of vast amounts of information to improve capacity for innovative products. Cloud computing provides the power needed to commoditize unstructured data, allows banks the flexibility to scale their IT infrastructure up or down, and reinforces the resilience of cybersecurity because of simpler update solutions.</p><p>Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, automation, and robotics</p><p>Thanks to their information-rich client data, banks, with the help of AI and related technology, will be better able to offer tailored services. S&amp;P believe this technology will allow banks to expand revenues by better understanding client behaviour and preferences. At the same time, AI-based solutions will enable banks to establish state-of-the-art \"know-your-client\" processes and compliance systems to better prevent reputation and financial risks stemming from criminal activity.</p><p>Distributed ledger technologies and blockchain</p><p>S&amp;P expects this technology to allow banks to transact business more efficiently and securely. Although S&amp;P still believes current use cases to be marginal, blockchain application might result in a leaner way to execute structured transactions. Banking regulation will also need to adapt, and the digital literacy of potential product users must improve for banks to fully leverage blockchain solutions. \u2013 TradeArabia News Service</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/4/6/52/155790362192.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/4/6/52/155790362192.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TRARAB-144466709</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TRARAB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W41-8C51-JDJN-64FH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">335146</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"950\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TradeArabia - Hilal Publishing and Marketing Group.

Open Now[1]  The microprocessor industry's unfolding saga got a big plot twist a couple of weeks ago when Nvidia paid $40 billion to buy Arm[2], the world's leading processor architecture. That deal turned some heads, as it meant a proprietary parent company was taking over a business that openly licensed its architecture to all comers. Nvidia and Arm promised the ARM architecture would continue to be available for licensing, but you could see other players looking for a backup plan. </p><p>One of the alternatives isRISC-V[3], a rival architecture that is royalty-free and open. Though the architecture was created a decade ago by university professors, RISC-V has been building its ecosystem for years and has started to hit its stride with big licensees like Western Digital, SiFive, and even Nvidia itself. Now the question is whether RISC-V will gain even more momentum, whether from China or from big tech platform owners like Intel or Qualcomm, who are both investors in SiFive. I talked with RISC-V[4] International CEO Calista Redmond, who has over 20 years of management experience and is a veteran of open systems, about the company's outlook. Here's an edited transcript of our interview. Above: Calista Redmond, CEO of the RISC-V International. Image Credit: RISC-V FoundationVentureBeat: Did you have a rush of people come to you and start conversations after the deal? Or was that already happening? Calista Redmond: I haven't noticed a specific new interest in RISC-V in the last week. But it's been a very steady stream. We've had a lot of visibility over the last few years, especially coming through our global forum that we had on September 3. On the heels of that, it's difficult to discern exactly where the interest is coming from. But we are noticing a deepening of our current members in their interest, including Nvidia. They've spoken publicly about their ongoing commitment to RISC-V. It's not surprising, honestly. They've been great, open collaboration partners as long as I've worked with them, which dates back to OpenPOWER as well. They're continuing that. VentureBeat: I thought it was funny that they're still supporting it. Redmond: If you look at the models of many large organizations, it follows a very clear pattern. The large multinationals have entrenched or existing investments in the programs and products and things that they're already doing. Sometimes it's through relationships. Sometimes it's through their own IP. Western Digital, Nvidia, Google, and others have leveraged RISC-V as part of their portfolio. Having that diversity has been something that's grown over the last 10 years or so. We've seen that. It's not just as a lever to weigh against other alternatives. It's a genuine interest, whether it's coming in at a microcontroller level or looking at RISC-V for their new workloads, where they don't have existing investments already. VentureBeat: Arm talks a lot about its ecosystem. I'm curious about whether you see the RISC-V as ready in the same way or whether it's making a certain amount of progress to show that whatever you're able to do on ARM, you're able to do with RISC-V. Redmond: It hasn't always necessarily been an apples-to-apples comparison. ARM is very proficient in many workloads, but not across the full spectrum. Intel has had a relative share on parts of the ecosystem that have been entrenched for years, investing there. When we look at operating systems and some of those common areas, we're continuing to see growth and investment in that. We haven't seen any of that drop off. Our growth from our membership continues at a very significant clip. We've increased by more than 50% this year from where we landed at the end of 2019. That ecosystem continues to be spread across many areas, including software, chip design, tools, foundries, and others that are all around the table. It's not just the hyperscalers or the OEMs or any of those that are taking up a share of these things. It's all stakeholders. We see a continued interest from universities and other types of organizations that are levering. Today we have about 15 relationships that we've grown over the last year with other organizations. If you look at security, we have a great relationship with Global Platform in setting security standards. These are industrywide types of things. We also have relationships with others that are involved in the software space, the tools space, different geographic locations. There are lots of alliances that are working on some of the local agendas in various geographies as well. We've also seen institutes start popping up that are dedicated to RISC-V. Overall, the trajectory of ecosystems is going well. I don't think it's at hyperspeed, because there's real work that needs to get done. But there's been a lot of learning across multiple architectures so far that's accelerating the ecosystem growth for RISC-V. Luckily for us, RISC architecture is not something new. Above: RISC-V Foundation CEO Calista Redmond. Image Credit: Dean TakahashiVentureBeat: Do you think that there will be any change in the perspective of companies here because the headquarters of Arm is going to change to the U.S.? Redmond: From what I've read, the headquarters is anticipated to stay in the U.K., but the parent company is of course in the U.S. How the geopolitical winds blow, I think it's a little early to tell. There are a lot of regulatory hurdles to overcome for that transaction. My understanding is it could be 12 to 18 months. I think folks are not rushing to any conclusions on that yet. Whether the home base changes from one country to another, it doesn't matter to RISC-V. RISC-V doesn't have a geography or entity with a hold on it. As an open source organization, that's how the licenses work. That's something that's been understood in the export control world for a long time. It's also something that many regions or nations look at as an investment that won't have a barrier thrown up later. If you look at the European Union, the EPI initiative has designated RISC-V as a key piece of technology for acceleration in AI, simply because that allows them to build on top of that for regional independence, some of that sovereignty that's sought when it comes to technology. If your base building blocks, you can be assured, are free and open, then you can locally develop whatever you like, whatever works for your implementation, the boundaries you're working in. It's our belief that no single entity, whether it's a country or a company, should control the technology. VentureBeat: I know Nvidia was very excited about taking Arm into the datacenter and into AI, more on the high end. Do you also have a lot of projects that are on that high end? Redmond: RISC-V started off with a lot of embedded applications. We saw a lot of growth coming out of that new frontier, whether it's IoT or embedded or industrial. Some of the new applications, where new investment was welcome, or new ways of thinking, new architectures \u2014 as the collective experience of the industry has grown, we see this moving very quickly into scale-up. You look at Alibaba Cloud, which is leveraging and has road maps around RISC-V. You look at the European Processor Initiative. That's all about scale-up, and HPC. You look at some of the other announcements that members have made around the PC, like SiFive. You see members growing in onboard across mobile. We've just grown our board of directors from seven to 16. We have a great diversity of interest there, both geographically as well as industry, other stakeholders. VentureBeat: I noticed that Nvidia didn't buy the internet of things part of Arm. I don't know if that seems significant to you at all as far as competition goes. Redmond: I haven't dug as deeply into the pieces and parts, looking at that. I spent a long time doing acquisition and divestitures, and I know that it's important to look at your portfolio as you embark on any type of acquisition or partnership or divestiture and understand the implications there. As they looked at their portfolio and the Arm portfolio \u2014 I certainly would not be in a place to speak for them about what fit or didn't fit. But every company is looking at the strategic outcomes they're going for, and not a near-term quick flip. If one plus one doesn't equal more than three, there's probably no point in going through the acquisition. Above: RISC-V board members, (left to right): Krste Asanovic, Zvonimir Bandic, Ted Speers, Calista Redmond, Frans Sijstermans, and Rob Oshana. Image Credit: Dean TakahashiVentureBeat: Do you also get any specific feedback on RISC-V companies in China and what they're thinking? Redmond: The sentiment I've gathered so far continues to be very positive for RISC-V. We continue to see companies and organizations investing. We have a great collaboration set up there between Berkeley and Tsinghua University. There are some other institutes that have started to come to fruition around RISC-V. We continue to see a lot of great interest there. The sentiment I've heard specific to any proposed acquisition \u2014 it is a proposed acquisition at this point. It's not a done deal. But it's been more of a wait-and-see. There's a lot of noise in the system right now, but I don't think anyone is making a quick move if they have a strong investment already in place. VentureBeat: What about on the MIPS side? Has anything there caught your attention? I know they're in their own strange transactions right now. Redmond: They are going through some things, and it's very similar to the Arm story. Many of our members have investments in multiple places. Looking for synergy across architectures is where our interest lies. We understand and appreciate that there are a lot of great minds working on each of these. When it comes to how transactions are going to play out, we haven't seen a need to take any specific actions on any of it. VentureBeat: I saw that Intel and Qualcomm were investors in SiFive. Some of that seems clear, what their motives might be. Do you also see any of that happening on a larger level? Redmond: There's a growing understanding that having multiple architectures is a smart investment. You don't want to have all the eggs in one basket. It depends on what you're doing. If you want to go into a particular space, you have some assets that can help take you there, and you need to fill in the blanks with something from a different architecture, that's a smart move. I don't have information specific to the Intel/SiFive relationship or the Qualcomm relationship there. I know that Qualcomm has been a great investor in RISC-V, holds a seat on the board and everything. We continue to see a lot of activity from our partners there, as well as from SiFive, and we continue to see that spilling into additional areas for growth. Above: The crowd at the second RISC-V Summit in 2019. Image Credit: Dean TakahashiVentureBeat: Has RISC-V dealt pretty well with anybody forking or trying to fork the architecture? Redmond: Not at the ISA level. There's a temptation to go build something if you don't already have it readily available. It may be a short-term solution for experimentation. But we haven't seen that at a production level. We do engage quite a few folks to work with those base building blocks, to make sure we're on the same path and stay there together. We have 43 different workgroups right now, working on all kinds of extensions to the base ISA. But we've had no signs of a fork of the ISA itself. VentureBeat: Anything else on your mind that's timely today? Redmond: I anticipate that between now and the end of the year, we're going to have more insight into how the landscape is going to come together. We're excited about our early December summit. We're going to have a lot more news to share there about the progress of not only RISC-V International, but also to help amplify the progress our members are making. Right now we're nearly complete on some of our compliance tests. We're moving ahead in fast-forward on many of these other workgroups. We see a lot going on there.

Nigeria and Australia are among the countries that have sought to introduce or revitalise the ways in which they protect open markets.</p><p>The &amp; techlash&amp; against Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and other technology giants is playing out in Washington DC, an increasing number of US states and the EU.</p><p>This pushback against big tech's power is playing out in one prominent front: the antitrust or competition policy arena. The tech giants are accused of anticompetitive behaviour, with heavy penalties emerging out of the EU Competition Commission. There are concerns over network effects that raise barriers to entry. Within the US, where the charge has so far been less aggressive, antitrust activism is on the rise, with proposed legislation to curb the market power of the main technology platforms. According to The Economist, &amp; M&amp; for monopolist is this era's scarlet letter.</p><p>Not long ago, arguments based on a linear view of economic history would have declared &amp; the end of antitrust history&amp; in the US.</p><p>As a bemused American colleague remarked when I left a &amp; big four&amp; consultancy to join the world of competition regulation in 2010, policing market power was no longer an issue in the US. That country had long broken up the likes of Standard Oil and Bell Telecommunications and had a mature, if somewhat hands-off, competition regime.</p><p>At the time SA was dealing with garden-variety cartels and the behaviour of dominant firms in industries such as steel, chemicals and telecommunications. Some of the main transgressions of the construction cartel had just come to pass. In the US, the fear of market power was dead and buried, while SA was only getting to grips with it.</p><p>But in 2018 concerns over big, anticompetitive, addictive and destructive tech companies have revived antitrust fervour in the US.</p><p>In our phase of development, a tougher competition policy regime might be one of the most significant manifestations of &amp; radical economic transformation&amp; In 2018 amendments to the main competition statute, the Competition Act, will be passed.</p><p>Though competition regulation proceeds from the desire to protect the unfettered operation of capitalist markets, it can be couched as a radical attack against &amp; monopoly capital&amp; The amendments are still up for public debate, but the direction of SA's competition policy is clear.</p><p>A new competition doctrine is likely to develop based on these amendments, which places a premium on economic participation. This will be achieved by focusing the analysis of the competition authorities on how market conduct and structure affect participation in the economy, especially by small and black-owned businesses.</p><p>The new doctrine also elevates public interest considerations in assessing competition matters, a move its advocates see as bringing competition policy in line with national economic imperatives.</p><p>Business can play a constructive role in this discussion. Some of SA's most significant businesses were founded in the past 40 years, which is to say they were entrants not so long ago.</p><p>Though their commercial interests now lie in defending their turf and their founders may suffer from the selective memory that comes with success, they are not ignorant of the challenges presented by a concentrated economy with high barriers to entry.</p><p>It is also in the interests of business in SA to operate within a growing and meritocratic pie, rather than sucking the diminishing returns of incumbency.</p><p>Makhaya is CEO of Makhaya Advisory.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TMLBD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TMLBD2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RJ0-VHD1-JCB2-W2Y0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163765</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"604\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 BDFM Publishers PTY Ltd.

Top execs from Facebook and Twitter were there ready to testify, but Google took a pass on sending someone senior \u2014 much to the annoyance of the committee. \u201cIt\u2019s just like, who do they think they are?</p><p>\u201d Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) told Axios. \u201cI don\u2019t get it, but if Google thinks we\u2019re going away they\u2019re making a big error in judgment.\u201d It\u2019s highly unlikely that this is what Google or any large American technology company thinks. There\u2019s a reason the sector\u2019s five biggest companies \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft \u2014 spent nearly $50 million lobbying the federal government in 2017, with even more dough likely headed to Washington this year. They know the days are long past when politicians would only cite Silicon Valley as a shining example of America\u2019s technological superiority and fundamental economic strength. These days, the titans of tech are being politically pressured from the left and the right, with both sides continually upping the ante. Warner, for one, has circulated a serious, thoughtful white paper outlining 20 different approaches Congress could take for regulating the tech platforms on issues such as competition, data privacy, and disinformation. Republican ideas aren\u2019t yet as sophisticated or developed. When President Trump recently claimed Google was rigging its search results against him and his supporters, he gave no clue as to what the policy response should be, only that there would be one. But that was before Fox News weighed in. Given the importance of the pro-Trump network in molding the president\u2019s thinking, perhaps the White House is now investigating the musings of host Laura Ingraham, who last week raised the idea of semi-nationalizing Facebook and Twitter by turning them into government-regulated utilities. That\u2019s right. The folks that supposedly value the wonder-working power of markets to create prosperity now seemingly want Big Government to regulate and run Big Tech. Not that there has been any serious thinking on the right about how to execute a massive new regulatory scheme or what unintended consequences might arise from doing so. Have they thought about the possibility that, say, President Elizabeth Warren might latch onto the latest Trumpopulist thinking to create a Federal Internet Platform Commission to regulate the sector? What if Bernie Sanders were the tech regulator in chief? And haven\u2019t Republicans attacked net neutrality rules as a government takeover of the internet? </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PROFFN-RLPMN804347820180907</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PROFFN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T6P-HC31-DXCW-D33Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400349</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"458\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Premium Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"511\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 7, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RFI</classCode><className>AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Yet even if the IPO pipeline starts flowing again, this year will likely disappoint investors who are yearning to take positions in the next big tech stocks. San Jose-based unicorn Nutanix, for example, recently said it would acquire two startups, setting off rumors that the company is planning to go public soon. </p><p>But unicorns have challenged the very notion of going public in recent years, because they are quite capable of fueling rapid growth through private investments, without tapping the public markets. To date, Nutanix has raised some mega-VC investments - more than $300 million over five funding rounds (including participation by InstantScale Ventures, the venture capital firm that I cofounded). The hottest unicorns such as Uber, Snapchat, and Airbnb have not been eager to jump through the SEC's regulatory hoops or face the scrutiny of hitting quarterly earnings targets for Wall Street analysts. They have wisely chosen to continue innovating without facing such compliance hurdles and market distractions. New funding options are also changing the IPO landscape. Some startups are launching private stock offerings without a need to issue public shares. New online companies such as SharesPost[1] and Digital Offering[2] provide online platforms for individuals and small investor groups to take an equity stake. From my perspective as a venture capitalist, I see many young companies that are pioneering game-changing technologies with seemingly limitless market potential. However, many of them lose their luster after going public and being subjected to the bottom-line scrutiny of the public markets. As evidence of this shifting IPO climate, the total number of new stock debuts this year remains the lowest since 2009, according to data from the Wall Street Journal[3] and Dealogic[4]. Just 63 companies had gone public as of late August, raising a cumulative $12.9 billion. That's a 50% drop from the year-to-date volume in 2015 and a 73% drop over the first eight months of 2014. In fact, there have only been two slower years for IPOs since 1995 - in 2003 following the dot-com crash, and in 2009 right after the Great Recession. On the positive side, most stocks that have gone public this year have posted big gains in their share prices, well above the average returns for the Dow Jones Industrial, Nasdaq Composite, and S...00 stock indices. Acacia Communications, this year's top IPO, is trading 382% above its IPO price. Twilio, the first IPO of 2016 backed by venture capital, is trading 247% above its debut. Overall, however, the trickle of new tech stock issues has been particularly discouraging. Tech stocks have made up just 19% of all IPOs in 2016, compared to 32% in an average year. Deal flow in the technology sector declined by almost half last year, from 69 IPOs in 2014 to 35 IPOs in 2015. That marks the lowest annual number since 2009, according to the 2016 IPO Report[5] by WilmerHale. The tech sector's share of the U.S. IPO market has fallen every year for the past five years, from 46% in 2011 to 23% in 2015. The vast majority of those listings were lost off of the NASDAQ, the tech heavy exchange that is home to more than 90% of technology listings. Investment bankers say some smaller firms are preparing to price their stocks to raise critical funding for growth if the IPO window opens after Labor Day. There's even a fairly good chance that some tech unicorns such as Nutanix and/or AppDynamics may go IPO this year. But overall, it's likely that the IPO spigot won't completely open again until 2017.

What has been called the \"4th Industrial Revolution\" is the digital convergence of AI/Big Data/Robotics, 3D printing, biotech, and new materials and it will drive economic growth in the next decade and beyond. It will change the very nature of work, how we fight wars, live, and interact.</p><p>We are entering a world of self-driving electric vehicles, of billions of connected sensors and devices in an Internet of Things, of autonomous weapons, digitized trade, medical labs on chips, 3D printed houses, and precision agriculture, to name a few.</p><p>But the danger is accentuating. This technological transformation is unfolding at a time when the entire international economic and political system that has underpinned global trade, finance and political stability is eroding.</p><p>For starters, the future of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and its crown jewel, the dispute settlement mechanism, is in doubt. The consensus is that the WTO must be reformed, globally, as protectionism is on the rise. Initial talks have raised fears over its future while comprehensive rules for fast-growing digital commerce remain elusive. How will the world adopt standards and ethical norms for AI and robotics, autonomous vehicles, and other emerging technologies?</p><p>Similarly, how to decide on ethical questions raised by the breakthroughs in biosciences, synthetic biology, and bio-engineered things? To be effective, a consensus must be global. Do we know how removing one gene changes interaction among others? Larger still are issues on the new raw material of the 21st-century economy - Data. Who owns data? What are rights of privacy? A handful of mostly US and Chinese Big Tech firms dominate the world. Should Big Tech be broken up or regulated, as the EU has sought to do?</p><p>Some fear self-replicating AI robots will come to dominate or replace human beings. These fears are probably misguided. Machine intelligence \"deep learning\" is based on neural networks, simulating the brain. We still don't exactly know how the brain's billion-plus neurons actually work. So it is likely to be many decades before machine intelligence with anything like all the dimensions of human intelligence occurs- if at all.</p><p>Nonetheless, AI/robotics is beginning to impact the future of work. What happens to taxi drivers, truck and bus drivers as autonomous vehicles become more widespread? There is a debate on the degree to which robots will displace workers, and how they will create new jobs, with workers operating alongside robots, what some are calling a 'hybrid future.\" But such technological change requires all nations to rethink education, training, their social safety net, and even the social contract.</p><p>Then there is the question of how emerging technologies impact national security and even the nature of future wars.</p><p>At a time of renewed geopolitical competition, the arms control framework is already beginning to unravel. US threats to withdraw from yet another agreement - the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) between the US and Russia - may lead to a new arms race. The INF eliminated whole categories of missiles. If it unravels, all sides may pursue medium-range missiles and low-yield nuclear weapons. Terminating the INF may lead to the New Start Agreement, which expires in 2021, not being renewed or extended by the Trump administration not partial to arms control. That treaty limits the number of US and Russian nuclear weapons.</p><p>This, in turn, could spark a new nuclear arms race among the US, Russia, China and India. All four are also developing hypersonic missiles which travel five times the speed of sound and could undermine second strike capabilities on which nuclear deterrence is based. Should such weapons be banned?</p><p>Similarly, a UN expert group in Geneva has been examining the question of autonomous weapons - air, sea, and land. How do we control them? Should they be banned?</p><p>Even in the best of times, this would be a daunting set of challenges. You may not be interested in the future, but the future is interested in you. There are many challenges ahead for the human race, not least among them, climate change. But how we navigate the technological revolution will be a significant factor determining whether the future is prosperous and peaceful or a world of chaos and conflict.</p><p>The author is a senior fellow at the Brent Scowcroft Center for International Security at the Atlantic Council and its Foresight, Strategy and Risks Initiative. <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:opinion@globaltimes.com.cn\">opinion@globaltimes.com.cn</email>  Follow him on Twitter @Rmanning4 </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/478/1448/77/154586956346.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/478/1448/77/154586956346.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GTMCHI-133905732</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GTMCHI2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V2B-66T1-JDJN-61HM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411389</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"901\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Global Times.

Every time they clicked on a link that they thought was mine, it would transfer them to a competitor website,\" she told the ACCC.</p><p>Ultimately, too, customers ended up with fewer choices, not more. Unable to compete even to buy ads under her own business name, Katsanis says she shuttered the business last year and moved onto a new career.</p><p>Though the ACCC inquiry has come too late to save Flowers By Fruit, she's hoping that the inquiry will lead to regulations that when a Google user searches for a specific business, Google will have to show results for that business \"first and foremost\", and not bury that result under paid ads from competitors that \"appear organic\".</p><p>In December 2017, when the ACCC commenced its investigation into the effect that digital platforms are having on competition in media and advertising, it was at the leading edge of regulation: the eyes of regulators from all over the world were said to be on the inquiry.</p><p>But since then, regulators around the world have commenced their own investigations into the business practices of \"Big Tech\" (as Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and others have come to be known, echoing \"Big Oil\" and \"Big Tobacco\"), looking to see whether those practices are doing more harm than good.</p><p>In the USA, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the government's House Judiciary subcommittee on antitrust have all commenced investigations into Big Tech.</p><p>So monumental is the task of reining in the tech sector, the DOJ and the FTC have split the job between them, with the DOJ investigating Apple and Google and the FTC taking on Facebook and Amazon.</p><p>Meanwhile, the American tech companies are under antitrust pressure in Europe, too. The European Commission opened an investigation into what Amazon does with information it gleans from sales on the Amazon Marketplace.</p><p>When the ACCC hands the results of its inquiry to Parliament at the end of June, it may be the first regulator to report back on what needs to be done, if anything, to protect businesses big and small from unfair competition from Big Tech.</p><p>But it won't be the last.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc75tvziwsuh5ynw3fmm2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WC3-6X21-F0J6-J08V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"682\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Kamala Harris feels that 'we have to seriously take a look' at dismantling the monopolies of the likes of FacebookFB[1]. Joe Biden pitched in that such a move is 'something we should take a really hard look at.'Even staunch Republicans like Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley are making similar noises about the subject. But leading the pack is Elizabeth Warren, who has promised to oversee a breakup of Big Tech if she wins the presidency. Warren's proposals transcend contemporary antitrust law's focus on pricing.Instead, she argues that breaking up such tech majors would encourage innovation and promote competition by allowing startups to flourish. </p><p>This goes a step beyond earlier proposals which call for greater scrutiny of mergers in the tech arena. However, it is to be seen whether such a proposal is politically feasible for a likely Democrat successor to President Trump.Greater Scrutiny on the Big FiveThe top five U.S. tech majors are also the five most valuable companies in America. And over the years, the level of antitrust scrutiny has only increased for them. In the late 1990s, MicrosoftMSFT[2] was scrutinized for the same. More recently, huge fines were slapped on AlphabetGOOGL[3] by European antitrust regulators.In contrast, U.S. regulators have taken a favorable view of the incredible growth of Big Tech. Better smart phones, free online services and cheap e-commerce are believed to be the favorable outcomes of their growing power and influence. This has led U.S. regulators to believe that the success of tech majors has had a positive effect on competitive markets.However, it is equally true that tech majors have been crushing suppliers as well as nascent competition. In the process, they have employed a range of questionable tactics, as was witnessed during Amazon's AMZN[4] ruthless price wars against its competitors.The situation has been quite similar when it comes to Apple's AAPL[5] authoritative management of its app stores and Facebook's questionable data security practices, which resulted in numerous public scandals. Of the big five, Microsoft and Facebook carry a Zack Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[6].Is Warren's Proposal Mostly Symbolic?In March, Warren proposed that Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet should be broken up. Meanwhile, major restrictions should be imposed on how Apple and Microsoft go about doing business.According to her plan, a company with annual global revenues in excess of $25 billion which 'offers to the public an online marketplace, an exchange, or a platform for connecting third parties' should be designated as 'platform utility.' This entity would be prevented from owning any participants on such a platform.The core business models of Apple and Microsoft would remain largely unaffected by such regulations. But it would have severe major implications for the three other members of this elite group. At the same time, the present day structure of Microsoft's Xbox Store and Apple's iOS App Store would be rendered invalid.But Warren has cautiously omitted all references to the kind of impact these new regulations would have on Big Tech. This is believed to be proof of the fact that her proposal is mostly symbolic rather than practical.ConclusionWarren's proposal to regulate Big Tech has found favor among other Democratic contenders. However, the strong link between leading Democrats and Silicon Valley giants make such regulations unviable in the real world. Further, her proposals run counter to conventional antitrust laws which focus on pricing and consumer interest.This is why it is unreasonable to expect a future White House to go so far as to attempt to break up big tech. However, a successful Democratic bid for the presidency would bring such companies under considerable regulatory scrutiny. This would have major implications for users, suppliers and competitors.More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

Blackstone's Byron Wien\u00a0said it could be a possibility. </p><p>Wien releases\u00a0his 'Ten Surprises' every year. This year, the 33rd year of surprises, he has 16 predictions[1] about economic, financial market and political surprises to come. One of Wien's yearly\u00a0predictions, the one most interesting for Europeans, is number 15 which says that:'The regulatory authorities in Europe and the United States finally get concerned about the creative destruction of Internet-related businesses. As a result of pressure from retailers and traditional media companies, they begin an investigation of anti-competitive practices at Amazon, Facebook and Google. The public begins to think these companies have too much power.'In short, Wien says the EU will get fed up with big tech companies and try to regulate them. He thinks, in 2018, the power of these companies will be too wide-spread and something will need to be done to rope them back in. Other interesting predictions include China cutting off all food and fuel shipments to North Korea in the hopes of suspending the country's nuclear development program, both NAFTA and the Iran Agreement enduring despite the fact that Trump has 'railed against them' and the US Republicans losing control of both the House and the Senate in the November election.

This came as telecommunications giant Verizon (US:VZ) and consumer goods group Unilever (ULVR) joined a growing list of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.stophateforprofit.org/participating-businesses\">more than 90</url> companies that have already, or plan to, temporarily stop advertising on the social network.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The exodus is being driven by the 'Stop Hate For Profit' campaign, organised by US civil rights groups including the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP). Insisting there is \"hate and misinformation across Facebook's products, which are supported by paid advertisements\", it is urging corporations to pause ad spending on the platform in July to push Facebook to improve its policing of racist, hateful and violent material.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Verizon's move is not directly linked to the campaign. But after one of the organisers, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), uncovered a Verizon advert next to a video from conspiracy group QAnon, it is halting spending \"until Facebook can create an acceptable solution\". According to data analytics provider Pathmatics, Verizon had splurged $850,000 (\u00a3689,000) on Facebook ads in June up to this point. </p><p>Unilever's boycott is also separate and goes further, shifting ad spending for its brands in the US from Facebook, Instagram and Twitter (US:TWTR) to other media until at least the end of this year. With the contagion spreading, Twitter's shares ended Friday more than 7 per cent lower.</p><p>                     Some of the other companies pausing ad spending on Facebook:                   </p><p>Beverage giant Coca-Cola (US:KO)</p><p>Spirits maker Diageo (DGE)</p><p>Outdoor retailers Patagonia and The North Face</p><p>Athletic apparel company Lululemon (US:LULU)</p><p>Peer-to-peer lender LendingClub (US:LC)</p><p>Automaker Honda's (JP:7276) US business</p><p>Chocolate manufacturer Hershey's (US:HSY)</p><p>Coffee shop chain Starbucks (US:SBUX) </p><p>                     Mounting pressure                   </p><p>Facebook hasn't been completely inactive with regards to content moderation - an annual exercise conducted by the European Commission found it removed more hateful content than YouTube and Twitter and did so in a more timely fashion. The group also established an independent 'oversight board' in May to arbitrate decisions over controversial content, although it will not be operational until later this year. </p><p>But chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is resistant to change. For him, it is a matter of principle - he believes his platform shouldn't be the arbiter of truth, telling Fox News that Facebook's policies distinguish it from other technology companies \"in terms of being stronger on free expression and giving people a voice.\"</p><p>At the root of the issue is whether 'Big Tech' should have any responsibility - moral or legal - for the content published on its platforms. From an ethical standpoint, a rift has emerged in Silicon Valley. Take US president Donald Trump - last month Twitter started placing warnings in front of and fact check labels alongside certain tweets, whereas Facebook left identical posts untouched. Meanwhile, Snapchat (US:SNAP) has stopped promoting the president's account in its 'Discover' section which presents tailored content to users.</p><p>Mr Trump has not taken kindly to moderation of his content. Following his executive order in May, the US Department of Justice has proposed new legislation targeting Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act - this currently spares online platforms from being held liable for third-party content and allows them to moderate it in \"good faith\". The reforms would force companies such as Facebook to justify decisions to delete user content to the government to keep their immunity. </p><p>Alongside other social media giants, Facebook is caught between America's two political factions - the left accuses it of inaction to counter hate speech and any move to moderate content is condemned by US conservatives as an attack on free expression or political bias. New legislation would have to be approved by a currently divided Congress, but it adds to a growing storm of international regulatory pressure. Facebook faces antitrust investigations on both sides of the Atlantic, and the European Union is drawing up plans for a digital tax despite US objections.</p><p>                     An empty gesture?                   </p><p>While regulatory threats are serious, governments are slow-moving beasts. This commercial manoeuvring could have a more immediate impact.</p><p>Facebook generated $69.7bn of revenue from advertising in 2019, which accounted for 99 per cent of total sales. A boycott could inflict pain in a year that will already see momentum slow thanks to Covid-19, although the magnitude won't really be clear until third quarter results in October - current analyst consensus places ad revenue at $18.5bn for the three months to 30 September. </p><p>The potential ramifications shouldn't be overstated. Facebook doesn't typically break down the source of its ad revenues, but in the first quarter of 2019, its top 100 advertisers represented less than a fifth of the total. That means the damage from big brand boycotts could be limited. Bear in mind that 'Stop Hate For Profit' is only for one month and lower risk at this time of year - the fourth quarter sees highest ad spending with Black Friday and Christmas. Meanwhile, small- and medium-sized enterprises might be less inclined to shun Facebook as they look to recover from pandemic lockdowns.</p><p>Ultimately, Facebook offers corporations access to 2.6bn monthly active users. Roger McNamee, managing director of private equity fund Elevation Partners and an early Facebook investor, explained to CNBC: \"For 15 years their strategy has been the same: apologise, promise to do better, go back to business as usual\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6Until that stops working, there's no reason for them to change\".</p><p>Attempting to stem the tide on Friday, Mr Zuckerberg announced <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.stophateforprofit.org/participating-businesses\">new content moderation measures</url>, including labelling potentially harmful posts. While activists are unimpressed, this might give companies cover to eventually back down. That being said, following Mr Zuckerberg's declaration and market close, Coca-Cola (US:KO) revealed it is pausing ad spending across all social media for at least 30 days, while Levi Strauss (US:LEVI) joined Stop Hate For Profit and called Facebook's new actions \"simply not enough\". The momentum continued over the weekend - Diageo (DGE) says it will suspend paid marketing across major social media platforms from 1 July while Starbucks (US:SBUX) has also hit pause.</p><p>This episode is damaging to Facebook's reputation, although it is not unaccustomed to scandal. From a cynical perspective, controversy and polarisation are good for business, driving user engagement. But Facebook and Mr Zuckerberg aren't invincible and given the current context, they may be misjudging the depth of feeling over this issue. The uncertainty and potential for further backlash shouldn't be ignored.

The biggest drop came on Friday 26 June - the shares tumbled by more than 8 per cent after telecommunications giant Verizon (US:VZ) and consumer goods group Unilever (ULVR) announced that they would also be halting their ad spending on the platform.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The exodus is being driven by the 'Stop Hate For Profit' campaign, organised by US civil rights groups including the National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People (NAACP). Insisting there is \"hate and misinformation across Facebook's products, which are supported by paid advertisements\", it is urging corporations to pause ad spending on the platform in July to push Facebook to improve its policing of racist, hateful and violent material.</p><p>Verizon's move is not directly linked to the campaign. But after one of the organisers, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), uncovered a Verizon advert next to a video from conspiracy group QAnon, it decided to halt spending \"until Facebook can create an acceptable solution\". According to data analytics provider Pathmatics, Verizon had splurged $850,000 (\u00a3689,000) on Facebook ads in June up to this point.</p><p>Unilever's boycott is also separate and goes further, shifting ad spending for its brands in the US from Facebook, Instagram and Twitter (US:TWTR) to other media until at least the end of this year. With the contagion spreading, Twitter's shares have also been weighed down.</p><p>Mounting pressure Facebook hasn't been completely inactive with regards to content moderation - an annual exercise conducted by the European Commission found it removed more hateful content than YouTube and Twitter and did so in a more timely fashion. The group also established an independent 'oversight board' in May to arbitrate decisions over controversial content, although it will not be operational until later this year.</p><p>But chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is resistant to change. For him, it is a matter of principle - he believes his platform shouldn't be the arbiter of truth, telling Fox News that Facebook's policies distinguish it from other technology companies \"in terms of being stronger on free expression and giving people a voice\".</p><p>At the root of the issue is whether 'Big Tech' should have any responsibility - moral or legal - for the content published on its platforms. From an ethical standpoint, a rift has emerged in Silicon Valley. Take US President Donald Trump. Last month Twitter started placing warnings in front of, and fact-check labels alongside, certain tweets, whereas Facebook left identical posts untouched. Meanwhile, Snapchat (US:SNAP) has stopped promoting the president's account in its 'Discover' section, which presents tailored content to users.</p><p>Mr Trump has not taken kindly to moderation of his content. Following his executive order in May, the US Department of Justice has proposed new legislation targeting Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act - this currently spares online platforms from being held liable for third-party content and allows them to moderate it in \"good faith\". The reforms would force companies such as Facebook to justify decisions to delete user content to the government to keep their immunity.</p><p>Alongside other social media giants, Facebook is caught between America's two political factions - the left accuses it of inaction in countering hate speech while any move to moderate content is condemned by US conservatives as political bias or an attack on free expression. New legislation would have to be approved by a currently divided Congress, but it adds to a growing storm of international regulatory pressure. Facebook faces antitrust investigations on both sides of the Atlantic, and the EU is drawing up plans for a digital tax despite US objections.</p><p>An empty gesture? While regulatory threats are serious, governments are slow-moving beasts. This commercial manoeuvring could have a more immediate impact.</p><p>Facebook generated $69.7bn of revenue from advertising in 2019, which accounted for 99 per cent of total sales. A boycott could inflict pain in a year that will already see momentum slow due to Covid-19, although the magnitude won't really be clear until thirdquarter results in October - current analyst consensus places ad revenue at $18.5bn for the three months to 30 September.</p><p>The potential ramifications shouldn't be overstated. Facebook doesn't typically break down the source of its ad revenues, but in the first quarter of 2019 its top 100 advertisers represented less than a fifth of the total. That means the damage from big brand boycotts could be limited. Bear in mind that 'Stop Hate For Profit' is only for one month and lower risk at this time of year - the fourth quarter sees the highest ad spending, which includes Black Friday and Christmas. Meanwhile, small- and mediumsized enterprises might be less inclined to shun Facebook as they look to recover from pandemic lockdowns.</p><p>'Ultimately, Facebook offers corporations access to 2.6bn monthly active users' 'Ultimately, Facebook offers corporations access to 2.6bn monthly active users'. Roger McNamee, managing director of private equity fund Elevation Partners and an early Facebook investor, explained to CNBC: \"For 15 years their strategy has been the same: apologise, promise to do better, go back to business as usual\u2026 until that stops working, there's no reason for them to change.\"</p><p>Attempting to stem the tide, Mr Zuckerberg announced new content moderation measures on 26 June, including labelling potentially harmful posts. He was likely to be hoping that this would be sufficient for companies to eventually back down after making a stand. But following Mr Zuckerberg's declaration, and market close, Coca-Cola (US:KO) revealed it is pausing ad spending across all social media for at least 30 days, while Levi Strauss (US:LEVI) joined Stop Hate For Profit and called Facebook's new actions \"simply not enough\". The momentum continued over the weekend and into the following week, with more big brand names hitting pause.</p><p>\u2022 This episode is damaging to Facebook's reputation, although it is not unaccustomed to scandal. From a cynical perspective, controversy and polarisation are good for business, driving user engagement. But Facebook and Mr Zuckerberg aren't invincible and, given the current context, they may be misjudging the depth of feeling over this issue. The uncertainty and potential for further backlash shouldn't be ignored. Hold.</p><p/><p>'Ultimately, Facebook offers corporations access to 2.6bn monthly active users'</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVSTR-161234788</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVSTR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:608G-R151-JCBW-N0TX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1114\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investors Chronicle - magazine and web content</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59206\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 3, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

David Cicilline, D-R.I. Cicilline heads the House Judiciary's antitrust subcommittee.\u00a0\"Some need to be broken up. All need to be properly regulated and held accountable.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Their control of the marketplace allows them to do whatever it takes to crush independent business and expand their own power,\" Cicilline said, adding that antitrust laws written a century ago need to be updated. \"This must end.\"</p><p>But can that really happen? To be sure, the investigations and scrutiny of Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Alphabet are coming from all directions. But a breakup of any of the four would no doubt be a gargantuan mission \u2014 perhaps too big, some say.</p><p>\"Ultimately, we think a legislative fix is the only one that creates a potential for limitations on these companies' ability to conduct business, whether that takes the form of higher taxes or new rules regarding market concentration,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to clients. \"Absent a legislative fix, we don't see meaningful change in regulation, although future acquisitions will most certainly be scrutinized and more difficult to close.\"</p><h>Tech Antitrust: $5 Trillion In Collective Value</h><p>The four companies, combined, are worth more than $5 trillion. They employ hundreds of thousands, and can boast billions of customers. Collectively, their products and services touch pretty much every aspect of society and economies.</p><p>And that's what draws interest from regulators.</p><p>Along with the House, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are eyeing tech giants as well. There also are numerous state attorneys general and international regulators looking into the matter.</p><p>Collectively, they want to know how the four tech giants leverage their vast resources. They're checking to see how they accumulate significant market share in multiple industries.</p><p>The FTC, Justice Department and a group of 47 state attorneys general have opened inquiries into Facebook. There, the agencies are looking at antitrust behavior as well as possible privacy law violations. Among other things, the FTC is also reviewing Facebook acquisitions over the past 10 years. This includes whether the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp were anticompetitive.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Justice Department has its cross hairs on Google, in particular. It's looking at whether Google abuses its power in the market for advertising technology and search products.</p><h>European Union On Tech Antitrust</h><p>There's more. In June, the European Union announced a formal antitrust investigation of Apple. It's assessing whether the tech giant's system of distributing apps through its App Store violates competition rules. It's also looking into the method in which Apple collects fees from app developers. Apple is being investigated in the U.S. for the same thing.</p><p>Separately, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal, the European Commission is readying antitrust charges against Amazon. It accuses Amazon of using data from third-party sellers to develop competing products. U.S. lawmakers have been looking into the same matter.</p><p>The probes launched by federal and state authorities are now more than a year old. Actions taken could come in the form of lawsuits, big fines and potentially damning reports.</p><p>\"It's clear the tech antitrust argument centers around each platform as a bottleneck for competition and ultimately cutting off access and opportunity for potential rivals,\" said Wedbush Securities' Ives.</p><h>Losing Public Opinion Battle</h><p>Moreover, a new <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.investors.com/news/technology/ibd-tipp-poll-majority-support-breakup-big-tech-avoid-monopoly/\">IBD/TIPP Poll</url> suggests the big four are losing the battle of public opinion. Consumers worry increasingly that the market strength of these companies may not be such a good thing, according to the poll, a collaboration of Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica.</p><p>A majority said Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google should be prevented from what could be viewed as monopolistic practices. Consequently, 72% of respondents were concerned, by varying degrees, that monopolistic practices would lead to higher prices. That's up from 66% who felt that way a year ago.</p><p>These views align with positions stated by Public Knowledge, a non-profit Washington, D.C.-based public interest research group. It supports antitrust investigations into Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>Public Knowledge says that if things remain as they are with the big tech firms, consumer choice will be limited, as will opportunity for entrepreneurs.</p><p>\"You'll see a lack of innovation and competitors,\" said Alex Petros, a policy counsel at Public Knowledge, where he focuses on digital platform competition issues. \"It will be harder for entrepreneurs to get people to invest in new ideas. That's bad for consumers.\"</p><h>Killing The Golden Geese?</h><p>Of course, opinions vary widely, from consumers to think tanks, over what to do.\u00a0The Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundations, has published a series of articles under the heading \"Monopoly Myths.\"</p><p>The organization is a nonprofit public policy think tank based out of Washington, D.C. Among other things, it focuses on public policies that spur technology innovation.</p><p>It says monopolists traditionally try to boost profits by reducing supply. But that is not the case with Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google, it says. These companies aggressively innovate. In the same vein, they do it to attract and retain users, and provide new and better products and services at low cost.</p><p>\"Far from being lazy monopolists that try to increase profits by artificially reducing supply, online platforms are constantly innovating to attract and retain users,\" wrote Joe Kennedy, a former economist at the Commerce Department and a senior fellow at ITIF.</p><p>\"To do this and create new markets, they invest enormous sums in R&amp;D,\" he wrote. \"To punish these companies for their success would be to risk killing the proverbial geese that lay the U.S. economy's golden eggs. It would only empower China and other foreign competitors while limiting a powerful business model for other industries in the future.\"</p><h>Tech Giants Defend Themselves</h><p>Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google declined to comment for this article. But at the House hearing this past week, as expected, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google vigorously defended their business practices.</p><p>Google said its tools made it possible for people to find information and businesses to grow.

traditional industries and the issues this is raising.</p><p>                     Contract of employment                   </p><p>Mr Crouch delves into history to explain that in the UK employment was based on the societal set up of a master and servant, but over time legislation has been brought in to regulate employment and many rights have been enshrined in law. </p><p>The gig economy has driven cart and horse through employment legislation - the tech companies such as Uber and Deliveroo argue that they are simply a technology platform linking self-employed drivers to their potential customers.</p><p>                     Precarious workers                   </p><p>The gig economy accounts for 20-30 per cent of the total workforce in Europe and US, but just 3 per cent of the business revenue. </p><p>It has also led to the rise of the precarious workers - these are people working in the gig economy but who do not have the security of the traditional employment contract and whose lives are becoming increasingly precarious. </p><p>Mr Crouch argues that the gig economy is underpinned by workers whose economic situation allows for no choice and that only if people have a base of security can they be expected to welcome and collaborate in tech revolution.</p><p>                     The future                    </p><p>So given the precariousness of the gig economy, can it actually prevail?</p><p>Mr Crouch argues that it can, but that we need a complete rethink about recognising the value of non-market activities.</p><p>One solution suggested would be to pay everyone a citizen's income funded through social insurance on \"users of labour\" as opposed to employers. </p><p>Social insurance on \"users of labour\" plus the safety net of a citizen's income providing a good, but basic, standard of living would enable people to embark on a lifelong learning mindset, which would ultimately benefit society.</p><p>In the increasingly polarised world of Brexit and Trump populism, a right to a citizen's income could provide a solution for the social cohesiveness we are all craving right now. </p><p>So, while the book may not be a riveting read, the facts and history bring context and the concept of a citizen's income a possible solution to problems of the gig economy. </p><p>                     Anna Sofat is founder of Addidi                   </p><p>

On July 29, members of Congress grilled the CEOs of\u00a0Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, asking whether they squelched competition.\u00a0</p><p>Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts promised to break up major technology companies during her presidential bid.\u00a0</p><p>Every week brings new headlines about ongoing antitrust probes by the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, and state attorneys general led by Republican Ken Paxton of Texas. Earlier this month, for example, the Wall Street Journal reported the Federal Trade Commission is considering whether to take sworn testimony from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg.</p><p>Dayen and Teachout detail how monopoly power extends well beyond Big Tech into every corner of the economy and our daily lives, from concert tickets to military contractors and rental houses to funeral homes. The resulting damage includes the \"murder\" of American journalism as Teachout puts it, middle class wage stagnation, and woefully inadequate rural Wi-Fi.</p><p>Teachout, a three-time progressive candidate for elected office in New York, uses particularly colorful language to describe the perpetrators. She equates Big Tech \"monopoly bosses\" with the mafia and singles out Amazon as \"a vast infrastructure machine with an ambition to take over the body and soul of the country.\"\u00a0</p><p>Dayen focuses much of his fury on Wall Street bankers and their legal advisers who, along with executives and shareholders, get rich together off the \"corporate money hose\" of mergers and acquisitions.</p><p>Teachout argues that simply adopting an ethos of \"ethical consumerism,\" and boycotting Amazon isn't enough. What's needed is \"a major, grassroots anti-monopoly movement\" designed to \"radically reshape our economy and democracy in the service of human needs,\" she writes.</p><p>Teachout would bar companies from controlling more than 10 percent of their respective markets, break up Big Tech companies and regulate the pieces as public utilities. In her epilogue, Teachout lays out her vision of a glorious monopoly-free future in which Google has been cut up into 57 smaller pieces by 2040.\u00a0</p><p>It is every writer's nightmare to have a book overtaken by events pre-publication, and perhaps one or both of these authors might update their work before the paperback version comes out to reflect the ways the world has changed due to Covid-19.</p><p>All signs so far suggest the big are just getting bigger as consumers flock to the likes of Walmart, Amazon, and Target. Big Tech companies are taking advantage of the moment, using their cash stockpiles to buy smaller, weaker rivals. Amazon boasted of hiring 175,000 people due to surging orders and announced plans in June to buy Zoox, a driverless vehicle startup, that could help the company eliminate delivery drivers one day.</p><p>Government\u00a0antitrust\u00a0enforcers may prove even more willing to allow mergers between giant airlines or hotel chains suffering from the travel shutdown, for example, if the alternative is letting companies fail altogether.</p><p>Or perhaps the pandemic will herald the third great period of trust busting in American history, akin to the Progressive Era and New Deal. After all, given how this year has gone so far, anything is possible.\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CSM-e2cf31022dcb0434b3d361de4afa747d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CSM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G7-3F11-JC8H-M3NR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7945</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"801\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Christian Science Publishing Society All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Christian Science Monitor</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0003SAE</classCode><className>PILGRIM'S PRIDE DE MEXICO SA DE CV</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000231M</classCode><className>PILGRIM'S PRIDE CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>FORDHAM UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

'Conservatives face a tough fight as Big Tech's censorship expands', authored by Donald Trump Jr., via The Hill[1] As Big Tech's censorship of conservatives becomes ever more flagrant and overt, the old arguments about protecting the sanctity of the modern public square are now invalid. Our right to freely engage in public discourse through speech is under sustained attack, necessitating a vigorous defense against the major social media and internet platforms. </p><p>From 'shadowbans' onFacebook[2]andTwitter[3], todemonetization of YouTube videos[4], topulled[5]ads for Republican candidates at the critical junctures of election campaigns, the list ofviolations against the online practices and speech of conservatives[6]is long. I certainly had my suspicions confirmed when Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, 'accidentally'censored[7]a post I made regarding the Jussie Smollett hoax, which consequently led to me hearing from hundreds of my followers about how they've been having problems seeing, liking or being able to interact with my posts. Many of them even claimed that they've had to repeatedly refollow me, as Instagram keeps unfollowing me on their accounts. While nothing about Big Tech's censorship of conservatives truly surprises me anymore, it's still chilling to see the proof for yourself. If it can happen to me, the son of the president, with millions of followers on social media, just think about how bad it must be for conservatives with smaller followings and those who don't have the soapbox or media reach to push back when they're being targeted? Thanks to a brave Facebook whistleblower whoapproached[8]James O'Keefe's Project Veritas, we now know thatMark Zuckerberg[9]'s social media giant developed algorithms to 'deboost' certain content, limiting its distribution and appearance in news feeds. As you probably guessed, this stealth censorship was specifically aimed at conservatives. Facebook appears to have deliberatelytailored[10]its algorithm to recognize the syntax and style popular among conservatives in order to 'deboost' that content. 'Mainstream media,' 'SJW' (Social Justice Warrior) and 'red pill' \u2014 all terms that conservatives often use to express themselves \u2014 were listed as red flags, according to the former Facebook insider. Facebook engineers even cited BlazeTV host Lauren Chen's video criticizing the social justice movement as an example of the kind of 'red pills' that users just aren't allowed to drop anymore. Mainstream conservative content wasstrangled[11]in real time, yet fringe leftists such as the Young Turks enjoy free rein on the social media platform. Despite the occasionalbrave gesture[12], politicians have been far too sluggish in recognizing the extent of the problem. But the Republican Party and the conservative movement are becoming more vigilant against the suppression of our speech, as we saw at last weekend'sConservative Political Action Conference (CPAC).[13] Silicon Valley lobbyists have splashedmillions of dollars[14]all over the Washington swamp to play on conservatives' innate faith in the free-market system and respect for private property. Even as Big Tech companies work to exclude us from the town square of the 21st century, they've been able to rely on misguided conservatives tocarry water[15]for them with irrelevant pedantry about whether the First Amendmentapplies[16]in cases of social media censorship. Sen.Josh Hawley[17](R-Mo.) has beenmaking[18]a name for himself as a Republican prepared to stand up to Big Tech malfeasance since his time as Missouri's attorney general. Hedelivered[19]a tour de force interview with The Wall Street Journal's Kimberly Strassel in front of the CPAC crowd, one that provided a clear-eyed assessment of the ongoing affront to the freedoms of conservative speech and expression. Hawley demolished the absurd notion that 'conservative principles' preclude taking action to ensure free debate online simply because Big Tech firms \u2014 the most powerful corporations in the world \u2014 are private companies. Hawley pointed out that Big Tech companies already enjoy 'sweetheart deals' under current regulations that make their malfeasance a matter of public concern. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, for instance, allows them to avoid liability for the content that users post to their platforms. To address this problem, Hawley proposed adding a viewpoint neutrality requirement for platforms that benefit from Section 230's protections, which were originallyenacted[20]to protect the internet as 'a forum for a true diversity of political discourse.' 'Google and Facebook should not be a law unto themselves,' Hawley declared. 'They should not be able to discriminate against conservatives. They should not be able to tell us we need to sit down and shut up!' It's high time other conservative politicians started heeding Hawley's warnings, because the logical endpoint of Big Tech's free rein is far more troubling than conservative meme warriors losing their Twitter accounts. As we're alreadystarting to see[21], what starts with social media censorship can quickly lead to banishment from such fundamental services as transportation, online payments and banking. Left unchecked, Big Tech and liberal activists could construct a private 'social credit' system \u2014 not unlike what the communists have nightmarishlyimplemented[22]in China \u2014 that excludes outspoken conservatives from wide swaths of American life simply because their political views differ from those of tech executives. There is no conservative principle that even remotely suggests we are obligated to adopt a laissez-faire attitude while the richest companies on earth abuse the power we give them to put a thumb on the scale for our political enemies. If anything, our love of the free market dictates that we must do whatever is necessary to ensure that the free marketplace of ideas remains open to all. Donald Trump Jr.[23]is executive vice president at The Trump Organization.

The question of what happens to TikTok in the US </emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Big Story</emphasis>)<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> is of far greater importance than the issue itself. Like the US blacklisting of Huawei, it could sour bilateral relations further and set the tone for data privacy policies in Europe and beyond.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">But this is by no means the only must-read story this week. Ant Group\u2019s planned IPO </emphasis>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mercedes\u2019 Top 10</emphasis>) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">may well be the world\u2019s big tech splash of the year.

It took a step in that direction this week after lawmakers voted 336 to 71 to prohibit TikTok\u2019s use by federal employees. An unnamed US official said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3621399b-b0af-43bc-bbf9-a546d8518189\"> Washington would send</url> a \u201cvery strong message to China\u201d within a month \u2014 but opposition towards a general ban is nevertheless significant.</p><p>\u201cForeign tech companies should not be kept out of the US market because of rumours and innuendo,\u201d said Daniel Castro, vice-president of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://itif.org/\">Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation</url>, a leading US tech think-tank. \u201cDoing so not only risks immediate retaliation for US companies, but it also would establish a global norm where countries are free to impose trade restrictions on digital goods and services for vague and undefined national security threats.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Key implications: </emphasis>The case against TikTok, which is owned by Chinese tech giant ByteDance, revolves around data security. US officials told the Financial Times that Washington was considering blacklisting ByteDance in order to prevent Beijing from harvesting US personal data. </p><p>Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, said downloading the TikTok app would put \u201cyour private information in the hands of the Chinese Communist party\u201d. TikTok has about 26.5m active monthly users in the US, mostly between the ages of 16 and 24. </p><p>Zhao Lijian, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman, said comments by certain US politicians about TikTok were \u201ccompletely groundless\u201d and amounted to \u201cmalicious smearing\u201d. TikTok says it has never handed over user data to the Chinese government.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Upshot: </emphasis>This week\u2019s vote by US House of Representatives lawmakers to ban TikTok for federal employees would need to be approved by the Senate to become law. But the administration of Donald Trump does not need congressional approval to add ByteDance to a blacklist. </p><p>Mercedes Top 10 </p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Ant Group, the Chinese payments giant valued at $200bn, is to pursue a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0ede30bb-ef34-436e-89d5-f62a02b78aa0\"> dual share listing</url> in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hong Kong</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Shanghai</emphasis> in what is likely to be the splash tech IPO of the year.

Employment offers in the jobs that can be easily automated \u2014 including for desk clerks and some types of manufacturing \u2014 have declined by more than 30 per cent year on year recently.</p><p>By contrast, job offers in occupations less easy to automate have fallen off much less steeply.

The growing backlash against Silicon Valley giants, who are viewed as harming competitors and wielding inordinate power over a key sector of the economy, could become part of the conversation in the 2020 U.S. presidential election.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But could that lead to the U.S. breaking up one or more of the tech companies? It's a long shot. Even if government regulators decide they have credible grounds to pursue antitrust cases against Big Tech, it will be at least five years - perhaps longer - before anything concrete happens as they wind through the court system, according to legal experts and industry analysts.</p><p>One of the issues is that current U.S. antitrust laws are geared around price harms to consumers, whereas the likes of <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2019/gaming/news/google-stadia-connect-1203231647/\">Google</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/netflix-amazon-double-revenue-uk-broadcaster-streaming-services-bbc-sky-1203228903/\">Facebook</url> offer their services for free. That would likely require a new federal law (or new interpretation of existing law) to bar the type of anticompetitive behavior the major tech players have been accused of.</p><p>For a \"let's break up Big Tech\" antitrust movement to happen, as <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2019/politics/news/elizabeth-warren-big-tech-1203158386/\">Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has proposed</url>, \"there would have to be a sea change first in how the antitrust enforcement agencies think about antitrust and then in how the courts think about it,\" says Prof. Daniel A. Crane, senior professor of law at the University of Michigan Law School.</p><p>Political pressure is building on U.S. regulators to do something, or at least make it look like they're trying. The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission in the past few weeks have divvied up their oversight of Big Tech with potential antitrust probes in the offing, per multiple reports. The DOJ is looking into Google and <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-monopoly-us-regulatory-scrutiny-1203232463/\">Apple</url> and the FTC is examining Facebook and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/good-omens-neil-gaiman-benedict-cumberbatch-satan-interview-1203218066/\">Amazon</url>, according to a       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftc-to-examine-how-facebook-s-practices-affect-digital-competition-11559576731?mod=BNM&amp;mod=breakingnews&amp;utm_source=CJR+Daily+News&amp;utm_campaign=da5112e479-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_10_31_05_02_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_9c93f57676-da5112e479-174406349\">Wall Street Journal report</url>.</p><p>The prospect of major regulatory action against tech companies spooked investors - shares of Alphabet, Google's parent company, fell 6% on Monday - but tech stocks rebounded Tuesday amid a broader market uptick.</p><p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) joined the fray Tuesday in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1135698759441145857\">pair</url> of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1135698760397393921\">tweets</url>, citing the House Judiciary's launch of \"a long overdue investigation to determine if dominant digital platforms have harmed Americans in the marketplace &amp; the voting booth.\" Her statements come a week after she       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/nancy-pelosi-rebukes-facebook-fake-video-1203228291/\">lashed out at Facebook when the company refused to remove a doctored video</url>.</p><p>\"Unwarranted, concentrated economic power in the hands of a few is dangerous to democracy - especially when digital platforms control content,\" Pelosi wrote. \"The era of self-regulation is over.\"</p><p>The question is what legal grounds the U.S. can use to rein in the big tech firms. Historically, antitrust law considers consumer harms in terms of pricing. But if, for example, Amazon or Facebook steal an idea from a competitor or acquire a startup before it can become a rival, \"that doesn't result in higher prices - it's some future innovation harm,\" says Hal Singer, fellow at George Washington Institute Public Policy. Going down the antitrust path could take up to a decade to reach a resolution, according to Singer.</p><p>Congress might get there faster through legislation, akin to the Glass-Steagall provisions of the Banking Act of 1933, which forced banks to separate commercial and investment banking. Even so, it's not clear that breaking up tech giants would actually work to fix the problem, for example, by requiring Facebook to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp or making Google divest YouTube, says Singer.</p><p>\"If you had five Baby Facebooks, they would still have an incentive to steal\" or otherwise use their scale to thwart rivals, Singer says.</p><p>It's worth noting that two decades ago, the U.S. government filed an antitrust suit - joined by 20 states - against Microsoft, seeking to break it up. The complaint centered on the software giant's bundling of Windows and Internet Explorer together. The DOJ won an initial ruling approving splitting Microsoft into two entities (an OS company and an applications company). But the D.C. Court of Appeals rejected the idea that Microsoft should be broken up as the remedy for anticompetitive behavior. The Justice Department later reached a settlement with Microsoft, which among other concessions agreed to share APIs with third parties.</p><p>\"Breakup remedies are radical and they frequently have unintended consequences,\" says Prof. Herb Hovenkamp of the University of Pennsylvania and the Wharton School. \"Judges aren't good at breaking up companies.\"</p><p>For now, expect business as usual among the big technology companies, according to Wall Street analysts.</p><p>For Google, the worst-case scenario of the U.S. antitrust probes would be a fine like <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/google-europe-fine-alphabet-5-billion-charge-q2-1202877140/\">the $5 billion penalty the European Commission</url> imposed last year, according to Citigroup analyst Mark May. European regulators ruled that parts of agreements between Google and Android partners violated European law, including requiring manufacturers to pre-install the Google Search app and Chrome browser app as a condition for licensing Google's Play Store app. Meanwhile, a U.S. antitrust case against Facebook is \"even less clear than it is for Alphabet,\" May added.</p><p>Any U.S. action against Google would come after \"significant business practice scrutiny by the EU that has resulted in limited impact on Google's ad business,\" BofAMerrill Lynch analyst Justin Post wrote in a note Monday. He also pointed out that an FTC probe into Google ended in 2013 \"without further action into whether Google used its dominant web search position to disadvantage rivals.\"</p><p>But the current political climate is somewhat different, Post acknowledged, and he believes that if the DOJ moves ahead against Google that \"would likely embolden critics of Facebook, Amazon and other tech giants as well\" heading into the 2020 election year.</p><p>The chorus for the American government to \"do something\" about Big Tech has included Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes (who hasn't worked at Facebook in over a decade) urging <url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/facebook-co-founder-mark-zuckerberg-break-up-1203209740/\">the U.S. government to find a way to break up the social giant</url> to rein in its \"unprecedented and un-American power.\"</p><p>It may be becoming fashionable to speak out against Big Tech. But for now, the idea that Facebook, Google, Apple or Amazon will be broken up remains just rhetoric.</p><p>Related stories</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-monopoly-us-regulatory-scrutiny-1203232463/\">Apple CEO Denies the Tech Giant Is a Monopoly but Says U.S. 'Scrutiny Is Fair'</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/ipados-dark-mode-wwdc-news-1203231833/\">iPadOS, Dark Mode and Sign in With Apple: All the Biggest News From WWDC</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">VARETY-1203232588</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">VARTY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8B-TSD1-JC3V-6217-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434864</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1091\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Variety</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26328\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 4, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Companies are scrambling to comply.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Regulators say the new rules are necessary to protect consumers in an era of huge cyberattacks and data leaks, highlighted by Facebook's admission that the personal details of millions of its users were abused. </p><p>Here's what's going on:</p><p>What is it?</p><p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into effect across the European Union on May 25. </p><p>It seeks to expand and update data rules that have been in place since 1995 -- long before hacks, security breaches and data leaks became a common occurrence.</p><p>The new rules give Europeans more control over their personal data. The European Commission said that a lack of trust in tech companies was the main motivation behind the new rules. </p><p>What does it mean for companies?</p><p>Any organization that holds or uses data on people inside the European Union is subject to the new rules, regardless of where is it based.</p><p>Companies that sell goods and services to people in Europe will be impacted, as well as organizations that monitor people's online behavior, for example by tracking browsing histories.</p><p>The rules mean Silicon Valley has to change some of its business practices. Facebook, for example, has tens of million users in the European Union. So does Google.</p><p>Under the new law, companies will have to obtain an individual's consent in order to store and process personal data. Requests must be clear and written in plain language.</p><p>Organizations aren't allowed to hold data for longer than is necessary, and anyone can ask for their personal information to be deleted from a company's servers. There are only a few exceptions -- including if services cannot be provided without the data.</p><p>Firms may also have to prove they are handling data correctly -- this might mean increased monitoring and documentation. Some may have to hire data protection officers. </p><p>What does it mean for people?</p><p>Consumers can expect to see more privacy warnings and consent requests. These must be made separately, and cannot be bundled with general terms and conditions.</p><p>The rules mean that tech companies can no longer assume users want to hand over their data. Companies must now count on the opposite, and reflect that in their services and products.</p><p>For example: Rather than automatically signing a user up for a mailing list and later offering an unsubscribe option, companies now have to explicitly seek consent ahead of time. The default option when asking users if they want to subscribe must be \"no.\" </p><p>Some brands are already asking consumers if they want to remain on email marketing lists.</p><p>Companies are also required to tell authorities about any data security breach within 72 hours of discovering it -- a rule that should eliminate big gaps between the business finding out and customers being informed.</p><p>What's the cost?</p><p>Making sure a business complies with the new rules is costly. Many large organizations have hired outside auditors and advisers to help make sure they are ready.</p><p>But the cost of breaking the rules is even higher. </p><p>European regulators can impose fines of at least (EURO)20 million ($25 million) or up to 4% of annual global sales, which for the big tech companies could run into billions of dollars. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2018 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Companies are scrambling to comply.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Regulators say the new rules are necessary to protect consumers in an era of huge cyberattacks and data leaks, highlighted by Facebook's admission that the personal details of millions of its users were abused.</p><p>Here's what's going on:</p><p>What is it?</p><p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into effect across the European Union on May 25.</p><p>It seeks to expand and update data rules that have been in place since 1995 -- long before hacks, security breaches and data leaks became a common occurrence.</p><p>The new rules give Europeans more control over their personal data. The European Commission said that a lack of trust in tech companies was the main motivation behind the new rules.</p><p>What does it mean for companies?</p><p>Any organization that holds or uses data on people inside the European Union is subject to the new rules, regardless of where is it based.</p><p>Companies that sell goods and services to people in Europe will be impacted, as well as organizations that monitor people's online behavior, for example by tracking browsing histories.</p><p>The rules mean Silicon Valley has to change some of its business practices. Facebook, for example, has tens of million users in the European Union. So does Google.</p><p>Under the new law, companies will have to obtain an individual's consent in order to store and process personal data. Requests must be clear and written in plain language.</p><p>Organizations aren't allowed to hold data for longer than is necessary, and anyone can ask for their personal information to be deleted from a company's servers. There are only a few exceptions -- including if services cannot be provided without the data.</p><p>Firms may also have to prove they are handling data correctly -- this might mean increased monitoring and documentation. Some may have to hire data protection officers.</p><p>What does it mean for people?</p><p>Consumers can expect to see more privacy warnings and consent requests. These must be made separately, and cannot be bundled with general terms and conditions.</p><p>The rules mean that tech companies can no longer assume users want to hand over their data. Companies must now count on the opposite, and reflect that in their services and products.</p><p>For example: Rather than automatically signing a user up for a mailing list and later offering an unsubscribe option, companies now have to explicitly seek consent ahead of time. The default option when asking users if they want to subscribe must be \"no.\"</p><p>Some brands are already asking consumers if they want to remain on email marketing lists.</p><p>Companies are also required to tell authorities about any data security breach within 72 hours of discovering it -- a rule that should eliminate big gaps between the business finding out and customers being informed.</p><p>What's the cost?</p><p>Making sure a business complies with the new rules is costly. Many large organizations have hired outside auditors and advisers to help make sure they are ready.</p><p>But the cost of breaking the rules is even higher.</p><p>European regulators can impose fines of at least ?20 million ($25 million) or up to 4% of annual global sales, which for the big tech companies could run into billions of dollars.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20180406data-protection-europe-gdpr-facebook-tech1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S3B-1BM1-DY60-K106-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"570\"/><timeReceived>8:27 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"04\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>April 6, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But will those tools censor other content? Can a program judge the value of speech? <br/>Facebookfounder <person><nameText>Mark Zuckerberg </nameText></person>told Congress last week that his company is rapidly developing AI tools to \"identify certain classes of bad activity proactively and flag it for our team.\" </p><p><br/>It is one of several moves by Facebookas it struggles with an erosion of consumer trust over its harvesting of user data, its past vulnerability to targeted political misinformation and the opaqueness of the formulas upon which its news feeds are built. <br/>Some technologists believe that AI tools won't resolve these issues that Facebookand other social media companies face. <br/>\"The problem is that surveillance is Facebook's business model: surveillance in order to facilitate psychological manipulation,\" said Bruce Schneier, a well-known security expert and privacy specialist. \"Whether it's done by people or (artificial intelligence) is in the noise.\" <br/><person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said his Menlo Park, California, company relies on both AI tools and thousands of employees to review content. By the end of the year, he said, some 20,000 Facebookemployees will be \"working on security and content review.\" <br/>The company is developing its AI tools to track down hate speech and fake news on its platform and views the tools as a \"scalable way to identify and root out most of this harmful content,\" he said, indicating several times over 10 hours of testimony on two days that Facebookalgorithms can find objectionable content faster than humans. <br/>\"Today, as we sit here, 99 percent of the ISIS and Al Qaeda content that we take down on Facebook, our AI systems flag before any human sees it,\" <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said at a Senate hearing, referring to extremist groups. <br/>The artificial intelligence systems work in conjunction with a counterterrorism team of humans that <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>says numbers 200 employees. \"I think we have capacity in 30 languages that we're working on,\" he said. <br/>Other existing AI tools \"do a better job of identifying fake accounts that may be trying to interfere in elections or spread misinformation,\" he said. After fake accounts placed political information on Facebookthat disrupted the 2016 election, Facebookproactively took down \"tens of thousands of fake accounts\" before French and German elections in 2017, and Alabama's special election for a vacant Senate seat last December, he added. Facebookis far from alone among social media companies harnessing artificial intelligence to assist humans monitoring content.  <br/>\"AI tools in concert with humans can do better than either can do alone,\" said Wendell Wallach, an investigator at The Hastings Center, a bioethics research institute in Garrison, New York.  <br/>But Wallach noted that many users do not understand artificial intelligence, and Big Tech may face a backlash like food concerns face over genetically modified (GMO) ingredients.  <br/>\"The leading AI companies, which happen to be the same as the leading digital companies at the moment, understand that there is a GMO-like elephant that could jump out of the AI closet,\" Wallach said.  <br/>Already, concern is mounting among conservatives on Capitol Hill that platforms like Facebooktilt to the political left, whether AI tools or humans are involved in making content decisions.  <br/>\"You recognise these folks?\" Rep. Billy Long, R-Mo., asked <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>while holding up a photo of two sisters.  <br/>\"Is that Diamond and Silk?\" <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>asked, referring to two black social media personalities who are fervent supporters of President Donald Trump.  <br/>Indeed, it was, Long said, and Facebookhad deemed them \"unsafe.\"  <br/>\"What is unsafe about two black women supporting President Donald J. Trump?\"  <br/><person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>later noted that his Facebookteam \"made an enforcement error, and we've already gotten in touch with them to reverse it.\"  <br/>Artificial intelligence tools excel at identifying salient information out of masses of data but struggle to understand context, especially in spoken language, experts said.  <br/>\"The exact same sentence, depending on the relationship between two individuals, could be an expression of hate or an expression of endearment,\" said David Danks, an expert on ethics around autonomous systems at Carnegie Mellon University. He cited the use of the \"N-word,\" which between some people can be a friendly term, but is also widely considered hate speech in other contexts.  <br/>Any errors that AI tools make in such linguistic minefields could be interpreted as censorship or political bias that could further diminish trust in social media companies.  <br/>\"The general public, I think, is much less trusting of these companies,\" Danks said.  <br/>Eventually, he said, the algorithms and AI tools of a handful of companies will earn greater public trust, even as consumers do not understand how they operate.<br/><br/>\"I don't understand in many ways how my car works, but I still trust it to function in all the ways I need it to,\" Danks said.  <br/>Just as librarians once used subjective judgment in taking books off the shelves, social media companies also can face criticism that AI tools can overreach.  <br/>\"Twitter faces this,\" said James J. Hughes, executive director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, in Boston. \"Pinterest and Instagram are always taking down artists' websites who happen to have naked bodies in them when they think they are porn, when they are not.  <br/>\"And they are doing that based on artificial intelligence algorithms that flag how much naked flesh is in the picture.\"  <br/>In his testimony, <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>said AI tools were increasingly adept at \"identifying fake accounts that may be trying to interfere in elections or spread misinformation.\"  <br/>Facebookhas admitted that a Russian agency used Facebookto spread misinformation that reached up to 126 million people around the time of the 2016 presidential vote, and that the personal data of 87 million people may have been misused by the firm Cambridge Analytica to target voters in favour of Trump.  <br/><person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>told senators that Facebook's delay in identifying Russian efforts to interfere in the election is \"one of my greatest regrets in running the company\" and pledged to do better to combat manipulation for this year's election.  <br/>As legislators wrestled over whether Facebookand other social media companies need regulation, <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>repeatedly faced questions over the nature of his company. Is it also a media company because it produces content? A software company? A financial services firm that supports money transfers?  <br/>\"I consider us to be a technology company, because the primary thing that we do is have engineers who write code and build products and services for other people,\" <person><nameText>Zuckerberg </nameText></person>told a House hearing.  <br/>Experts say that answer doesn't address complex issues around platforms that are increasingly more like public utilities.  <br/>\"The electric company is not allowed to say, we don't like your political views therefore we are not going to give you electricity,'\" Danks said. \"If somebody is knocked off of Facebook, is that tantamount to the electric company cutting off their electricity? Or is it more like the person who is really loud and obnoxious in a bar, and the owner says, 'You need to leave now'?\" \u2014 McClatchy Washington Bureau/TNS</p><p>(Syndigate.info).</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/60/183/4/152451904486.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/60/183/4/152451904486.jpg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLFTMS-114958128</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLFTMS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S5N-77R1-JDJN-62M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381159</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1246\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Gulf Times Newspaper Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

The venture is being pitched at what people like to describe as \"emerging markets\", which tend to contain significant numbers of people who lack access to banking services, and is what's known as a \"stablecoin\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What that means is that it will - as distinct from, say, bitcoin - be underpinned by a basket of global currencies and securities. The aim is to ensure that its valuation doesn't move like the latest Disney theme park rollercoaster, which would severely crimp its ability to serve as a unit of exchange as opposed to a unit of speculation. Facebook has also been at pains to nix any impression that it's a means for the empire to extend the reach of the dark side of the data force, despite the lead role it has played in developing the thing, and the blockchain software it will run on.</p><p>The cryptocurrency will therefore be governed in Geneva by the Libra Association, whose members have each ponied up $10m (\u00a38m) to get an equal vote and serve as Libra nodes. Facebook will have just one of those votes alongside the likes of financial-services outfits such as Visa and Mastercard, payment companies such as PayPal, some of the digital businesses that might use it (eBay, Lyft, Uber, Spotify), and even Vodafone, which has a presence in several emerging markets. Lots of people without bank accounts still have mobile phones that operate over its networks, which are a key part of this.</p><p>Clearly Facebook doesn't want to scare either potential users, or, more to the point, the regulators and politicians that are crawling all over it in the wake of the privacy and data scandals that have bedevilled the company. It has a separate vehicle for its Libra-related transactions called Calibra, that won't make much money at first but could soon do so through the expansion of related services. Lending is one possibility that has been mentioned.</p><p>Facebook has tried to reassure potential users that transaction data won't be shared with ad-targeting companies if they don't want it to be. Regulators have also been told that Libra wants to cooperate with them. So they'll presumably get a tour of the building and lots of reassuring noises about them not needing to worry too much. There have also been promises made about compensating Libra users who get hacked and to make sure it doesn't become the vehicle of choice for fraud and money laundering.</p><p>It's true that extending the ability of people to access digital marketplaces, and to buy and sell services through them, could be a thoroughly welcome development. But there are already schemes, digital wallets for example, that have grown up to facilitate this in places where people lacking access to traditional financial services is a problem. They just don't happen to involve Facebook.</p><p>Libra would certainly appear to have potential in areas where costs can be debilitating, such as the transfer of monies overseas by immigrant communities. Ultimately its success or failure will be heavily dependent on how comfortable people feel about trusting Facebook with the reinvention of money in places where they often resort to dollars.

What's also interesting about the Libra Association is who's not involved: there's no Google or Apple or Amazon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INPDWB-INMLMMGLSTRY000031933273-ARTICLE-TEXT-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDPNT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WCF-8M11-JCS0-D4FH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"585\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Print Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Independent - Daily Edition</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30262\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 19, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>CC000266V</classCode><className>VISA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00068GY</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY PARKS &amp;

This is true for most major economic depressions and recessions in U.S. history. General Motors (NYSE: GM[1]) was founded less than a year after the Panic of 1907, a crisis so severe it led to the creation of the Federal Reserve. The first Publix grocery store was opened in 1930, less than a year into The Great Depression. </p><p>More recently, the dotcom bubble burst gave way to Web 2.0 companies like Skype, Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB[2]), and YouTube, three companies that would all grow to be worth over $1 billion. In each of these cases, entrepreneurs either identified a shift in consumer behavior that was already beginning to take shape (automobiles in the 1910s and supermarkets in the 1930s) or harnessed emerging technology for new purposes (video chatting, streaming, and social media in the 2000s). And though the world is still in a state of flux thanks to the global pandemic, we're already starting to see how this crisis is changing the way we work and spend. Remote work has made enterprise software and communication tools like Slack Technologies Inc (NYSE: WORK[3]), Zoom Video Communications (NASDAQ: ZM[4]), and Asana even more indispensable than they were before. On the consumer front, e-commerce spending[5] is expected to reach an all-time high this year. In this regard, financial services are no different than how every other industry is in flux right now. Everything about financial services is changing before our eyes\u2014from how we bank, to how we invest and spend money. Just like the last financial crisis in 2008, fintech is going to pull it all forward.The Great Recession And The Birth Of Modern FintechWhile the technological disruption of financial services was well underway by the time The Great Recession destroyed a decade's worth of wealth, the economic and regulatory upheaval of that period gave way to a fintech boom that is still being felt today. For example, the collapse of several large financial institutions and drying up of credit gave the nascent digital lending industry a shot in the arm. Today, alternative lenders like Kabbage, Affirm, and SoFi are among the leaders of an industry that some estimates[6] have pegged is as large as $100 billion. S&amp;#38;P Global estimates[7] the loan originations at the top digital lenders grew approximately 72% annually between 2014-2019. Meanwhile, distaste over how traditional banks and Wall Street firms had played a role in the financial crisis led to a host of new financial services providers that focused on democratizing access to the market. Among those was Robinhood, which ushered in the commission-free trading business model that has since been replicated by the major retail brokerage firms and low-fee banks like Chime, NuBank, and Aspiration. The JOBS Act, passed in 2012, and Regulation A, passed in 2015, also enabled smaller private companies to raise money from public investors, giving birth to the entirely new industry of equity crowdfunding and companies like WeFunder and StartEngine. And then there are the poster children of fintech\u2014payments apps Venmo and Square Inc (NYSE: SQ[8])\u2014which enabled payments in the early days of smartphones and have since exploded into multi-billion dollar financial services.Fintech In A Post-COVID WorldIf the modern fintech industry was essentially born out of the last major economic recession, the obvious next question is what kind of impact will the COVID-19 pandemic have on the industry? Here are some ideas for the types of companies that could thrive in a post-pandemic world.Companies That Enable Digital Payments And SpendingDigital payments and e-commerce are not new. But there's a chance we'll look back and realize 2020 was the year that threw gasoline on the fire. The pandemic has not only forced every type of financial institution\u2014from the largest commercial lenders to the smallest community banks\u2014to shift its operations and interactions with clients to online and mobile, it's forced consumers to make that very same adjustment. Though some consumers will always prefer in-person interactions with their bank or lender, these types of monumental shifts can spur long-term change. As the Kansas City Fed notes[9], 'The COVID-19 pandemic may prove to be the needed catalyst for change. The pandemic has fostered a digital shift in the behaviors and preferences of consumers and businesses, spurred industry initiatives, and strengthened legislative efforts to address the prevailing gaps in consumer access to financial services and affordable broadband internet.'Companies That Put An Emphasis On Data PrivacyRegulatory and public scrutiny of Big Tech has steadily increased in recent years, and the rising trend of digitization that has resulted from the global pandemic has only further raised the stakes. The enactment of GDPR in Europe in 2018 and the California Consumer Privacy Act in 2019 set the stage for what will likely be the most scrutinized decade yet when it comes to data protection. Just as 'consumer-friendly' became the calling card of post-2008 financial services, it's not unreasonable to think that 'data friendly' and 'privacy' will be the next things financial services prioritize in an effort to gain market share. It's why the heads of the major U.S. banks stressed the importance of cybersecurity to Congress last year[10].Companies That Find New Markets OnlineCrises can breed innovation, but that innovation can also expose gaps and opportunities unseen in the existing business models. New technologies create the need for other new technologies, and new services need to find ways to reach consumers who may not know to look for them. Companies that can fill these gaps can position themselves as key cogs in the marketplace. Square, for example, started as a company that facilitated cashless and mobile payments. But that created a need for new services as more and more merchants built up e-commerce operations. Now, the company provides small businesses with everything from marketing and payroll solutions to loans with the caveat that everything is done as frictionless as possible. This ease of integrations has made Square an often critical partner to businesses during the pandemic. Other firms have taken it upon themselves to fill in the gaps by connecting financial services around the globe. JP Morgan Chase &amp;#38; Co.'s (NYSE: JPM[11]) Interbank Information Network is a good example. Since its launch in 2017, the initiative has connected more than 415 institutions across 78 countries to facilitate cross-border payments. Even Financial is another example. According to its founder, the company was created due to the rise of application programming interfaces. APIs, interfaces that allow multiple pieces of software to communicate, created a new opportunity in financial services to deliver a better user experience. 'As the financial services industry focused on consumer experience, it became increasingly reliant on technologies like APIs that enable speed and convenience,' said Even Founder and CEO Phill Rosen. 'On one hand, consumers were searching for financial services such as loans, and banks and other companies were trying to reach these same consumers, but there was nothing to facilitate that process beyond static ads and traditional lead aggregators. We built Even to fill that gap.' Our 'new normal' from the pandemic has created a unique opportunity for financial services to define what the 'new normal' is within banking and finance. The economic shockwave from COVID-19 created a situation where there are suddenly many more people in need of services like credit and loans, while at the same time shifting the way firms interact with their clients. The innovation from fintech can help us navigate this changing environment. 'Fintech's potential to help counter the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and support the eventual economic recovery is large but cannot be taken for granted,' wrote the International Monetary Fund[12] in a July whitepaper. 'Fintech is proving to be a useful tool in ensuring access to financial services and helping deliver governments' support measures.'   2020 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

Experts are doubtful He's calling for tech businesses to shut down rhetoric that could lead to violence, while accusing the same companies of censoring conservative groups.</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline><nitf:dateline><location>Portland, Me.</location></nitf:dateline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Technology experts are skeptical of President Trump's call for internet companies to work with law enforcement and the Justice Department to develop tools to detect mass shootings before they even happen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They say the Trump administration has an especially bad track record on addressing violence on social media - and has ignored major opportunities to take action on this front both at home and with other countries. Instead, they lament, Trump's tech policy focus has been heavily centered on accusing Big Tech of anti-conservative bias - accusations the companies deny and have not been backed by substantial evidence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump promised that the \"perils of the internet and social media cannot be ignored and they will not be ignored,\" after last weekend's shootings in El Paso, Texas, and Dayton, Ohio. The president spent more time blaming the internet and social media for the shootings than racism, hatred or access to guns, according to an analysis by The Washington Post.</p><p>While Trump is now promising to \"shine a light\" on the dark corners of the internet, experts note that the administration did not even sign onto the Christchuch call, a key international agreement to curb violent extremism online after the New Zealand shootings. Twitter, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft all signed on to the May agreement to work closely with each other and the 18 participating governments to stop their platforms from fostering terrorism. The United Kingdom, Canada and France were among those who did sign on.</p><p>And violent speech on social media \"wasn't even mentioned\" as the White House hosted a high-profile social media summit last month, said Clint Watts, a former FBI special agent now at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. The summit's circus-like atmosphere seemed designed to amplify conservatives' accusations of bias against the platforms.</p><p>Trump's call for social media companies to take a greater role in searching for possible predictors of violent acts could also be difficult to square with his charges that Big Tech is already going overboard in the effort to moderate accounts, Watts also points out.</p><p>One primary reason that social media companies do remove or limit the reach of accounts is due to concerns the speech could lead to violence, he said.</p><p>\"What the administration is saying is constantly at odds with itself,\" Watts said in an interview. \"If you're the main social media platforms, what do you do?\"</p><p>Case in point: The White House expressed concerns that signing the Christchuch call could run afoul of the First Amendment despite his personal crusade to regulate companies for perceived bias against conservatives. Now, he's opening the door to more drastic moderation from the companies themselves.</p><p>It also was unclear from Trump's brief comments how the potential work with the department would differ from what technology companies already do to combat violent extremism on their platforms.</p><p>Michael Beckerman, the chief executive of the Internet Association, said the tech industry is committed to continue working with law enforcement on these issues.</p><p>\"Violent and terroristic speech violate IA member company policies and have no place either online or in our society. IA members work everyday to find dangerous content and remove it from their platforms,\" said Beckerman, whose trade group represents some of the large technology companies including Google and Facebook in Washington. \"IA members are committed to continuing to work with law enforcement, stakeholders, and policymakers to make their platforms safer, and to prevent people from using their services as a vehicle for disseminating violent, hateful content.\"</p><p>Facebook, Google's YouTube and Twitter declined to comment on the record, but the companies all have policies that state they cooperate with law enforcement.</p><p>The mainstream technology platforms have been stepping up their efforts to combat violence and hate speech on their platforms following broad global pressure, especially after the public backlash following the New Zealand attacks earlier this year. Still, the spotlight is only growing as the El Paso gunman is believed to have posted a white nationalist manifesto to 8chan. It was the third mass shooting this year to begin with a hateful screed on the website.</p><p>Watts says the rise of fringe platforms like 8chan is actually evidence that the tech companies' efforts to moderate content have been working, and extremists have to turn to alternative platforms where less content moderation occurs.</p><p>Watts also was skeptical that the Justice Department has the resources and and expertise to conduct research on the rise of domestic terrorism on social media.</p><p>Jessica Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez, co-founder of Change The Terms, a coalition of civil rights groups focused on fighting the spread of hate speech on social media, said the government can't be trusted to take on this issue, either - and warned that new tools they develop could be \"dangerous\" and risk infringing on free speech. It should be up to the companies to do even more to effectively enforce their policies and invest in better content moderation, Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez argues.</p><p>Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez also criticized Trump's own attacks on immigrants on social media as \"part of the problem.\"</p><p>\"I'm not interested in seeing predictive policing online,\" Gonz\u00c3\u00a1lez said. \"I'm interested in seeing him ramp down his rhetoric online.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRTPRH-2270854615</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRTPRH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WSV-DPR1-JBHT-D1SD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409746</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"895\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 Portland Newspapers Aug 11, 2019</copyright><publicationName>Portland Press Herald</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 26895900</issn><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 11, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

[Audio link to full show is posted below.] We continue today to try to focus on a number of important issues that aren't receiving the coverage they deserve, but that voters need to know about as we head toward the crucial 2018 mid-term elections. Among those issues is the strange matter of the wildly unpopular[3] GOP tax bill which, oddly enough, most Republicans members of Congress don't seem overly concerned about[4]. Why would that be? One reason, as cited by GOP leadership[5] in Congress, is that they believe Americans will come to love the new scheme once they begin to see more money in their paychecks this year. </p><p>But how much more money will average middle-class Americans actually see, if any? That may be up to one man who now heads the IRS, with an \"Acting\" title, even as he works for the Trump Administration's Treasury Department at the same time in what seems a blatant conflict of interest. Remember the phony \"IRS Scandal\" that Republicans and Fox \"News\" and Donald Trump all still pretend was an actual scandal involving Barrack Obama using the IRS for political purposes (which the IRS Inspector General has since completely debunked with far less fanfare[6])? Well, now the President of the United States actually does have a ringer at the IRS, his unconfirmed Acting IRS Chief David Kautter [pictured above]. Could he be the \"Ace in the Hole\" for Republicans on their tax bill? Investigative financial journalist DAVID DAYEN[7], who recently wrote about this for The Nation[8], joins us today to explain how Trump's ringer at the Internal Revenue Service may be able to game the nation's paycheck tax withholding scheme, beginning in February, in order to try and turn the tide in favor of the GOP tax scam in advance of the 2018 mid-terms. \"Instead of putting someone up for a vote in the Senate and going through the confirmation process, they just made this guy, Kautter, the IRS Commissioner, and there is nobody on the horizon who is set to replace him,\" Dayen explains. \"So, this guy is doing two separate jobs, essentially. He is the Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy --- which is a position where he was working with members of Congress to put the tax bill forward --- and he's supposed to be the non-partisan official who is implementing that same policy.\" Since most of the changes to the tax law won't be seen by average Americans until 2019, when they file their 2018 taxes, paycheck withholding is \"the only way that people are really going to experience this tax bill between now and the midterm elections,\" says Dayen. \"And they'll see that difference in their paychecks, allegedly, by the beginning of February.\" But the way the federal government determines the formulas for withholding is \"more art than science,\" Dayen tells me. The question is now whether Kautter, who previously worked at financial giant Ernst ...ung assisting huge corporations avoid taxes, will \"move resources toward making sure that the assumptions that are made in withholding work to the benefit of ordinary people, so that they get more money now that they might have to give back in April of 2019? But [that] will create the feeling that there is this boost from the tax cut that is illusory, and that might help Republicans in the midterms?\" Republicans, he argues, seem to be \"really relying on this. They're saying, 'Just you wait and see, America. Wait until February and all of your questions about the tax bill will be answered by your huge gain in your paycheck.' There's tons of pressure, from both the White House and from Congress, to get this done.\" Also discussed on today's show: Speaking of the new Gilded Age for corporations and the wealthy, Dayen's latest cover story for American Prospect[9] on \"Big Tech's New Predatory Capitalism\"; HUD's just-announced postponement[10] of a major new Obama-era rule meant to decrease racial segregation in public housing; EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt takes credit for[11] the Obama EPA's work on Superfund site cleanup...

An optometrist has an office downstairs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr. Weinberg's company, DuckDuckGo, has become one of the feistiest adversaries of Google. Started over a decade ago, DuckDuckGo offers a privacy-focused alternative to Google's search engine. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  The company's share of the search engine market is still tiny -- about 1 percent compared with Google's 85 percent, according to StatCounter. But it has tripled over the past two years and is now handling around 40 million searches a day. It has also made a profit in each of the last five years, Mr. Weinberg said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Mr. Weinberg, 40, is among the most outspoken critics of the internet giants. DuckDuckGo's chief executive has repeatedly called for new privacy-focused legislation and has warned at hearings and in newspaper opinion pieces about the problems that big companies can cause by tracking our every move online.</p><p>  But the challenges faced by DuckDuckGo reflect just how difficult it is to take on the giants and build an internet business that is focused on the privacy of its users.</p><p>  After a decade, the private company's modest success is an indication that, even as regulators around the world consider tougher rules for the data-tracking methods of big tech companies, selling consumers on privacy-focused services is still an uphill battle.</p><p>  Like other search companies, DuckDuckGo displays ads at the top of each search page. But unlike others, it does not track the online behavior of its users to personalize the ads.</p><p>DuckDuckGo constantly bumps into Google's business, which stretches far beyond search. It also has to contend with the fact that most people don't seem willing to give up much to recover their privacy, and are easily overwhelmed when they decide to try to make a change.</p><p>  ''It's not as easy to switch as we'd like it to be,'' Mr. Weinberg said while sitting in his office in jeans, red sneakers and a black short-sleeve shirt. ''There is a lot of inertia drawing people back to the existing system.''</p><p>  These limitations are reflected in DuckDuckGo's modest offices. DuckDuckGo, which has 65 employees, has done only two relatively small fund-raising rounds, about $13 million, that add up to less than what Google makes in an hour. Mr. Weinberg parks his 2011 Honda minivan in a parking lot you can see from his corner office, which is papered mostly in drawings by his two sons.</p><p>  For people who care about privacy, DuckDuckGo is a reminder that it is possible to offer internet access and build an online business without logging every move made by users. It also provides a vision of what the internet might look like if companies are forced to scale back the surveillance economy.</p><p>  ''DuckDuckGo is very much a poster child for a future in which companies stand with their users and still make money,'' said Gennie Gebhart, a researcher at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on privacy and online rights. ''They counter the assumption that we've all been socialized to accept: that it is normal to hand over all your information. DuckDuckGo shows that doesn't have to be the way.''</p><p>Google has so far avoided any showdowns with DuckDuckGo. Last year, Google added DuckDuckGo as one of the four default search engines available for users of its internet browser, Chrome.</p><p>  But the internet giant has not taken kindly to DuckDuckGo's suggestions that it is selling information about its users to the highest bidder.</p><p>  ''The data we collect makes our product more helpful for people in a variety of ways, such as improving our understanding of queries and combating threats like spam and fraud,'' said Lara Levin, a Google spokeswoman. ''We keep this data private and secure, and we provide controls so people can make their own choices.''</p><p>  Mr. Weinberg started DuckDuckGo in 2008 when he was a stay-at-home dad, after struggling to get two previous start-ups off the ground. The early versions of DuckDuckGo (its name is a nod to the children's game) did not have any focus on privacy. When he went in that direction, it was attractive to only a small number of privacy advocates.</p><p>  But after Edward J. Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, revealed extensive online surveillance by the United States government in 2013, privacy became a selling point. Business began to grow.</p><p>DuckDuckGo is not the only upstart that is trying to capitalize on privacy concerns. Proton Technologies, a Swiss start-up, is taking on Gmail with an alternative email service. The Firefox and Brave browsers are more focused on privacy than Chrome. And Google Maps users can switch to OpenStreetMap.</p><p>  [If you're online -- and, well, you are -- chances are someone is using your information. We'll tell you what you can do about it. Sign up for our limited-run newsletter.]</p><p>DuckDuckGo's search site looks similar to Google, with the G replaced by a playful cartoon head of a duck, who goes by the name Dax. Type in a question and up pops a list of links that looks like what you'd get from Google, with definitions from Wikipedia at the top and maps supplied through a partnership with Apple Maps.</p><p>  Mr. Weinberg said the site was designed to make it feel similar to Google, to ease the transition for new users. While DuckDuckGo does not keep data on its users, it can pull the geographic location from each query and serve local results for things like restaurants and news.</p><p>  ''We don't think privacy is stopping getting good search results for anybody,'' Mr. Weinberg said.</p><p>  In online reviews at sites like Reddit and Quora, users praising DuckDuckGo's little features -- like shortcuts for searching specific websites, known as bangs -- are roughly equal in number to those who find its search results inferior.</p><p>  I made DuckDuckGo my default search engine while I was doing my reporting for this article. I mostly didn't notice a difference, though I did find the maps and local results to be less on target. And there were times when DuckDuckGo couldn't figure out what I was looking for when Google could, especially for more obscure queries.</p><p>  Joseph Turow, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has written extensively about privacy, said that whenever he had tried DuckDuckGo, he had given up after a few days because of nagging doubts about quality of the results.</p><p>  ''I'm almost embarrassed to say that I don't use it more than I do,'' Mr. Turow said. ''There is something in my head that tells me I'll get a better search from Google, even when I don't know if that is demonstrably correct or not.''</p><p>DuckDuckGo is also up against another hard reality of the online world: If you call up DuckDuckGo on the Chrome browser, for example, Google is still logging your search queries.</p><p>  ''It can feel a bit futile as an individual,'' said Liz Coll, the head of digital change at Consumers International, a consumer advocacy group. ''It's quite hard to isolate your search engine as opposed to all the other things you do online.''</p><p>DuckDuckGo is expanding beyond the search engine. The company's second most popular product, a free widget that can be installed in any browser, blocks invisible trackers from Google and other companies while providing a privacy and security grade for every website.</p><p>  The plug-in gives Google's main website a grade of D, because, DuckDuckGo says, Google tracks you across the web and keeps permanent logs of your activity, which either the government or hackers might exploit.</p><p>Google has said it offers users many settings so they can opt out of data collection. Most people don't, the company said, because the data collection makes online services better and hasn't led to big problems -- at least at Google.</p><p>  Mr. Weinberg said the challenge of parsing what Google did and did not do was an indication of why it was so important to build alternatives that don't keep any data.</p><p>  ''All of these companies were saying you can't make money without tracking your users,'' he said. ''By us existing and getting bigger and being profitable, we serve as the existence proof that it is possible.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Gabriel Weinberg, chief executive of the search engine DuckDuckGo, at the company's offices in Paoli, Pa., far left and left.

He's in Beirut this morning.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PEREIRA: And we're going to get some developments from him from the Syrian - about the Syrian capital, how things are standing right now. We'll get to him a little later in our broadcast.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes, he's been in Syria doing incredible reporting through all this.</p><p>PEREIRA: Really incredible.</p><p>HARLOW: So we'll bring you the latest from Fred live as soon as we have him.</p><p>Meantime, a new report in \"The Washington Post\" sheds some light on just how much bang the United States is getting for its so-called spying bucks. The report says that Washington will spend, get this, more than $52 billion this year on intelligence, going to things like paying CIA agents and other analysts. But it also says that the United States still has some blind spots in the world, like Pakistan. Spies, of course, don't know much about how secure things are in Pakistan. North Korea, another one. Its missiles and even its leaders are mysteries still, this report says. \"The Post\" used information from NSA leaker Edward Snowden for this latest report.</p><p>PEREIRA: Well, some progress. Slowly but surely crews are making progress fighting that enormous wildfire that's in and around Yosemite National Park. Favorable weather conditions have actually helped them keep the fire burning deeper into the park and encroaching on some of those really popular tourist areas.</p><p>Let's give you an update. The fire has burned so far nearly 200,000 acres. It's at 32 percent containment right now. And this is a really shocking figure, I think, to many. Officials are estimating the cost to date to fight one of the largest fire in California's history, $47 million. This is a concern because there have been so many other fires. It's been a bad fire season.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PEREIRA: It was predicted early on this year that this year would be a bad fire season. And it's turning out just to be so.</p><p>HARLOW: It's been horrific and it's interesting this fire, and I want to bring Indra Petersons in to talk about it, but this fire seems like it has just taken so long to even get to 30 percent containment. PEREIRA: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: So the weather, we what to know what factor that has.</p><p>Indra, what can you tell us.</p><p>INDRA PETERSONS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Yes, I mean it's hard to believe, when you guys talk about how big this fire is -</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PETERSONS: It's literally larger than New York City. So that puts it in perspective. And I actually put up here the top five fires here. If you want to see, notice, it's now the top five for California. The biggest on still Cedar Fire, everyone remembers, about a decade ago in San Diego.</p><p>But speaking of the weather, it's actually good. So that's the one thing that's helping them. Again, it is the steep terrain in the area. The numbers look good out there. The winds, only about five to 10 miles per hour. Seventy-seven degrees is their high. Some hints for moisture in the afternoon producing a possible thunderstorm. But even that pretty low, again, it's just this terrain. It is so steep in the area. It's so difficult for firefighters to get in there and combat those flames. So, unfortunately, they're still dealing with that.</p><p>In the Midwest is actually - we're still seeing that heat today. I mean look at these temperatures. We're actually seeing the heat spread even farther south. Oklahoma City, 10 degrees above normal. But Des Moines today expected to break a record, 18 degrees above normal.</p><p>Want to take you forward in time. Relief is in the forecast. You can see by tomorrow, temperatures starting to go down as the cold front makes its way through. But Saturday in through Sunday is when you're really going to see that big change and see those temperatures go back to where we'd like to see them. We'll see a lot more 70s and 80s in that forecast.</p><p>Unfortunately, that cold front is good news for them as far as temperatures. But for a lot of us, as we go through Labor Day weekend, it does. And we're going to watch a series of cold front moves through the area and that's going to mean some chances for rain. So by Sunday especially in through Monday, that's Labor Day, we're going to watch those two cold fronts merge and see a lot of rain and all the way in the northeast, all the way into the mid-Atlantic as well. So, rain.</p><p>HARLOW: All right. Well, it's been a nice week.</p><p>PETERSONS: Exactly. I like that attitude.</p><p>PEREIRA: (INAUDIBLE). It's Labor Day weekend.</p><p>HARLOW: I know.</p><p>PEREIRA: A lot of people are taking it off and want to -</p><p>HARLOW: But Indra was -</p><p>PETERSONS: I'm going with Poppy on this one.</p><p>PEREIRA: You're not going to help me out?</p><p>PETERSONS: Sorry.</p><p>HARLOW: Indra was telling me earlier, you've got to just make the best of it. Make the best of it.</p><p>PEREIRA: That's true. She's very positive.</p><p>PETERSONS: Thank you.</p><p>PEREIRA: All right, we want to turn back to our top story of Syria, a crisis there as the world waits for <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>to react. The Syrians, however, now claiming that they have proof that the rebels were behind the chemical weapons attack. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is monitoring developments for us in the Syrian capital. He is live in Beirut this morning.</p><p>We want to find out what you're hearing about this.</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this was apparently the defense minister of Syria, Michaela, and he was in a phone call with the defense minister of Iran where he said that they had evidence that apparently rebels had unleashed chemical gases in the suburbs of Damascus. Of course, this is completely contrary to what the U.S. is saying and also what many others are saying as well where they say that it was in fact the Syrian government that's behind all this. But the Syrian regime is now saying that it was the rebels who did all of this. Also, with a very strong statement, Bashar al-Assad came out himself as well late yesterday saying that if the Syrians are attacked, that they would retaliate with any means that they have.</p><p>I want to tell you a little bit about the mood in Damascus as well because I'm hearing from a lot of people there that there are many people who are nervous, they're buying additional food, they're making sure that they're stocked up. A lot of people have actually come over here to Lebanon. It's not like it's a big exodus or something, but there are many people who are saying we're going to playing it safe, we're going to bring our families out of the country and wait and see if America strikes.</p><p>And also, the regime is sending a lot of people, sort of propaganda people, out on the ground in Damascus waving Syrian flags, honking their horns, making the people prepared for what they believe could be an American attack.</p><p>Michaela.</p><p>PEREIRA: Hey, are you getting any word on how the U.S. is reacting to this claim from Syria that it was actually the rebels?</p><p>PLEITGEN: Well, not so far. And it sort of comes out of left field, doesn't it? I mean so far the U.S. is saying that all of their evidence, all of the evidence that Washington has, points to the fact that this was a regime chemical attack that happened there. Of course the big question is going to be, what are the U.S. weapons inspectors going to find out? And today is actually their last day gathering evidence on the ground. They're going to go to the eastern suburbs of Damascus, again, gather evidence and they're leaving tomorrow morning and then they want to brief the U.N. secretary-general as fast as possible.</p><p>And then we'll probably hear, or possibly hear, what sort of chemical agent was used in that alleged attack and that could give conclusions as to who might have done this. Could this have been something that only a military could make or is this something that could be homemade as well, Michaela.</p><p>PEREIRA: They will piece together what they find there in Damascus. Fred Pleitgen, we appreciate that. Thank you so very much.</p><p>Vice President Joe Biden announcing two White House executive orders on gun control. The first will curb the import of military surplus weapons. The other closing a loophole that allows individuals barred from purchasing certain weapons to do so legally by registering them to a trust or corporation without a background check. The NRA, of course, responding by saying, if the Obama administration is serious about reducing gun violence, it should spend more time prosecuting criminals for gun crimes.</p><p>HARLOW: Meantime, the Justice Department announcing that it will not challenge state laws in Colorado and Washington allowing people to grow, use and buy marijuana. The ruling gives state officials a green light, pretty much, to regulate marijuana use on their own, not on a federal level. Now, this could set the stage for even more states to make pot legal. The feds will now focus their attention, they say, on distribution of marijuana to minors, also on preventing revenues from going to various criminal enterprises. A big move there.</p><p>PEREIRA: A big story here.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PEREIRA: The NFL agreeing to settle a lawsuit with thousands of former players over concussion related brain injuries. The league setting aside $765 million. Most of it is compensation for retired players who suffered brain injuries and for the families of those who died. They're also going to put money towards base line medical exams and much needed research.</p><p>HARLOW: And a new warning added to the bottle caps of Tylenol. You're going to be seeing this soon. Manufacturer Johnson &amp; Johnson will warn of the risk of taking too much Tylenol. Overdoses of acetaminophen, that's the main drug in Tylenol, has been the leading cause of sudden liver failure in the United States for more than a decade now. Five hundred people die a year from taking too much acetaminophen. The warning labels will be in stores in October.</p><p>PEREIRA: Well, her dream of winning the U.S. Open is over for this year, at least. Seventeen-year-old Victoria Duval, no doubt, is still the darling of this year's tournament. The young American lost in straight sets last night to Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia. You'll recall that Duval scored a massive upset in her first round match beating the 2011 Open champion, but it was really a bit of heartbreak for her because I know she had sights set on much higher.</p><p>HARLOW: You got to meet her.</p><p>PEREIRA: I did. I got to meet the whole family.</p><p>HARLOW: Was she just a joy?</p><p>PEREIRA: She's a delight.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PEREIRA: She describes herself as a goofy girl. She's 17 years old and she's having a whole lot of fun. And when you have fun at your job --</p><p>HARLOW: That's the best thing.</p><p>PEREIRA: Well, come on, look at us.</p><p>HARLOW: She's got many years ahead. Many years ahead.</p><p>PEREIRA: She really does. And hopefully many U.S. Opens ahead, too.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes, absolutely. Very cool.</p><p>All right, well, coming up, folks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We do work hard and they only pay us $7.35 and that's not right.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Thousands of fast food workers on strike. Their fight for a better way of life.</p><p>PEREIRA: And ahead, how a couple of kittens shut down New York's subway service for hours. We'll have that when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PEREIRA: Welcome back to EARLY START.</p><p>Prosecutors in the Aaron Hernandez case say a cousin of the former NFL star could be the key witness against him, but Tanya Singleton is refusing to talk. She is sitting in jail on a contempt charge, even though she's been offered immunity. Authorities say she may have received a firsthand account of that murder that Hernandez is charged with from one of his alleged accomplice. Hernandez is scheduled to be arraigned on murder and weapons charges next week.</p><p>HARLOW: Meantime, new charges in the Boston bombing case. A classmate of suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev indicted on two counts for lying to investigators. Police say this man, 19-year-old Robel Phillipos, and two others went into the suspect's dormitory just days after the bombing. They're accused of removing a laptop and a backpack. Information police say that Phillipos hid from them. He faces up to eight years in prison on each count.</p><p>PEREIRA: Months before his death, Michael Jackson apparently begged for the drug that would eventually kill him. That's according to a nurse practitioner who testified in the Jackson family's wrongful death case against concert promoter AEG Live. Cherlyn Lee says she warned Jackson against using the powerful anesthetic, Propofol. Just months later, his family alleges Dr. Conrad Murray was brought in by AEG. Murray, as you know, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Michael Jackson's death.</p><p>HARLOW: And a lawyer for Army Private Bradley Manning says he is doing well at the military prison at Ft. Leavenworth. That's in Kansas. David Coombs says he spoke Wednesday with his client who now prefers to be called Chelsea Manning. He says that Manning has already made some new friends at the prison. Manning's attorney also said that he will soon travel to Leavenworth to meet with the prison's medical staff in hopes that they will allow his client to receive hormone therapy.</p><p>PEREIRA: Investigators still trying to figure out exactly what caused an oil rig explosion in Texas earlier this week. Officials say workers were drilling on the rig near Victoria, Texas, when something went horribly wrong and it burst into flames. Fortunately, all of the workers managed to make it to safety.</p><p>HARLOW: Fast food nation slowing a bit. Thousands of employees from the major chains walk off the job in a nationwide protest. It's part of a growing campaign for better pay in their industry. CNN's Erin McPike spoke to some of the demonstrators who are asking, can I get a living wage with that?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do we want?</p><p>CROWD: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When do we want it?</p><p>CROWD: Now.</p><p>ERIN MCPIKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Fast food workers took to the streets this morning to strike in dozens of cities, from Hartford, Connecticut, to Memphis, Tennessee, and all the way to Berkeley, California.</p><p>CROWD: Fighting (ph) for more money.</p><p>MCPIKE: More than the federal minimum wage many of them earn, $7.35 an hour, which works out to about $15,000 a year for those who can clock 40-hour workweeks. CHARLES EDEN, (INAUDIBLE) WORKER: And it's just like really stress. It was like a really hard job. And we really do work hard. And they only pay us $7.35 and that's not right.</p><p>MCPIKE: So Charles and his co-workers want to form a union. They're asking $15 an hour to flip burgers and take your lunch money.</p><p>CROWD: (INAUDIBLE), wait a minute, let me put something (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCPIKE (on camera): The National Restaurant Association says paying workers more could mean that you pay more for your Big Mac. They also say that only 5 percent of workers earn the minimum wage and those are mostly teenagers and part timers.</p><p>ANGELO AMADOR, NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION: As we're coming from - coming out of the recession, we should be looking at way of creating more jobs and increasing the economy, growing the economy, not adding more burdens to small businesses.</p><p>MCPIKE: And the Conservative Employment Policies Institute argues higher wages would lead to fewer jobs for humans. Then again, fast food companies are turning profits. McDonald's pocketed $5.5 billion last year that it turned over to its shareholders, not the small business owners who run the franchises or the workers who staff them.</p><p>Erin McPike, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PEREIRA: Yes. We were talking - Poppy and I were talking -</p><p>HARLOW: Just talking about that.</p><p>PEREIRA: About the importance of getting support for those folks.</p><p>HARLOW: Of this discussion.</p><p>PEREIRA: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PEREIRA: All right, moving on. We want to talk about something that New Yorkers are used to seeing a lot on the subway tracks.</p><p>HARLOW: Michaela's never seen a rat yet.</p><p>PEREIRA: I'm traumatized by the prospect of seeing a r-a-t on the subway tracks.</p><p>HARLOW: These are ready.</p><p>PEREIRA: These are much cuter, what was spotted. Two kittens were spotted on a Brooklyn station on Thursday. In fact, they shut down subway service for nearly two hours as transit workers searched for those little felines. And, boy, that did not sit well with some of the travelers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a waste of money. They could have been doing something else. It's a waste of money. But that's the MTA for you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PEREIRA: The kittens, you'll be happy to know, were eventually found and they were rescued from the tracks.</p><p>HARLOW: Oh.</p><p>PEREIRA: And I also learned another thing, that people that ride the subways frequently are called what?</p><p>HARLOW: Strap hangers.</p><p>PEREIRA: It's because of the strap you hang on to?</p><p>HARLOW: Apparently, but there are no straps on the trains anymore.</p><p>PEREIRA: Not any more. This West Coast girl has so much to learn.</p><p>HARLOW: So much to learn.</p><p>PEREIRA: Teach me, Poppy.</p><p>HARLOW: Coming up.</p><p>PEREIRA: Teach me.</p><p>HARLOW: We'll go find a rat in the subway after the show.</p><p>PEREIRA: No thank you.</p><p>HARLOW: OK.</p><p>All right, coming up, investigators fighting over Foursquare. Why your mobile check-ins are worth big bucks. Money time is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW: Good morning, New York City. Man, you know summer is ending when it's black outside still at this hour. No sunrise for you yet, but --</p><p>PEREIRA: But she's resolute. Look at her standing there strong.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes, Lady Liberty. Good morning, New York City. Welcome back to EARLY START, everyone.</p><p>PEREIRA: It is money time. Let's count our pennies with Christine Romans. She is here.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, HOST, CNN'S \"YOUR MONEY\": Good morning.</p><p>HARLOW: Good morning.</p><p>PEREIRA: Hopefully some good news on this Friday.</p><p>ROMANS: You had a little tease about, you know -</p><p>HARLOW: Foursquare.</p><p>ROMANS: Foursquare, right?</p><p>PEREIRA: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: You know, and location, location, location. Big tech companies want - they want location services.</p><p>HARLOW: Totally.</p><p>ROMANS: And we were watching very closely all the reports about Foursquare and who they were talking to this morning. A really interesting report from Bloomberg that Microsoft is considering an investment in Foursquare. Has been discussing it with them for some time.</p><p>PEREIRA: Oooh.</p><p>HARLOW: Wow.</p><p>ROMANS: They're in the late stages of talks. But unclear if something's really going to happen.</p><p>But last week I told you about Google. How Google and Foursquare might make sense. So, we'll just watch that space.</p><p>PEREIRA: All right.</p><p>ROMANS: We'll watch that space. Location, like in real estate, politics and in tech, I guess, location's important.</p><p>Watching stock futures this morning. They are higher after two days up now for the Dow. Stronger news on the economy in hopes that a Syria strike might be delayed. That - all of that together boosting investor sentiment. The major markets following the Dow up, all closing higher. And again, futures higher this morning. So maybe you'll have a strong close to the week.</p><p>General Electric getting out of the retail lending business. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting that GE is preparing to spin off one of its most important financial assets. The Unit at GE issues store credit cards for 55 million Americans. So this is one of those business stories that you have right there in your own pocket this morning. GE's U.S. consumer finance business earned $2.2 billion last year. That unit accounts for about 50 billion of the 274 billion loans outstanding by GE Capital. An IPO for the consumer finance business could come as early as next year.</p><p>Now, if you think the next iPhone will boost Apple stock, have you been buying Apple because you think you're bullish on the iPhone? I want to show you some stats here. Apple is expected to announce the newest iPhone at a September 10th event. It may initially boost the stock, the gains might be short lived. Why? In five of the past six years, Apple stock has ultimately been lower a month after the new iPhone was released.</p><p>PEREIRA: This is interesting.</p><p>ROMANS: One analyst tells CNN Money that there's a lot of hoopla with Apple, but soon after the news comes out, there isn't much reason to be excited. Well, they call it, buy on the rumors, sell on the news.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: That's one of those old things in Wall Street, right, that you buy it up and then when something actually happens, now people will start to take the profits.</p><p>PEREIRA: Interesting.</p><p>HARLOW: And some of the changes are sort of arguably incremental at this point.</p><p>PEREIRA: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: Absolutely. I'm going to be anxious to see if there's this fingerprint technology.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>ROMANS: That's what I want to see happen in that iPhone. But we'll see.</p><p>PEREIRA: September 10th on my calendar.</p><p>ROMANS: And, listen another - I know.</p><p>And another big - another big story we're following.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: So you've heard of the fast food protests yesterday.</p><p>PEREIRA: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: But there's also a living wage bill expected to reach the desk today of Washington, D.C.'s mayor, Vincent Gray. That legislation would force the retailers, the big box stores, occupying more than 75,000 square feet, or their parent companies that gross $1 billion or more, they would have to pay their employees a minimum wage of $12.50 an hour. The current rate in D.C. is $8.25. And as you know, you know, thousands of fast food employees hit the streets. Sixty cities to strike, aiming to boost their hourly pay to $15 from the current federal minimum wage of $7.25.</p><p>I think you're at the beginning of this discussion about the minimum wage. HARLOW: We were just talking about that.</p><p>ROMANS: You're just at the beginning because so many people - look, these jobs for many people - for some were always a career, but for many people they were a steppingstone to something else.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: There's not a lot else out there and so you've got 20 -- the average age of a fast food worker, 29. You've got people paying off student loans who are working at big box retailers. There is going to be more discussion about this and we'll have to talk about it. Does it mean higher pay for what we buy? Does it mean maybe a push to automate and you start to lose some of those jobs?</p><p>PEREIRA: Well, it's important -</p><p>ROMANS: We're at the beginning of this conversation.</p><p>PEREIRA: If you're trying to support a family, it's near impossible to survive on that amount.</p><p>HARLOW: And as we were talking about too, it's also about self-esteem and confidence and being able to provide.</p><p>PEREIRA: Yes, this sure is.</p><p>HARLOW: It's an important discussion and it's all unfolding right now.</p><p>PEREIRA: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: Absolutely.</p><p>PEREIRA: All right, Christine Romans, thanks so much.</p><p>ROMANS: You're welcome.</p><p>PEREIRA: We're going to take a short break. We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW: Striking Syria.

I'm Poppy Harlow. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PEREIRA: And I'm Michaela Pereira. It is Friday, and aren't we glad of that, August 30th. It is 5:00 a.m. in the East. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HARLOW: And up first, will the United States go it alone when it comes to a potential military strike in Syria? It may have to. Now that Britain has opted out, America's staunchest ally voting against military action. Prime Minister David Cameron may not like it, but accepted the vote by parliament saying the people have spoken. It comes as President Obama briefs congressional leaders on Syria and U.S. intelligence suggests the Assad regime was preparing for a massive chemical attack. Here's our Dana Bash. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): CNN is told top Obama officials insisted to lawmakers on the Thursday night conference call, they have no doubt Bashar Assad's regime in Syria was behind deadly chemical attacks there. Secretaries of state, defense and others back that up by revealing to lawmakers that the U.S. intercepted communications from a high-level Syrian official which clearly indicates they were responsible for these weapons. That according to Congressman Eliot Engel, who participated in the call.</p><p>Though Obama officials insisted no decisions have been made on military action against Syria, CNN is also told they privately made clear to lawmakers that chemical weapons in Syria is such a threat, the U.S. could engage with or without support from critical allies like Great Britain. </p><p>One key GOP senator, Bob Corker, emerged from briefings Thursday announcing support for what he called \"surgical, proportional military strikes given the strong evidence of the Assad regime's continued use of chemical warfare.\" Democratic Senate Foreign Relations Chair Bob Menendez reaffirmed his support too, says, \"a decisive and consequential U.S. response is justified and warranted.\" Others argue the president still has to come before Congress and the American people before he acts.  REP. HOWARD \"BUCK\" MCKEON, (R) CALIFORNIA: It's up to the president to sell this to the American people and pass it (ph). </p><p>BASH: Dana Bash, CNN, Washington. </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PEREIRA: All right, we have Fred Pleitgen in Libya or Lebanon, rather. He's in Beirut this morning. </p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PEREIRA: And we're going to get some developments from him from the Syrian - about the Syrian capital, how things are standing right now. We'll get to him a little later in our broadcast. </p><p>HARLOW: Yes, he's been in Syria doing incredible reporting through all this. </p><p>PEREIRA: Really incredible.</p><p>HARLOW: So we'll bring you the latest from Fred live as soon as we have him. </p><p>Meantime, a new report in \"The Washington Post\" sheds some light on just how much bang the United States is getting for its so-called spying bucks. The report says that Washington will spend, get this, more than $52 billion this year on intelligence, going to things like paying CIA agents and other analysts. But it also says that the United States still has some blind spots in the world, like Pakistan. Spies, of course, don't know much about how secure things are in Pakistan. North Korea, another one. Its missiles and even its leaders are mysteries still, this report says. \"The Post\" used information from NSA leaker Edward Snowden for this latest report. </p><p>PEREIRA: Well, some progress. Slowly but surely crews are making progress fighting that enormous wildfire that's in and around Yosemite National Park. Favorable weather conditions have actually helped them keep the fire burning deeper into the park and encroaching on some of those really popular tourist areas. </p><p>Let's give you an update. The fire has burned so far nearly 200,000 acres. It's at 32 percent containment right now. And this is a really shocking figure, I think, to many. Officials are estimating the cost to date to fight one of the largest fire in California's history, $47 million. This is a concern because there have been so many other fires. It's been a bad fire season. </p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PEREIRA: It was predicted early on this year that this year would be a bad fire season. And it's turning out just to be so. </p><p>HARLOW: It's been horrific and it's interesting this fire, and I want to bring Indra Petersons in to talk about it, but this fire seems like it has just taken so long to even get to 30 percent containment.  PEREIRA: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: So the weather, we what to know what factor that has. </p><p>Indra, what can you tell us.</p><p>INDRA PETERSONS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Yes, I mean it's hard to believe, when you guys talk about how big this fire is -</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PETERSONS: It's literally larger than New York City. So that puts it in perspective. And I actually put up here the top five fires here. If you want to see, notice, it's now the top five for California. The biggest on still Cedar Fire, everyone remembers, about a decade ago in San Diego. </p><p>But speaking of the weather, it's actually good. So that's the one thing that's helping them. Again, it is the steep terrain in the area. The numbers look good out there. The winds, only about five to 10 miles per hour. Seventy-seven degrees is their high. Some hints for moisture in the afternoon producing a possible thunderstorm. But even that pretty low, again, it's just this terrain. It is so steep in the area. It's so difficult for firefighters to get in there and combat those flames. So, unfortunately, they're still dealing with that. </p><p>In the Midwest is actually - we're still seeing that heat today. I mean look at these temperatures. We're actually seeing the heat spread even farther south. Oklahoma City, 10 degrees above normal. But Des Moines today expected to break a record, 18 degrees above normal. </p><p>Want to take you forward in time. Relief is in the forecast. You can see by tomorrow, temperatures starting to go down as the cold front makes its way through. But Saturday in through Sunday is when you're really going to see that big change and see those temperatures go back to where we'd like to see them. We'll see a lot more 70s and 80s in that forecast.</p><p>Unfortunately, that cold front is good news for them as far as temperatures. But for a lot of us, as we go through Labor Day weekend, it does. And we're going to watch a series of cold front moves through the area and that's going to mean some chances for rain. So by Sunday especially in through Monday, that's Labor Day, we're going to watch those two cold fronts merge and see a lot of rain and all the way in the northeast, all the way into the mid-Atlantic as well. So, rain.</p><p>HARLOW: All right. Well, it's been a nice week. </p><p>PETERSONS: Exactly. I like that attitude.</p><p>PEREIRA: (INAUDIBLE). It's Labor Day weekend. </p><p>HARLOW: I know.</p><p>PEREIRA: A lot of people are taking it off and want to -</p><p>HARLOW: But Indra was -</p><p>PETERSONS: I'm going with Poppy on this one. </p><p>PEREIRA: You're not going to help me out?</p><p>PETERSONS: Sorry.</p><p>HARLOW: Indra was telling me earlier, you've got to just make the best of it. Make the best of it.</p><p>PEREIRA: That's true. She's very positive. </p><p>PETERSONS: Thank you.</p><p>PEREIRA: All right, we want to turn back to our top story of Syria, a crisis there as the world waits for President Obama to react. The Syrians, however, now claiming that they have proof that the rebels were behind the chemical weapons attack. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is monitoring developments for us in the Syrian capital. He is live in Beirut this morning. </p><p>We want to find out what you're hearing about this. </p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this was apparently the defense minister of Syria, Michaela, and he was in a phone call with the defense minister of Iran where he said that they had evidence that apparently rebels had unleashed chemical gases in the suburbs of Damascus. Of course, this is completely contrary to what the U.S. is saying and also what many others are saying as well where they say that it was in fact the Syrian government that's behind all this. But the Syrian regime is now saying that it was the rebels who did all of this. Also, with a very strong statement, Bashar al-Assad came out himself as well late yesterday saying that if the Syrians are attacked, that they would retaliate with any means that they have. </p><p>I want to tell you a little bit about the mood in Damascus as well because I'm hearing from a lot of people there that there are many people who are nervous, they're buying additional food, they're making sure that they're stocked up. A lot of people have actually come over here to Lebanon. It's not like it's a big exodus or something, but there are many people who are saying we're going to playing it safe, we're going to bring our families out of the country and wait and see if America strikes. </p><p>And also, the regime is sending a lot of people, sort of propaganda people, out on the ground in Damascus waving Syrian flags, honking their horns, making the people prepared for what they believe could be an American attack. </p><p>Michaela.</p><p>PEREIRA: Hey, are you getting any word on how the U.S. is reacting to this claim from Syria that it was actually the rebels? </p><p>PLEITGEN: Well, not so far. And it sort of comes out of left field, doesn't it? I mean so far the U.S. is saying that all of their evidence, all of the evidence that Washington has, points to the fact that this was a regime chemical attack that happened there. Of course the big question is going to be, what are the U.S. weapons inspectors going to find out? And today is actually their last day gathering evidence on the ground. They're going to go to the eastern suburbs of Damascus, again, gather evidence and they're leaving tomorrow morning and then they want to brief the U.N. secretary-general as fast as possible. </p><p>And then we'll probably hear, or possibly hear, what sort of chemical agent was used in that alleged attack and that could give conclusions as to who might have done this. Could this have been something that only a military could make or is this something that could be homemade as well, Michaela.</p><p>PEREIRA: They will piece together what they find there in Damascus. Fred Pleitgen, we appreciate that. Thank you so very much. </p><p>Vice President Joe Biden announcing two White House executive orders on gun control. The first will curb the import of military surplus weapons. The other closing a loophole that allows individuals barred from purchasing certain weapons to do so legally by registering them to a trust or corporation without a background check. The NRA, of course, responding by saying, if the Obama administration is serious about reducing gun violence, it should spend more time prosecuting criminals for gun crimes. </p><p>HARLOW: Meantime, the Justice Department announcing that it will not challenge state laws in Colorado and Washington allowing people to grow, use and buy marijuana. The ruling gives state officials a green light, pretty much, to regulate marijuana use on their own, not on a federal level. Now, this could set the stage for even more states to make pot legal. The feds will now focus their attention, they say, on distribution of marijuana to minors, also on preventing revenues from going to various criminal enterprises. A big move there. </p><p>PEREIRA: A big story here. </p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PEREIRA: The NFL agreeing to settle a lawsuit with thousands of former players over concussion related brain injuries. The league setting aside $765 million. Most of it is compensation for retired players who suffered brain injuries and for the families of those who died. They're also going to put money towards base line medical exams and much needed research.</p><p>HARLOW: And a new warning added to the bottle caps of Tylenol. You're going to be seeing this soon. Manufacturer Johnson &amp; Johnson will warn of the risk of taking too much Tylenol. Overdoses of acetaminophen, that's the main drug in Tylenol, has been the leading cause of sudden liver failure in the United States for more than a decade now. Five hundred people die a year from taking too much acetaminophen. The warning labels will be in stores in October. </p><p>PEREIRA: Well, her dream of winning the U.S. Open is over for this year, at least. Seventeen-year-old Victoria Duval, no doubt, is still the darling of this year's tournament. The young American lost in straight sets last night to Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia. You'll recall that Duval scored a massive upset in her first round match beating the 2011 Open champion, but it was really a bit of heartbreak for her because I know she had sights set on much higher. </p><p>HARLOW: You got to meet her.</p><p>PEREIRA: I did. I got to meet the whole family.</p><p>HARLOW: Was she just a joy?</p><p>PEREIRA: She's a delight. </p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PEREIRA: She describes herself as a goofy girl. She's 17 years old and she's having a whole lot of fun. And when you have fun at your job -- </p><p>HARLOW: That's the best thing. </p><p>PEREIRA: Well, come on, look at us.</p><p>HARLOW: She's got many years ahead. Many years ahead.</p><p>PEREIRA: She really does. And hopefully many U.S. Opens ahead, too. </p><p>HARLOW: Yes, absolutely. Very cool. </p><p>All right, well, coming up, folks. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We do work hard and they only pay us $7.35 and that's not right. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Thousands of fast food workers on strike. Their fight for a better way of life. </p><p>PEREIRA: And ahead, how a couple of kittens shut down New York's subway service for hours. We'll have that when we come back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>PEREIRA: Welcome back to EARLY START. </p><p>Prosecutors in the Aaron Hernandez case say a cousin of the former NFL star could be the key witness against him, but Tanya Singleton is refusing to talk. She is sitting in jail on a contempt charge, even though she's been offered immunity. Authorities say she may have received a firsthand account of that murder that Hernandez is charged with from one of his alleged accomplice. Hernandez is scheduled to be arraigned on murder and weapons charges next week. </p><p>HARLOW: Meantime, new charges in the Boston bombing case. A classmate of suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev indicted on two counts for lying to investigators. Police say this man, 19-year-old Robel Phillipos, and two others went into the suspect's dormitory just days after the bombing. They're accused of removing a laptop and a backpack. Information police say that Phillipos hid from them. He faces up to eight years in prison on each count. </p><p>PEREIRA: Months before his death, Michael Jackson apparently begged for the drug that would eventually kill him. That's according to a nurse practitioner who testified in the Jackson family's wrongful death case against concert promoter AEG Live. Cherlyn Lee says she warned Jackson against using the powerful anesthetic, Propofol. Just months later, his family alleges Dr. Conrad Murray was brought in by AEG. Murray, as you know, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Michael Jackson's death. </p><p>HARLOW: And a lawyer for Army Private Bradley Manning says he is doing well at the military prison at Ft. Leavenworth. That's in Kansas. David Coombs says he spoke Wednesday with his client who now prefers to be called Chelsea Manning. He says that Manning has already made some new friends at the prison. Manning's attorney also said that he will soon travel to Leavenworth to meet with the prison's medical staff in hopes that they will allow his client to receive hormone therapy. </p><p>PEREIRA: Investigators still trying to figure out exactly what caused an oil rig explosion in Texas earlier this week. Officials say workers were drilling on the rig near Victoria, Texas, when something went horribly wrong and it burst into flames. Fortunately, all of the workers managed to make it to safety. </p><p>HARLOW: Fast food nation slowing a bit. Thousands of employees from the major chains walk off the job in a nationwide protest. It's part of a growing campaign for better pay in their industry. CNN's Erin McPike spoke to some of the demonstrators who are asking, can I get a living wage with that? </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do we want?</p><p>CROWD: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When do we want it?</p><p>CROWD: Now.</p><p>ERIN MCPIKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Fast food workers took to the streets this morning to strike in dozens of cities, from Hartford, Connecticut, to Memphis, Tennessee, and all the way to Berkeley, California. </p><p>CROWD: Fighting (ph) for more money.</p><p>MCPIKE: More than the federal minimum wage many of them earn, $7.35 an hour, which works out to about $15,000 a year for those who can clock 40-hour workweeks.  CHARLES EDEN, (INAUDIBLE) WORKER: And it's just like really stress. It was like a really hard job. And we really do work hard. And they only pay us $7.35 and that's not right. </p><p>MCPIKE: So Charles and his co-workers want to form a union. They're asking $15 an hour to flip burgers and take your lunch money. </p><p>CROWD: (INAUDIBLE), wait a minute, let me put something (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCPIKE (on camera): The National Restaurant Association says paying workers more could mean that you pay more for your Big Mac. They also say that only 5 percent of workers earn the minimum wage and those are mostly teenagers and part timers. </p><p>ANGELO AMADOR, NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION: As we're coming from - coming out of the recession, we should be looking at way of creating more jobs and increasing the economy, growing the economy, not adding more burdens to small businesses. </p><p>MCPIKE: And the Conservative Employment Policies Institute argues higher wages would lead to fewer jobs for humans. Then again, fast food companies are turning profits. McDonald's pocketed $5.5 billion last year that it turned over to its shareholders, not the small business owners who run the franchises or the workers who staff them. </p><p>Erin McPike, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PEREIRA: Yes. We were talking - Poppy and I were talking -</p><p>HARLOW: Just talking about that.</p><p>PEREIRA: About the importance of getting support for those folks. </p><p>HARLOW: Of this discussion.</p><p>PEREIRA: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PEREIRA: All right, moving on. We want to talk about something that New Yorkers are used to seeing a lot on the subway tracks. </p><p>HARLOW: Michaela's never seen a rat yet. </p><p>PEREIRA: I'm traumatized by the prospect of seeing a r-a-t on the subway tracks.</p><p>HARLOW: These are ready.</p><p>PEREIRA: These are much cuter, what was spotted. Two kittens were spotted on a Brooklyn station on Thursday. In fact, they shut down subway service for nearly two hours as transit workers searched for those little felines. And, boy, that did not sit well with some of the travelers.  (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a waste of money. They could have been doing something else. It's a waste of money. But that's the MTA for you. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PEREIRA: The kittens, you'll be happy to know, were eventually found and they were rescued from the tracks. </p><p>HARLOW: Oh.</p><p>PEREIRA: And I also learned another thing, that people that ride the subways frequently are called what? </p><p>HARLOW: Strap hangers. </p><p>PEREIRA: It's because of the strap you hang on to? </p><p>HARLOW: Apparently, but there are no straps on the trains anymore. </p><p>PEREIRA: Not any more. This West Coast girl has so much to learn. </p><p>HARLOW: So much to learn.</p><p>PEREIRA: Teach me, Poppy. </p><p>HARLOW: Coming up.</p><p>PEREIRA: Teach me.</p><p>HARLOW: We'll go find a rat in the subway after the show. </p><p>PEREIRA: No thank you.</p><p>HARLOW: OK.</p><p>All right, coming up, investigators fighting over Foursquare. Why your mobile check-ins are worth big bucks. Money time is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW: Good morning, New York City. Man, you know summer is ending when it's black outside still at this hour. No sunrise for you yet, but -- </p><p>PEREIRA: But she's resolute. Look at her standing there strong. </p><p>HARLOW: Yes, Lady Liberty. Good morning, New York City. Welcome back to EARLY START, everyone.</p><p>PEREIRA: It is money time. Let's count our pennies with Christine Romans. She is here. </p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, HOST, CNN'S \"YOUR MONEY\": Good morning.</p><p>HARLOW: Good morning.</p><p>PEREIRA: Hopefully some good news on this Friday. </p><p>ROMANS: You had a little tease about, you know -</p><p>HARLOW: Foursquare.</p><p>ROMANS: Foursquare, right?</p><p>PEREIRA: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: You know, and location, location, location. Big tech companies want - they want location services. </p><p>HARLOW: Totally.</p><p>ROMANS: And we were watching very closely all the reports about Foursquare and who they were talking to this morning. A really interesting report from Bloomberg that Microsoft is considering an investment in Foursquare. Has been discussing it with them for some time. </p><p>PEREIRA: Oooh.</p><p>HARLOW: Wow.</p><p>ROMANS: They're in the late stages of talks. But unclear if something's really going to happen.</p><p>But last week I told you about Google. How Google and Foursquare might make sense. So, we'll just watch that space. </p><p>PEREIRA: All right.</p><p>ROMANS: We'll watch that space. Location, like in real estate, politics and in tech, I guess, location's important.</p><p>Watching stock futures this morning. They are higher after two days up now for the Dow. Stronger news on the economy in hopes that a Syria strike might be delayed. That - all of that together boosting investor sentiment. The major markets following the Dow up, all closing higher. And again, futures higher this morning. So maybe you'll have a strong close to the week.</p><p>General Electric getting out of the retail lending business. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting that GE is preparing to spin off one of its most important financial assets. The Unit at GE issues store credit cards for 55 million Americans. So this is one of those business stories that you have right there in your own pocket this morning. GE's U.S. consumer finance business earned $2.2 billion last year. That unit accounts for about 50 billion of the 274 billion loans outstanding by GE Capital. An IPO for the consumer finance business could come as early as next year. </p><p>Now, if you think the next iPhone will boost Apple stock, have you been buying Apple because you think you're bullish on the iPhone? I want to show you some stats here. Apple is expected to announce the newest iPhone at a September 10th event. It may initially boost the stock, the gains might be short lived. Why? In five of the past six years, Apple stock has ultimately been lower a month after the new iPhone was released. </p><p>PEREIRA: This is interesting. </p><p>ROMANS: One analyst tells CNN Money that there's a lot of hoopla with Apple, but soon after the news comes out, there isn't much reason to be excited. Well, they call it, buy on the rumors, sell on the news.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: That's one of those old things in Wall Street, right, that you buy it up and then when something actually happens, now people will start to take the profits. </p><p>PEREIRA: Interesting.</p><p>HARLOW: And some of the changes are sort of arguably incremental at this point. </p><p>PEREIRA: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: Absolutely. I'm going to be anxious to see if there's this fingerprint technology. </p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>ROMANS: That's what I want to see happen in that iPhone. But we'll see.</p><p>PEREIRA: September 10th on my calendar.</p><p>ROMANS: And, listen another - I know. </p><p>And another big - another big story we're following.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: So you've heard of the fast food protests yesterday.</p><p>PEREIRA: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: But there's also a living wage bill expected to reach the desk today of Washington, D.C.'s mayor, Vincent Gray. That legislation would force the retailers, the big box stores, occupying more than 75,000 square feet, or their parent companies that gross $1 billion or more, they would have to pay their employees a minimum wage of $12.50 an hour. The current rate in D.C. is $8.25. And as you know, you know, thousands of fast food employees hit the streets. Sixty cities to strike, aiming to boost their hourly pay to $15 from the current federal minimum wage of $7.25.</p><p>I think you're at the beginning of this discussion about the minimum wage.  HARLOW: We were just talking about that. </p><p>ROMANS: You're just at the beginning because so many people - look, these jobs for many people - for some were always a career, but for many people they were a steppingstone to something else. </p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: There's not a lot else out there and so you've got 20 -- the average age of a fast food worker, 29. You've got people paying off student loans who are working at big box retailers. There is going to be more discussion about this and we'll have to talk about it. Does it mean higher pay for what we buy? Does it mean maybe a push to automate and you start to lose some of those jobs? </p><p>PEREIRA: Well, it's important -</p><p>ROMANS: We're at the beginning of this conversation. </p><p>PEREIRA: If you're trying to support a family, it's near impossible to survive on that amount. </p><p>HARLOW: And as we were talking about too, it's also about self-esteem and confidence and being able to provide. </p><p>PEREIRA: Yes, this sure is.</p><p>HARLOW: It's an important discussion and it's all unfolding right now. </p><p>PEREIRA: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: Absolutely.</p><p>PEREIRA: All right, Christine Romans, thanks so much. </p><p>ROMANS: You're welcome.</p><p>PEREIRA: We're going to take a short break. We'll be right back. </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>HARLOW: Striking Syria.

I'm Poppy Harlow.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PEREIRA: And I'm Michaela Pereira. It is Friday, and aren't we glad of that, August 30th. It is 5:00 a.m. in the East.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HARLOW: And up first, will the United States go it alone when it comes to a potential military strike in Syria? It may have to. Now that Britain has opted out, America's staunchest ally voting against military action. Prime Minister David Cameron may not like it, but accepted the vote by parliament saying the people have spoken. It comes as <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>briefs congressional leaders on Syria and U.S. intelligence suggests the Assad regime was preparing for a massive chemical attack. Here's our Dana Bash.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DANA BASH, CNN CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): CNN is told top Obama officials insisted to lawmakers on the Thursday night conference call, they have no doubt <person><nameText>Bashar Assad's </nameText></person>regime in Syria was behind deadly chemical attacks there. Secretaries of state, defense and others back that up by revealing to lawmakers that the U.S. intercepted communications from a high-level Syrian official which clearly indicates they were responsible for these weapons. That according to Congressman Eliot Engel, who participated in the call.</p><p>Though Obama officials insisted no decisions have been made on military action against Syria, CNN is also told they privately made clear to lawmakers that chemical weapons in Syria is such a threat, the U.S. could engage with or without support from critical allies like Great Britain.</p><p>One key GOP senator, Bob Corker, emerged from briefings Thursday announcing support for what he called \"surgical, proportional military strikes given the strong evidence of the Assad regime's continued use of chemical warfare.\" Democratic Senate Foreign Relations Chair Bob Menendez reaffirmed his support too, says, \"a decisive and consequential U.S. response is justified and warranted.\" Others argue the president still has to come before Congress and the American people before he acts. REP. HOWARD \"BUCK\" MCKEON, (R) CALIFORNIA: It's up to the president to sell this to the American people and pass it (ph).</p><p>BASH: Dana Bash, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PEREIRA: All right, we have Fred Pleitgen in Libya or Lebanon, rather. He's in Beirut this morning.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PEREIRA: And we're going to get some developments from him from the Syrian - about the Syrian capital, how things are standing right now. We'll get to him a little later in our broadcast.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes, he's been in Syria doing incredible reporting through all this.</p><p>PEREIRA: Really incredible.</p><p>HARLOW: So we'll bring you the latest from Fred live as soon as we have him.</p><p>Meantime, a new report in \"The Washington Post\" sheds some light on just how much bang the United States is getting for its so-called spying bucks. The report says that Washington will spend, get this, more than $52 billion this year on intelligence, going to things like paying CIA agents and other analysts. But it also says that the United States still has some blind spots in the world, like Pakistan. Spies, of course, don't know much about how secure things are in Pakistan. North Korea, another one. Its missiles and even its leaders are mysteries still, this report says. \"The Post\" used information from NSA leaker Edward Snowden for this latest report.</p><p>PEREIRA: Well, some progress. Slowly but surely crews are making progress fighting that enormous wildfire that's in and around Yosemite National Park. Favorable weather conditions have actually helped them keep the fire burning deeper into the park and encroaching on some of those really popular tourist areas.</p><p>Let's give you an update. The fire has burned so far nearly 200,000 acres. It's at 32 percent containment right now. And this is a really shocking figure, I think, to many. Officials are estimating the cost to date to fight one of the largest fire in California's history, $47 million. This is a concern because there have been so many other fires. It's been a bad fire season.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PEREIRA: It was predicted early on this year that this year would be a bad fire season. And it's turning out just to be so.</p><p>HARLOW: It's been horrific and it's interesting this fire, and I want to bring Indra Petersons in to talk about it, but this fire seems like it has just taken so long to even get to 30 percent containment. PEREIRA: Yes.</p><p>HARLOW: So the weather, we what to know what factor that has.</p><p>Indra, what can you tell us.</p><p>INDRA PETERSONS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: Yes, I mean it's hard to believe, when you guys talk about how big this fire is -</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PETERSONS: It's literally larger than New York City. So that puts it in perspective. And I actually put up here the top five fires here. If you want to see, notice, it's now the top five for California. The biggest on still Cedar Fire, everyone remembers, about a decade ago in San Diego.</p><p>But speaking of the weather, it's actually good. So that's the one thing that's helping them. Again, it is the steep terrain in the area. The numbers look good out there. The winds, only about five to 10 miles per hour. Seventy-seven degrees is their high. Some hints for moisture in the afternoon producing a possible thunderstorm. But even that pretty low, again, it's just this terrain. It is so steep in the area. It's so difficult for firefighters to get in there and combat those flames. So, unfortunately, they're still dealing with that.</p><p>In the Midwest is actually - we're still seeing that heat today. I mean look at these temperatures. We're actually seeing the heat spread even farther south. Oklahoma City, 10 degrees above normal. But Des Moines today expected to break a record, 18 degrees above normal.</p><p>Want to take you forward in time. Relief is in the forecast. You can see by tomorrow, temperatures starting to go down as the cold front makes its way through. But Saturday in through Sunday is when you're really going to see that big change and see those temperatures go back to where we'd like to see them. We'll see a lot more 70s and 80s in that forecast.</p><p>Unfortunately, that cold front is good news for them as far as temperatures. But for a lot of us, as we go through Labor Day weekend, it does. And we're going to watch a series of cold front moves through the area and that's going to mean some chances for rain. So by Sunday especially in through Monday, that's Labor Day, we're going to watch those two cold fronts merge and see a lot of rain and all the way in the northeast, all the way into the mid-Atlantic as well. So, rain.</p><p>HARLOW: All right. Well, it's been a nice week.</p><p>PETERSONS: Exactly. I like that attitude.</p><p>PEREIRA: (INAUDIBLE). It's Labor Day weekend.</p><p>HARLOW: I know.</p><p>PEREIRA: A lot of people are taking it off and want to -</p><p>HARLOW: But Indra was -</p><p>PETERSONS: I'm going with Poppy on this one.</p><p>PEREIRA: You're not going to help me out?</p><p>PETERSONS: Sorry.</p><p>HARLOW: Indra was telling me earlier, you've got to just make the best of it. Make the best of it.</p><p>PEREIRA: That's true. She's very positive.</p><p>PETERSONS: Thank you.</p><p>PEREIRA: All right, we want to turn back to our top story of Syria, a crisis there as the world waits for <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>to react. The Syrians, however, now claiming that they have proof that the rebels were behind the chemical weapons attack. CNN's Fred Pleitgen is monitoring developments for us in the Syrian capital. He is live in Beirut this morning.</p><p>We want to find out what you're hearing about this.</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this was apparently the defense minister of Syria, Michaela, and he was in a phone call with the defense minister of Iran where he said that they had evidence that apparently rebels had unleashed chemical gases in the suburbs of Damascus. Of course, this is completely contrary to what the U.S. is saying and also what many others are saying as well where they say that it was in fact the Syrian government that's behind all this. But the Syrian regime is now saying that it was the rebels who did all of this. Also, with a very strong statement, Bashar al-Assad came out himself as well late yesterday saying that if the Syrians are attacked, that they would retaliate with any means that they have.</p><p>I want to tell you a little bit about the mood in Damascus as well because I'm hearing from a lot of people there that there are many people who are nervous, they're buying additional food, they're making sure that they're stocked up. A lot of people have actually come over here to Lebanon. It's not like it's a big exodus or something, but there are many people who are saying we're going to playing it safe, we're going to bring our families out of the country and wait and see if America strikes.</p><p>And also, the regime is sending a lot of people, sort of propaganda people, out on the ground in Damascus waving Syrian flags, honking their horns, making the people prepared for what they believe could be an American attack.</p><p>Michaela.</p><p>PEREIRA: Hey, are you getting any word on how the U.S. is reacting to this claim from Syria that it was actually the rebels?</p><p>PLEITGEN: Well, not so far. And it sort of comes out of left field, doesn't it? I mean so far the U.S. is saying that all of their evidence, all of the evidence that Washington has, points to the fact that this was a regime chemical attack that happened there. Of course the big question is going to be, what are the U.S. weapons inspectors going to find out? And today is actually their last day gathering evidence on the ground. They're going to go to the eastern suburbs of Damascus, again, gather evidence and they're leaving tomorrow morning and then they want to brief the U.N. secretary-general as fast as possible.</p><p>And then we'll probably hear, or possibly hear, what sort of chemical agent was used in that alleged attack and that could give conclusions as to who might have done this. Could this have been something that only a military could make or is this something that could be homemade as well, Michaela.</p><p>PEREIRA: They will piece together what they find there in Damascus. Fred Pleitgen, we appreciate that. Thank you so very much.</p><p>Vice President Joe Biden announcing two White House executive orders on gun control. The first will curb the import of military surplus weapons. The other closing a loophole that allows individuals barred from purchasing certain weapons to do so legally by registering them to a trust or corporation without a background check. The NRA, of course, responding by saying, if the Obama administration is serious about reducing gun violence, it should spend more time prosecuting criminals for gun crimes.</p><p>HARLOW: Meantime, the Justice Department announcing that it will not challenge state laws in Colorado and Washington allowing people to grow, use and buy marijuana. The ruling gives state officials a green light, pretty much, to regulate marijuana use on their own, not on a federal level. Now, this could set the stage for even more states to make pot legal. The feds will now focus their attention, they say, on distribution of marijuana to minors, also on preventing revenues from going to various criminal enterprises. A big move there.</p><p>PEREIRA: A big story here.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PEREIRA: The NFL agreeing to settle a lawsuit with thousands of former players over concussion related brain injuries. The league setting aside $765 million. Most of it is compensation for retired players who suffered brain injuries and for the families of those who died. They're also going to put money towards base line medical exams and much needed research.</p><p>HARLOW: And a new warning added to the bottle caps of Tylenol. You're going to be seeing this soon. Manufacturer Johnson &amp; Johnson will warn of the risk of taking too much Tylenol. Overdoses of acetaminophen, that's the main drug in Tylenol, has been the leading cause of sudden liver failure in the United States for more than a decade now. Five hundred people die a year from taking too much acetaminophen. The warning labels will be in stores in October.</p><p>PEREIRA: Well, her dream of winning the U.S. Open is over for this year, at least. Seventeen-year-old Victoria Duval, no doubt, is still the darling of this year's tournament. The young American lost in straight sets last night to Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia. You'll recall that Duval scored a massive upset in her first round match beating the 2011 Open champion, but it was really a bit of heartbreak for her because I know she had sights set on much higher.</p><p>HARLOW: You got to meet her.</p><p>PEREIRA: I did. I got to meet the whole family.</p><p>HARLOW: Was she just a joy?</p><p>PEREIRA: She's a delight.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PEREIRA: She describes herself as a goofy girl. She's 17 years old and she's having a whole lot of fun. And when you have fun at your job --</p><p>HARLOW: That's the best thing.</p><p>PEREIRA: Well, come on, look at us.</p><p>HARLOW: She's got many years ahead. Many years ahead.</p><p>PEREIRA: She really does. And hopefully many U.S. Opens ahead, too.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes, absolutely. Very cool.</p><p>All right, well, coming up, folks.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We do work hard and they only pay us $7.35 and that's not right.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HARLOW: Thousands of fast food workers on strike. Their fight for a better way of life.</p><p>PEREIRA: And ahead, how a couple of kittens shut down New York's subway service for hours. We'll have that when we come back.</p><p>PEREIRA: Welcome back to EARLY START.</p><p>Prosecutors in the Aaron Hernandez case say a cousin of the former NFL star could be the key witness against him, but Tanya Singleton is refusing to talk. She is sitting in jail on a contempt charge, even though she's been offered immunity. Authorities say she may have received a firsthand account of that murder that Hernandez is charged with from one of his alleged accomplice. Hernandez is scheduled to be arraigned on murder and weapons charges next week.</p><p>HARLOW: Meantime, new charges in the Boston bombing case. A classmate of suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev indicted on two counts for lying to investigators. Police say this man, 19-year-old Robel Phillipos, and two others went into the suspect's dormitory just days after the bombing. They're accused of removing a laptop and a backpack. Information police say that Phillipos hid from them. He faces up to eight years in prison on each count.</p><p>PEREIRA: Months before his death, Michael Jackson apparently begged for the drug that would eventually kill him. That's according to a nurse practitioner who testified in the Jackson family's wrongful death case against concert promoter AEG Live. Cherlyn Lee says she warned Jackson against using the powerful anesthetic, Propofol. Just months later, his family alleges Dr. Conrad Murray was brought in by AEG. Murray, as you know, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Michael Jackson's death.</p><p>HARLOW: And a lawyer for Army Private Bradley Manning says he is doing well at the military prison at Ft. Leavenworth. That's in Kansas. David Coombs says he spoke Wednesday with his client who now prefers to be called Chelsea Manning. He says that Manning has already made some new friends at the prison. Manning's attorney also said that he will soon travel to Leavenworth to meet with the prison's medical staff in hopes that they will allow his client to receive hormone therapy.</p><p>PEREIRA: Investigators still trying to figure out exactly what caused an oil rig explosion in Texas earlier this week. Officials say workers were drilling on the rig near Victoria, Texas, when something went horribly wrong and it burst into flames. Fortunately, all of the workers managed to make it to safety.</p><p>HARLOW: Fast food nation slowing a bit. Thousands of employees from the major chains walk off the job in a nationwide protest. It's part of a growing campaign for better pay in their industry. CNN's Erin McPike spoke to some of the demonstrators who are asking, can I get a living wage with that?</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What do we want?</p><p>CROWD: (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When do we want it?</p><p>CROWD: Now.</p><p>ERIN MCPIKE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Fast food workers took to the streets this morning to strike in dozens of cities, from Hartford, Connecticut, to Memphis, Tennessee, and all the way to Berkeley, California.</p><p>CROWD: Fighting (ph) for more money.</p><p>MCPIKE: More than the federal minimum wage many of them earn, $7.35 an hour, which works out to about $15,000 a year for those who can clock 40-hour workweeks. CHARLES EDEN, (INAUDIBLE) WORKER: And it's just like really stress. It was like a really hard job. And we really do work hard. And they only pay us $7.35 and that's not right.</p><p>MCPIKE: So Charles and his co-workers want to form a union. They're asking $15 an hour to flip burgers and take your lunch money.</p><p>CROWD: (INAUDIBLE), wait a minute, let me put something (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>MCPIKE (on camera): The National Restaurant Association says paying workers more could mean that you pay more for your Big Mac. They also say that only 5 percent of workers earn the minimum wage and those are mostly teenagers and part timers.</p><p>ANGELO AMADOR, NATIONAL RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION: As we're coming from - coming out of the recession, we should be looking at way of creating more jobs and increasing the economy, growing the economy, not adding more burdens to small businesses.</p><p>MCPIKE: And the Conservative Employment Policies Institute argues higher wages would lead to fewer jobs for humans. Then again, fast food companies are turning profits. McDonald's pocketed $5.5 billion last year that it turned over to its shareholders, not the small business owners who run the franchises or the workers who staff them.</p><p>Erin McPike, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PEREIRA: Yes. We were talking - Poppy and I were talking -</p><p>HARLOW: Just talking about that.</p><p>PEREIRA: About the importance of getting support for those folks.</p><p>HARLOW: Of this discussion.</p><p>PEREIRA: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>PEREIRA: All right, moving on. We want to talk about something that New Yorkers are used to seeing a lot on the subway tracks.</p><p>HARLOW: Michaela's never seen a rat yet.</p><p>PEREIRA: I'm traumatized by the prospect of seeing a r-a-t on the subway tracks.</p><p>HARLOW: These are ready.</p><p>PEREIRA: These are much cuter, what was spotted. Two kittens were spotted on a Brooklyn station on Thursday. In fact, they shut down subway service for nearly two hours as transit workers searched for those little felines. And, boy, that did not sit well with some of the travelers. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It's a waste of money. They could have been doing something else. It's a waste of money. But that's the MTA for you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PEREIRA: The kittens, you'll be happy to know, were eventually found and they were rescued from the tracks.</p><p>HARLOW: Oh.</p><p>PEREIRA: And I also learned another thing, that people that ride the subways frequently are called what?</p><p>HARLOW: Strap hangers.</p><p>PEREIRA: It's because of the strap you hang on to?</p><p>HARLOW: Apparently, but there are no straps on the trains anymore.</p><p>PEREIRA: Not any more. This West Coast girl has so much to learn.</p><p>HARLOW: So much to learn.</p><p>PEREIRA: Teach me, Poppy.</p><p>HARLOW: Coming up.</p><p>PEREIRA: Teach me.</p><p>HARLOW: We'll go find a rat in the subway after the show.</p><p>PEREIRA: No thank you.</p><p>HARLOW: OK.</p><p>All right, coming up, investigators fighting over Foursquare. Why your mobile check-ins are worth big bucks. Money time is next.</p><p>HARLOW: Good morning, New York City. Man, you know summer is ending when it's black outside still at this hour. No sunrise for you yet, but --</p><p>PEREIRA: But she's resolute. Look at her standing there strong.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes, Lady Liberty. Good morning, New York City. Welcome back to EARLY START, everyone.</p><p>PEREIRA: It is money time. Let's count our pennies with Christine Romans. She is here.</p><p>CHRISTINE ROMANS, HOST, CNN'S \"YOUR MONEY\": Good morning.</p><p>HARLOW: Good morning.</p><p>PEREIRA: Hopefully some good news on this Friday.</p><p>ROMANS: You had a little tease about, you know -</p><p>HARLOW: Foursquare.</p><p>ROMANS: Foursquare, right?</p><p>PEREIRA: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: You know, and location, location, location. Big tech companies want - they want location services.</p><p>HARLOW: Totally.</p><p>ROMANS: And we were watching very closely all the reports about Foursquare and who they were talking to this morning. A really interesting report from Bloomberg that Microsoft is considering an investment in Foursquare. Has been discussing it with them for some time.</p><p>PEREIRA: Oooh.</p><p>HARLOW: Wow.</p><p>ROMANS: They're in the late stages of talks. But unclear if something's really going to happen.</p><p>But last week I told you about Google. How Google and Foursquare might make sense. So, we'll just watch that space.</p><p>PEREIRA: All right.</p><p>ROMANS: We'll watch that space. Location, like in real estate, politics and in tech, I guess, location's important.</p><p>Watching stock futures this morning. They are higher after two days up now for the Dow. Stronger news on the economy in hopes that a Syria strike might be delayed. That - all of that together boosting investor sentiment. The major markets following the Dow up, all closing higher. And again, futures higher this morning. So maybe you'll have a strong close to the week.</p><p>General Electric getting out of the retail lending business. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reporting that GE is preparing to spin off one of its most important financial assets. The Unit at GE issues store credit cards for 55 million Americans. So this is one of those business stories that you have right there in your own pocket this morning. GE's U.S. consumer finance business earned $2.2 billion last year. That unit accounts for about 50 billion of the 274 billion loans outstanding by GE Capital. An IPO for the consumer finance business could come as early as next year.</p><p>Now, if you think the next iPhone will boost Apple stock, have you been buying Apple because you think you're bullish on the iPhone? I want to show you some stats here. Apple is expected to announce the newest iPhone at a September 10th event. It may initially boost the stock, the gains might be short lived. Why? In five of the past six years, Apple stock has ultimately been lower a month after the new iPhone was released.</p><p>PEREIRA: This is interesting.</p><p>ROMANS: One analyst tells CNN Money that there's a lot of hoopla with Apple, but soon after the news comes out, there isn't much reason to be excited. Well, they call it, buy on the rumors, sell on the news.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: That's one of those old things in Wall Street, right, that you buy it up and then when something actually happens, now people will start to take the profits.</p><p>PEREIRA: Interesting.</p><p>HARLOW: And some of the changes are sort of arguably incremental at this point.</p><p>PEREIRA: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: Absolutely. I'm going to be anxious to see if there's this fingerprint technology.</p><p>HARLOW: Right.</p><p>ROMANS: That's what I want to see happen in that iPhone. But we'll see.</p><p>PEREIRA: September 10th on my calendar.</p><p>ROMANS: And, listen another - I know.</p><p>And another big - another big story we're following.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: So you've heard of the fast food protests yesterday.</p><p>PEREIRA: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: But there's also a living wage bill expected to reach the desk today of Washington, D.C.'s mayor, Vincent Gray. That legislation would force the retailers, the big box stores, occupying more than 75,000 square feet, or their parent companies that gross $1 billion or more, they would have to pay their employees a minimum wage of $12.50 an hour. The current rate in D.C. is $8.25. And as you know, you know, thousands of fast food employees hit the streets. Sixty cities to strike, aiming to boost their hourly pay to $15 from the current federal minimum wage of $7.25.</p><p>I think you're at the beginning of this discussion about the minimum wage. HARLOW: We were just talking about that.</p><p>ROMANS: You're just at the beginning because so many people - look, these jobs for many people - for some were always a career, but for many people they were a steppingstone to something else.</p><p>HARLOW: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: There's not a lot else out there and so you've got 20 -- the average age of a fast food worker, 29. You've got people paying off student loans who are working at big box retailers. There is going to be more discussion about this and we'll have to talk about it. Does it mean higher pay for what we buy? Does it mean maybe a push to automate and you start to lose some of those jobs?</p><p>PEREIRA: Well, it's important -</p><p>ROMANS: We're at the beginning of this conversation.</p><p>PEREIRA: If you're trying to support a family, it's near impossible to survive on that amount.</p><p>HARLOW: And as we were talking about too, it's also about self-esteem and confidence and being able to provide.</p><p>PEREIRA: Yes, this sure is.</p><p>HARLOW: It's an important discussion and it's all unfolding right now.</p><p>PEREIRA: Yes.</p><p>ROMANS: Absolutely.</p><p>PEREIRA: All right, Christine Romans, thanks so much.</p><p>ROMANS: You're welcome.</p><p>PEREIRA: We're going to take a short break. We'll be right back.</p><p>HARLOW: Striking Syria.

However, it's been a very different story over the last 13 years: value stocks have been trounced by their growth counterparts, underperforming by 39 per cent. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Only once - at the height of the dotcom bubble in the late 1990s - has value underperformed growth by such an amount. Even more striking is the duration of the current run, which is \"by far the longest run on record\", notes Ned Davis Research.</p><p>Year after year over the last decade, predictions of an imminent return to form have been dashed. Similarly, expensive growth stocks have continued to defy the doubters. Remarkably, a portfolio of stocks consisting only of companies trading for \"crazy\" valuations (in this case, stocks trading at more than 10 times their revenues) would have beaten the market over the last decade, according to data from quantitative expert and Alpha Architect money manager Jack Vogel.</p><p>A number of factors are at play. One common explanation has been investors' continued preference for fast-growing tech stocks. The six FANMAG stocks - Facebook, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft, Amazon and Google - now account for about 16 per cent of US stock market capitalisation, notes Research Affiliates, having appreciated nearly tenfold since 2007.</p><h>Valuation gap</h><p> However, tech stocks are only part of the story. Technology companies only account for a small part of the European stock market but the value-growth valuation gap is similarly wide here, last year hitting its widest level in almost two decades. </p><p>According to data from German firm Star Capital, European growth stocks have historically been valued 78 per cent higher than value stocks, but that valuation premium had climbed to 156 per cent by late 2019.</p><p>In most market cycles, the most profitable growth stocks eventually lose their profitability and thus underperform, says Star Capital's Norbert Keimling, but low interest rates mean growth stocks across different sectors have been able to maintain their above-average growth rates and profitability for much longer in the current cycle. Many strategists content that the end result has been an increase in concentration across different industries, with the dominant and most profitable players in each sector taking a larger share of the pie.</p><p>Others contend that value strategies have become too well-known and simply don't work as well as they did in the past. </p><p>Accounting and economic developments are also factors, according to Prof. Baruch Lev of New York University. His 2019 study, Explaining the Recent Failure of Value Investing, finds that value investing has \"generally been unprofitable for almost 30 years, barring a brief resurrection following the dotcom bust\".</p><p>Lev's conclusions are rejected by those who say that, while some value indicators, such as the price-book ratio, may have lost their reliability, this doesn't mean that value investing is dead. Research from Cliff Asness, founder of the $186 billion hedge fund AQR Capital Management, has found that a composite indicator based on many different value ratios is more effective than any one individual ratio. </p><p>Value is not \"permanently broken\" as a strategy, Asness argued in a research note in November. His contention is that the underperformance of value strategies for most of the last decade was \"rational\" because highly-valued growth stocks managed to justify their valuations by continuing to deliver higher earnings, revenues and profit margins. </p><p>For the last two years, however, value has lost for \"irrational\" reasons. \"Value fundamentals have not come in worse over this recent painful period,\" said Asness, but investor sentiment has been such that prices have \"gone the wrong way\". Consequently, if one excludes the late 1990s technology bubble, the \"value of value is the cheapest it's ever been by a fairly decent margin\".</p><h>'Sin a little'</h><p> Asness is wary of trying to time markets, calling it an investing \"sin\", but the relative attractiveness of value stocks meant it was time to \"sin a little\", he said.</p><p>That was echoed earlier this month by another quantitative manager, Research Affiliates' Rob Arnott, in a paper titled Reports of Value's Death May Be Greatly Exaggerated. The paper, co-authored with Duke University finance professor Campbell Harvey, noted that value stocks are now cheaper relative to growth stocks than they have been in 97 per cent of past instances. </p><p>Value stocks are likely to significantly beat their growth counterparts in the coming years, the paper suggested. Indeed, this is likely to be the case even if prices never fully revert to the mean, even if the growth-value valuation gap remains wide relative to historical norms.</p><p>Index fund giant Vanguard also expects US value stocks to rebound over the coming decade, forecasting annualised returns of 6 to 8 per cent, compared to just 2.5 to 4 per cent for US growth stocks.</p><p>Of course, an increased likelihood of elevated long-term returns doesn't mean that value must outperform growth in the short run, admits Rob Arnott, although JP Morgan is hopeful that a turnaround is under way. In a recent report documenting its 2020 outlook, the bank said it believed the \"possible last days of extreme value underperformance are unfolding\". </p><p>Large-cap value stocks started to outperform in the last months of 2019, with \"stresses\" in the initial public offerings (IPO) market - in particular, the pulling of the much-hyped WeWork flotation after investors baulked at attempts to secure an eye-watering $47 billion valuation for the loss-making company - sparking \"increased concern about the proliferation of IPOs with little to no earnings growth\". </p><h>Antitrust revival</h><p> Highly-priced growth stocks may also be at risk from an antitrust revival, cautions JP Morgan. In the US, antitrust investigations have been declining for 50 years but politicians are increasingly calling for more scrutiny of big tech stocks like Facebook, Google and Amazon.</p><p>\"History dampens high expectations,\" says Star Capital's Norbert Keimling. \"Above-average growth rates and profitability could never be sustained in past technological innovation phases such as the introduction of mass production, whether due to competition, regulation or a broad adaptation of new technologies in traditional companies.\" </p><p>It is, he adds, \"too early to proclaim an end to value investments\". JP Morgan goes further, saying that recent developments indicate that for value investors, \"the time to despair may be ending\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4153445</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y30-XR41-JC8Y-84K2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1102\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

On Monday, Google found itself at the centre of a 50-state investigation by the US attorneys general into a range of anti-competitive practices. By the end of the week, publishers had hit out en masse at Google and Facebook for \"unscrupulous behaviour\" in dominating the digital advertising sector, revealed as part of a probe by the UK Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the biggest surprise of them all was one almost nobody had predicted.</p><p>EU chief competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager had been pegged for greener pastures, once thought to be in the running for a job at the very top of the organisation. Instead, incoming European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen had other plans.</p><p>Vestager's profile as antitrust chief was something the EU couldn't afford to lose, it seems. On Tuesday, she was re-appointed for a second term, but with new powers added to her arsenal. Now also the bloc's executive vice president for digital affairs, Vestager can expand her reach far beyond the world of competition law. Known to many as the EU's strong arm on Silicon Valley, Vestager has often complained of the limited scope in her role as competition chief.</p><p>Following five years of high-profile fines against the likes of Facebook, Google and Apple - which have amounted to tens of billions of euros - she has wanted to do more than simply litigate against market dominance. \"It's understandable that people sometimes think of competition as a panacea, a universal answer to all society's problems,\" she said in a speech on Friday.</p><p>\"But competition is only part of the issue. When platforms manipulate the way we see the world, in ways that we often don't even notice, that affects our ability to understand the world around us.\"</p><p>According to those close to Brussels, her sights are seemingly set on issues close to her heart, such as misuse of data, abuse of corporation tax law and a lack of press freedom.</p><p>Whether or not Vestager will be successful in her new role is in part made harder by the legacy of her first term as competition chief - a period during which she became a unique figure in Brussels, renowned even for knitting elephants during meetings with highranking executives.</p><p>In the coming months, the Danish politician will face a slew of court cases and appeals over the fines she levied.</p><p>Silicon Valley is now ready to hit back, and it won't be pulling any punches. Google promised to appeal each of the three penalties it has been served, totalling nearly (EURO)8bn (\u00a37.1bn). Tomorrow, a challenge from Apple will also begin in court over her state aid ruling, in which she ordered the iPhone creator to repay (EURO)14bn in back taxes to Dublin authorities.</p><p>Although those headline-grabbing fines helped to lift Vestager's profile, their efficacy has yet to be judged. Some have criticised her office for being too vague to ensure tech giants change their ways after a penalty, effectively allowing the likes of Google to pay its parking ticket and put the affair behind them.</p><p>Another thorn in her side is those making noise across the Atlantic. Far from being one to be outdone, US President Donald Trump has made his disdain for \"the tax lady\" who \"really hates the US\" known.</p><p>Trump's administration has ordered America's own authorities to get tough on Big Tech. The US Federal Trade Commission has already given Vestager a run for her money, after it levied a $5bn (\u00a34bn) fine against Facebook this summer.</p><p>Similarly, as the UK prepares to leave the EU, it remains a task for the government to analyse how the CMA can be most effective. As of today, the watchdog can impose fines only on a company's British assets, but with a new tech watchdog on the horizon, its place in a digital-dominant world is up for evolution.</p><p>All of this puts pressure on one frequent criticism of the Dane and her squad: their lack of speed. Some of the biggest cases in EU tech antitrust history have taken seven to eight years to compile, followed by a further three to four years before a result is heard.</p><p>With Washington and London hot on her tail, Vestager is hard-pushed to find a way to increase the pace of her litigation, while also being effective. Silicon Valley won't go unchallenged for long.</p><p>Competition is only part of the issue. Platforms manipulate the way we see the world in ways we don't even notice</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Margrethe Vestager has taken a hard stance against Silicon Valley tech giants</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-152965837</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X2F-1H11-DYTY-C007-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"732\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 City A.M.

But even during the biggest economic crisis in living memory, Americans back his captaining of the U.S. economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump's economy approval rating remains in positive territory at +8, according to YouGov. More concerning still for Camp Biden is that just 34 per cent of Americans believe the economy would get better under his presidency. A total of 39 per cent fear it would get worse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If the \"it's the economy, stupid\" mantra still holds strong, November's election could be tighter than Biden's current nine-point lead suggests. Can the former vice-president get voters to back Bidenomics? Despite his reputation as a moderate who can reach across the aisle, Biden's platform is seen by experts as the most extreme proposed by a Democratic presidential challenger in decades.</p><p>\"If we compare to previous Democratic plans or Trump's plan, it is a pretty radical change,\" says Stephen Gallagher, U.S. economist at Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. \"But if we compare to the offering of the other Democratic candidates, it is more moderate compared to Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren or even Kamala Harris.\"</p><p>There was a fairly serious risk that the shift would have been even more crashing had the man Trump derides as \"Sleepy Joe\" not come out on top in the primaries, Gallagher says.</p><p>Four years of Trump have pushed the Democratic Party further Left as the country becomes increasingly polarized. Biden has followed his party, being forced into a number of key pledges to curry favour with Left-wing Democrats who have grown in stature.</p><p>The field of candidates in this year's Democratic primaries have responded to the popularity of the party's Leftists, such as firebrand socialist Bernie Sanders and liberal policy wonk Elizabeth Warren. Ultimately Democratic voters opted for a candidate who they believe is best-placed to defeat Trump - electability was a top concern, polling suggests - but the race has left its mark on Biden's platform.</p><p>Perhaps most important for the economy has been the former vice-president's promise to do \"whatever it takes\" to tackle COVID-19.</p><p>\"I would shut it down. I would listen to the scientists,\" he said last month. States rather than the president ultimately have the power to shut down and reopen their economies, as Trump has found to his frustration. But a new Oval Office stance on the virus could still be significant for the economy.</p><p>Beyond COVID, Biden has a number of leftist policies he claims will help America \"build back better.\"</p><p>He wants to almost double the federal minimum wage to US$15 an hour, up from US$7.25. Many states already have a higher minimum wage but Biden is seeking to bring the U.S. closer to pay floors seen elsewhere. \"It's going to hurt more rural populations where the minimum wage is not nearly that high and it would be an abrupt change,\" says Gallagher.</p><p>Workers will also be bolstered by his plans to make it easier to organize unions and collectively bargain, although some voters are likely to fear this will hit the country's famously dynamic labour market. He wants universal paid sick days and 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave, while social security payments will be US$200 higher per month.</p><p>Biden has promised to create 5 million new jobs in manufacturing and innovation and has vowed to spend US$2 trillion over four years on clean energy infrastructure, aiming for a carbon-zero power industry by 2035. He has promised no new taxes on those earning less than US$400,000, while Trump's corporate tax cuts will be partially reversed. The corporate tax rate will rise from 21 per cent to 28 per cent.</p><p>\"It's going to be the wealthy that are going to be paying the tax rises and you get more income for the poorer people,\" says James Knightley, ING chief international economist.</p><p>Trade policy is likely to become less combative while experts say the tech titans could face a clampdown amid rising competition worries.</p><p>Biden has not made tech regulation a key plank of his campaign as rivals such as Warren did, but the Democratic party has decisively shifted toward stricter rules on Silicon Valley behemoths.</p><p>Sam McGowan of Beacon Policy Advisors, a research firm focused on Washington, says a Biden administration is likely to reflect a growing skepticism of Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"If Biden wins, there's going to be a lot of influences out there that are going to shape the kinds of the policy that they're going to put in place. And I really think the conversation will shift towards more stringent enforcement.\" McGowan says that even if a Biden administration does not aim to break up Big Tech, it will certainly make predatory acquisitions harder and enforce competition.</p><p>However, Biden's Left-leaning agenda faces key hurdles. The 77-year old needs to win big against Trump to push through the most radical parts of his agenda.</p><p>The Democrats currently hold the House of Representatives but the other half of Congress, the Senate, is controlled by the Republicans. Many of Biden's economic plans would be scuppered unless the Democrats win the three or more seats needed to take the Senate.</p><p>\"One question is whether he might be limited by Congressional opposition. The battle for Senate control looks tight,\" says Philip Shaw, Investec economist.</p><p>Knightley says: \"If Biden gets a clean sweep and the Democrats win the House and Senate, we are going to see a very significant shift in policy. Much more taxation, more spending and more regulation of energy, financial services and big tech.\"</p><p>His ambitions could also be limited by the state of public finances he inherits. Trump was running high deficits at close to 5 per cent even before COVID struck and sent debt soaring.</p><p>\"When we get in, the pantry is going to be bare,\" warned Ted Kaufman, a leading figure in Biden's transition team. Economists also argue that his platform could be harmful for the economy in the longer term.</p><p>Gallagher says Biden's policies would slow the economy or limit its potential, despite rising in popularity among voters. \"It's not until the economy slows that these voters will abandon their support for all these changes,\" he says, highlighting Biden's health care and energy plans.</p><p>Shaw adds that Biden's tax pledges could have a significant impact on investor confidence, while the roaring recovery on the U.S. stock market could be derailed by an antitrust crackdown.</p><p>Biden has framed the 2020 election as a \"battle for the soul of the nation\". His plans would be transformative for the world's largest economy - but polling suggests Americans may be reluctant to give up on Trump's vision just yet.</p><p>The Daily Telegraph !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

The Alexa in the corner of the kitchen monitoring your every word? The location-betraying device in your pocket? The dozen trackers on that web page you just opened? The thought that a 5G network could, in some hazily understood way, be hardwired back to Beijing? The spooky use of live facial recognition on CCTV cameras across London.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With privacy there have been so many landmarks in the past 12 months. The $5-billion US Federal Trade Commission fine on Facebook to settle the Cambridge Analytica scandal? The accidental exposure of a mind-blowing 1.2 billion people's details from two data enrichment companies? Up to 50 million medical records spilled?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Maybe your mind was changed by The New York Times's Privacy Project, an intensely reported and alarming yearlong exploration of the issue? Or the publication of Shoshana Zuboff's searing book, 'The Age of Surveillance Capitalism'? Was it the growing unease over the probable manipulation of elections the world over? Or that moment when you learned from whistleblowers that Big Tech giants had hired actual humans to monitor Siri and Alexa activations, who ended up listening to couples?</p><p>Even people whose job it is to think deeply about technology have begun to come out with forms of belated protest or dissent. The Washington Post's tech columnist, Geoffrey A. Fowler, concluded 2019 by writing, \"Learning how everyday things spy on us made me, at times, feel paranoid. Mostly, my privacy project left me angry. Our cultural reference points \u2014 Big Brother and tinfoil hats \u2014 don't quite capture the sickness of an era when we gleefully carry surveillance machines in our pockets and install them in our homes.\"</p><p>Fowler's newspaper \u2014 owned by one of the biggest data harvesters of all, Amazon's Jeff Bezos \u2014 was not alone in publishing detailed guides to readers on the steps they could try to recover a degree of privacy online (belatedly, essential reading for Bezos himself, now he knows what it is like to have his own privacy invaded in the most spectacular way). But most commentators agree that such measures are too little too late \u2014 maybe 20 years too late. \"We were caught off-guard by surveillance capitalism,\" says Zuboff, a Harvard professor. \"Once we searched Google, but now Google searches us. Once we thought of digital services as free, but now surveillance capitalists think of us as free\u2026 The message here is simple: Once I was mine. Now I am theirs.\"</p><p>The future of privacy is likely to be complicated. For starters, no one can even agree what \"privacy\" means today. Some argue its first obituary was written 21 years ago when Scott McNealy, then CEO of Sun Microsystems, pronounced, \"You have zero privacy anyway. Get over it.\" That may, technically speaking, be true. A different question is: Have we reached the tipping point when enough people mind?</p><p>The traditional response is to argue that privacy has become a bargain. We may all be uneasy about granting so much access to our lives that big corporations know more about us than we do about ourselves\u2026 but we are, by and large, happy to trade that data for the (mostly free!) services and convenience we get in return.</p><p>So one scenario is that nothing much will change. Elite newspapers and Harvard professors can wring their hands about the human rights implications and the menacing power of the algorithm. But, in the end, the world has moved on and the privacy genie is never going back into the bottle. A second scenario is that there will be some sort of techlash, with consumers increasingly changing their privacy settings \u2014 both real and metaphorical.</p><p>What's changed in the past year (this argument goes) is the growing realization of the sheer scale of what's happening. You or I might have been reasonably relaxed about Google or Instagram targeting us with tailored ads in return for free email, search or social pictures. But we may draw the line at the newly revealed armies of trackers and data-brokers, traders and compilers who are running riot across insurance, retail, finance, health, education and much, much more. The New York Times found smartphones broadcasting the exact locations of users thousands of times per day through hundreds of apps.</p><p>\"That\", thundered a NYT editorial, \"is not a glitch in the system. It is the system. If the government ordered Americans to continuously provide such precise, real-time information about themselves, there would be a revolt.\" And maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 there will be one. Possibly it could take just one more massive hack or leak or breach of data to make even non-NYT readers sit up and take notice.</p><p>A third scenario could see a gradual shift in behaviors as new players enter the market, along with new technologies that allow for the better stewardship of personal data. So-called edge computing seeks to move information out of the cloud and back on to personal devices. Think of the developments in the Apple iPhone that seek to do encryption and store biometric information on your smartphone itself rather than pinging information halfway round the globe.</p><p>One estimate is that there may be 200 or 300 startups, SMEs and entrepreneurs rethinking the ownership and value of data. Finland's MyData project is just one high-profile attempt to let individuals regain control of their own data. Other players are exploring how blockchain can strengthen privacy as a basic consumer right. The jury is out \u2014 and doubtless will be for a while yet.</p><p>The final scenario is regulation. Europe has led the way with General Data Protection Regulation (see the recent thumping \u00a3500k fine on Dixons Carphone for not spotting the malicious software planted on more than 5,000 tills). It used to be assumed that the US would be slow to go down this route, but there have been baby steps in Vermont and Illinois, and January 2020 saw the introduction of the California Consumer Privacy Act, which marks a significant change in how west coast companies need to behave. Who will follow?</p><p>Our actual loss of privacy will eventually be dated to before 2019, but that was the year we shed our naivety about the scale of the loss. As always in the digital world, the future is unknowable. We may carry on as though nothing has happened. Or everything could be disrupted in the blink of an eye.</p><p>\"Competitors that align themselves with the actual needs of people and the norms of a market democracy\", says Zuboff, \"are likely to attract just about every person on Earth as their customer.\"</p><p>Now there's an opportunity.</p><p>* Alan Rusbridger chairs the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism and is a senior adviser to Watatawa communications consultancy.

For three months prior to Election Day, the social media company set out to manipulate the emotions of its U.S. users, showing 1.9 million randomly selected Facebookers more news stories in their newsfeeds. The result of this so-called \"voter megaphone\" tool, according to the social media network, was \"measurably increased civic engagement and voter turnout\"--a similar result to a previous experiment in which Facebook \"nudged\" up turnout by around 340,000 people when it created an \"I voted\" badge for users to reveal to their friends.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What made this \"voter megaphone\" effect different than, say, running a televised or radio ad campaign was its invisibility. Simply put, users didn't know they were Facebook's guinea pigs--and they were shocked. They were shocked again this past June, when the social media network revealed that it had manipulated over half a million newsfeeds to manipulate its users' emotions. Facebook later apologized for \"any anxiety it caused.\"</p><p>Why were we getting upset? some commentators asked--and it was a good question. Not only had we agreed to this kind of thing under Facebook's Terms and Conditions, but the company's experimenting was no different from the sort of user-testing carried out every day by other big tech giants. Google, for instance, once user-tested 41 different shades of blue in an effort to find an interface element people were most likely to click on. The search leviathan similarly tweaks its search algorithms on a regular basis, promoting or demoting content in the process according to what it thinks you will be interested in. Google's homepage rarely changes to clue users in that these alterations have been made.</p><p>Milennials grow up soaked in this sort of catered-to-you technology. We think it empowers us--and we're right about that, to some degree. But in our thirst to share photos, to trade stocks and make restaurant reservations online, we cannot overlook the darker side to the tech boom: It has made us slaves to the algorithm--the underlying codes that govern the computer age. Is it possible that we live in a world in which Facebook keeps us connected, Google flatters us with tailored search results and Amazon knows what books and music we're likely to enjoy without realizing the extent to which algorithms rule our lives?</p><p>As it happens, companies like Google and Facebook are just the tip of the iceberg. Today algorithms carry out 70 percent of trades on the U.S. stock market. Tomorrow, who's to say they won't be helping us pick political leaders in the same way that Amazon's formulas suggest which products we are likely to buy: \"You liked Mitt Romney, you might also like such-and-such.\" Before that happens, we need to start asking the tough questions about what algorithms are and what purpose they are designed to achieve--for just because they are \"scientific\" certainly doesn't mean they're neutral. If Facebook's algorithms can convince a certain percentage of users to vote, couldn't they just as easily convince a certain subset of users not to?</p><p>***</p><p>The first thing we must do it shake off the widespread belief that algorithms are neutral, there to give us unbiased, objective results.</p><p>Trust in the impartiality of perceived science is far from a recent development. In his 1886 essay \"The Ethic of Freethought,\" the English statistical mathematician Karl Pearson argued that science's \"single-eyed devotion to truth [admits] no interested motive, no working to support a party, an individual, or a theory; such action but leads to the distortion of knowledge, and those who do not seek truth from an unbiased standpoint are, in the theology of freethought, ministers in the devil's synagogue.\" More than a century on, in 1989, the artificial intelligence philosopher Peter Slezak announced the dawning of a (not unrelated) age of \"scientific discovery by computer ... totally isolated from all social and cultural factors whatever.\"</p><p>Today's billion-dollar tech giants have picked up this objective ball and run with it. In a manifesto entitled \"Ten Things We Know to Be True,\" Google claims, \"Our users trust our objectivity.\" And Google has a point, too. Very few of us stop to consider the fact that the tools that deliver search results in an average of 0.48 seconds have agendas of their own. But the reality is that of course they do--and these agendas can reflect everything from what Google's own engineers consider important to the preferences expressed by individual users.</p><p>Take something as simple as search results. Many Politico readers will be familiar with the concept of the \"filter bubble,\" the idea that due to personalized search services, Google will frequently produce two very different sets of search results for two different users searching for the same thing. In one famous example, the liberal who types \"BP\" into his or her Web browser is likely to receive information about the April 2010 oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, while a conservative typing the same two letters is more likely to get investment information about the oil company.</p><p>Similarly, algorithms are more likely to respond to a female search for \"wagner\" by directing the user towards sites about the composer \"Richard Wagner,\" while the same search by a male is taken as meaning \"Wagner USA\" paint supplies. As such, what is presented by search algorithms is not a formula designed to give ideologically untampered answers but precisely the opposite: search results that flatter our personal mythologies by reinforcing what we already \"know\" about particular issues, while also downgrading in importance the concerns that do not marry up to our existing worldview.</p><p>Although this type of targeting is probably more about enhancing UX (the User Experience) than overtly political, the end result is often quite partisan. Take, for instance, the story of African-American Harvard University PhD, Latanya Sweeney. Searching on Google one day, Sweeney was shocked to notice that her search results were accompanied by adverts asking, \"Have you ever been arrested?\" These ads did not appear for her white colleagues. Sweeney began a study that ultimately demonstrated that the machine-learning tools behind Google's search were being inadvertently racist, by linking names more commonly given to black people to ads relating to arrest records. A similar revelation is the fact that Google's Android app store recommender system suggests users who download Grindr, a location-based social-networking tool for gay men, also download a sex-offender locating app. In both of these cases, are we to assume that the algorithm has made an error, or that they are revealing in-built prejudice on the part of their makers? Or, as is more likely, are they revealing distasteful large-scale cultural associations between--in the former case--black people and criminal behavior and--in the latter--homosexuality and predatory behavior?</p><p>This type of profiling doesn't simply begin and end on your Google results page: As they become more powerful, more far-reaching--primary decision makers instead of support tools, algorithms are beginning to control more than just what we see on our screens--from our economy (as was the case earlier this year when a Hong Kong-based venture capital firm tasked an algorithm with making crucial decisions about which companies to invest in) to our laws.</p><p>Take predictive policing, for instance. Envisioned as a way to make law enforcement proactive rather than reactive, predictive policing is currently being rolled out around the world. It makes use of recent advances in real-time crime data recording and utilizes this for accurate forecasting. As it turns out, crimes don't occur randomly within a particular area, but rather exist in small geographical clusters, known as \"hotspots.\"</p><p>In Seattle, for example, crime data gathered over a 14-year period shows that half of all crime can be isolated to just 4.5 percent of the city's streets. A similar observation holds true for Minneapolis, Minnesota, where 3.3 percent of all street addresses generate more than 50 percent of calls to police. Over a 28-year stretch, a marginal 8 percent of streets in Boston accounted for a massive 66 percent of street robberies. Being able to use computer science to search for patterns in this data makes it possible to anticipate, prevent and respond more effectively to crimes that will take place in the future. If that all sounds a bit too Minority Report--referring to the 2002 Steven Spielberg sci-fi movie in which crime is all but wiped out thanks to a specialized psychic \"PreCrime\" police department--it is still very effective. During one of the first deployments of predictive policing, in Los Angeles, the trial period resulted in a 36 percent drop in crime rate. The algorithm's predictions about which crimes were likely to take place and where were twice as accurate as those made by a human analyst.</p><p>With an area like law, we are convinced--often correctly--that algorithms can do a better job than we can. No matter how loudly we scream and shout about robots taking over the workplace, we humans regularly have more faith in computers than in our own reasoning. \"We are all so scared of human bias and inconsistency,\" explains Danielle Citron, professor of Law at University of Maryland.</p><p>As a result, the creation of laws themselves will increasingly reflect algorithmic reasoning. \"Ambient Law\" refers to the idea that laws can be both embedded within and enforced by our smart devices and environment. Like the human body, where temperature, breathing and heart rate are regulated without our having to be consciously aware of what is happening, so too is the dream for algorithms to self-manage, self-configure and self-optimize--without the need for physical or mental input on the part of users. As technologies like on-board computers and Google's self-driving cars (which have now completed 700,000 autonomous miles on open roads) gain prominence, questions related to speeding, road safety and similar legal conundrums become enshrined in the form of algorithms. For example, an in-car system developed by Japanese carmakerNissan monitors users from the moment they get behind the wheel, looking for signs of drunk-driving. To do this it checks the driver's breath with an alcohol odor sensor, tests for alcohol in the sweat of the driver's palm as he or she touches the gear stick, and looks for signs of drowsiness through a miniature dashboard camera. Based on an averaging of these biometrics, the car's algorithms then decide whether the person in the driver's seat is safe to drive. If not, the transmission locks, a \"drunk-driving\" alert sounds, and the seatbelt tightens to shock the person out of his or her stupor. Whether a person is fit to drive moves from a self-imposed standard to a computerized rule.</p><p>Similar algorithmic decision makers now play a part in deciding which prisoners are allowed out on parole, who should be given permission to board an airplane, whether assembled crowds are benign or dangerous and whether a person is eligible for welfare or other benefits. In all of these cases, politics are built directly into the codes that govern our lives.</p><p>But while allowing previously subjective ideas to be coded (or \"codified\") into massive system-wide architectures is an extremely useful development, it carries with it a host of potential challenges. As slashed budgets have led to staff cuts across a variety of different sectors, automated systems have moved from simple administrative tools to primary decision-makers. In some instances, the result is a lack of transparency that obscures decision-making and reveals only the (incontestable) final decision. Shades of this problem were evident several years back in the Colorado Benefits Management System disaster, in which hundreds of incorrect rules and illegal simplifications were accidentally written into the system's codes. When Amazon messes up its algorithms, you might order a book you end up hating; but when it comes to public policy, simplified or erroneous code can have enormous consequences. One mistake can expunge legitimate voters from electoral rolls without notice, incorrectly label small businesses as ineligible for government contracts or mistakenly identify individuals as \"deadbeat\" parents. There are precedents for all of these dystopian situations. And while humans are certainly capable of perpetuating these same errors, what is different with algorithms is the scale: A human might make dozens of errors, while a formula can make hundred of thousands, millions, even billions.</p><p>Worse, if we assume results churned out by an algorithm to be objective, we might not even realize there are errors. Back in 2012, the Washington Post developed a so-called \"TruthTeller\" algorithm to coincide with that summer's presidential-election season. The algorithm scanned through transcripts of political speeches in near real-time and pattern-matched the \"facts\" to a database of previously recorded, proven facts. The purpose behind the algorithm, to catch politicians in their lies, was noble enough. But the idea we would stop doing our own thinking in favor of the polygraph version of a spellcheck is disconcerting.</p><p>So what can we do about the algorithmization of everything? It seems clear that we are at a signal point in history. Algorithms can carry out complex jobs like medical diagnosis and legal work often better than humans can--and almost certainly for less money. But they also have the ability to nudge us in directions we might not choose for ourselves, whether by recommending new products for consumption, opening up and shutting down certain avenues of exploration or reminding us that it's Election Day.</p><p>As more of our lives are governed by hidden formulae, algorithms and neural networks, we need to seek understanding of these tools and, where sensible, to push for transparency. And as jobs continue to be lost to automation, its time we ask ourselves what the value of human work actually is--what it is that we can do better than expert systems and machine learning tools and what it is that, for all the reasons discusses above, we don't want to relinquish to formulas and codes.</p><p>Algorithms allow us to navigate through the 2.5 quintillion bytes of data that are generated each day (a million times more information than the human brain is capable of holding) and draw actionable conclusions from it. They are some of the most powerful tools shaping our lives in the 21st century. It's of vital importance that we understand them--and that we realize that whatever else they might be, they're certainly not free of politics.</p><p>As technology historian Melvin Kranzberg says: Technology is neither good nor bad, but it's certainly not neutral.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-113142</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DP6-B1T1-F118-9155-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2470\"/><timeReceived>7:51 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2014  Capitol News Company, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"11\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>November 25, 2014 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

The Senate Judiciary Committee has agreed to hold a public hearing on Thursday at which Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh will testify separately about Dr. Ford's accusation that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers. It is unclear at this time if either Republican staffers or senators would be asking questions of Dr. Ford.Additionally, another woman came forward over the weekend with a new sexual allegation against Kavanaugh that occurred while he was in college. Senate Judiciary Ranking Member Feinstein has called for a postponement of Thursday's hearing in order for the FBI to investigate the new development. </p><p>Labor-HHS, Defense Appropriations. The House is scheduled to vote on the minibus appropriations bill that continues funding for Labor-HHS and Defense and contains a continuing resolution for the parts of the government not yet funded by spending bills including Homeland Security and Commerce-Justice-Science. House Conservatives have expressed their opposition to the bill but have realized they are unlikely to keep it from passing. The Senate passed the bill last week. Election Outlook. A new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll is reporting that Democrats hold a 12-point lead in congressional preference among registered voters. A version of the same poll only reported an 8-point lead last month.  Last Week in the Nation's Capital CONGRESS Budget Trump Signs First 'Minibus' Spending Package for 2019: President Trump signed into law a package of three spending bills for 2019, temporarily setting aside a veto threat that could have shut down the government. The $147 billion package covered military construction and veterans affairs, the legislative branch, and energy and water. Those bills made up a quarter of the 12 planned total funding bills, but just a small fraction of the overall spending total. (The Hill[1]) Trump Criticizes 'Ridiculous' Spending Deal as Shutdown Deadline Looms: President Trump last week renewed calls for Congress to increase funding for his proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Although he did not reiterate his threat to trigger a shutdown of federal agencies, Trump called into question an agreement struck by Democratic and Republican lawmakers last week to maintain spending government-wide after appropriations expire on September 30. (Government Executive[2]) Health A Gap Between Opioid Bills Has an Easy Fix in Existing Medicaid Waivers: As the House and Senate attempt to reconcile their respective packages of bills addressing the nation's opioid crisis, the chambers find themselves at an impasse over a provision to lift restrictions on using Medicaid funds for people receiving in-patient treatment for substance use disorders. But some health experts say the conflict over the provision is unnecessary, not only because states already have ways to fund this care using Medicaid, but because the provision would ultimately do little to combat the opioid crisis. (Morning Consult[3]) GOP Plays Defense on ObamaCare's Pre-existing Conditions: Republicans in tough reelection races are scrambling to show that they support protections for people with pre-existing conditions in the face of a wave of Democratic attacks on the issue. But the argument they are making has been complicated by their party's repeated efforts to repeal ObamaCare, as well as a lawsuit supported by the Trump administration that seeks to overturn protections under the law for people with pre-existing health conditions. (The Hill[4]) New Bill Would Hold HHS Feet to Fire for Unaccompanied Minors: A bipartisan group of senators have introduced a bill designed to ensure that the Department of Health and Human Services takes full responsibility for, and keeps better track of, unaccompanied children who come to the border seeking entry to the United States and then are placed with U.S. sponsors. The legislation follows a new report that revealed that the government could not determine the whereabouts of nearly 1,500 children that HHS had placed with sponsors this year. (Roll Call[5]) Tax Reform After Pushback, IRS Will Hold Big Withholding Form Changes Until 2020 Tax Year: The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) is nearly a year old, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is still struggling to figure out how to assist taxpayers with their withholding under the new law - an updated form W-4, Employee's Withholding Allowance Certificate, to reflect changes in the new tax law still needs additional work and won't be ready by year end/for the 2019 tax year. The push from Congress to make things 'simple' means that many taxpayers might not be withholding enough - and that may not change any time soon. In the meantime, the IRS advises taxpayers to take advantage of the new Withholding Calculator which reflects changes under the new tax law. (Forbes[6]) Banking ...using Bankshot What Happens to Banking Policy if Democrats Win Both Chambers of Congress?: With some Republican strongholds suddenly looking like tossups, there is recent coverage suggesting that the GOP is worried about holding the Senate, in addition to staring down potential defeat in the House. If such concerns became a reality, it would rewrite the script in Washington on financial policy. The implications of a Democratic sweep of both houses would be far-reaching: Likely nailing the coffin shut on further regulatory relief legislation, the opposition party having more influence in the Trump administration's remaining picks to run regulatory agencies, and the Democrats having a larger role in housing finance reform and other initiatives. (American Banker[7]) Justice Carlos Curbelo Calls on Jeff Sessions, DOJ to Get Out of the Way of Medical Marijuana Research: U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla., is calling on U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions to allow more companies to research how Cannabidiol (CBD) and Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) can be used for medicinal purposes. Noting that the federal Drug Enforcement Agency had approved plans for Tilray, a company based out of British Columbia, to import CBD and THC for studies on how to treat nerve pain, Curbelo called on the U.S. Department of Justice to get out of the way of domestic companies trying to do the same thing. (Sunshine State News[8]) Agriculture Looming Farm Bill Expiration Yields Uncertainty Over Funding: The 2014 farm bill is set to expire in one week, raising concerns about disruptions in a number of programs, including one of the largest conservation programs as well as much smaller programs that help commodity groups open overseas markets. Congressional negotiators had hoped to reach agreement on a new farm bill in time to have it enacted by Sept. 30, when the 2014 law expires, but the talks remain bogged down this week over a range of policy and funding disagreements. (Agri Pulse[9]) Transportation Congress Allows Airlines to Continue Passenger Fees that Cost $4.6B Last Year: Congress protected the $4.6 billion in fees that U.S. airlines charge for baggage, seat assignment and flight changes as part of a late-night action to continue funding for the Federal Aviation Administration. The fees would have come under scrutiny by the U.S. Department of Transportation if a House-Senate committee had agreed to the language in the bill. But the legislation removed a provision that would have allowed the DOT to decide whether airline fees were 'unreasonable' or out of line with the cost of providing the service in question. (The Washington Post[10]) Data Privacy Big Tech Preps for Senate Showdown: Some of the biggest tech and telecom companies are preparing for members of the Senate Commerce Committee to grill them over their data practices this week. Why it matters:Industry players are trying to shape the debate as Congress considers passing its own privacy rules. Apple will pledge its support for \"comprehensive\" federal privacy regulations during the Senate hearing, according to an executive's prepared testimony obtained by Axios. It'll be the first time Apple has made this explicit to Congress. (Axios[11]) EXECUTIVE BRANCH HHS Trump Puts HHS in Charge of Defense against Biological Threats: President Donald issued a national biodefense strategy that repeals Bush and Obama administration policies and installs an HHS-led committee to survey gaps in responding to biological threats. The committee includes officials from the Pentagon, Agriculture and Homeland Security departments and will review capabilities across the intelligence community and 15 executive branch agencies. (Politico[12]) HHS Awards over $1B in Grants to Fight Opioid Epidemic: The Department of Health and Human Services awarded more than $1 billion in grants to states, communities and organizations fighting the opioid crisis. The vast majority of that funding \u2014 $930 million \u2014 is intended to support states' efforts to provide treatment and prevention services to combat opioid abuse. Another $352 million was awarded to 1,232 community health centers to increase access to services for substance use disorder and mental health needs. (The Hill[13]) FDA Expands Strategies for Safer Opioid Prescribing: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration took new steps as part of its broader efforts to address the opioid crisis by approving the final Opioid Analgesic Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy. This new plan includes several measures to help better communicate the serious risks about the use of opioid pain medications to patients and health care professionals. (FDA News Release[14]) Defense Wilson: $13 billion Space Force Cost Estimate is 'Conservative': Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson said her initial $13 billion cost estimate to stand up a Space Force and sustain it for five years is likely to be revised upward as more data is crunched. In a detailed memo to Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, Wilson provided the first glimpse into the potential cost, size and makeup of a military branch for space. The $13 billion projected cost over five years is based on a force of 13,000 people, including a headquarters of about 2,400. (Space News[15]) Air Force Busts Out Credit Cards To Buy High Tech Gear: The Pentagon has been trying for years to replicate the speed of Silicon Valley-style startup culture, with only sporadic \u2014 and limited \u2014 success. But the Air Force says it's doubling down on the effort, and is looking to start using government credit cards to buy small amounts of gear from tech firms that don't have much interest in forming long-term relationships with the government. The Air Force can be an 'angel investor' for some startups, said Will Roper, the service's top acquisition official (and former head of the Pentagon's Strategic Capabilities Office). (Breaking Defense[16]) Labor ...rkforce Eighty Percent of Contractors Report Difficulty Finding Qualified Craft Workers to Hire as Association Calls for Measures to Rebuild Workforce: Eighty percent of construction firms report they are having a hard time filling hourly craft positions that represent the bulk of the construction workforce, according to the results of an industry-wide survey released recently by Autodesk and the Associated General Contractors of America. Association officials said shortages pose a significant risk to future economic growth and they released a new workforce development plan to solve the growing problem. (Agc.org[17]) Labor Dept. to Visit Federal Contractors in the Coming Months: Hundreds of government contractors should expect a visit from the Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs in the coming months. Labor's OFCCP sent letters to 445 vendors alerting them about an upcoming review. Among the areas Labor will review is how contractors are meeting requirements to take affirmative action and not discriminate on the basis of race, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran. (Department of Labor[18]) DOE Department of Energy Announces $120 Million for Battery Innovation Hub: The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced plans to provide $120 million over five years to renew the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research (JCESR), a DOE Energy Innovation Hub devoted to advancing battery science and technology, led by Argonne National Laboratory. Future efforts at JCESR will focus on developing new battery materials 'from the bottom up' using principles rooted in a detailed understanding of matter at the atomic and molecular levels. Emphasis will be on the development of multivalent battery designs, capable of significantly higher energy capacity than today's lithium-ion batteries, as well as on new concepts for so-called flow batteries for the electric grid. (DoE Press Releases[19]) Cybersecurity FBI Issues Public Service Announcement of Cyber Threats Related to Student Use of Educational Technologies: On September 13th, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a public service announcement in an effort to increase awareness of the vulnerability of K-12 students to the threat of cyber-attacks. According to the FBI, the rapid growth of U.S. schools using educational technologies and digital tools, particularly those connected to networked devices or directly connected to the internet, provide increased opportunities for 'cyber-actors to access devices collecting data monitoring children within educational and home environments.' In particular, mobile devices, laptops, and tablets all may be improperly secured and pose additional avenues for exploitation by cybercriminals. The FBI warns that the improper use of sensitive personal data could result in social engineering, bullying, tracking, identity theft, or other means for targeting children. (Clark Hill Insight[20]) Trump's National Cyber Strategy Praised by Experts: After months of criticism for lacking a cohesive federal approach to cybersecurity, President Trump's new national cybersecurity strategy, released Sept. 20, has been largely met with praise from former government officials, business executives and political opponents. The strategy calls for more offensive cyber attacks and attempts to bolster America's digital defenses by creating new norms online. On Twitter, Michael Daniel, the Obama administration cyber czar and president of the Cyber Threat Alliance, praised the plan. He cast Trump's strategy as an evolution of U.S. policy from previous eras.(Fifth Domain[21]) Banking Bank Regulators' \"Clarifying\" Statement on Enforcing Supervisory Guidance: The prudential regulators, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (prudential regulators) along with the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (agencies) recently issued an Interagency Statement Clarifying the Role of Supervisory Guidance (Seehere[22]) to explain the role of supervisory guidance and the agencies approach to it.In summary, the agencies are clarifying their position that they 'do not take enforcement actions based on supervisory guidance.' Will banks and thrifts be free to avoid compliance with supervisory guidance, assured they will suffer no consequences? Don't bet on it. (Clark Hill Insight[23]) Space, NASA ...AA Three Companies Win NOAA Commercial Weather Data Pilot Contracts: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) awarded more than $8 million in contracts last week to three companies in the second round of a commercial satellite weather data pilot program. In the announcement, NOAA said it was issuing contracts to GeoOptics, PlanetIQ and Spire to provide GPS radio occultation weather data from satellites currently in orbit or planned for launch in the coming months..The awards represent round two of NOAA's Commercial Weather Data Pilot program, an effort by the agency to experiment with buying data from commercial providers to determine its usefulness, as well as to examine various technical and programmatic issues with such data buys. (Space News[24]) New Small Satellite Peers Inside Hurricane Florence: A new experimental weather satellite no bigger than a cereal box got an inside look at Hurricane Florence in a test of technology that could influence the future of storm monitoring from space. The satellite took its first images of Hurricane Florence on Tuesday, Sept. 11, just hours after its instrument was turned on. TEMPEST-D, which deployed into low-Earth orbit from the International Space Station in July, carries a state-of-the-art miniaturized microwave radiometer, an instrument that sees through the thick clouds to reveal the hidden interior of storms, just like a security scanner can see inside luggage at the airport. (Space Ref[25]) Bezos Touts Investments in Rockets, Launch Facilities: Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos said he plans to invest a billion dollars next year in his rocket company Blue Origin to further the development of New Glenn, a heavy lift launch vehicle that is anticipated to fly in late 2020. Bezos took the stage at the Air Force Association's annual symposium in a fireside chat with AFA CEO Larry Spencer, and did not take questions from the audience. One of Bezos' messages to a room packed with Air Force officers, Pentagon officials and contractors is that he will continue to put financial firepower behind New Glenn and space launch facilities. (Space News[26]) Trade Despite New Tariffs, China Still Not Budging on Trade Tactics, White House Says: The Trump administration is not aiming to 'cleve off' the U.S. economy from China's, but it intends to continue pressuring the Asian giant even though tough moves like repeated rounds of tariffs have yet to bring the fundamental changes President Donald Trump is demanding. 'Our goal is not to totally divorce our economies from each other,' said a senior official who briefed reporters Friday at the White House about trade matters. 'Our goal is for China to stop behaving unfairly.' And the official also gave no indication that talks with Canada are any closer than where they were weeks ago to bring Ottawa into a preliminary U.S.-Mexico deal that might replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. (Roll Call[27]) DHS Trump Administration Proposal Would Deny Green Cards to Immigrants Using Welfare, Food Stamps: Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials, who announced the proposal late Saturday, claim it would save federal taxpayers $2.7 billion annually by deterring immigrants from applying for benefits they would otherwise be qualified for. It would affect about 380,000 people annually, federal officials said, and is designed to ensure the immigrants can support themselves. 'Under longstanding federal law, those seeking to immigrate to the United States must show they can support themselves financially,' said DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. \"This proposed rule will implement a law passed by Congress intended to promote immigrant self-sufficiency and protect finite resources by ensuring that they are not likely to become burdens on American taxpayers.' (USA Today[28]) DOT DOT Announces Competition for Two New University Transportation Research Centers: The U.S. Department of Transportation published a Notice of Funding Opportunity for $15 million to fund two new University Transportation Centers. One center will focus on 'Congestion Relief,' while the other will focus on 'Improving the Durability and Extending the Life of Transportation Infrastructure.' (DoT News[29]) FEC SCOTUS Refuses to Stay Order on Campaign Finance Disclosure on Eve of Midterms: Last week, the Supreme Court decided it would not intercede in a ruling by a federal judge to eliminate a Federal Election Commission (FEC) regulation that allows donor money to be kept secret. CREW, which brought the case, called it 'a great day for democracy.' The original ruling will be appealed, but this will take time, and probably won't happen before midterms. The ruling closes a 40-year-old loophole that let individual donors to aggressive political ad campaigns remain anonymous. This means, according to FEC Chair Caroline Hunter, that for the first time in decades large donors to political campaigns through 501c4s (social welfare nonprofits) and 501c6s (association-based nonprofits) will need to be disclosed.

The House returns for a final week of legislative action before breaking for the August recess, while the Senate still has two weeks to go. Even in the volatile Trump era, last week was an extraordinary and historic week in the House of Representatives. In addition to the minimum wage vote, the House voted to condemn a sitting president for \"racist\" tweets and voted to hold two top Cabinet officials in contempt of Congress. </p><p>The House also voted on a resolution to impeach the President but both Democrats and Republicans largely voted against the measure and it only received 98 yea votes. Senate leaders have agreed to take up a bill this Tuesday that would extend a financial lifeline to thousands of victims suffering health problems from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The bill sailed through the House last week on a 402-12 vote, but has faced resistance in the Senate from fiscal hawks worried about its price tag.White House. The House voted on Wednesday to ask the Justice Department to prosecute Attorney General William Barr and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for defying congressional subpoenas, an escalation in House Democrats' ongoing oversight battle with the Trump administration. The 230-198 vote to hold Barr and Ross in criminal contempt of Congress is largely symbolic, as President Trump's DOJ will not act on the request. It is, however, another effort by House Democrats to create a 'record' of actions by the Administration, in advance of a likely lawsuit to try and get federal courts to order release of materials the Administration is denying under executive privilege claims.Budget ...propriations. Democrats said Friday there are \"nonstarters\" in a new White House offer that includes $1.1 trillion in options to offset spending increases in a two-year agreement that would raise the budget caps and hike the debt limit. The Trump Administration's demand to at least offset the spending increases represents a significant hurdle to finalizing a deal, with the administration seeking at least $150 billion in cuts. Speaker Nancy Pelosi is shooting for getting a deal on and through the House floor by Thursday, so that the House can vote and leave the bill in the Senate's court. Reports have indicated that Speaker Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin had reached a deal on new budget caps for FY 20 and 21 as well as an agreement to raise the debt ceiling, but now the issue of offsets remains the final hurdle to a deal.Race for the White House 2020. CNN's two-night Democratic primary debatenext week will offer a rematch offormer Vice President Joe BidenandCalifornia Sen. Kamala Harris, whose clash over race became the most closely watched moment of the first round of debates. Biden and Harris will debate in Detroit on Wednesday, July 31. The debates will also, for the first time, offer a match-up between Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, thetwo top progressives in the Democratic primary.
