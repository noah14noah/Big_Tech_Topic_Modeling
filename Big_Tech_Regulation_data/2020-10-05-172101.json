The congressman invoked an attack line that Donald J. Trump had used against Mr. Cruz in the 2016 presidential race.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u201cSenator Cruz is not going to be honest with you,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cHe\u2019s dishonest, and it\u2019s why the president called him Lyin\u2019 Ted, and it\u2019s why the nickname stuck \u2014 because it\u2019s true.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear Congressman O\u2019Rourke\u2019s pollsters have told him to come out on the attack,\u201d Mr. Cruz replied.</p><p>In their first debate last month, Mr. O\u2019Rourke was largely reserved and anything but aggressive. He had trouble boiling down his expansive responses into memorable zingers, and his just-good-enough performance most likely played at least some role in Mr. Cruz\u2019s recent lead in the polls. On Tuesday, however, Mr. O\u2019Rourke was far sharper and edgier. He sweated more, used his hands and arms to punctuate his arguments and repeatedly cast Mr. Cruz as dishonest, ineffective, more focused on running for president than representing Texas and beholden to corporate interests.</p><p>In one exchange, Mr. Cruz was asked about Mr. Trump\u2019s trade war. Mr. Cruz said he was against it, and pivoted to talk about Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s remarks about impeaching the president, calling his opponent \u201cthe only Democratic Senate nominee in the country who has explicitly come out for impeaching President Trump.\u201d He added that if Mr. O\u2019Rourke had his way, there would be \u201ctwo years of a partisan circus\u201d aimed at ousting the president.</p><p>Mr. O\u2019Rourke replied, \u201cIt\u2019s really interesting to hear you talk about a partisan circus, after your last six years in the U.S. Senate.\u201d Then he switched gears as well, to talk about Mr. Cruz\u2019s relationship with Mr. Trump, who is coming to Houston on Monday to hold a rally for Mr. Cruz.</p><p>\u201cListen,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said, \u201cif you have this special relationship with President Trump, then where is the result of that? You are all talk and no action.\u201d</p><p>But Mr. Cruz largely kept his cool, and even chuckled out loud at some of Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s attacks. He continued to paint Mr. O\u2019Rourke as a liberal who is too radical for Texas and who wants to steer the state away from the low-tax, low-regulation mantra that Republicans view as the key to the Texas economy\u2019s success.</p><p>\u201cHave you noticed in this debate he doesn\u2019t talk about what he has accomplished in Congress?\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cBecause he has scored political points rather than accomplishing victories for the people of Texas.\u201d</p><p>Only once did Mr. Cruz grow audibly frustrated \u2014 but that was aimed at one of the two moderators, Jason Whitely, a senior reporter at WFAA-TV in Dallas. Responding to a question about incivility in politics, Mr. Cruz made a point about partisanship, saying, \u201cThere is an anger, there is a rage on the far left.\u201d When Mr. Whitely tried to interject, Mr. Cruz said sharply, \u201cDon\u2019t interrupt me, Jason,\u201d and then continued discussing his views on treating others with respect.</p><p>\u201cThe personal attacks, the going to the gutter that is so common in politics, I\u2019ve tried not to engage in,\u201d Mr. Cruz said.</p><p>The displays of fireworks aside, there was no single significant moment in the debate that seemed certain to help or hurt the two candidates with about three weeks to go to Election Day. Mr. O\u2019Rourke was clearly aiming to energize his base of voters and trying to remind Texas independents and moderates of misgivings they may have about Mr. Cruz.</p><p>On Wednesday morning, President Trump weighed in on the debate, declaring his support for Mr. Cruz and calling Mr. O\u2019Rourke \u201ca flake\u2019\u2019 who was \u201cnot in the same league with Ted Cruz.\u2019\u2019</p><p>The two candidates clashed from the first question, about the security of voting and whether Congress should regulate social media companies. Mr. O\u2019Rourke said that voting and the ballot box were \u201cunder attack\u201d more than \u201cany other time in our nation\u2019s history\u201d and argued that Senator Cruz had not done enough to finance greater election security measures. He also criticized Mr. Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir V. Putin, given Russian\u2019s interference in the 2016 American election, and pledged to \u201cstand up\u201d to Mr. Trump while saying Mr. Cruz had not.</p><p>Mr. Cruz said he had supported legislation to do more to protect American voting, but also focused on \u201cpolitical bias of big tech, of Facebook and Google\u201d and said he was concerned that social media was not protecting free political speech on social media.</p><p>Mr. O\u2019Rourke also criticized Mr. Cruz for opposing the Violence Against Women Act, while the senator presented himself as a strong supporter of the #MeToo movement and victims of sexual assault and misconduct.</p><p>\u201cThe #MeToo movement has done an incredible amount of good for our country,\u201d Mr. Cruz said. \u201cI believe everyone, women and men, girls and boys, need to be protected.\u201d As the father of two girls, and the son and husband of women who had careers, he noted that he helped lead a Senate effort to stop secret settlements by members of Congress over sexual harassment complaints.</p><p>Mr. Cruz and Mr. O\u2019Rourke were facing off for the second and perhaps final time, as Mr. Cruz seeks to widen his lead in the polls and Mr. O\u2019Rourke tries to restore dimming Democratic hopes that he can unseat Mr. Cruz and pull off the biggest upset in modern Texas political history.</p><p>The battle between Mr. Cruz and Mr. O\u2019Rourke has captivated and polarized Texas and drawn enormous interest nationwide, with the candidates raising far more money than those in typical Senate races. Mr. O\u2019Rourke raised a record-breaking $38.1 million in the last three months alone, the most of any Senate candidate ever. And he has enjoyed a kind of pop-culture celebrity status, getting a shout-out from the young El Paso soul singer Khalid at the American Music Awards and jamming on stage with Willie Nelson. On Thursday, he will appear in a live town-hall event on CNN in the border city of McAllen.</p><p>Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s CNN town hall has become a contested issue. The Cruz campaign asked CNN to change the format of the event into a town-hall debate and to allow the two candidates to hold their third debate there. In a letter to CNN, Jeff Roe, Mr. Cruz\u2019s campaign manager, wrote that if they were going to spend an hour \u201con national cable news discussing and debating the issues important to Texas voters, we believe it should be on a stage with our opponent.\u201d</p><p>The network had originally invited both candidates to participate in a town hall, with each candidate appearing separately on the stage in individual segments. The Cruz campaign had accepted but later backed out, the network said. CNN said in response to the Cruz campaign request that it would convert the event into a debate if the O\u2019Rourke campaign agreed to the change.</p><p>It was unclear if Mr. O\u2019Rourke was going to agree. Although three debates were originally scheduled, one of them set for Houston was postponed, and it was uncertain whether it would be rescheduled. It seemed possible that Tuesday night\u2019s debate was the final one.</p><p>For weeks, several polls showed the two candidates running about even, an extraordinary feat in Texas, where Democrats have failed to win any statewide offices since 1994. But lately the polls have shown Mr. Cruz building a lead over Mr. O\u2019Rourke. One Quinnipiac University poll last week showed Mr. Cruz ahead by nine percentage points and another by The New York Times Upshot and Siena College<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/upshot/elections-poll-txsen-2.html\">had Mr. Cruz up by eight points</url>.</p><p>Texas Democrats remain cautiously optimistic, with some more cautious and others more optimistic.</p><p>Few, if any, Democrats running statewide in Texas in recent decades have generated the amount of enthusiasm that Mr. O\u2019Rourke has. In the 2014 race for governor, the party\u2019s nominee, Wendy Davis, enjoyed an initial wave of excitement but then trailed the Republican, Greg Abbott, by up to 12 percentage points in the polls four months before the election, and some Democrats were publicly and privately grumbling about her campaign\u2019s missteps.</p><p>Mr. O\u2019Rourke is running a tighter race and a smoother campaign, effectively turning much of his life into a social-media live stream, allowing his supporters to watch him as he drives between events and gets a haircut.</p><p>\u201cHe\u2019s probably running the best campaign that\u2019s been run in Texas in my lifetime,\u201d said Garry Mauro, a former state land commissioner who was the chairman of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign in Texas in 2016. \u201cI\u2019m on his Facebook. At one time yesterday he had 13,000 people watching him drive in the car.\u201d</p><p>On Tuesday night, Mr. O\u2019Rourke was lucky to have made it into the studios at all. Before the debate, the parking attendant outside the KENS 5 television station was surprised when Mr. O\u2019Rourke pulled in driving his own vehicle. He regularly drives himself campaigning around the state. Debate night was no different.</p><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a pass, I don\u2019t know how to get you through,\u201d the attendant told Mr. O\u2019Rourke. His wife, Amy O\u2019Rourke, sat in the car, joined by staff members. They were live-streaming the drive to the debate on his Facebook page.</p><p>\u201cThis is how you know it\u2019s real,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. After some consultation, the parking attendant sent Mr. O\u2019Rourke in.</p><p>\u201cThank you,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cThank you for your service.\u201d</p><p>He rolled up the window.</p><p>\u201cWe passed the first hurdle,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke added.</p><h>Related Articles</h><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/us/politics/ted-cruz-beto-orourke-poll.html\">Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s War Chest Bothers Some Democrats as He Struggles Against Ted Cruz</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/us/politics/beto-cruz-debate.html\">Ted Cruz and Beto O\u2019Rourke Debate Who Is \u2018Out of Step\u2019 With Texas</url></p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/us/politics/beto-orourke-dreams-of-one-texas-ted-cruz-sees-another-clearly.html\">Beto O\u2019Rourke Dreams of One Texas.

Beto O'Rourke popped out of a coffee shop here Thursday afternoon, after his event inside was cut short by the fire marshal for attracting too many people an unceremonious but perhaps fitting end to a 48-hour blitz of all 10 counties in New Hampshire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"You are a whirlwind,\" one man gushed to O'Rourke as he navigated a gauntlet of selfie-seekers and leftover questioners on the sidewalk, aides hurrying him to his minivan so he could catch a flight to his next state. A handwritten index card propped on the console of the Dodge Grand Caravan reminded him he had an hour to get to the airport.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> A week into his long-anticipated presidential bid, hectic scenes like this one have become familiar but telling of O'Rourke's early approach to the campaign trail  constantly in motion, barreling through the good and the bad, chaos and controversy. His first week saw a series of undeniable highs  monster fundraising, overflow crowds  as well as several less flattering chapters that found him expressing contrition for various missteps or confronting skeptics at his no-holds-barred events.</p><p> \"I know that we have not done an event where folks cannot ask questions or make comments or level criticisms at me,\" O'Rourke told reporters earlier Thursday in Manchester. \"I'm getting better along the way. I have a long way to go, and that's very clear to me, but I am grateful for the opportunity. I'm going to make the most of it.\"</p><p> Free of a day job, the former El Paso congressman seems determined to set the pace for the rest of the field with 10 months until voting begins, even if he will not acknowledge it. Asked in Manchester if the breakneck speed of his launch tour  complete with scenes of him leaping atop restaurant counters to speak  was meant to send a message to older opponents about his energy, O'Rourke responded with typical earnestness, saying he and his supporters will \"never define ourselves in contrast to others.\"</p><p> Yet O'Rourke's itinerary speaks for itself. By the end of Thursday  one week into his run  he had visited six states, beginning in Iowa and crossing the Midwest to New Hampshire, holding dozens of events across them. After two days in New Hampshire, he was in South Carolina on Friday for a day and a half and then headed to Nevada for another day and a half. On March 30, he will return to Texas to not only kick off his campaign in his hometown but also hold similar rallies in Houston and Austin later that same day.</p><p> As he has zoomed across the country, O'Rourke has been effectively testing whether the freewheeling style of his Senate campaign can withstand the rigors of a presidential race. The hallmarks of the 2018 bid have been abundant over the past week: the candidate driving himself from town to town, relying largely on the same two travel aides, broadcasting his appearances on Facebook Live, taking audience questions at every stop and entertaining reporters' questions at almost every turn.</p><p> There have been initial signs of a more professional effort  he appears to have an advance staff in place, for example  but it is not lost on even O'Rourke supporters that an early challenge of his 2020 campaign is scaling up what he did in 2018. It was the thrust of a question that Peggy Magner posed to O'Rourke on Saturday in Independence, Iowa, and while his answer reverted to familiar themes of showing up everywhere and talking to everyone, the 69-year-old retiree walked away hopeful that he is prepared to take his statewide campaign national.</p><p> \"I think Texas is a huge state  I mean, you're talking about 200-and-some counties. You're talking 99 in Iowa,\" Magner said. \"And I think the way he did it and the way he organized it from the ground up  I think it could really work. But of course it depends on who he hires to be with him. He is the magic behind it.\"</p><p> When it comes to staffing, it remains to be seen just how much things have changed from his Senate campaign, when he kept a small inner circle and largely served as his own strategist. He told reporters on the first day of his presidential bid that he will \"rely on the wisdom, perspective and experience of a lot of people,\" including those from his Senate campaign as well as some fresh faces. \"That's exciting to me  and I need it,\" he said.</p><p> Yet a week into his candidacy, O'Rourke had not named a campaign manager, somewhat unusual for such a high-profile contender. \"We're working on it,\" he told reporters in Independence, hours later maintaining that \"there are a number of people working together\" to run the campaign. CNN reported Thursday night that O'Rourke was set to hire veteran Democratic strategist Jen O'Malley Dillon to lead his bid, though neither the candidate nor his campaign confirmed the news.</p><p> Navigating the issues</p><p> O'Rourke's flurry of events  combined with his willingness to take questions from both attendees and reporters at virtually every one of them \u2013 has subjected him in a short time to a battery of thorny yet ascendant issues in the Democratic primary as well as more clear-cut litmus tests. O'Rourke's responses ranged from vague to blunt.</p><p> In Durham, New Hampshire, on Wednesday, he said he does not support a universal basic income, which is being pushed by upstart rival Andrew Yang, who wants to give American adults $1,000 a month. And earlier that day in Conway, New Hampshire, O'Rourke expressed skepticism when asked about a proposal by another opponent, Elizabeth Warren, to break up Big Tech companies.</p><p> \"I think the best way to approach the fact that people become products on these platforms ... is to regulate them more seriously and perhaps to treat them a little but more like a utility,\" O'Rourke said. \"I'm not sure if having five more Facebooks ... makes as much sense as regulating them, given the power that they have.\"</p><p> On a host of other issues du jour, O'Rourke expressed an almost instinctive openness.</p><p> Abolish the Electoral College? There is \"a lot of wisdom\" in that. (In his Senate campaign, he called for the \"direct election\" of the president.)</p><p> Lower the voting age? \"I'm open to the idea.\"</p><p> End the filibuster? \"I think that's something that we should seriously consider.\"</p><p> Change the Supreme Court? It is worth debating whether to add more justices and give them term limits, but he is \"more partial\" to the latter.</p><p> Republicans were keeping close watch as O'Rourke navigated the knottier issues, particularly when it came to abortion. He sidestepped a number of questions across multiple states involving late-term abortion, including his personal feelings toward it, saying each time he trusts women to make decisions about their bodies.</p><p> On some other issues dominating the primary, O'Rourke's positions have become gradually clearer over the week as he has been pressed by voters and reporters. On reparations, O'Rourke initially gave a fuzzy answer Thursday in Iowa, alluding to talks he had about the issue with civil rights leader Bryan Stevenson, who O'Rourke said argued there must first be a national conversation confronting America's racist past. But under questioning six days later in New Hampshire, O'Rourke revealed that he had asked Stevenson about reparations and that \"he does not believe  and I don't believe  that should be the primary or initial focus of the conversation.\"</p><p> O'Rourke has also offered increasing clarity on health care, speaking more and more favorably about a proposal called Medicare for America that he claims would eventually get the country to universal health care without immediately axing people's employer-sponsored insurance. He gave his most precise pitch for the legislation Thursday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where an audience member asked him if he would support Medicare for All  a single-payer system  over Medicare for America. Both are good proposals that achieve universal health care, he said, but Medicare for America, \"I think, gets us there more quickly than any alternative that I've seen.\"</p><p> O'Rourke's work-in-progress platform has not thrilled everyone.</p><p> \"When are we going to get an actual policy from you instead of platitudes and nice stories?\" a woman bluntly asked him Tuesday in Pennsylvania, to which O'Rourke insisted he is \"trying to be a specific as I can.\" He pointed to a number of issues where he has prescribed specific solutions, such as Medicare for America when it comes to health care.</p><p> Other people who heard O'Rourke in his first week were more understanding.</p><p> \"I do think there's a bit of a lack of specifics, I think, but I also think, you know, we're two years out,\" said Sam Sands, a 30-year-old research fellow at the University of New Hampshire who saw O'Rourke there Wednesday. \"There's a lot of time to build policy and understand it. And I really like this plan that he has of sort of going around and listening to everybody first.\"</p><p> \"The campaign is part of the message\"</p><p> While O'Rourke stood out for how he conducted his Senate campaign in a red state like Texas, he and other 2020 candidates are facing new, mounting pressures to run their races more consistent with progressive values. He acknowledged as much Thursday in Manchester, telling reporters he thinks \"the campaign is part of the message.\"</p><p> Accordingly, O'Rourke said over the last week that he would be \"very supportive\" of unionizing his campaign if employees wanted to, something rival Bernie Sanders' campaign has already done.</p><p> He has also confronted the new standards that Democrats are seeking to create when it comes to campaign finance, an issue where he was already relatively ahead of the curve. Asked in Iowa if he would join rival Elizabeth Warren in swearing off high-dollar fundraisers  events where four-digit checks are typically solicited  he did not rule them out but said he was not planning to hold such events.</p><p> He also got a similar taste of scrutiny Monday when he announced that his campaign had raised $6.1 million in its first 24 hours. It was an astonishing number that surpassed Sanders' first-day haul, but it quickly prompted questions  most vocally from Sanders supporters  about the details of how many donors fueled that haul. O'Rourke responded to the questions Wednesday by announcing he had received over 128,000 \"unique contributions\" for an average donation size of $47, an announcement that did little to quiet skeptics who questioned why he had not released his number of individual donors like Sanders did. O'Rourke promised to release that figure as his New Hampshire trip concluded Thursday but has not done so yet.</p><p> When it comes to campaign finance, he has also been getting questions about whether he will take contributions tied to the fossil fuel industry, to which he has responded by reiterating his longtime policy against accepting PAC or lobbyist money. Yet the answer leaves open the possibility that O'Rourke could accept large donations from executives  not uncommon for candidates from both parties in oil-loving Texas  something he took a pledge against in the Senate race and was apparently found to have violated.</p><p> \"Yes, there are employees of the oil and gas industry, just as there are employees of every single industry under the sun, from you name it  people are contributing to us,\" O'Rourke said in Manchester.</p><p> Aside from campaign finance, questions have continued to follow O'Rourke about his privilege as a white man in the 2020 field  and he has continued to own up to it. After the New York Times published an interview Wednesday in which Florida Democrat Andrew Gillum, who like O'Rourke, gained national attention last year for a spirited yet failed bid for statewide office, said O'Rourke \"enjoys a set of privileges in his decision making\" that others do not, a reporter asked O'Rourke in Conway, New Hampshire, if Gillum had a point. \"Yes,\" O'Rourke said with little hesitation.</p><p> He was also quick to repent when asked about reports  including one by CNN on Wednesday  that reprised comments he made as a congressional candidate in 2012 saying the country needs to consider means-testing Social Security.</p><p> \"You asked the question has my mind changed on that  absolutely,\" O'Rourke said to a reporter in Conway. \"I think I've become a lot smarter from listening to the people that I've represented in Congress and others that understand this issue better than I do.\"</p><p> \"Is that a negative?\"</p><p> Perhaps no aspect of O'Rourke's nascent campaign has stood out more than his travel, though. While he made his debuts in the traditional early voting states after skipping them while considering a White House bid, the midwestern locales he visited in between were particularly significant. They were part of the \"blue wall\" that President Donald Trump toppled in 2016, and O'Rourke brought tough love for his party to the region, saying Democrats get what they deserve when they do not show up.</p><p> He had particularly good timing in Ohio, which he visited a day after Trump lashed out on Twitter at local union official David Green over the recent closure of General Motors' Lordstown facility. O'Rourke met Monday with Green, praising him in a conversation broadcast on Facebook Live for taking the high road in response to Trump's attacks.</p><p> Green was not the only local leader that O'Rourke consulted as he crossed the Midwest. He spoke by phone Monday with OhioU.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who considered his own presidential run earlier this year but decided against it. And as O'Rourke headed to New Hampshire, he dialed up U.S. Rep. Ann Kuster and other elected officials from the Granite State, getting advice on how to talk about the opioid crisis and New Hampshire's efforts to combat it, making note of the conversations at public events afterward.</p><p> Some of those calls came as he drove himself Tuesday from State College, Pennsylvania, to Keene, New Hampshire, a seven-hour trek that exemplified the do-it-yourself ethos of O'Rourke's Senate campaign that will be tested on the national stage. He ended up arriving over an hour late at his Keene event, where the crowd thinned out a little as attendees were encouraged to follow his journey on Facebook Live. He nonetheless received an enthusiastic reception when he got there and stuck around afterward for a long photo line.</p><p> So far, O'Rourke's unorthodox roadshow appears to have drawn far more fans than detractors. Among the fans: Dubuque County, Iowa, Recorder John Murphy, who hosted O'Rourke for a house party Saturday and offered a full-throated endorsement.</p><p> \"The one knock I heard of Beto from a friend of mine that's a consultant  he said he doesn't run a typical campaign,\" Murphy said. \"And I scratched my head and thought, 'Is that a negative?'\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKTX-b815433b92f4393615d2592ddd777b62b7a4c7fa</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289BC044B39602 NWBKTX2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VRH-WPN1-DXVP-V0CK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401983</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2435\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Glen Rose Reporter, American Consolidated Media<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

He told reporters on the first day of his presidential bid that he will \"rely on the wisdom, perspective and experience of a lot of people,\" including those from his Senate campaign as well as some fresh faces. \"That's exciting to me \u2014 and I need it,\" he said. Yet a week into his candidacy, O'Rourke had not named a campaign manager, somewhat unusual for such a high-profile contender. \"We're working on it,\" he told reporters in Independence, hours later maintaining that \"there are a number of people working together\" to run the campaign. CNN reported Thursday night[6] that O'Rourke was set to hire veteran Democratic strategist Jen O'Malley Dillon to lead his bid, though neither the candidate nor his campaign confirmed the news. Navigating the issuesO'Rourke's flurry of events \u2014 combined with his willingness to take questions from both attendees and reporters at virtually every one of them - has subjected him in a short time to a battery of thorny yet ascendant issues in the Democratic primary as well as more clear-cut litmus tests. O'Rourke's responses ranged from vague to blunt. In Durham, New Hampshire, on Wednesday, he said he does not support a universal basic income, which is being pushed by upstart rival Andrew Yang, who wants to give American adults $1,000 a month. And earlier that day in Conway, New Hampshire, O'Rourke expressed skepticism when asked about a proposal by another opponent, Elizabeth Warren, to break up Big Tech companies. \"I think the best way to approach the fact that people become products on these platforms ... is to regulate them more seriously and perhaps to treat them a little but more like a utility,\" O'Rourke said. \"I'm not sure if having five more Facebooks ... makes as much sense as regulating them, given the power that they have.\" The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one[7].On a host of other issues du jour, O'Rourke expressed an almost instinctive openness. Abolish the Electoral College? There is \"a lot of wisdom\" in that. (In his Senate campaign, he called for the \"direct election\" of the president.) Lower the voting age? \"I'm open to the idea.\" End the filibuster? \"I think that's something that we should seriously consider.\" The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one[8].Change the Supreme Court? It is worth debating whether to add more justices and give them term limits, but he is \"more partial\" to the latter. Republicans were keeping close watch as O'Rourke navigated the knottier issues, particularly when it came to abortion. He sidestepped a number of questions across multiple states involving late-term abortion, including his personal feelings toward it, saying each time he trusts women to make decisions about their bodies. On some other issues dominating the primary, O'Rourke's positions have become gradually clearer over the week as he has been pressed by voters and reporters. On reparations, O'Rourke initially gave a fuzzy answer Thursday in Iowa, alluding to talks he had about the issue with civil rights leader Bryan Stevenson, who O'Rourke said argued there must first be a national conversation confronting America's racist past. But under questioning six days later in New Hampshire, O'Rourke revealed that he had asked Stevenson about reparations and that \"he does not believe \u2014 and I don't believe \u2014 that should be the primary or initial focus of the conversation.\" O'Rourke has also offered increasing clarity on health care, speaking more and more favorably about a proposal called Medicare for America that he claims would eventually get the country to universal health care without immediately axing people's employer-sponsored insurance. He gave his most precise pitch for the legislation Thursday in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where an audience member asked him if he would support Medicare for All \u2014 a single-payer system \u2014 over Medicare for America. Both are good proposals that achieve universal health care, he said, but Medicare for America, \"I think, gets us there more quickly than any alternative that I've seen.\" O'Rourke's work-in-progress platform has not thrilled everyone. \"When are we going to get an actual policy from you instead of platitudes and nice stories?\" a woman bluntly asked him Tuesday in Pennsylvania, to which O'Rourke insisted he is \"trying to be a specific as I can.\" He pointed to a number of issues where he has prescribed specific solutions, such as Medicare for America when it comes to health care. Other people who heard O'Rourke in his first week were more understanding. The Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one[9].\"I do think there's a bit of a lack of specifics, I think, but I also think, you know, we're two years out,\" said Sam Sands, a 30-year-old research fellow at the University of New Hampshire who saw O'Rourke there Wednesday. \"There's a lot of time to build policy and understand it. And I really like this plan that he has of sort of going around and listening to everybody first.\"\"The campaign is part of the message\"While O'Rourke stood out for how he conducted his Senate campaign in a red state like Texas, he and other 2020 candidates are facing new, mounting pressures to run their races more consistent with progressive values. He acknowledged as much Thursday in Manchester, telling reporters he thinks \"the campaign is part of the message.\" Accordingly, O'Rourke said over the last week that he would be \"very supportive\" of unionizing his campaign if employees wanted to, something rival Bernie Sanders' campaign has already done. He has also confronted the new standards that Democrats are seeking to create when it comes to campaign finance, an issue where he was already relatively ahead of the curve. Asked in Iowa if he would join rival Elizabeth Warren in swearing off high-dollar fundraisers \u2014 events where four-digit checks are typically solicited \u2014 he did not rule them out but said he was not planning to hold such events. He also got a similar taste of scrutiny Monday when he announced that his campaign had raised $6.1 million in its first 24 hours. It was an astonishing number that surpassed Sanders' first-day haul, but it quickly prompted questions \u2014 most vocally from Sanders supporters \u2014 about the details of how many donors fueled that haul. O'Rourke responded to the questions Wednesday by announcing he had received over 128,000 \"unique contributions\" for an average donation size of $47, an announcement that did little to quiet skeptics who questioned why he had not released his number of individual donors like Sanders did. O'Rourke promised to release that figure as his New Hampshire trip concluded Thursday but has not done so yet. When it comes to campaign finance, he has also been getting questions about whether he will take contributions tied to the fossil fuel industry, to which he has responded by reiterating his longtime policy against accepting PAC or lobbyist money. Yet the answer leaves open the possibility that O'Rourke could accept large donations from executives \u2014 not uncommon for candidates from both parties in oil-loving Texas \u2014 something he took a pledge against in the Senate race and was apparently found to have violated[10]. \"Yes, there are employees of the oil and gas industry, just as there are employees of every single industry under the sun, from you name it \u2014 people are contributing to us,\" O'Rourke said in Manchester. Aside from campaign finance, questions have continued to follow O'Rourke about his privilege as a white man in the 2020 field \u2014 and he has continued to own up to it. After the New York Times published an interview[11] Wednesday in which Florida Democrat Andrew Gillum, who like O'Rourke, gained national attention last year for a spirited yet failed bid for statewide office, said O'Rourke 'enjoys a set of privileges in his decision making\" that others do not, a reporter asked O'Rourke in Conway, New Hampshire, if Gillum had a point. 'Yes,' O'Rourke said with little hesitation. He was also quick to repent when asked about reports \u2014 including one by CNN[12] on Wednesday \u2014 that reprised comments he made as a congressional candidate in 2012 saying the country needs to consider means-testing Social Security. \"You asked the question has my mind changed on that \u2014 absolutely,\" O'Rourke said to a reporter in Conway. \"I think I've become a lot smarter from listening to the people that I've represented in Congress and others that understand this issue better than I do.\"\"Is that a negative?\"Perhaps no aspect of O'Rourke's nascent campaign has stood out more than his travel, though. While he made his debuts in the traditional early voting states after skipping them while considering a White House bid, the midwestern locales he visited in between were particularly significant. They were part of the \"blue wall\" that President Donald Trump toppled in 2016, and O'Rourke brought tough love for his party to the region, saying Democrats get what they deserve when they do not show up. He had particularly good timing in Ohio, which he visited a day after Trump lashed out on Twitter at local union official David Green over the recent closure of General Motors' Lordstown facility. O'Rourke met Monday with Green, praising him in a conversation broadcast on Facebook Live for taking the high road in response to Trump's attacks. Green was not the only local leader that O'Rourke consulted as he crossed the Midwest. He spoke by phone Monday with OhioU.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who considered his own presidential run earlier this year but decided against it. And as O'Rourke headed to New Hampshire, he dialed up U.S. Rep. Ann Kuster and other elected officials from the Granite State, getting advice on how to talk about the opioid crisis and New Hampshire's efforts to combat it, making note of the conversations at public events afterward. Some of those calls came as he drove himself Tuesday from State College, Pennsylvania, to Keene, New Hampshire, a seven-hour trek that exemplified the do-it-yourself ethos of O'Rourke's Senate campaign that will be tested on the national stage. He ended up arriving over an hour late at his Keene event, where the crowd thinned out a little as attendees were encouraged to follow his journey on Facebook Live. He nonetheless received an enthusiastic reception when he got there and stuck around afterward for a long photo line. So far, O'Rourke's unorthodox roadshow appears to have drawn far more fans than detractors. Among the fans: Dubuque County, Iowa, Recorder John Murphy, who hosted O'Rourke for a house party Saturday and offered a full-throated endorsement. \"The one knock I heard of Beto from a friend of mine that's a consultant \u2014 he said he doesn't run a typical campaign,\" Murphy said. \"And I scratched my head and thought, 'Is that a negative?'\" Read related Tribune coverage Coming soon: a new, improved commenting experience.

O'Rourke, who officially entered the race on March 14, has emerged as a fundraising frontrunner, raking in $6.1 million in 24 hours. He gained Democratic star power during his failed 2018 Senate campaign against Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, where he brought in a whopping $80 million while eschewing PAC money[2]. However, critics point[3] to his seemingly nebulous stance on key issues[4], compared to some of his fellow 2020 competitors, who have released comprehensive policy plans. (Sen. Elizabeth Warren, for instance has released plans on affordable housing[5], universal child care[6], and regulating big tech[7].) Read more: Beto O'Rourke just endorsed a healthcare idea called 'Medicare for America' which differs in some major ways from Bernie Sanders' 'Medicare for All' plan[8] But voters are starting to get answers. He took some policy specific questions from the media on Wednesday in New Hampshire, while on a tour through all 10 counties[9] of the state, which holds the first primary and is second only to the Iowa caucus. O'Rourke was asked about Warren's calls to break up the big tech companies \u2014 Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. \u2014 by CNN national reporter Eric Bradner[10]. He responded saying that while he's not sure about breaking up the big tech companies, he does favor regulating them. For O'Rourke the \"best way to approach the fact that people have become the products on these platforms\" is to \"perhaps to treat them a little bit more like a utility.\" In his response he also touched on the fact that \"they can be used wittingly or not to undermine our democracy and affect the outcomes of our elections.\" Warren, as recently as her CNN town hall on Monday, has proposed several specific policy changes to address big tech companies, which have grown in the past several decades and are struggling with issues like user privacy, nefarious uses of platforms, and the rise of false news stories. Her plan would include appointing regulators to undo mergers of big tech companies, for example \"break Facebook away from Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon away from Whole Foods, Google away from Nest, and more,\" she explained in a campaign email[11]. It also forbids selling user data to third parties, and would include what she calls \"platform neutrality.\" During her Monday town hall, she explained that this would mean that companies could not own both the marketplace platform (Amazon for instance) and sell its own products on that marketplace (Amazon's brand of batteries for example). Other candidates like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar have also said they would like tighter regulations on big tech, INSIDER's Eliza Relman noted[12].

The rose window is what they are trying to save now and we will follow that story as that rebuilding continues. That is \"The Story\" on this Wednesday night. Thanks for joining us everybody. We'll see you back here tomorrow night at seven.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TUCKER CARLSON, FOX NEWS HOST, TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT: Good evening and welcome to TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT. Former Congressman Beto O'Rourke gave a speech to kids at the University of Virginia yesterday in Charlottesville, maybe you saw it. Beto had a microphone. He was speaking to a group of students seated in a small amphitheater, and for a moment, if closed one eye, it looked convincingly like a campaign event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There were volunteers in matching t-shirts fussing over logistics. O'Rourke himself wore a slightly dopey UVA basketball cap as he spoke because wearing other people's hats is what you're supposed to do when you run for President.</p><p>And to be clear, running for President is what Beto O'Rourke says he is doing. It's all a little sad when you think about it. O'Rourke is not going to be the President, at least of this country. His campaign is dead, totally dead. They went toes up last week from a fatal overdose of Buttigieg. Not everyone has heard the news, the morning hasn't yet started but Beto for President is done, it's over. He is Jeb Bush now.</p><p>Future generations will remember Beto O'Rourke -- if they recall him at all -- really as a media story. Remember that guy with a weird nickname that all the dummies on cable news fell in love with in a single day? That was bizarre.</p><p>And it was bizarre.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I saw him for the first time just a month ago when he sat down with Oprah and me and the rest of the people in the audience thought, \"Wow, this guy has this dynamic positive energy.\"</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, he has that raw talent. He is very kind of Obama-esque indeed.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The women voted for him in the suburbs of Houston who hadn't voted Democrat before because they had a kind of Beto crush going on.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, he's wholesome and he is earnest.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He has that gleam in his eye somebody -- Evan Smith in the \"Texas Tribune\" said seeing him is like it's like a Jesus Christ Superstar seeing this guy in front of people. He's got that celebrity aura about him.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He is the rock and roll loving, 46-year-old caught the nation's attention. His offbeat social media posts appealing to a younger generation even taking the skateboarding at What-A-Burger.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Keep in mind that just happened. The frenzy just occurred. It was just last month. College-educated adults in an advanced country with air travel and air conditioning talking like that in public. It's pretty embarrassing. My gosh.</p><p>But before we get too judge-y about, a confession -- we did it too. Beto's personal magic distorted our journalistic objectivity for a second there. It may have been the skateboarding or maybe it was the weird resemblance to a young Bobby Kennedy -- whatever it was, we lost control like everyone else.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Beto loves rock and roll, says \"GMA.\" He's not like everyone else. He doesn't do stuffy speeches or policy programs. He is not going to bore you with entitlement projections or some scary stuff about the Korean Peninsula.</p><p>Beto has got a skateboard and wears Nirvana t-shirts. His vision for this country is 1995 -- that was a year he was living way uptown and this walk- up and working as a man and you knew this dude on West 112th Street was some of the stickiest bud in Manhattan. Indica -- a little heavy, but sweet. It was a good time. Beto wants to bring us back to that time.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: We got a little carried away. Sorry about that. It all seems so innocent then, back a few weeks ago, back in March of 2019. It was just Beto and us and a dream. It was a simpler time. We thought anything was possible then. We thought we could write our own story. We didn't know that even fairytales end and one day ours did end. The magic turned to dust. Bitter in our mouths like a peyote button or psilocybin tea.</p><p>One day the music died. Bye-bye Miss American Pie. Bye-bye weirdly youthful middle-aged white guy with fake Hispanic nickname. You've been replaced. There's a new heartthrob in cable news. He is everything that you were, but more. He is younger. He is shallower. He is even less experienced. He's got an even weirder name. Plus he is gay. He is the perfect candidate for voters who say they love diversity, but don't really want to vote for Stacey Abrams.</p><p>This candidate could have been created at a lab at CNN and might have been. There's no stopping a man like this -- at least until Election Day. On some level, Beto must know it's over. He is no genius, but he can smell it.</p><p>More than six months before the first votes are cast in Iowa, he is done. Sure, he may keep raising money, he probably will. It's his one real skill, but his political career is done. Cue the sad Nirvana playlist.</p><p>So what are the lessons of the sinking of the SS Beto? Well, here's one. Maybe he should have run on something. It's pretty hard to win on charisma alone as Hillary Clinton recently discovered. So why don't be the one person in the race with real ideas? They don't have to be big ideas -- how about any idea?</p><p>Beto could have tried that. It never seemed to occur to him. Instead, he just strung together cliches. It was like one of those word games. Remember, Mad Libs - the one you used to play with your brother on the road trips. You get these long seemingly coherent sentences that when you read them don't actually mean anything. Beto was big on those. Here's Beto doing that on the Green New Deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BETO O'ROURKE (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: This country was willing to sacrifice, men and women, all over the United States to make sure that we defeated Germany and that we won that war, and for the following 75 years that we made this world safe for democracy.</p><p>The Green New Deal calls that sacrifice and service and scale -- scale of commitment to mind when it talks about the challenges that we face today.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Those are the questions that Beto asked just yesterday at UVA. So the question for the rest of us is, are voters ready to suffer -- I don't know 400,000 U.S. combat deaths for the sake of the climate? What does that carbon dioxide Guadalcanal look like? A CO2 Saipan? Will we get to bomb Tokyo again with fire bombs? How would that affect the temperature?</p><p>Come on. This is just too stupid. None of this is real. The Green New Deal isn't a deal. It's fulfillment posing as legislation. But here's the thing. Beto kept a straight face throughout that talk like he really sincerely meant it. Who does that?</p><p>Well, mediocre people do that. Mediocre people tell implausible lies and then demand that you pretend to believe them. Is Beto a mediocre person? We'll let you decide.</p><p>In 2017, Beto O'Rourke gave a total of less than one percent of his income. One third of one percent to be precise to charity and keep in mind, he is rich -- very rich. Here is his explanation for why he did that.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>O'ROURKE: I've served in public office since 2005. I do my best to contribute to the success of my community, of my state and now, of my country. There are ways that I do this that are measurable, and there are ways that I do this that are immeasurable. There are charities that we donate to that we recorded and itemized, others that we don't donate to that we have not.</p><p>But I'll tell you, I'm doing everything I can right now, spending this time with you, not with our kiddos, not back home in El Paso because I want to sacrifice everything to make sure that we meet this moment of truth with everything that we've got.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Okay, so save that tape. It's on the internet -- that's from UVA yesterday and you're going to want to download that and keep that for your grandchildren because Beto -- pedestrian as he is in so many ways -- just did something that has never been done or even attempted by any politician before. That is a unique contribution to American political life.</p><p>Beto has just made the case that his entire life -- Beto's entire life -- is a kind of charitable donation. All of us get the gift of Beto just because he is here. Every time Beto speaks, it's like endowing a library in Burma or curing shingles in Malawi or battling childhood obesity in Appalachia or sending mosquito nets to the Congo, by the millions.</p><p>Every time he talks, when he tweets it's an act of charity. It's something that makes this world wiser and kinder and more decent and better smelling. Beto is such a good person that he could write himself off his taxes if he wanted to. The IRS would have to let him. His goodness is so clearly deductible. No lawyer would contest that.</p><p>But Beto doesn't do that. He doesn't shirk his duty. He'll pay the extra tax because he cares that much. Whew. Now that you think about it, it's most said he'll never be President.</p><p>Ben Shapiro host one of America's top podcast, \"The Ben Shapiro Show.\" He is the author of the book, \"The Right Side of History,\" and we're happy to have him on set tonight in Los Angeles. Ben, it's great to see you. Thank you for being here.</p><p>BEN SHAPIRO, PODCAST HOST, THE BEN SHAPIRO SHOW: And I kept a straight face for you there.</p><p>CARLSON: I did. There are so many levels here, but I do believe that this is the end of the Beto O'Rourke phenomenon.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Yes, I think he's toast.</p><p>CARLSON: What are the lessons that we should draw from what we just saw?</p><p>SHAPIRO: Well, I think that you can run in the moderate lane as the Bobby Kennedy candidate so long as there's not anything newer on the block. Buttigieg came along and drank his milkshake and he had some intersectional credibility.</p><p>The problem for Beto is that he happened to be straight and also white, just like Bobby Kennedy was. Buttigieg is gay, so therefore, he takes precedence. And also, he speaks more languages like Norwegian, which is a language that is very much in vogue with the media these days he doesn't just play a guitar, he also plays piano and he does it with Ben Folds Five and the whole deal.</p><p>So Buttigieg has basically stolen all of his momentum and I think you're right, I mean I think Beto is toast here.</p><p>CARLSON: Speaking Norwegian and playing the piano -- and I'm being sincere -- are actually impressive ...</p><p>SHAPIRO: No, they are cool, I mean ...</p><p>CARLSON: ... things to do, for sure and I'm impressed by them, but they're not really policy prescriptions. They're not ideas that are going to improve America and neither is who you sleep with relevant to running the country as far as I can tell or any of these criteria meaningful. So like where's the part we get to debate their ideas for the country?</p><p>SHAPIRO: Well, the problem is obviously that there is only one thought leader in the Democratic Party right now and that's Bernie Sanders and what you're seeing is a bunch of candidates who are attempting to steer into the Bernie Sanders lane and there's no room in that lane.</p><p>Bernie Sanders has occupied that entire lane and you talk about ideas and candidates. The one candidate who keeps shouting ideas from the rooftops is of course our Native American candidate, Elizabeth Warren who keeps spouting ideas every five minutes. There's a new policy prescription. Why isn't anyone paying attention to me? And the answer is because you are in Bernie Sanders' lane. He is the thought leader in this lane.</p><p>Well, in the moderate lane, there are no thought leaders. There are just a bunch of people with platitudes.</p><p>Biden is presumably the thought leader, but Joe Biden doesn't have enough thoughts to be a thought leader and so who exactly is going to come along and occupy that lane while still being able to win over \"the woke\" intersectional base of the Democratic Party? Whoever does that has a possibility at the nomination.</p><p>Right now, Buttigieg can do that only in so far as he can speak the platitudes that sound moderate, but when he's actually pegged down as you've noted, he's just as far left as Bernie Sanders.</p><p>CARLSON: This is a guy telling us what a great Christian he is, who is for abortion up until birth and for sex selection. Spare me your Christian talk, please. It's absurd. I'm just struck though by Bernie could be the one guy -- I mean, I want to have a conversation about ideas because I think it's important and clearly, we need to make some changes to the way the country is going.</p><p>But Bernie doesn't really seem to be an ideas' candidate when you listen to him. He almost never says anything. Unlike Elizabeth Warren, he never says anything interesting. Why is that?</p><p>SHAPIRO: Well, I mean I think that his ideas are so radical, but they are consistent and so everybody has followed him out to the fringe. So you can shout Medicare-for-All and what you'll see is every Democrat then pay homage to Medicare-for-All. Footnote: we don't really want Medicare-for- All, we want sort of a gradualistic plan that may achieve Medicare-for-all sometime in the future. But everybody is trying to imitate Bernie.</p><p>Bernie is the guy who is really running this race. Bernie is almost in a position right now that Trump was in in 2016 where everybody in the Democratic Party who is running is afraid to take him off because they hope that eventually, he'll collapse and they'll get his support. But he is riding at 25 percent to 30 percent in virtually all of the polls that support is extraordinarily durable.</p><p>I don't think that it's going anywhere and so he can just steer that way and he could win Iowa, he could win New Hampshire. He could do well in California and New York. There's a reason that Democrats are running scared of Bernie and what is puzzling to me is that they are so interested in what the journalists on Twitter say, this kind of echo chamber in the media say that they won't just go to where the mainstream of their own party is, which is the moderate area, right?</p><p>Joe Biden is a terrible candidate. He is actually leading in most of these polls because he is perceived as a moderate.</p><p>CARLSON: Totally true.</p><p>SHAPIRO: But that is true of Beto and Buttigieg by the way. The reason both of them were doing well for a moment there was because they are both perceived as moderate with all of the platitudes and then when you gets down to policy, it turns out that they want to be more like Bernie than like Biden. Nobody in the Democratic Party actually has the stones to run as a moderate inside the Democratic Party even though it's probably the best possible way for them to win the nomination.</p><p>CARLSON: And I think you're absolutely right and your diagnosis is that they are captive of social media and that's why --</p><p>SHAPIRO: I think they're captive of social media. I think that they're captive of the intersectional woke base. I think they're afraid that they are going to be held hostage to the dictates of the \"New York Times\" Editorial Board and people suggesting that they're not woke enough if they don't pay homage to the latest flavor -- slavery reparations or whatever it is today.</p><p>CARLSON: I think the person who gives the finger to that mob gets the support of millions.</p><p>SHAPIRO: I think that's right and then has a good shot in the general.</p><p>CARLSON: Right.</p><p>SHAPIRO: But I don't think any of them have the actual stones to do it.</p><p>CARLSON: He'll probably get my support. I mean, if someone were to stand up and say, \"You know what, I'm not taking orders from you.\" How does that sound? I almost -- you don't even care what the person is for. I'd probably vote for him because I'm so desperate for that.</p><p>SHAPIRO: I mean that is why if a Democrat actually were able to do that, they would win sweeping support, but they can't do that. But we've been saying this for years, all you have to do is not be crazy and they can't stop themselves. They just can't.</p><p>CARLSON: So good. Ben Shapiro. Great to see you.</p><p>SHAPIRO: Good to see you, too.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you for that. All they have to do is not be crazy and they can't do it. Put that on your fridge. All right, after the break, Bernie Sanders has become a rich man by attacking other people getting rich under our system of capitalism. Now, he denies that his success reflects that either capitalism or the American Dream actually work. What is he saying exactly? We'll find out after the break and then there are new developments in the ongoing corruption scandal which points to the deeper corruption, which is almost total in our higher education and we'll give you another set of details after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Andrew Yang is running for President of the United States. He is a Democrat. We disagree with him on plenty of issues, but he's a serious person. He is smart and he cares and he has a pretty deep understanding of the problems the country faces and so he may be the one person running this year who is pitching a series of reforms that might actually help the country, particularly the middle class.</p><p>One of his proposals is worth telling you about. It's about the salary of top government officials. So currently, the President of the United States makes four hundred grand a year. The position of course is far more lucrative than that for most Presidents. A former President can give speeches for hundreds of thousands per -- and they do -- they can serve on corporate boards, the can and in effect, really, spend the rest of their lives cashing in on the position they held as President -- and they have.</p><p>Bill Clinton has made more than a hundred million dollars from being a former President since he left office in 2000. Former Cabinet members and top regulators get rich the same way on a smaller scale, but still. And it's not hard to see what this does to the country.</p><p>Our leaders have a big incentive to defend the winners of our current system because they're paid by those winners. Bank regulators go to work at banks if they make bankers happy. Tech regulators join up with Google or Facebook. Their only incentive to promote the public good is the kindness of their hearts. Up against that is all the accrued wealth of global capitalism, so it's not really a fair fight.</p><p>I am not attacking anyone, it's just the way it works. The system itself is inherently corrupt and in abets corruption and it acts inherently against your interests. And Yang has a solution for this, and it's not stupid. It's this. Increase the pay of our top officials by a lot. Take the President's pay up to four million bucks a year. Pay top regulators a million dollars a year. Here's the catch.</p><p>Presidents would be banned from joining corporate boards or giving speeches for money. Regulators would be banned from cashing in on the private side of the fields they regulated. They'll make a lot more money while they do their job, but their only incentive will be promoting the good of the country, not enriching themselves afterward.</p><p>If Yang's idea has a flaw, it's only that it does not go far enough. Why wouldn't we apply these same rules to Members of Congress? Hike their pay, but bar them from cashing in as lobbyists are joining corporate boards the moment they leave. We should do that immediately because public service should be service. It's not a way to enrich yourself for life. If we did that, the rest of us could stop being as cynical as we justifiably are about their behavior on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Well, speaking of being cynical about people's motives, Bernie Sanders is the most high-profile socialist in the world, but he doesn't live like one. He has become very rich by the way, ironically, promoting a book about socialism and how great it is.</p><p>Sanders is a capitalist success story. We may in fact say that he embodies the American Dream, but on this channel two nights ago, he insisted that's not the case at all. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRET BAIER, FOX NEWS HOST: You know when you wrote the book and you made the money, isn't that the definition of capitalism and the American Dream?</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: No. I mean, you know, what we want is a country where everybody has opportunity. You know, I have a college degree, okay, I'm a United States Senator. But a lot of people don't have a college degree. A lot of people are not United States senators.</p><p>So what we are fighting for, Bret, is a society not where just a few people can make a whole lot of money, but a society where everybody in this country has the opportunity to live in security and dignity.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: Nomiki Konst is a former Bernie Sanders surrogate and she joins tonight. Nomiki, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>NOMIKI KONST, FORMER BERNIE SANDERS SURROGATE: Hi, Tucker, how are you?</p><p>CARLSON: So I'm not begrudging Sanders writing a book, good for him and it doesn't bother me that he got paid for it either. But I have two concerns. One is, why not just say that that is in fact the American Dream and you did something that people found impressive and you got rewarded, why not just say that?</p><p>KONST: I think the American Dream is a much bigger idea. What he was arguing is that we have a select few 0.1 percent who have effectively lobbied to get away with not paying taxes or not paying their fair share of taxes, so when we talk about Bernie Sanders making $580,000.00 or so last year on the sales of his books, that's not about the American Dream. Everybody should have the opportunity to be able to pay their bills, to be able to pay for their rent, to not live in debt. That is unfortunately the American Dream, just survival at this point.</p><p>So when he taught -- you know, the American Dream is not what we had considered in the 50s and 60s when millionaires and billionaires paid 70 percent in taxes. You know, the working people --</p><p>CARLSON: But why isn't Bernie -- but then, okay, I get it. I get it and some of what you're saying I agree with and it's true and we need to have a country where ordinary people with an IQ of a hundred and no special access can raise a family. I completely agree with that.</p><p>But why is Bernie pocketing the money? So why wouldn't Bernie be paying 70 percent tax on those book royalties voluntarily? I mean he wrote the book as a sideline project while serving as a Federal official, okay, so why is he taking all that money and spending on a second home? I'm serious.</p><p>KONST: Well, his second home was actually inherited by a family member who passed away, so that's not what he spent it on.</p><p>CARLSON: One of his second homes. One of his second homes.</p><p>KONST: This is a conspiracy theory that has been perpetuated on like conspiracy theory blogs. But furthermore, you know, who voluntarily --</p><p>CARLSON: Okay, I am not a conspiracy blogger. I just -- well, why wouldn't he?</p><p>KONST: Who voluntarily pays 70 percent in taxes? We need a tax policy for all, so we have a more equitable society. Right now, the 0.1 percent are not paying their share.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, wait a second. Didn't you just -- okay, but he's in in the one percent.</p><p>KONST: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: And so am I. I'm not attacking rich people. Again I am one. I'm just also not Bernie Sanders, so Bernie Sanders is out there like \"Oh people who make this amount of money (the same amount he makes) should pay their fair share.\" I asked you well why isn't he paying his fair share, 70 percent, the tax rate that you cited and you said, \"Who would do that voluntarily?\"</p><p>KONST: Because that's not the law.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, I don't know. If you're Bernie Sanders --</p><p>KONST: You don't have to do that.</p><p>CARLSON: Why would you do it voluntarily?</p><p>KONST: Oh, come on, Tucker. Like, this is a joke.</p><p>CARLSON: No, I'm serious.</p><p>KONST: The point is you have --</p><p>CARLSON: But what's the answer? Why is it a joke?</p><p>KONST: You have 0.1 percent -- 0.1 percent lobbying Congress so that they don't have to pay taxes, which is why our roads are a mess, our infrastructure is a mess. Schools aren't functioning.</p><p>CARLSON: Couldn't agree more.</p><p>KONST: Which is why we are not funding NASA and science and fighting climate change.</p><p>CARLSON: I agree with every word you're saying.</p><p>KONST: We need -- he makes it about --</p><p>CARLSON: Now, you've lost me on the climate nonsense, okay, but --</p><p>KONST: He needs to make it -- he makes it about the most elite not exploiting workers so they don't have to pay taxes, but so that all of us have a chance.</p><p>CARLSON: Okay, I'm just going to give you one last chance super quick, super quick -- why doesn't anybody who ever espouses these tax rates ever voluntarily pay them? It's a sincere question.</p><p>KONST: Because that's not how our government functions. Where do send that form? To the IRS?</p><p>CARLSON: But why wouldn't you lead by example?</p><p>KONST: Hi, IRS, here's a check for 70 percent. That's not how it works.</p><p>CARLSON: To the general fund, yes, U.S. Treasury, people do that.</p><p>KONST: Systemically, I mean, who does that?</p><p>CARLSON: I mean, why not make that work that way?</p><p>KONST: I would love to see one guest on your show that has actually given their entire paycheck.</p><p>CARLSON: Hey, if it's such a good idea for other people, I was wondering, it's like --</p><p>KONST: It is a good idea for the law to be passed.</p><p>CARLSON: It's like gun control. It's like, you should disarm. You should disarm, but not me. I'm not disarming. You go first. The water is fine. Jump in.</p><p>KONST: We are saying that. We need a broad reform of tax policy so working people have an opportunity and so that our government infrastructure and schools are funded.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, let's Bernie go first. I've got it. I've got it. I am with you. Nomiki, good to see you. Thank you.</p><p>KONST: Tucker, you're so silly.</p><p>CARLSON: I know. The Varsity Blues college bribery scandal could be expanding to involve criminal charges against the kids who benefited. What? Plus, Adam Carolla is here in Los Angeles to respond to that growing scandal. After the break.</p><p>CARLSON: Lori Loughlin and her husband have pleaded not guilty to charges that they used fraudulent means to get their daughters into the University of Southern California. Now prosecutors have widened the probe. They are investigating whether one of those daughters knew what her parents were doing. Trace Gallagher has been on the story from day one and he joins us now.</p><p>TRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Tucker, this is bad news for students involved in the scandal because legal experts say it indicates that some of them could soon face their own charges. \"The Daily Mail\" is reporting that Lori Loughlin's daughter, Olivia Jade Giannulli got a letter from the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston saying she was also a subject of the investigation.</p><p>It's unclear if Loughlin's oldest daughter, Isabella, also got a letter but experts say prosecutors are making it clear they believe the kids knew about the cheating scandal and were willing participants and it's hard to imagine the daughters didn't think something was up when they got recruited to be on the University of Southern California crew team knowing that neither one of them had ever rowed.</p><p>They also sent pictures on their applications of them in rowing attire on rowing machines. That's tough to explain away. IT'S unclear if Olivia Jade has her own lawyer. This is also an indication that the cheating probe isn't wrapping up, instead it's expanding.</p><p>Meantime, Lorie Loughlin is reportedly concerned that if she and her husband, the fashion designer Massimo Guinnulli go to trial that her daughters will have to testify. Many the analysts say that Loughlin and Giannulli are in desperate need of a plea deal and a source now tells \"People Magazine\" the couple resents how the case is playing out in public quoting here, \"This is putting unspeakable stress on her and her family. They're having to play this out all publicly and they're fair game for jokes and memes, but also outraged by people who are saying that they are cheaters.\"</p><p>Of course if they accept a plea deal or get convicted, they are cheaters, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Don't call me a cheater, Trace. I'm a rower -- a varsity rower.</p><p>GALLAGHER: We'd love the picture of you --</p><p>CARLSON: There's a distinction. Great to see you. Thank you.</p><p>GALLAGHER: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: You may have noticed, the show is in Los Angeles this week. While here, we headed across town to the studios in race car garage of podcast host, our friend Adam Carolla. He loves to race. We've covered a lot of ground. Tonight, he shares his thoughts on the college bribery scandal. It's interesting. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CARLSON: Famous actors have everything they want in the world, all their needs catered to, why would they of all people bribe their kids into college? Why would they care where their kids went to college?</p><p>ADAM CAROLLA, HOST AND COMEDIAN: You know famous actors are famously narcissistic and your kid in their mind -- in the mind of a narcissist, your kid is an extension of you, so you put on a very expensive Rolex and you're not the Rolex, but the Rolex is an extension of you, you know. Or you drive a Rolls Royce. That's an extension.</p><p>What's the difference between your kid and a Rolls Royce? Your kid and a mansion? Your kid and fancy jewelry? I mean, if you really think about it, if you said would you drive a Rolls Royce? Would you wear an expensive watch? And if the answer is yes, well then your kid is closer to you than that is and a greater expression of you than the watch and so the better your kid is, the bigger the Rolex, the bigger the diamonds, the bigger the Rolls Royce.</p><p>CARLSON: So I mean you're really a narcissist if you're seeing your children that way, not as human beings, but as accessories.</p><p>CAROLLA: Well, I mean we all hate the moms, the pageant mom who take the five-year-old and spray-tan them and put all the makeup on them and lash extenders and then they go, \"Oh that's what she wants to do.\" Which I always like.</p><p>Like, all right, we hate that mom. What's the difference? I mean if you really think about it, like one is we think of what one is healthy, your child is going to Stanford. The activity is healthy, but what motivates the activity in a way comes from the same place, right? So either mom is in the audience at the Miss --</p><p>CARLSON: Totally right.</p><p>CAROLLA: Little Miss Sunshine, doing this.</p><p>CARLSON: The Junior Jacksonville.</p><p>CAROLLA: Right or the mom is at Stanford doing this, it's kind of an extension of the same mom. One is a kind of educated and wealthy and evolved mom and the other one is a little more trailer-trash, but either way, all roads lead to narcissism.</p><p>CARLSON: I really wish the Stanford mom could know how much she has in common with the pageant mom.</p><p>CAROLLA: Well, the thing that's funny is the Stanford mom would never stop making fun of the pageant mom.</p><p>CARLSON: Of course, of course.</p><p>CAROLLA: She'd be looking down her nose, \"Oh honey boo-boo have fun with your young child who'll be serving my child when they stop at the Del Taco 14 years from now.\" But the place is the same. I mean it emanates from the same place, it's just a different version of it.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CARLSON: That conversation went on for quite some time. We'll be hitting it again and again. We've got a lot with Adam Carolla. Fantastic.</p><p>Well Chicago State's Attorney Kim Foxx claimed that she'd recused herself from the Jussie Smollett case, it turns out that was not quite true or maybe true at all. Newly released text messages revealed that Foxx was pressured or she pressured rather an underling to go easy on Smollett. Our own Matt Finn is in Chicago with this story tonight still unfolding -- Matt.</p><p>MATT FINN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Tucker, these new text messages indicate that Kim Foxx continued to discuss the Smollett case with some of her staff even after she publicly claims she recused herself and we now know that she did not legally recuse herself from this case.</p><p>On March 8th, the day that Smollett's 16 felony counts became public, Foxx texted her first assistant State's Attorney, Joseph Magats in part quote, \"So I'm recused, but when people accuse us of overcharging cases, 16 counts on a Class 4 felony, it becomes Exhibit A.\" Foxx continued, \"Pedophile with four victims, 10 counts. Washed up celeb who lied to cops, 16. Just because we can charge something doesn't mean we have to.\"</p><p>It appears there, Foxx was referring to singer R. Kelly as the pedophile and Jussie Smollett as a washed-up celeb who lied to cops. The text also reveals Chicago's top cop, Eddie Johnson called the morning the charges were suddenly dropped.</p><p>Foxx texted in part quote, \"He was told we were just dropping the case. He seemed satisfied with the explanation.\" Johnson was apparently not satisfied hours after that text. He said justice was not served. Foxx has responded to some of these texts she sent to her first Assistant State's Attorney Joe Magats, writing in part, quote, \"After the indictment became public, I reached out to Joe to discuss reviewing office policies to assure consistencies in our charging and our use of appropriate charging authority.\"</p><p>Cook County Inspector General is reviewing Kim Foxx's decision. The National District Attorneys Association and the Illinois Prosecutors Bar both rebuked Kim Foxx for not recusing her entire office from this case -- Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Matt Finn, thanks for that report live from Chicago for us tonight. Up ahead, Breitbart and a number of other news outlets on the right are being suppressed by powerful tech companies because they aren't reliable. Interesting. Waiting for that same standard to be applied to the perpetrators of the Russia hoax, going to be waiting a while. I'll speak to the editor of Breitbart after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: So the people who run big journalism are always telling you we need to get a handle on fake news. Fake news -- in the interest of the public, we need to get fake news off our screens. You know what that really means and now it's clear what it really means. Enforcing an official narrative and stamping out all dissent.</p><p>CNN and MSNBC for example spent two full years perpetuating the Russia hoax. \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" did the same and won a Pulitzer Prize for it. The whole story was a complete sham, but they were not held to account. They're still considered reliable news by the big tech companies.</p><p>Meanwhile, \"The Federalist,\" a pretty small website got the Russia story right from day one and yet \"USA Today\" recently blacklisted \"The Federalist\" as an unreliable source because they don't like \"The Federalist\" politics, their views on abortion for example.</p><p>Last year, meanwhile, Wikipedia's editors banned the use of Breitbart as a source because it was deemed quote \"not reliable,\" meaning they hadn't helped stoke baseless fears about Vladimir Putin, apparently.</p><p>Alex Marlow is the editor-in-chief of Breitbart and we're happy to have him on our set tonight. Alex, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>ALEX MARLOW, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, BREITBART: Tucker, thanks for the time. I appreciate it.</p><p>CARLSON: So what does this mean in practical terms that Wikipedia users can no longer use Breitbart as a citation?</p><p>MARLOW: Yes, I think in practical terms what it means is that people who would access Wikipedia as a source are only going to get establishment media outlets to source their claims and we know those claims, they treat full-on hoaxes as fact. They've missed these seminal stories of our time starting with I think the immigration crisis which really we started reporting on in conservative media particularly Breitbart 2014-2015, they missed the Brexit narrative. They missed the narrative that the establishment in our media and political classes and our coastal elite losing touch with the working men and women in flyover country. They missed that. They missed of course the election of Donald Trump, and now - -</p><p>CARLSON: No, not a big thing.</p><p>MARLOW: That's a minor thing, a minor thing that they totally air-balled and now we're a year and a half maybe two and a half years arguably into the Russia hoax. This is their Jonestown, the media. This is their mass suicide effort but will it be treated like that? No, because they're a bubble of elite and they treat themselves as if they'll always be correct.</p><p>CARLSON: What's so interesting is not simply that they're evading all responsibility for what they did, for the lies they told and the distortions that really kind of wrecked our foreign policy among other things, but that they're trying to suppress other news outlets which told the truth. How Orwellian is that?</p><p>MARLOW: You nailed it here. They're not suppressing us and they're targeting you. They target us and they'll target just about all of us right-of-center and who service a right-of-center audience not because we're getting things wrong, they're targeting us because we're getting things right. That we got these key stories right and we'll probably get the next key stories right and they're doing it in a methodical way that started with Google kind of toying with their searches which you've been very good at reporting on with Dr. Robert Epstein.</p><p>Twitter with the shadow banning which we broke at Breitbart, it was called a hoax at the time. It turned out it wasn't. Facebook had to change their algorithm because places like Breitbart were dominating and it goes on. Wikipedia kicking us out. Our Wikipedia, it shows up every time you use Google and Facebook, they rely on Wikipedia. This is methodical and they'll continue to expand this.</p><p>Microsoft is now in the blacklisting game. They teamed with this group called News Guard which is of course, they sanction all the places that got the Russia hoax wrong and they treat places like Breitbart and even the Drudge Report as fake news.</p><p>It's ridiculous and they'll continue. Next is going to be de-banking. They're going to decapitalize people, not just with right-of-center world views. They're doing this with people who even want to have a pipeline, who want to work in the energy sector and our woke fascists who want the Green New Deal. It's insane.</p><p>CARLSON: Since free speech is dying and what's killing it is not government, but big monopolies sanctioned by government, do you know anyone in government who might be able to save free speech for the Republic? Why is nobody doing anything about this?</p><p>MARLOW: I don't know and that's exactly the question I was hoping you would ask, because I do hope that this is the most powerful audience in all of news and I think that it would be great if the people and the powerful folks who are watching it understand that this is the battle. They are trying to win the 2020 election by shutting down and censor the outlets that might give voices to the voiceless, the people disenfranchised.</p><p>CARLSON: You really think you're going to get reelected President if nobody can hear your message?</p><p>MARLOW: Absolutely, they see this crystal clear and that's why they're trying to shut down you and me.</p><p>CARLSON: That's exactly right. Alex Marlow, come back anytime. Great to see you.</p><p>MARLOW: Thank you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Thank you very much. Well not too many things genuinely unite the Democratic Party, one that does though is abortion. The party loves it. It wants more of it up until birth maybe a little bit after if possible.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. CORY BOOKER (D-NJ), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Generations from now, our children and grandchildren will wonder, what did we do? What did we do when they were trying to take away a woman's right to control her own body?</p><p>SEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND (D-NY), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Whether we are going to arresting women for making decisions about their bodies.</p><p>O'ROURKE: That that should be a decision that the woman makes about her own body. I trust her.</p><p>SEN. KAMALA HARRIS (D-CA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: What's at stake is whether or not we will continue to recognize or not a woman's right to choose.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Women's access to safe, legal abortions on the line.</p><p>SANDERS: The decision over abortion belongs to a woman and her physician, not the Federal government, not the state government and not the local government.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: So what's the motive behind all of this? The autonomy of women? That's a little abstract. It's not quite it. It's not really what's going on. Well God bless former Georgia gubernatorial candidate, Stacey Abrams for telling the unadorned truth about it. This is about business. It's about making sure that women can be obedient workers rather than harried mothers.</p><p>Hurting business by restricting abortion she says is evil, said it right out loud. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STACEY ABRAMS, FORMER GEORGIA GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATE: We have to be a state that is not only friendly to business, we've got to be friendly to the women who work in these businesses. You should not have to worry about your ability to control your bodily autonomy because the governor has pushed such an abominable and evil bill that is so restrictive. It's not only bad for morality and our humanity, it's bad for business.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CARLSON: There's something creepy about this. There are a lot of things about this topic that nobody ever says out loud, but here's one of them because it's true. You can look it up on the CDC website.</p><p>African-American women are five times as likely as white women to get abortions in this country. In New York City, more black children are aborted than born. Now, the Democratic Party will tell you forever that it loves African-Americans, but why is it pushing abortion on them? And by the way why is it continuing to import low-wage labor to dilute the political power of people whose families have been in this country for 400 years? No one ever ask those questions. Somebody should.</p><p>David Webb hosts \"Reality Check\" with David Webb on Fox Nation and he joins us tonight. David, thanks a lot for coming on.</p><p>DAVID WEBB, FOX NATION HOST, REALITY CHECK WITH DAVID WEBB: Great to see you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: I mean, that's the question that always pops up in my mind and I guess you're not allowed to say it, but then I thought I'm almost 50, why do I care? I really -- it's a sincere question. If somebody says, \"I really care about you. I really love you. You really should consider abortion.\" Does the person really love me, actually? I don't think so.</p><p>WEBB: Tucker, this goes to a level of dangerous action by the Democratic Party that has pushed something that has changed the culture in the black community where young black women are not being taught responsibility for their bodies, but they're actually being taught that if you are irresponsible and sometimes accidents do happen, let's be fair, young people do this and it happens.</p><p>CARLSON: Sure, yes, of course.</p><p>WEBB: But if you're irresponsible, then it's easy to get rid of it and abortion is your answer because they never want to solve the actual problem, Tucker. Think about it. You're a free-market guy. We've talked about this over the years. If you reduce the rate of pregnancies, what do you do? You reduce the rate of abortions.</p><p>If you educate young black women, if you educate them on what getting pregnant does to your body and by the way educate young black men they play a role in this and what it does to your education, to your earnings capability to getting ahead in life -- and by the way, it keeps you in poverty.</p><p>That rate of abortions in young black women correlates to single-parent birth and by the way, not just young black women, but single-parent birth and poverty in this country in medical terms that's an epidemic.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, yes, I wouldn't even say on a gut level I'm struck by it. I mean, if you love somebody, I mean you love your own children and so you want your kids to have as many kids as they want to have because you love them and you want to see them reproduce, okay?</p><p>So again, if I'm saying to you, you probably shouldn't reproduce and let me make it really easy for you not to, what am I really saying to you? That's not a message of love actually. I don't care what anybody says. You know what I'm saying that's not a message of love. It's something very different from that actually. It's something really dark.</p><p>WEBB: It's onerous and something very dangerous because you are destroying the culture and the future of young women in young men for that matter again let's not forget that half of the equation because you're tearing the family unit apart. You're tearing the community apart and you're not teaching them to grow up to be responsible people.</p><p>It's just something that is so dangerous that we have to look at it for what it is -- cultural destruction by a bunch of liars in power.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes, well that's clearly that's clearly true. David Webb, thanks very much. Great to see you.</p><p>WEBB: Good to see you, Tucker.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, last year, and we're glad this happened, plastic straws were purged from restaurants. Man, those were dangerous, but the people who did it are still unhappy so they have a new target, something else to be angry about and take away from you for your own good. We will tell you what it is after the break.</p><p>CARLSON: The government thought long and hard about how to completely humiliate Patriots owner, Robert Kraft. He wasn't simply charged with soliciting a prostitute, prosecutors also suggested he was somehow involved with human trafficking. He is in his mid-70s. That's a far more serious offense, but having damaged Kraft's reputation, prosecutors now admit that it wasn't true. They have no evidence he did anything to do with human trafficking, but they're still intent on humiliating him, so they're trying to release a recording of Kraft allegedly meeting with women to receive sexual services.</p><p>So if the video really does show that, it's by definition pornography, why would we want to see that? How does it advance the cause of justice? It doesn't. It doesn't help the public in any way. It only hurts Robert Kraft. This is about the state and the press colluding as they so often do to humiliate people they don't like and keep in mind, if they can do it to Bob Kraft, they can do it to you -- for real.</p><p>Well, in a blitzkrieg campaign last year, liberals across America got plastic straws banned in many cities and restricted it in entire states. Life got a little bit worse for normal people, but not bad enough. So now liberals in California have a new target. No, it's not actually something there's too much of like heroin or human feces on the sidewalk. Those are everywhere, but that's totally cool, human expression. Instead they're going after hotel shampoo bottles, a problem you didn't know existed.</p><p>A group of lawmakers in this state want to ban those completely. Anyone who breaks the law could be fined 500 bucks for every offense.</p><p>Tammy Bruce is -- we're not sure if she is an offender of this would-be law, but she has a radio show host and president of the Independent Women's Voice, and she joins us tonight. Do you feel safe for now?</p><p>TAMMY BRUCE, PRESIDENT, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S VOICE: I feel weirdly safer that you're the one in California and I'm out here in New York, so I'm going to leave that to you.</p><p>CARLSON: It's just weird.</p><p>BRUCE: Look, this is where look this is a proposed bill. It's stupid. You've got people of course, they're saying it because of the plastic in the ocean, but here's the truth of the matter. A headline in \"Forbes\" last year, five Asian countries dumped more plastic into oceans than everybody else combined -- China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam. The United States is not the problem. Californians strangely enough are not the problem and yet they banned the straws, they're banning the plastic bags and now, it's the little tiny shampoo bottles that you can't have them in hotels or in any kind of rental or in the resorts because we're going to save the oceans.</p><p>The problem with this of course is that people think they're doing something to help the problem and they're not, but as you've mentioned, in California, you can relieve yourself on the street. You can smoke marijuana to your heart's content, but God help you, should you have one of those Lilliputian bottles of Listerine that now is the problem.</p><p>So take a good whiff of California air, Tucker because with the poo on the street and with nobody being able to shampoo, it's going to start smelling pretty bad in the Golden State.</p><p>CARLSON: This isn't a -- there's a reason they call it the Golden State, sadly, but this is an assault on cleanliness, you're totally right and I of course didn't connect the dots because I'm in California and a little high to be honest, but that's what it is, it's an assault on cleanliness.</p><p>BRUCE: Well, look the tiny bottles suggest also, look there's droughts all the time. When you get into that shower in the hotel, the tiny bottle says to you, \"Make it quick.\" You've got enough for maybe like a quarters' worth of shampoo and don't linger. Don't linger in there. This is a brief visit.</p><p>They're saying you should put in dispensers like in a spa. Well then you're going to spend an hour in the shower using all the water and then of course that will be a crime. So I'm waiting for the guy --</p><p>CARLSON: The law of unintended consequence.</p><p>BRUCE: That's it. Everything they touch ends up being making things worse and in this case, that will be the issue as well. Trust me and I'm going go buy a hundred of the little bottles when I leave here and that's all I'm going to use in my own bathroom.</p><p>CARLSON: I agree, along with some incandescent light bulbs.</p><p>BRUCE: That's right.</p><p>CARLSON: Put that in my shower. Tammy Bruce, great to see you tonight. Thank you for that.</p><p>BRUCE: Thank you, dear. See you later.</p><p>CARLSON: We're out of time, amazingly. Things go fast. Life goes fast. Enjoy every second of it. We have. We'll be back tomorrow night 8:00 p.m. The show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Good night from Los Angeles ...</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2019041701cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VX8-J7H1-DXH2-649M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8294\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 17, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Election</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Polls</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Homosexuality</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Policy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tax</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Education</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Scandal</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Journalism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Abortion</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjE4Nzc5N0NGQTVDNDhDMkJEQjFEQURGRjBGRURDRkM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000271</classCode><className>CENSORSHIP</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001371</classCode><className>HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001812</classCode><className>VOTERS &amp;

And my ham-handed attempt to try to highlight the fact that Amy has the lion's share of the burden in our family should have also been a moment for me to acknowledge that that is far too often the case, not just in politics, but just in life in general.</p><p>DEAN: And for being part of an early computer hacking group as a teenager.</p><p>O'ROURKE: Some of the things you know connected to that I did, I'm embarrassed about, not proud of.</p><p>DEAN: But he also left audiences wanting more specifics on the policy front.</p><p>O'ROURKE: And also in listening to the suggestions and the solutions that are brought forward from the communities that I'm visiting, I mean, if you have all the answers, why show up?</p><p>DEAN: O'Rourke has not yet hired a campaign manager, but he is in talks with President Obama's former deputy campaign manager in 2012 Jen O'Malley Dillon.</p><p>Meanwhile, in Delaware, Joe Biden might have let his 2020 intentions slip during a weekend speech to Democrats.</p><p>JOSEPH BIDEN, FORMER VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I have the most progressive record of anybody running for the -- if -- anybody who would run.</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>BIDEN: I didn't mean...</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)</p><p>BIDEN: Of anybody who would run.</p><p>DEAN: Sources tell CNN Biden is preparing for an announcement in April and is hoping to seize command of the Democratic primary through major endorsements.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DEAN: Sources also telling CNN that Biden's going to argue that the most pressing task for the Democratic Party in 2020 is beating President Donald Trump.</p><p>Now, back here in Cleveland, Ohio, Beto O'Rourke inside right over my shoulder, this crowd here overflow who couldn't fit inside. But we have noted over the last several days of O'Rourke has been really gravitating toward these smaller venues, where he can stand up, talk to people, get to know them. And, Dana, interesting, he actually drove himself up here in a minivan when he got here about 15, 20 minutes ago. He plans to then drive on to Pennsylvania. And then it's on to New Hampshire -- Dana.</p><p>BASH: I can see him behind you. He needs a higher ceiling, I think. He's a tall man.</p><p>Thank you so much, Jessica. Appreciate that.</p><p>Senator Bernie Sanders' campaign just sent out a fund-raising e-mail off the Beto O'Rourke news how big statement did -- what a big statement O'Rourke made on his fund-raising haul. That was what Bernie was trying to say, me too, me too, please send it my way, not -- which is not dumb, trying to create a healthy competition among their supporters.</p><p>What do you think, Paul?</p><p>PAUL BEGALA, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I think it's great . This is a new model.</p><p>Actually, it began years ago with Howard Dean, Karen's old friend. Barack Obama then really took it to the next level. And now here certainly Beto, Kamala Harris and Bernie, this is great. If Democrats can raise huge amounts of money, like the $6 million man is Beto, do that in 24 hours, without having to go to lobbyists and PACs and special interests and corporate interests, this -- first off, just as a practical matter, it frees your candidate.</p><p>The two most important and precious commodities in the campaign are the candidate's time and the campaign's money. Well, they're getting money without using time. It puts -- I think it puts Bernie, Beto and Kamala in a really good position.</p><p>MIA LOVE, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: The thing that comes to mind is that these people are raising this amount of money in a great economy and in a free economy.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LOVE: In a free economy. So they should be pushing that free economy out there.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>[16:35:10]</p><p>BASH: The president needs a communications director. Maybe he should call you.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BASH: Maybe he should call you.</p><p>Let me just put up on the screen. It's kind of in keeping with what you said, what David Axelrod, of course, the CNN contributor who helped run President Obama's campaign, said.</p><p>In early 2007, \"The early ability of Barack Obama to raise eye-popping funds, a bunch of it online, bought him the time to work out the kinks and become the candidate we all remember. Beto O'Rourke has the same opportunity because of his enthusiastic base.\"</p><p>Interesting, not just about not spending time fund-raising, but, more importantly, the point he's making is spending more time honing his campaigning skills. It's important.</p><p>KAREN FINNEY, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: That's right.</p><p>And, obviously, he's got the energy and the excitement. At some point, it will be about can you turn all that into votes, right?</p><p>For now, yes, the more time that you have to test out your message, and -- which it clearly is the goal of this van trip. Paul and I were joking about the Scooby van, which was another little van trip across America.</p><p>But, yes, and he needs it. I mean, let's be honest, he had kind of a rough week last week, Beto did, not just on the substance, which is something that all of the candidates, who they are today is not who they're going to be six months from now, because all candidates should be getting better. All candidates should be honing their skills.</p><p>But, as you say, if you're not worried about raising money, you definitely have more time to be honing your message and spending more time with voters actually.</p><p>BASH: Yes, well, speaking of voters and on substance, some of the stumbles not having answers to a lot of questions that, by the way, the rest of this Democratic field is incredibly substantive. They have 10-point plans to the 10-point plans. A lot of them do.</p><p>Listen to what one voter told us about this notion of not answering questions on substance.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RYAN TURNER, VOTER: I feel like he really answered it honestly. And so I understand there's a lot of pressure and you're getting a ton of questions.</p><p>But you're asking to be the leader of the free world. And so I think you should be -- on either side, you should be called to the carpet and be able to back up what you say, if you're asking for that -- for that seat.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARY KATHARINE HAM, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, first of all, if I could have made this money standing on bar tops in college, it would have been a lot more...</p><p>(CROSSTALK) (LAUGHTER)</p><p>BASH: Standing, not dancing. I just want to be precise.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>HAM: No, but respect for that number, because he did -- Karen is right. He did have some stumbles out of the gate, but not in this respect.</p><p>And I think this may give him a cushion. This may give him time to get his feet under him, because I think a lot of -- a lot of the attention, a lot of him getting thrust here and the popularity comes from the fact that he got very, very, very friendly coverage in Texas, running against Senator Cruz, and now he's got to prove his mettle.</p><p>And the people of Iowa and New Hampshire, early states, are going to require that.</p><p>BASH: And yet as you -- I know you want to make a point, Karen.</p><p>But tell me if I'm totally wrong about this, that one of the lessons I think from Trump and certainly from the Democratic nominees of the past is people like the feels. That's the official political term. They like to feel the feels about candidates.</p><p>FINNEY: Sure.</p><p>BASH: Substance is important, but there's also something that's that sort of the inevitable connection. And the question is whether he can have both.</p><p>FINNEY: I was just going to say, you got to have both, right?</p><p>And particularly, Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada voters, these are -- because of their position in the calendar, they're going to be tougher. They actually will pull -- they know your 10-point plan a little bit better, and will raise issues that you don't always get when you are doing big rallies.</p><p>When you do these smaller events, you're more likely to get more substantive questions. I think the other thing that's really interesting, we were talking a little bit about the criticism he was getting about the comment he made about his wife, which I think is kind of an interesting flip, because usually it's female candidates -- you know this better than anybody -- who tend to get the, well, who's taking care of the kids, right?</p><p>And so for him to sort of make a joke, and for it to be taken the way it was, kind of says, well, how come you're not taking care of your kids as you're rolling around the campaign?</p><p>BASH: I want to quickly before we take a break talk about Joe Biden, because you heard Jessica talking about the fact that his strategy is to sort of make clear that he is going to run, roll out a string of endorsements once he finally does run.</p><p>This is what CNN is told. Campaign on a message of strength, make the argument that the party's most urgent tasks should be defeating President Trump.</p><p>But look at this poll released last month; 47 percent of Democratic- leaning voters said it was more important that a candidate shared their views on issues, compared to 43 percent who said the candidate should beat Donald Trump.</p><p>LOVE: I was just going to bring this up, because the problem that Beto O'Rourke is going to have is the fact that if this continues to be a narrative where he's not answering questions, it's not enough to be anti-Trump. It's not enough to say, I am so far away from Trump that you should vote for me.</p><p>You have to have a plan, because, at the end of the day, because at the end of the day, people are looking for solutions. They're looking at how you're going to make their life better for them and for their children.</p><p>[16:40:07]</p><p>So that's going to be an issue. And I think Joe Biden's actually -- if he jumps in the race, it's going to cause a lot of problems, because he's been in the arena.</p><p>HAM: Can I also just say that Biden accidentally announcing is the most Biden thing ever?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BASH: Yes. Yes.</p><p>HAM: Here I am, guys.</p><p>BASH: Paul, 10 seconds on Biden.</p><p>BEGALA: He's terrific. Everybody says, I love Joe, but he's going to have a formidable field if and when he gets in.</p><p>And I would worry, if I were him, that he's the big aircraft carrier that everybody else is going to fly over and strafe. He's going to have to be nimble, quick.</p><p>I don't think the answer lies in more 10-point plans. I think it lies in answer to the thing that you teased: Who could beat Trump?</p><p>BASH: Yes.</p><p>OK, everybody, stand by. There is another name popular in his party who also won't confirm if he's going to run. But this is a Republican. And he may have just dropped a big hint he's at least considering taking on Donald Trump.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>[16:45:00] DANA BASH, CNN ANCHOR: Soon Senator Elizabeth Warren will face questions at a live CNN Town Hall. She's fighting to stand out as a fellow Liberal candidate. Senator Bernie Sanders is already raking in the cash and has the 2016 chances. Both candidates rollouts incredibly similar campaigns down to their proposed policies. CNN's MJ Lee has the story.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MJ LEE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders both New England senators, both champions of the progressive left, both running for the Democratic nomination. And on the stump, they're sounding strikingly similar in their rhetoric and their positions.</p><p>SEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm not in Washington to work for billionaires. I'm in Washington to help level the playing field so that everybody gets a chance to get out there and compete.</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We will no longer tolerate the greed of Corporate America and the billionaire class.</p><p>LEE: But there is at least one notable distinction. Sanders a Democratic Socialist, Warren insisting she is not.</p><p>WARREN: I am a capitalist. Come on. I believe in Markets. What I don't believe in is theft. What I don't believe in is cheating.</p><p>LEE: The Senators also share similar fundraising strategies, only courting grassroots small dollar supporters.</p><p>WARREN: I want to run a campaign that's based on principles and ideas not on how much money I can scoop up from people who've already made it big.</p><p>SANDERS: We're going to win this election because we are putting together the strongest grassroots campaign in the history of American politics.</p><p>LEE: But Sanders' early hall appears tough to compete with. His campaign says it raised a stunning $10 million in just the first week of its second White House campaign.</p><p>SANDERS: Thank you, Iowa.</p><p>LEE: And in the crucial state of Iowa, Sanders is running near the top of the pack a 25 percent among likely Democratic caucus-goers with Warren in single digits at nine percent. Some voters who have supported both see they now have a tough choice to make.</p><p>BILL JORDAN, VOTER, NEW HAMPSHIRE: In 2016 she got in. So then I got behind Sanders and I canvassed for him really. I liked him a lot so I'm sort of torn now by who to support.</p><p>LEE: When it comes to her 2020 rival, Warren is sticking to her own script.</p><p>WARREN: It's not up to me to describe anybody else's position in the Democratic Party.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LEE: Now, one thing that Senator Warren's at earlier today was take a walking tour of an impoverished neighborhood in Cleveland, Mississippi, one way to remind voters that she has a housing plan to try to address the housing crisis. This is going to be one policy proposal, Dana, that you can bet audience members will choose to ask her about later tonight in the Town Hall. I think it begins in four hours.</p><p>BASH: It sure does and we look forward to it. Before we get there, we have what to discuss about Elizabeth Warren. M.J. just set it up so beautifully just first and foremost the notion that she is running in a crowded progressive field and you know she's trying to sort of you know, kill the progressive giant for lack of a better way to say it.</p><p>And yet she -- let me just look at the subjects, the policies that she's supporting. A wealth tax, universal child care, breaking up tech companies like Facebook, affordable housing, you know, those are all things that certainly appeal to the Progressives but they're not that different from what the original Progressive on the presidential campaign trail Bernie Sanders supports.</p><p>KAREN FINNEY, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I think a lot of those policies in fairness are -- have been Progressive policy for some time. And I would say that I think the idea about childcare, universal child care, that could be a game changer for Americans if you think about that.</p><p>If you think about the number of people who can't afford childcare or they -- so one person stays home and they or and or maybe they need both paychecks. I mean, if you sit down and think about it and talk about it with people, that could actually be something that really catches on because it's something that people talk about around their kitchen tables.</p><p>And that's what you want at this stage in the campaign is if you're going to be talking about ideas, you're right, we don't want to remember the ten specific points but you want like people talking about you know, that could be really interesting. That could really -- you want that head-shaking moment in addition to what we're talking about before that connectivity with people.</p><p>BASH: And there -- we talked about the fact that there's a new CNN poll out this hour. One of the things that was really fascinating was about her bid to break up the tech companies. And if you look at it, just 11 percent say they support the notion of more regulation and having the government be this involved. What do you think about that especially somebody who helped elect a moderate Democrat president?</p><p>[16:50:04] PAUL BEGALA, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Well, I'm stunned actually, because when she announces -- and I still believe that this is the one issue Democrats -- a Democrat is running on that has cross- cutting appeal. I know more conservative -- I guess I just live in a world with too many big Liberals and Conservatives, right, too polarized maybe my world here in D.C. because the Conservatives I know hate big tech far more than the Liberals do. And when she announced that, I thought that's exciting.</p><p>I don't know if I'm not smart enough to know who's right who's wrong but I know a lot of Conservatives who nod their head vigorously when Elizabeth Warren says I want to go after big tech.</p><p>BASH: That surprises me.</p><p>MARY KATHARINE HAM, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: Yes. I think there is -- there is some of that probably --</p><p>BASH: Do you hear that from fellow Conservatives?</p><p>HAM: Yes, it's partly because of some speech issues and feel -- the feeling that on Facebook or Twitter that Conservatives don't get a fair shake because of their beliefs so that's where some of that comes from. But like Bernie is in Warren's lane and she's got to swerve in there and try to make her mark.</p><p>And I can't express to Democrats enough how much it matters your name I.D. and your money at the beginning these things because you'll pop to the top of polling and it sort of snowballs as we saw with Donald Trump in a big field right? And so she's got to get in there and make noise and that's what she's attempting to do.</p><p>BASH: OK, I'm going to put this one to you because on the Republican side, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan is just returning from Iowa and here's how he responded to people asking about that visit.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOV. LARRY HOGAN (R), MARYLAND: I also thought it would just be great to spend 48 hours and sub-zero temperatures in Des Moines. I thought it would be fun, you know. But that doesn't mean I'm actually running for anything but we're going to -- we're going to keep talking about the things we think are important.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BASH: You call for Republicans to speak out against Donald Trump. Is that something you encourage, somebody to not just speak out but try to primary him or is that --</p><p>MIA LOVE, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: It's not mainly about speaking out against Donald Trump. That's not -- the point is to speak for the principles that we believe in and call him out.</p><p>BASH: So should he -- should someone like Larry Hogan take it to the next level?</p><p>LOVE: Look, I am a big advocate of as many options as possible. I think it's good for America. I think it's good for us to have a choice. So he wants to jump into the race and has good ideas and some good thoughts and supports again free markets and the things that have made people -- that made this country so successful, then I'm willing to hear it.</p><p>I think that we need to have as many options as possible. And yes, I may -- you know, I may get some phone calls after this, but I think -- I think options are good for people. I really do.</p><p>BASH: I'm guessing you might get many phone calls after this.</p><p>LOVE: Well, that's OK. Bring it. I'm OK with that.</p><p>BEGALA: He should run.</p><p>BASH: There you go.</p><p>BEGALA: He should run.</p><p>BASH: All right, we'll talk about that in the break. Everybody stand by because we want to also make sure you know that Jake Tapper, the host of this program will host tonight's presidential Town Hall with 2020 candidates Senator Elizabeth Warren. It is live from JacksonMississippi. That's at 9:00 o'clock Eastern right here on CNN.</p><p>And up next, more calls for change after another tragedy but there's something very different about the response happening right now in New Zealand.</p><p>[16:55:00] BASH: The \"WORLD LEAD.\" Talk of change already turning into action just days after the horrific attack that killed 50 people in the city of Christchurch in New Zealand. The Prime Minister said today that her cabinet will announce a plan to change gun laws within days as CNN's Alexandra Field reports, that is incredibly fast.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JACINDA ARDERN, PRIME MINISTER, NEW ZEALAND: The time to act is now.</p><p>ALEXANDRA FIELD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Within 72 hours of the worst mass shooting in New Zealand's history, the Prime Minister is poised to change gun laws fast.</p><p>ARDERN: The cabinet today made in-principle decisions around the reform of our gun laws. Within ten days of this horrific act of terrorism, we will have announced reforms which I believe make our communities safer.</p><p>FIELD: The terrorist in Friday's attacks killed 50 people at two separate mosques. With him at the time, five legally obtained weapons. The shooter was born in Australia where a 1996 mass shooting prompted tough new gun laws including a ban on shotguns and rapid-fire rifles.</p><p>ARDERN: They took 12 days to make the decision.</p><p>FIELD: Since then, Australians risk of dying by gunshot has fallen by 50 percent. By contrast, the United States has made few consequential changes to gun legislation despite recurring massacres including 17 people killed at Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, 11 people killed at a Pittsburg synagogue, and 58 people killed at a music festival in Las Vegas, all within the last two years.</p><p>The owner of the Christchurch gun shop that sold the arsenal used in the attacks says he supports change in his country.</p><p>DAVID TIPPLE, OWNER, GUN CITY STORE: I fully support the Prime Minister's swift and decisive actions following this tragedy.</p><p>FIELD: The pledges do little for Farid Ahmed whose wife was killed in Friday's massacre. It fell to him to tell their young daughter the news.</p><p>FARID AHMED, WIFE KILLED IN NEW ZEALAND ATTACK: She said are you telling me I don't have a mother? I said yes.</p><p>FIELD: New Zealand's next step are meant to ensure no other family will have to have such conversations due to gun violence.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>FIELD: Dana, it all stands in such a sharp contrast to the common response to mass shootings in the United States, thoughts and prayers to of course. But here, the leader of the right-leaning party which has resisted gun reforms before has put it simply saying the reality has changed, the laws will too. Dana?</p><p>BASH: Alex Field, thank you for that report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019031802CNV40</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VP2-3161-JB20-G28W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3866\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 18, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Beto O'Rourke</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Joe Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>White House</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republican Party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000769</classCode><className>FUNDRAISING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001342</classCode><className>POLITICAL CANDIDATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TRZ</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0UY</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TA3</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp;

It's a dry, legalistic area of policy that even elected officials themselves have largely preferred to delegate to technocratic regulators.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet competition policy is an integral part of the lifeblood of capitalism. At a time when trust in the market economy is under severe strain, ensuring that markets remain free and contestable is more important than ever. A key flashpoint in this deepening distrust has been the growing market power of a small number of giant technology companies - sparking a reaction from politicians and the public that has been labelled the \"techlash\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In just a few years, companies such as Facebook, Google and Amazon have gone from being perceived as heroic disruptors to immoveable incumbents dominant in an ever-increasing number of markets, from advertising and artificial intelligence to e-commerce and cloud computing.</p><p>More fundamentally, public unease about \"big tech\" has stemmed from the pervasive sense that users lack understanding and control over how the growing quantities of data collected about them are used. The 2018 Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the personal data of millions of Facebook users was harvested without their consent, starkly brought this home. Yet despite these trends, competition regulators - including the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) - have been slow to react. For decades, antitrust policy has been dominated by the \"Chicago School\" of thinking: the idea that concentrated markets are not problematic unless they lead to higher prices for consumers.</p><p>While this philosophy may have worked in an analogue economy, it has been unable to grasp the implications for competition of new business models in which \"free\" services are tacitly exchanged for personal data and the right to target users with tailored advertising, itself underpinned by that very same user data.</p><p>This has meant so-called \"killer\" acquisitions by tech giants - those of companies that may have one day become challengers, such as WhatsApp or Instagram - went unchallenged by the CMA and other competition authorities. Considerations beyond the acquisitions' impacts on consumer prices, such as their potential effects on innovation or data concentration, were simply deemed irrelevant.</p><p>This has finally begun to change.</p><p>Regulators are getting to grips with the nature of digital competition, with the CMA - whose remit is being expanded post-Brexit - at the forefront. Under its energetic new chair, Lord Tyrie, the CMA has sought to bolster its armoury through a combination of upgrades to its legal powers and a broader rethinking of its approach.</p><p>In terms of the former, it has requested a series of new powers from the government, including a greater ability to impose fines for abuses, the capacity to act more swiftly using interim measures, and expanded information-gathering powers outside of formal investigations.</p><p>All of this will depend on the new administration's willingness to pass legislation along these lines, which is highly uncertain.</p><p>Rather than wait for an answer, the CMA has set itself a bold agenda: rethinking its approach to acquisitions, taking a more preventative \"ex-ante\" approach to regulation, conducting a study of the highly-concentrated online advertising sector, and establishing a dedicated tech unit to strengthen its activities in the digital realm.</p><p>A more robust approach from a higher-profile CMA, in digital markets and beyond, will go some way in combating the perception that the economy is rigged in favour of a few powerful incumbents. A greater willingness to intervene when acquisitions threaten competition will ultimately benefit consumers, and ensure that genuine challengers can emerge to today's dominant platforms.</p><p>The CMA will need to proceed carefully to avoid spooking investors and undermining the UK's notable recent successes in tech. This means ensuring that its work is evidence-based, transparent, and consistent. The recently launched investigations of Amazon's attempted investment in Deliveroo and Takeaway.com's proposed takeover of Just Eat, will be instructive in this regard.</p><p>But a more assertive and self-reflective competition authority is something we should all welcome.</p><p>\u00a3 Max von Thun is a senior associate at political advisory firm Global Counsel.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-158128051</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC4-5KS1-JCBW-N06B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"725\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 City A.M.

The growing anti-monopoly movement is a major part of this populist uprising\u2014aimed at breaking up the corporate giants that dominate large swaths of the economy. Even some stalwarts of the old system are now anti-monopolists: In late April, a group of longtime Democratic economists and antitrust practitioners sent aletter[2]urging Congress to pass legislation that would align antitrust law with 'modern economic theory and to fix harmful judicial rules.' The letter's recommendations, if enacted, would create a substantially more active antitrust regime than we've seen over the last four decades. </p><p>In other words, elite liberals now recognize that something has gone wrong in how America polices market concentration. The problem, though, is they haven't yet fully figured out what that 'something' is. The April missive prescribes new legislation and judicial interpretations of antitrust law, which would be welcome, but it ignores the circumstances that made antitrust enforcement collapse in the first place. America's flawed anti-monopoly policies have flourished because a cloistered world of bureaucrats\u2014some well-intentioned, some not\u2014have been charged with implementing it with few checks on their power. This small cache of regulators, lawyers, and judges all know each other, and all know that there's a lot of money in letting the system fall into the decay it has. Too often, the same antitrust officials who set lax antitrust standards then go and work for firms that benefit from those decisions. To fix our monopoly problem, the United States needs more than a set of policy prescriptions from well-meaning wonks. It requires a fundamental shift in both who we trust to shape our political economy\u2014and the personal incentives that drive those people's careers. As they stand, the principal federal institutions that enforce antitrust law\u2014the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission\u2014present conflicts of interests to the lawyers and economists who carry out the agencies' missions. That's because civil servants regularly leave government to cash in on their insider knowledge and connections in the private sector. Our organization has found that the most popular career path\u2014by far\u2014for former FTC antitrust lawyers was to argue for corporate mergers and acquisitions before the very agencies for which they used to work. Forty-oneof 81[3]former FTC Bureau of Competition officials who left the agency between 2014 and April 2020 went to BigLaw firms, such as Kirkland &amp;#38; Ellis, Baker Potts, and Akin Gump. Another 11 became in-house competition counsels at acquisition-fueled companies like Facebook and Amazon. In total, 67 percent of former FTC officials went to work for corporate America arguing against their former government colleagues. Even among the antitrust experts who signed on to the April letter, at least one is currently advising corporate clients. Bloomberg revealed that Fiona Scott Morton, Yale professor and former deputy assistant attorney general of the Antitrust Division, has beenadvising[4]Apple and Amazon while co-authoring papers on the government's cases against Google and Facebook. This revolving door underlies many frustrating examples of our failure to police big business. In April 2020, Facebookhired[5]a lawyer from the FTC's Anticompetitive Practices division, just as the company faces anexamination[6]of its past acquisitions. Former FTC higher-ups also helped Facebooksecure[7]its wrist-slap of a settlement over the Cambridge Analytica scandal. The coronavirus pandemic demonstrates how the FTC's revolving door can have deadly consequences. In 2007, for instance, federal officials attempted tostock up[8]on cheap ventilators to be supplied by a firm called Newport Medical Instruments. But this arrangement threatened medtech giant Covidien, whose ventilators were more expensive to produce. So through what executives called a 'killer acquisition[9],' pushed through by aformer FTC lawyer[10], Covidien bought Newport and terminated the government contract, and thus the cheaper ventilators. As wereported[11], that merger was approved by FTC leaders who all,without exception, left the agency for positions representing corporate clients. This dynamic has proved toxic. When a partnership at a corporate law firm appears to be the logical next step in a career, officials are incentivized to keep private interests in mind when they're supposed to be carrying out antitrust enforcement in the public interest. To truly change the culture within the antitrust enforcement agencies, political appointees\u2014 including nominees by a potential Biden administration\u2014must be provably free from corporate interests, due to long and clear records advocating for the public good and against private buckraking. Congress and the agencies also need to limit the influence of former antitrust officials who leave for private gigs, via restrictions on post-employment work and other binding ethics guidelines. At the same time, Congress and a future Biden administration should also heavily prioritize promoting career officials within government, and better compensate them for their expertise. This would be vastly superior to hiring former corporate lawyers inside the agencies they once sought to undermine\u2014and likely will again. Economists with antitrust authorities also have a clear path to representing corporate clients through a cottage industry of consultancies. C-Suite executives rarely lose any sleep if the FTC or DOJ start asking tough questions about their corporation's latest acquisition. They simply cut a check to one of these consultancies and, like magic, a tenured academic or well-regarded economist comes back with numbers showing that merger to be a godsend to consumers. If they're savvy, they can hire an economist with experience at the very agency they're seeking to persuade\u2060. Our organization hasfound[12]that at least five members of the Bureau of Economics ended up at an economic consulting group after leaving the FTC. Fittingly, there are only two major firms that regularly argue in favor of monopolies: Charles River Associates and Compass Lexecon. Charles River, for example, consulted on afull third[13]of all merger cases in the early 2010's. Lax professional ethics are common inside the consultancies, too. In one case reported by ProPublica, a group of government lawyers hired Compass Lexecon's Jonathan Baker as a consultant for a case against Apple. In the courtroom, however, Baker found himself arguing against his own boss at Compass Lexecon, Jonathan Orszag, who'd helped to set up Baker's contract with the Feds. Baker conducted an economic analysis finding Apple artificially inflated e-book prices by 19 percent. Orszag ran a similar analysis and found Apple only had negligibly higher prices of 1.9 percent. Two economists from the same firm, two different answers to the same question. The only difference was who was paying whom. With case studies like these, is it any wonder why 'outdated and bad economic theory has undermined antitrust enforcement,' in the words of the letter from established antitrust actors? This isn't simply a matter of good-faith economists coming to the wrong conclusions. It's far simpler: If these economists cannot justify what corporate America wants, they don't get paid. It's like the old Upton Sinclair quote: 'It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends on his not understanding it.' The antitrust regulatory agencies simply cannot compete with the deep pockets of BigLaw and mega-corporations. Mergers in the US economy havequintupled[14]since 1985, while the DOJ Antitrust division's budget hasdeclined[15]in real dollars. Government officials' paychecks look pitiful compared to private sector peers. Plus, the FTC and DOJ Antitrust highly value private-sector experience when looking to promote, thus stifling any promising talent from inside the agencies and further incentivizing ambitious lawyers to revolve back and forth. Executive appointments to the top positions similarly pull from the pool of revolving antitrust experts rather than steady promotions from within. That means genuinely career-oriented officials are effectively barred from attaining positions of peak responsibility or prestige unless they go work for the other side. This does not need to be the case: recently retired Postmaster General Megan Brennan achieved her position within the US Postal Service after starting her career as amail carrier[16]30 years ago. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, along with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Office of the Comptroller of Currency, operates on analternative pay scale[17]specifically to attract skilled experts that normally might take higher-paying private sector positions. And of course, Dr. Anthony Fauci has run the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, and istrusted[18]by 70 percent of Americans, including 60 percent of Republicans. Americans have faith in his judgement about when to re-open the economy more than the president's by more than two-to-one. In contrast, two of the current FTC Commissioners came to the FTC from private sector jobs: Christine Wilson was a senior vice president at Delta Airlines, while Joseph Simons was the co-chair of the antitrust section of Paul Weiss, a BigLaw firm. The assistant attorney general who oversees DOJ Antitrust, Makan Delrahim, was a longtime partnerpracticing[19]competition and intellectual property law at BigLaw firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck before he joined the Trump Administration in 2017. But there's yet another way that corporate America rigs antitrust law in its favor\u2014the courts themselves. Arecent analysis[20]by Demand Justice, a progressive court-watching group, found that nearly 60 percent of all 175 circuit-court judges (the level just below the Supreme Court) were once BigLaw partners. Given most judges' formative experiences, it's unsurprising that each decade the courts become more permissive of mergers and acquisitions. That's an example of why BigLaw partners are less, rather than more, suited to the bench than lawyers who represent small businesses, much less unions, consumers, or civil rights plaintiffs. (This, of course, affects more than just antitrust; corporate and labor law would, for example, be unrecognizable if fewer members of the bench were corporate law veterans). A recognizable liberal impulse undergirds the calls for reform from established antitrust practitioners\u2014a belief that rationality will prevail, that Congress and DOJ and FTC officials just need to have the problems with current antitrust enforcement explained to them properly. Then, they'll naturally spring into action to correct these innocent errors. It's a desperate belief that everyone else is acting in good faith, that actors in the system just haven't noticed the problems that exist. But not everyone is acting in good faith. Many antitrust regulators have been motivated by their own bottom line. The real challenge, then, is to ensure that people who occupy those positions don't have a conflict of interest. That way, we can be sure they are acting in the public interest, not their own.

If that revenue exceeds $1\u00a0million, the legislation would require companies to file a state tax return estimating how much they owe in digital advertising taxes. The companies would have to keep records of advertising sales.</p><p> Ferguson, the Baltimore Democrat who drafted the plan, said he was inspired by economist Paul Romer, a Nobel laureate who suggested earlier this year that such a tax could use market forces to shift tech companies' business models - creating a disincentive for profiting off the collection of private data. </p><p>The proposal, Ferguson said, could both fund a sizable chunk of the education changes he's championing and put \"some guideposts around the intrusive aggregation of data of individual Marylanders.\"</p><p>\"It's an assessment on the platforms for the use of Marylanders' data, for which, right now, companies are not paying a cost to access,\" he said. </p><p>Internet advertising is big business: The Interactive Advertising Bureau reported 2018 digital ad revenue exceeded $100\u00a0billion nationwide, and it grew 21.8\u00a0percent from 2017. </p><p>Representatives of Facebook and Google declined to comment on the legislation. </p><p> It was not immediately clear whether the legislation would apply to other online platforms that host digital ads, such as The Washington Post.</p><p>Companies with less than $100\u00a0million of annual, global online advertising revenue would be exempt. The graduated tax rate would climb from 2.5\u00a0percent for firms with $100\u00a0million in online sales to 10\u00a0percent for those with $15\u00a0billion in global advertising revenue. </p><p>The approach also raised questions about the limits of taxing Internet commerce. While other states have expanded their sales taxes to apply to digital products such as streaming services or music downloads, it appears none has created a new tax for digital advertising, according to Maryland tax experts and others. </p><p>Robert Callahan, a senior vice president for the Internet Association, which represents many big tech firms, said in a statement: \"While we are still reviewing the proposal, we have serious initial concerns. The bill appears to stand on questionable legal footing and unfairly discriminate against a single segment of the advertising sector.\"</p><p>The Internet Tax Freedom Act, originally passed in 1998 and reinstated several times, sets limits on the taxation of Internet access and bars taxation on certain things, such as taxes on emails. </p><p>Ferguson and other state lawmakers are searching for a way to raise money to pay for a $4\u00a0billion per year revamping of public schools, a set of proposals known as the Kirwan recommendations. Ferguson and his counterpart in the House of Delegates, Speaker Adrienne A. Jones (D-Baltimore County), pledged not to increase property, income or sales tax rates to pay for them. </p><p> Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who has derided the school changes as \"pie-in-the-sky\" and too costly, declined to comment on the prospect of taxing targeted digital ads. </p><p>\"If or when the legislature finally releases a detailed plan to pay for Kirwan's massive price tag, we will certainly take a look at it,\" Hogan spokesman Michael Ricci said in an email. \"The question remains: where is all the money coming from?\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:erin.cox@washpost.com\">erin.cox@washpost.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-cb6c3a98340711ea93136cba89b1b9fb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYC-8441-DXKP-J4YY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"863\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 11, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>CC000CUKL</classCode><className>THOMAS V MIKE MILLER JR PA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Campaigners say this makes little dent on the five companies\u2019 profits, which amounted to \u00a3468m in 2018.</p><p>The industry has also tried to fend off further regulation by agreeing to a ban on advertising during live sports events and warning politicians that stricter laws could result in gamblers betting with unlicensed operators offshore.</p><p>When it was founded, the BGC made a commitment to take action on five areas relating to safer gambling \u2014 including prevention of underage gambling and reviewing advertising. It is collaborating with the Gambling Commission, the regulator, on game design, marketing and incentives for high spending players.</p><p>In January, it emerged that when gamblers searched for Gamstop, a free scheme that allows punters to exclude themselves from betting websites, Google\u2019s algorithm promoted unregistered gambling websites and others that told customers how to get around the self-exclusion platform.</p><p>Ms Simmonds said that although Google had \u201cpromised\u201d to take action, unregulated websites were being presented to those that had tried to self-exclude.</p><p>Google said: \u201cWe have strict policies around gambling ads, which we enforce rigorously. We continue to review our policies and approaches in this area as new risks emerge.\u201d</p><p>The company added that it had stopped showing adverts when people searched for Gamstop, although when the FT searched the term sites offering ways to avoid Gamstop still appeared.\u00a0</p><p>UK Finance, which represents the banks, said that individual lenders had already put in place schemes to allow customers to block their cards from being used for gambling online and that the sector would \u201ccontinue to liaise closely with the government, regulators and consumer groups in supporting vulnerable customers\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>The House of Lords hearing will focus on potential changes to the UK\u2019s current gambling legislation, which many in and outside of the industry say must be revised.</p><p>\u201c[The current act] doesn\u2019t make any provision for online and it doesn\u2019t make any provision for advertisement,\u201d said Adam Bradford, director of the campaign group Safer Online Gambling, adding that the council needed to promote the industry\u2019s own efforts and not deflect attention on to other sectors.</p><p>An industry executive, who asked to remain anonymous, said the council faced an uphill struggle in bringing such a competitive sector together: \u201cThe principal players know that we will need a significant gesture to quell negative public opinion\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009but the problem stems from [major operators]: the rest of the industry has had to play unfair to keep up with their unsustainable low pricing.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-4cc7cfa2469211eaaeb3955839e06441</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y4C-T0G1-JB77-K3BG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"781\"/><timeReceived>6:04 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 3, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>CC0002BKC</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TIMES GROUP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><className>SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

Google is the runaway leader in online search. Facebook is the largest social network in the world by a wide margin. Amazon is far and away the biggest e-commerce site. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Even among so-called unicorns -- private start-ups worth $1 billion or more -- de facto monopolies are already the norm. As the technology writer Om Malik argued in The New Yorker recently, ''Most competition in Silicon Valley now heads toward there being one monopolistic winner.'' Airbnb dominates the apartment rental market, Snapchat is the big player in ephemeral messaging, and Spotify stands out as the major streaming music library. And when it comes to on-demand ride services, Uber, the most valuable private technology company in the world, is the clear leader.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  But while market dominance is hard to break, that doesn't stop upstarts from trying. In the case of Uber, it is Lyft that is doing its best to keep up.</p><p>  On Monday, Lyft raised an additional $1 billion from investors including General Motors, increasing its total fund-raising to $2 billion. At the same time, it announced it was developing software for self-driving cars, and teaming up with G.M. to put more drivers on the road. These moves are part of Lyft's bid to distinguish itself and avoid being muscled aside by the runaway market leader, an all-too-common experience for technology companies.</p><p>  ''We're gaining share in the United States,'' said John Zimmer, Lyft's president and co-founder. ''That's not what happens when one player has a complete monopoly.''</p><p>  Regardless of whether Lyft and Uber can both thrive, or if there is only one big winner in the booming ride-hailing industry, dominance in and of itself is not illegal. Problems arise only when a company ''unreasonably restrains competition'' or gains and holds power ''through improper conduct,'' according to the Federal Trade Commission's definition of monopolization.</p><p>  Indeed, there is a line of thinking that celebrates monopolies. In a unanimous decision from 2004, the Supreme Court said the ability to create a monopoly was a powerful incentive that should be protected.</p><p>  ''The mere possession of monopoly power, and the concomitant charging of monopoly prices, is not only not unlawful; it is an important element of the free-market system,'' Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in that opinion. ''The opportunity to charge monopoly prices -- at least for a short period -- is what attracts 'business acumen' in the first place; it induces risk-taking that produces innovation and economic growth.''</p><p>  In the book ''Zero to One,'' which he wrote with Blake Masters, the investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel offers tips on how to create monopolies, arguing that once achieved, they lead to more innovation.</p><p>  ''Monopolies drive progress because the promise of years or even decades of monopoly profits provides a powerful incentive to innovate,'' he writes. ''Then monopolies can keep innovating because profits enable them to make the long-term plans and to finance the ambitious research projects that firms locked in competition can't dream of.''</p><p>  And regulators have not been cracking down on Silicon Valley. Given how many big technology companies loom large in their respective markets, there have been relatively few big antitrust actions brought against tech giants.</p><p>  ''This is different from the old monopolies of the industrial age,'' Robert Reich, the former labor secretary, said of technology companies.</p><p>  Unlike United States Steel or Standard Oil, two of corporate history's biggest brutes, today's tech monopolies are rarely the exclusive provider of an essential commodity. Instead, many achieve their initial dominance by distinguishing themselves in a crowded marketplace, then rapidly taking market share thanks to the power of network effects -- that is, the more people use a service, the more valuable that service becomes to other people, who join in and make the service all the more popular.</p><p>  Network effects helped Google, Facebook and Amazon run away from their competitors, and are helping Uber today. Google wasn't the first search engine, Facebook wasn't the first social network, and Amazon wasn't the first to sell goods online. There are still many other sites for search, social and e-commerce. But despite an array of options, users keep coming back to the market leaders.</p><p>  Some argue, however, that the regulatory framework needs to adjust for a new kind of market dominance.</p><p>  ''The underlying problem here is that antitrust regulators are only looking at consumer welfare,'' Mr. Reich said. ''They aren't looking at the long-term potential for total dominance of a network, the possibility of predatory behavior once a technology giant becomes entrenched, or political power.'' (European antitrust laws are more expansive than those in the United States, resulting in continuing actions against Google and other big tech companies.)</p><p>  Along with network effects, another hallmark of today's tech monopolies is that, perhaps fearing obsolescence, they diversify. While Microsoft still makes its Windows and Office software, it also owns Skype and has a big video gaming business. Google is now a subsidiary of Alphabet, a new parent company that is also home to a health care company, a self-driving-cars division and a venture capital firm. Amazon is expanding its cloud computing and streaming-media businesses. And Facebook has diversified into messaging with WhatsApp, photos with Instagram, and virtual reality with Oculus Rift.</p><p>  This, too, creates challenges for regulators. When mergers and acquisitions are part of the natural life cycle of start-ups and venture capital, it isn't easy to block deals that might hypothetically reduce competition down the road. As a result, regulators have blessed many acquisitions that, to critics, appear to be deeply anticompetitive.</p><p>  Gary Reback, a lawyer who helped prompt a landmark antitrust investigation into Microsoft and is now pursuing Google in Europe, makes the case that Google bought its way to dominance in online advertising through the acquisition of DoubleClick, bought its leadership in mobile by purchasing Android and bought its strong mapping franchise in the deal for Waze. Similarly, Facebook bought two of its nearest rivals, WhatsApp and Instagram. If any of those deals had been blocked, Mr. Reback argues, behemoths like Google and Facebook might today be facing more concerted competition.</p><p>  ''Once one of these companies gets a monopoly, it's easy to spread the monopoly to adjacent markets by acquisition,'' Mr. Reback said. ''You would think antitrust enforcers would know this by now.''</p><p>  While monopolies in the tech industry are perhaps easier than ever to achieve, industry experts contend they are also more vulnerable than ever before. The advent of the smartphone and widespread access to broadband Internet connectivity have democratized access to creative new technologies.</p><p>  ''Sun Microsystems. EMC. Cisco. All these were considered the dominant market players in their category at the time,'' said Rich Wong, a venture capitalist at Accel Partners. ''Then the vast majority of them got whacked by this thing called the cloud.''</p><p>  And of course, billions of people browse the web without Google, use other social networking apps besides Facebook, and shop on websites besides Amazon. Though no upstarts have replaced them yet, none are immune to disruption.</p><p>  As for Uber, if it's not a monopoly already, it is the giant in the ride-hailing market, at least in the United States. One rival, Sidecar, shut down last month, and Lyft is its last meaningful competitor on a national scale. (Uber faces a tougher road abroad, where it is tangling with regulators in Europe, recently withdrew from Frankfurt and is fighting against entrenched rivals in China and other international markets.)</p><p>  As the underdog, Lyft is trying to put more drivers on the road and acquire new users. Like Uber, the company is private, and neither shares much information about performance. But Mr. Zimmer said the company was quickly increasing market share in the United States. He also sees the on-demand ride business as different from search or social media and more like telecommunications companies, where several big competitors can compete on service.</p><p>  ''Just like AT&amp;T and Verizon need three bars of coverage,'' he said, ''we get down to two to three minutes of wait time for a vehicle to arrive. Once it gets to that point, there's no difference in behavior between services. That's when you compete on experience.''</p><p>  Still, Lyft will be hard pressed to unseat Uber.</p><p>  ''The network effects hold competition at stiff arm's length,'' said Steve Cheney, an entrepreneur and co-founder of Estimote, a micro-location platform for mobile developers.</p><p>  Or perhaps the ride-hailing market is big enough for both Uber and Lyft. Monopolies don't necessarily mean there is no competition whatsoever. While a company like Uber may take a huge lead in market share, others, like Lyft, may still have room to profit and even prosper. Even Google has not managed to squash every other search engine.</p><p>  ''Microsoft has a decent search business. A lot of Yahoo's profits still come from searches on Yahoo properties,'' said Roelof Botha, a partner at Sequoia Capital, which has investments in WhatsApp and Airbnb. ''It's more of a 'winner takes most' than a 'winner takes all' phenomenon.''</p><p>  Should that be the case in the ride-hailing industry, Uber and Lyft may become something truly competitive by Silicon Valley standards: a duopoly.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: Logan Green, Lyft's chief executive, and John Zimmer, its president.

With big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and other novel methods, they promise to cut costs for struggling healthcare systems, revolutionize how doctors make medical decisions, and save us from ourselves.</p><p>What could possibly go wrong? Quite a lot, it turns out. In Weapons of Mass Destruction, data scientist Cathy O'Neil lists many examples of how algorithms and data can fail us in unsuspecting ways. When transparent data-feedback algorithms were applied to baseball, they worked better than expected; but when similar models are used in finance, insurance, law enforcement and education, they can be highly discriminatory and destructive.</p><p>Healthcare is no exception. Individuals' medical data are susceptible to subjective clinical decision-making, medical errors and evolving practices, and the quality of larger data sets is often diminished by missing records, measurement errors, and a lack of structure and standardization.</p><p>Nonetheless, the big data revolution in healthcare is being sold as if these troubling limitations did not exist. Worse, many medical decision-makers are falling for the hype.</p><p>No infrastructure to gather evidence</p><p>One could argue that as long as new solutions offer some benefits, they are worth it. But we cannot really know whether data analytics and AI actually do improve on the status quo without large, well-designed empirical studies.</p><p>Not only is such evidence lacking; there is no infrastructure or regulatory framework in place to generate it. Big-data applications are simply being introduced into healthcare settings as if they were harmless or unquestionably beneficial.</p><p>Consider Project Nightingale, a private data-sharing arrangement between Google Health and Ascension, a massive nonprofit health system in the United States. When The Wall Street Journal first reported on this secret relationship last November, it triggered a scandal over concerns about patient data and privacy. Worse, as Feinberg openly admitted to the same newspaper just two months later, \"We didn't know what we were doing.\"</p><p>Given that the Big Tech companies have no experience in healthcare, such admissions should come as no surprise, despite the attempts to reassure us otherwise. Worse, at a time when individual privacy is becoming more of a luxury than a right, the algorithms that are increasingly ruling our lives are becoming inaccessible black boxes, shielded from public or regulatory scrutiny to protect corporate interests. And in the case of healthcare, algorithmic diagnostic and decision models sometimes return results that doctors themselves do not understand.</p><p>Unethical and poorly informed</p><p>Although many of those pouring into the health-tech arena are well intentioned, the industry's current approach is fundamentally unethical and poorly informed. No one objects to improving health care with technology. But before rushing into partnerships with tech companies, healthcare executives and providers need to improve their understanding of the healthtech field.</p><p>For starters, it is critical to remember that big data inferences are gleaned through statistics and mathematics, which demand their own form of literacy. When an algorithm detects \"causality\" or some other association signal, that information can be valuable for conducting further hypothesis-driven investigations. But when it comes to actual decision-making, mathematically driven predictive models are only as reliable as the data being fed into them. And since their fundamental assumptions are based on what is already known, they offer a view of the past and the present, not the future. Such applications have far-reaching potential to improve healthcare and cut costs; but those gains are not guaranteed.</p><p>Another critical area is AI, which requires both its own architecture\uff0dthat is, the rules and basic logic that determine how the system operates\uff0dand access to massive amounts of potentially sensitive data. The goal is to position the system so that it can \"teach\" itself how to deliver optimal solutions to stated problems. But, here, one must remember that the creators of the architecture\uff0dthe people writing the rules and articulating the problems\uff0dare as biased as anyone else, whether they mean to be or not.</p><p>Moreover, as with data analytics, AI systems are guided by data from the current healthcare system, making them prone to replicating their own failures and successes.</p><p>Algorithms should be shared with regulators</p><p>At the end of the day, improving healthcare through big data and AI will likely take much more trial and error than techno-optimists realize. If conducted transparently and publicly, big-data projects can teach us how to create high quality data sets prospectively, thereby increasing algorithmic solutions' chances of success. By the same token, the algorithms themselves should be made available at least to regulators and the organizations subscribing to the service, if not to the public.</p><p>Above all, healthcare providers and governments should remove their rose-tinted glasses and think critically about the implications of largely untested new applications in healthcare. Rather than simply giving away patient records and other data, hospitals and regulators should shadow the tech sector developers who are designing the architecture and deploying experimental new systems. More people need to be offering feedback and questioning the assumptions underlying initial prototypes, and this must be followed by controlled experiments to assess these technologies' real-world performance.</p><p>Having been massively over-hyped, big data healthcare solutions are being pushed into the market without meaningful regulation, transparency, standardization, accountability or robust validation practices.</p><p>Patients deserve health systems and providers that will protect them, rather than using them as mere sources of data for profit-driven experiments.</p><p>The author is a senior lecturer in practice in the Department of Health Policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

This British artificial intelligence start-up that learnt to play video and board games - like chess - better than humans was gobbled up by Google in 2014.</p><p>The entrepreneurial sellers received about $600 million for the innovative artificial intelligence firm - so far, so good. But it's what happened afterwards that concerns Rogoff. DeepMind went quiet, and this lack of subsequent activity from promising young tech players after acquisition has become a pattern.</p><p>The economist in Rogoff sees these type of transactions as problematic.</p><p>Rogoff believes big technology platform companies, such as Facebook and Google, are suppressing innovation and competition by acquiring competitive threats with \"blinding\" amounts of money paid to founding inventors.</p><p>\"You're being offered all this money and the nature of the negotiations are like 'if you don't sell to us we'll steal it',\" Rogoff told The Australian Financial Review Business Summit in Sydney this week. \"Once the big tech company buys something, it's dead - they're looking to kill it.\"</p><p>Rogoff sees this as the big anti-trust or competition issue for regulators in the digital age. He points to other examples, such as the $US2 billion sale of virtual reality company Oculus to Facebook in 2014.</p><p>\"The reason that Oculus was so valuable was that it had designed an alternative operating system. [The bidders] didn't care about the virtual reality, they cared that the operating system might challenge Android, iOS and Windows,\" Rogoff said.</p><p>The personal user data the big Silicon Valley companies hold on all of us is known as the \"new gold\" for business.</p><p>Controlling data on consumer preferences, people's spending habits, their finances and internet search history gives the big tech platforms enormous power and influence. Google controls about 90 per cent of the internet search market in Australia and Europe. Google and Facebook collect about 84 per cent of international digital advertising revenue, media buying agency GroupM estimates. Most social media users have a Facebook account.</p><p>In Australia, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission is probing digital platforms, including Google's search engine, social media platforms such as Facebook and other digital content aggregation platforms.</p><p>ACCC boss Rod Sims wants to determine their impact on competition in media and advertising services markets.</p><p>Former ACCC chairman Alan Fels says the power of the tech giants \"is the big issue for anti-trust globally\".</p><p>\"The framework of analysis is very unsettled and underdeveloped,\" Fels says.</p><p>Fels, now a Melbourne University professor, is undecided on whether heavy-handed regulation - such as breaking up the companies or forcing them to better share user data with rival upstarts - is required.</p><p>Last year Europe imposed a record \u00a32.4 billion ($3.8 billion) fine against Google for abusing its dominance by manipulating search results to favour its own comparison shopping service.</p><p>US regulators have been more hands off with the Silicon Valley companies.</p><p>Rogoff hopes the US government probes Facebook's role in peddling Russian-authored fake news and sowing of societal divisions in the 2016 US presidential election campaign will lead to a crackdown against big tech.</p><p>More broadly, the rise of \"superstar\" firms in tech and other industries, according to Goldman Sachs research, has led to three-quarters of US industries experiencing a rise in concentration and accounted for one-third of the 4.2 percentage-point rise in operating profit margins between 1996 and 2014.</p><p>A Productivity Commission inquiry last year concluded that data frameworks and protections developed prior to sweeping digitisation need reform.</p><p>It called for the government to legislate to create a \"comprehensive right\" for consumers to access data held by one organisation and share it with another as a \"fundamental reform to Australia's competition policy in a digital world\".</p><p>Rogoff says open access to user data was \"low hanging fruit\" for regulators to ensure.</p><p>Banks in Australia are under government pressure to move towards an open banking platform, to lift competitive pressures on banks by empowering customers.</p><p>The open banking regime will force banks to provide transaction and product data to customers, who will then be able to share it around with competitors. It overturns the conventional wisdom that customer data was proprietary and a source of competitive advantage.</p><p>ANZ group executive for digital banking Maile Carnegie says competition laws \"are pretty antiquated in terms of the globalisation of business, but also the speed of innovation\".</p><p>But the former Google executive worries that opening up bank customer data to bit tech companies may deliver a win to Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"As governments look to regulate they are potentially going to regulate in a way that is going to be advantageous to the existing platform players,\" she told the Financial Review Business Summit this week.</p><p>Key decisions on data, the power of big tech and competition policy will be critical to the performance of individual firms and the broader economy.</p><p>For Australia, Reserve Bank governor Phil Lowe said this week that \"innovation, creativity and ingenuity\" will determine the country's future economic fortunes against the rest of the world.</p><p>\"A business culture that highly values innovation and competition and that is not afraid of taking risk will surely help in creating this positive environment,\" Lowe said.P</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc6z6x2bmi5mp1eq3nfvi</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RTX-VW31-F0J6-J19M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1022\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

My friend Arianna Huffington recently penned 'The Great Awakening[2],' in which she opines about 'how our thinking about technology fundamentally changed in 2017 and where we go from here.' And just a few weeks ago, I made 'The Case for Responsible Innovation[3]' with the help of my friends Dave Sapin and Rob Mesirow from PwC. </p><p>Here is a list of observable techno-facts: We humans are using more digital technology today than ever before. We will use more digital technology tomorrow than we are using today. Technology writ large is way ahead of any policy or law that might govern it. Societal norms and mores cannot keep up with our technological progress. Social media addiction is real. Social media-empowered tribalism cannot be controlled. Echo chambers are virtual vortexes, and we need to use extreme force to escape them. You have granted a small number of very large companies permission to transform the data you willingly provide them into wealth. Those companies are doing so with exponentially increasing efficiency. Every item on this list will be true until the apocalypse.The ApocalypseI don't really think there's going to be an apocalypse. I think there's going to be a bumpy ride as we transition from the old to the new. So when will the list of techno-facts go away? They won't. Ever.This Is Not a Time for Fear-MongeringLet's be careful about tales of techlash and how far we want to push the fear factor. It's true, Big Tech has lots of data and lots of money and lots of computing power. Small Tech has none of that. The techno-haves are going to win. There really won't be a David-and-Goliath story here. FANG's (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google's) only real enemy (other than itself) is the government, because only the government has the power to beat FANG. Multibillion-dollar enterprises can make huge numbers of mistakes and live to tell about it. As long as their strategies for growth are sound, they are really only stoppable by rule of law.My FearThe power (or future) of FANG (or BAT - Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent) isn't what worries me. These companies are on the regulatory radar, and their business models are at the center of the debate. What worries me is how techlash will impact smaller organizations as they try to craft digital transformation strategies.  Today, every company is a tech company. You can argue very well about what kind of technology is core to your business, but it is much harder for you to make your argument when FUD-mongers (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) impact your executive- or board-level decisions.What to DoThere are nonsubtle, nontrivial differences between responsible innovation and irresponsible innovation. If big, publicly traded companies act responsibly, and some common-sense rules and watchdogs are put into place, FANG will not be a problem. (BAT may always be a problem, because they are China-based and China does not always impose the rule of law in a way that Westerners grasp.) We are getting to a technological place that most people do not understand. Quantum computing is closer than anyone thinks. Quantum-AI is closer than anyone thinks. The 'merge,' the joining of humans and machines[4], is closer than anyone thinks. This is the stuff of science fiction - except it's not science fiction. It's on the horizon. We can already see it. It took modern humans approximately 40,000 years to advance from cave paintings to written words. We've had control of iron for about 3,500 years. We've been industrialized for about 250 years.  On December 17, 1903, the Wright Brothers proved a heavier-than-air vehicle could fly. We landed on the moon on July 20, 1969. That's a lot of technological advancement in 65 years, 7 months, and 3 days - less than a human lifespan. The next stage of our technological evolution won't take anywhere near that long. According to IBM, 90 percent of all the data ever created by humans was created in the past 24 months. We are living in the age of exponentiation.  Our technological evolution is happening faster than most people ever imagined, and it is clearly happening faster than society is able to deal with it. How should we respond? Last week at CES we asked a small group of big thinkers if there was a way we could all work together to outline a reasonable approach to responsible innovation. We received an enthusiastic response.

stories Royal Navy frigate shadowing a tanker owned by BP's stepped in with protection after 3 Iranian vessels trying to block its passage thousands of illegal immigrants could be rounded up for deportation from America this weekend after President Trump calls a high profile rates and coming up in the next half-hour report says there is still a significant problem of bullying and harassment towards Westminster staff who work for British MPs and flash flooding and tornadoes is a massive storm approaches new Orleans the email warned that residents they cannot pump away the water levels are expected Donald Trump has often complained about Liberal bias on social media saying today he's hosting a tech summit at the white house with some of the biggest names in Conservative me media Yeah tweeting earlier today the President said the summit will cover the dishonesty and bias of the fake news media adding fake news is not as important or a powerful social media they have lost tremendous credibility since the election in 2016 joining us now from Washington is Margaret Morrow history Professor at the University of Washington and author of the current Silicon Valley in remaking America seems to me the problem with this text summit Margaret is the tech companies aren't there can we make significant changes in social media social media companies are even at the table now you can do really central to the problem with that the dilemma that both Washington and Silicon Valley have on our hands this one It's only be solved when they come together and the real of the enough basic problem is that there is a regulatory regime its governing social media that was created an error when the internet was very different the big tech companies are already under close Richer than ever before in Congress is a danger with them not being there and some other senior figures from Congress in the room that some of that process could be speeded up well it's interesting how the mood in Washington now so dramatically different than it was just a few years ago really for such a long time there's that the ground covered in my book is 70 years longer relationship between the us government and the us tech industry and for so long was a very very positive one person leaders of both parties President members of Congress were very gung Ho about the possibility of Silicon Valley companies to change the world now the mood darkened but gannets its kind to be no regular very fixes and Mwah legal fixes that will be quick and easy there will need to be technologically informed and listening to the people who really understand how it works there are a whole host of problems around social media of course interventions in democratic elections is one of them that Congress is trying to wrestle with if is the President right with the premise that there is a political bias inherited social media sites whether through the algorithms or whatever it is that conservative voices are excluded from social media platforms well the date the great irony about this bias conversation is that actually the problem stems from the fact that the social media platforms had been designed to try and be neutral this is really goes back and of the philosophy with which the platforms have been designed by Silicon Valley denizens of the beginning that you can create the platform for free and open communication you're not gonna have a gate keepers who are deciding what's he saying Watson who has privileged privileged voice but of course these platforms have been designed for maximum engagement their day they drive then because they appeal to our emotions whether it be now something that the positive emotion or an angry emotion and of course that is what social media platforms have have become very good Some conveyancers for all sorts of speech that their creators didn't imagine after which Donald Trump has caused profit more than page let me ask you about something that happened this side the French government today has approved a law or parliament house that would make France the first major economy to impose a tax on these internet giants say I think it's 3% tax how will the United States react that what will it mean for the social media giant's it is very interesting is the question of that sort of the specialness of the internet is something that it is being reckoned with both both now and in the US and globally and Remy the question of whether internet calmer should be taxed of course was alive one It's a very long time now you have you buy something on the internet and the us does is subject to state taxes away even used to be end these internet giants ground larger and in an era estate and taxation has been very well It's then there's been a swing towards deregulation lower taxes so</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

So entrenching the power of big tech. </p><p>Amol Rajan, BBC News. Let's speak now to Dr Vicky Nash, from the Oxford Internet Institute. Good evening. Countries around the world are grappling with how to regulate the Internet and regulate what is going on it. Do you think this is a model that could work in Britain or elsewhere? It is a good question. I think the UK Government would like to be seen as a model that other countries will take up. My fear is that precisely because it is so broad, it covers everything from terrorism to cyber bullying, that it might prove in practice quite difficult to have a system that other countries will want to copy. What is the actual process? Will it suggest any process through which Internet companies can be punished? I do not see how that would work in practice. It is difficult because not all Internet companies have any corporate space in the UK. This particular paper is trying to think about how you can address that. We have seen proposals which include things like fines, substantial fines, for noncompliant companies but also potentially find for individuals -- fines for individuals and even the blocking of sites that do not comply. There is a whole range of measures they are thinking of introducing, so which are quite severe. One of the debates about the Internet is that it comes back to this fundamental issue of freedom of speech versus censorship. Is there a concern that as soon as you could find this in any kind of way with regulation, even if it is in a country where the Government is acting in a benign manner, that template can be taken up by a more authoritarian country and gets used as a restriction and censorship? I think that is right. This is why I would personally prefer to see this paper reframes around the concept of human rights which would stealthily blast to identify and work with some of the most severe online times but would put freedom of expression at the core of the proposals. The notion of harm is so vague that I can't quite see countries -- I can see countries, authoritarian states, putting their hands together in a relish to enforce these rules in their own weight, in ways much more oppressive. It is like what is happening in the United States, there is little regulation imposed in Congress and you have members frustrated thinking that the big tech companies need to have more restrictions placed on them. But they are looking at what is happening in Europe and in Australia that is taking measures as well, and seeing if there is some kind of model for them. Any sense it is it world wide web, there has to be a worldwide policy, doesn't there? Though does and I suppose that is why would like to see a system that could actually be shared across these jurisdictions and I think human rights focus models would be much more amenable to that. The European approach itches much more accepting a need to limit free speech is hard to see it go down in the US. In an ideal world we would have a single system that these big multinational firms can apply in the same way across all jurisdictions. Thank you very much for joining us. Such an interesting discussion because very different views in Europe and here, completely different system in China where the Government has effectively said, we are going to take control of the Internet and have it behind a firewall and dictate what goes on to it. Now everyone trying to come up with some kind of unified position. An Australian having brought in Draconian laws after the Christchurch shootings to everyone working on different policy. This is Beyond 100 Days. Still to come -We'll look at the issues and contenders in India's election - as 900 million voters prepare to head to the polls. A new 'Ultra Low Emission Zone', to reduce air pollution, has come into force in central London. Under the scheme, drivers of older, more polluting cars and vans will have to pay a daily fee of #12.50 on top of the existing congestion charge. Victoria Gill reports. These images filled with a heat sensitive camera showed the pollution from vehicles being pumped into our streets. It's invisible but on busy city streets like this we're all breathing it and long-term exposure to air pollution from traffic can damage our lungs, our hearts, and it reduces our life expectancy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-131f3cd0ce8946ad80372110bf42bca8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VV6-0B01-JBH6-C38B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"836\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

interviewed on some American networks as well and you do get an impression that they remember every single detail they are very convincing but of course on the other side they say a lot of these allegations are politically if you make an allegation like this you can knock someone out of the political gain Yeah I think that's what women are now trying says this is not a political issue that this needs to be bipartisan we've seen this in Congress we see this debate in Congress this is not a Republican is not Democratic the response should not be Republican or Democrat earned despite the fact that the president is a Republican so it's very easy for this to become politicised a lot of women want to try and resist that temptation OK with the terms of a divorce agreement in place the way is now clear for the UK and the EU to begin talks about trade closely aligned should the UK remain to the rules of the single market after Brexit one of the people whose job it is to ensure a level playing field for trade is the EU's competition commissioner Margaret the stagger in recent years she has been a thorn in the side of the big tech company who managed to avoid paying corporation tax so I spoke to earlier today Am asking whether Apple has paid billions in back-taxes she demanded from them for business conducted here in Europe know they cannot pay that in 4 yet this is why we have referred the Aires to the EU court because we've seen the recovery from the Dutch authorities from the Belgian authorities from Luxembourg authorities they have recovered unpaid taxes and of course the Irish will have to wear to recover unpaid taxes as well when it comes to the big tech companies we talk about tax but you also fined Google for abusing dominance in search Facebook for providing misleading information in its acquisition of the messaging service WhatsApp and Amazon over its evil orcs do the tech giant's particular American tech giant need to do more they need to up their game when they need to follow our common rulebook because it's for everyone to do business in Europe but we do have a common rulebook and that applies for US companies world for European companies as well for as any other company and I think it is important for businesses to say well we want to compete on the merits and not by cutting corners of title you about the the Brexit negotiation because you're the the competition Commission as I'm sure you have an interest in regulations and rules what you understand by full alignment it is important for us as well as for UK businesses to have a level playing field so that we compete on quality products there are prizes services that we attach to this and this and that is what the compete and compete on a lot of people raised the example of the chlorinated chickens so say that the UK does a trade deal with the United States we know that chlorinated shaking is not acceptable within the European Union so what happens to chicken farmer is who might then in the future deal with the European Union how does that work tech I don't know what to tell you anything this is why a lot of people have the uncertainty about what will happen in the future and that is why of course it would be a good thing too advanced negotiations should be able to give answers to people so they know where to invest where to do their business where to engage themselves in may in future job openings and and this is our ambition to to get on with it in order to be able to provide answers that question and many many others he said before the record that when it comes to tax harmonisation and harmonisation of rules regulations and you're not a federalist but the things we're really here in the UK this week from people like Martin Schultz who was the former President of the European Parliament is that he wants the United States of Europe and when people look at that they think well most people in the UK didn't want that so maybe they were right to leave but the good thing about today Europe is that everyone can form their own opinion I'm entitled to mind just as well as Martin show is entitled to his I'm not a fatalist I think actually what we have created in Europe is quite unique is not a copy of something historic is not out there feeling book about what someone has just thought of it is can create lived life and then developed democracy based on a European history and that I think is a good thing and I think we are developing according to what people wants the Prime Minister and the UK said that she once seen deepens special partnership with the European Union but there's a lot of frustration at the moment directed at Ireland because it has these tax rates these corporate tax rate of 12 and a half % we've already talked about the difficulties that exposed in relation to Apple are you at all concerned that when Britain is a sovereign state and government is making sovereign decisions it will exist as a sort of low-tax

The response should not be Republican or Democrat despite the fact of course that the President is a Republican and it is easy for this to become politicised but a lot of women want to resist that temptation. With the terms of a divorce agreement in place the way is clear for the EU and the UK to begin talks about trade but how closely aligned should they remain to the single market after Brexit? One of the people whose job it is to ensure a level playing field is Margaret Thursday. </p><p>She has been a thorn in the side of the big tech companies who have managed to avoid paying corporation tax and when I spoke to her earlier I began by asking whether Apple has paved the billions of back taxes she has demanded from them for business conducted here in Europe. They have not paid that. This is why we have referred them to the EU courts. We have seen the recovery from the Dutch authorities, have recovered unpaid taxes and the from the Belgian authorities, they Irish will have to recover unpaid taxes as well. When it comes to the big companies, you have also find Google for abusing dominance in search, Facebook for providing misleading information in its accusation that rapper acquisition of what's up. Do you think the tech giants, particularly the tech giants need to do more? They need to follow our common rule book, because it is for everyone to do business in Europe but we do have a common rule book and that applies for US companies as well as European companies, as well as any other company and I think it is important for businesses to say we want to compete on merit and not by cutting corners. Can I talk to you about the Brexit negotiation because you are at the competition commissioner and I'm sure you have an interest in regulations and rules, what do you understand by full alignment? It is important for us as well as for the UK businesses to have a level playing field, so that we compete on the quality of products, prices, services that we attach to it and that is what we compete on. A lot of people raise the example of the chlorinated check-in. Say that the UK does a trade deal with the United States, we know that chlorinated chicken is not accepted in the European Union so what happens to chicken farmers who might deal with European Union, how does that work, technically? I don't know what to tell you and I think that is why a lot of people have the uncertainty about what will happen in the future and that is why it would be a good thing to advance the negotiation, to be able to give answers to people so they know where to do their business, where to engage themselves in future openings and this is our ambition, to get on with it enabled to be able to provide answers to that question and many others. You have said before that when it comes to tax harmonisation and the harmonisation of rules and regulations, you're not a Federalist, but the things we are reading in the UK this week from people like Martin Schulz, the former President of the European Parliament is that he once the United States of Europe and when people at the back, they think, most people in the UK did not want that so maybe they were right to leave. The good thing about Europe is that everyone can form their own opinion. I am entitled to mine as well as Martin Schulz is entitled to his. I am not a Federalist, I think what we have created in Europe is unique, it is not a copy of something historic, it is not out of the theory book, what someone has just thought of, it is concrete and develop democracy based on European history and I think that is a good thing. I think we are developing according to what people want. The Prime Minister of the UK said that she wanted a deep and special partnership with the European Union but there is a lot of frustration at the moment directed at Ireland because it has these corporate tax rates at 12.5% and we have talked about the difficulties that has posed in relation to Apple, are you concerned that when Britain is a sovereign state and the government is making sovereign decisions that it will exist as a low tax economy off the European mainland? The UK is an active part of this tax Alliance and they see no reason why the UK should leave that. It comes from, I think, a conviction from the rest of the countries that not only many company should pay their taxes but that all companies should pay their taxes.

But the people generally came together to reject that kind of extremism and that kind of radicalism. Now they are called on, the world is called on, to reject this kind of terrorism that we saw two days ago, to say this is just not going to be acceptable. </p><p>This is a worldwide community now, New Zealand is no longer the isolated little island that it was once. It is part of a world community, and particularly the Internet has now connected all of us, and so these radical people can talk to each other all over the world and spread their venom all over the world, and we have to as a world community say it is not going to be tolerated. Donald Trump tweeted today the fake news media is working overtime to blame me for the horrible attack in New Zealand, they will have to work very hard to prove something ridiculous. I don't think the media is trying to blame Donald Trump. The point that they have been making is that there wasn't the forcible denunciation of white extremist terrorism that many people might have expected, the white nationalism that we obviously have talked about when it comes to Charlottesville or indeed this attack in New Zealand. Right. I don't know if Donald Trump is delusional, if his delusional narcissism has any bounds, and it is tragic when you have innocent lives being taken, whether it is a woman standing on the street in Charlottesville or people at prayer at a mosque in Christchurch, it really is the same stuff. You have to take ownership of the fact that as the leader of the free world, and the United States considers itself to be that, you have a responsibility to set an example and to show people what is moral and what is right by the way you conduct and purport yourself. And I don't think he understands that at all. Carol Moseley Braun, ambassador to New Zealand under President Clinton, thank you very much for joining us. Amidst the dreadful loss of life and injury caused by Christchurch mosque attack in New Zealand is an additional horror. As the gunman opened fire, killing 50 people and injuring 50 more, he filmed the entire crime and live-streamed it directly to Facebook. Yet again, the big tech companies are coming under pressure to prevent damaging and disturbing material being widely shared on their sites. Facebook says it removed 1.5 million copies of the footage in the first day after the incident and that 1.2 million of those copies were blocked while they were being uploaded. But is that enough? We're joined from Westminster by the Chair of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Damian Collins. You have had strong things to say about the social media companies in recent months. Do you think they did enough in this instance to stop what was being circulated? No, I don't think they did. I think many people are concerned that the Facebook live stream lasted for over 17 minutes before it was stopped, and by the figures that you quoted from Facebook, it still means there were 300,000 successful uploads of the video. Now, in addition to issues on Facebook, there were then further issues throughout the day following the attacks on YouTube as well of the film is reappearing, so I think there are serious questions for the company as to why they were unable to take more effective action earlier against the live streaming, why so many films were successfully uploaded, and throughout the day as well. We know that they can identify harmful content, and they do it successfully with many forms of harmful content to particularly things like child abuse. Why were they not able to do it more effectively here? Why couldn't they use facial recognition technology to identify images of the attacker and to identify films that he was in? I think these are the sorts of technical questions that we need answers to, because for me, if Facebook responses and duty responses at the best we could do, I think we have to say back to them, that is not good enough. I was listening to a journalist today who covers tech and extremism saying that the problem with it as there is an algorithmic nudge towards extremism, and he gave the analogy of, you wouldn't have gone into a library 50 years ago and asked for a book on white supremacy and then as you left the librarian would have offered you Mein Kampf as well, that is what is happening, you are taken step-by-step into a more extreme community. How do we stop that if it is an algorithm that is drawing people there? Absolutely. I think it is a very serious point, which is why my committee's report on disinformation and fake news, that is why we said we felt there needs to be an independent regulator that has the ability to go into the tech company and look at the way the algorithm works and challenge the company in a way that the situation</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCN24-d8427b5b6c854a50a67f3845514d5bdd</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCN242019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VNP-S511-DY08-3234-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402032</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"860\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 TVEyes, Inc.

Paul McIntyre, a 52-year-old man from the city, has been charged with murder, possession of a firearm and membership of the IRA. It gets better for those of us who live long enough to see it get better. Lyra McKee, a writer and gay rights activist, stood next to a police Land Rover the night she was killed during rioting in the city in April last year. </p><p>A gunman was seen on mobile phone footage, stepping out and firing towards police. The dissident Republican group, known as the New IRA, later claimed it was behind the shooting. The violence was widely condemned, bringing back memories of Northern Ireland's troubled past. Today, the vast majority of those who live in Derry do not support dissident Republican groups. Paul McIntyre, a man well-known locally, was greeted at court by a group of his supporters who held a protest through the hearing. Inside court, Paul McIntyre spoke only to confirm his name and address. His defence solicitor said he was accused of standing behind the man who'd fired the weapon, and was later seen picking up casings that had come out of the gun. Lyra McKee's partner, her family and friends attended court wearing T-shirts saying, \"Speak out for Lyra.\" Police say the search for evidence to try to bring the gunman to justice will go on. Emma Vardy, BBC News, Derry. Before the internet there was no such thing as virtual space-our world was defined by borders and physical boundaries that separated countries across continents. Today, however, we have communities that exist entirely online. Companies like Facebook, Google, and YouTube aren't just big-they're powerful. So, how should traditional nation-states confront the rise of so called \"net states\"? We're joined now by Alexis Wichowski, author of The Information Trade What Arnett states? It is what happens when big tech evolves beyond making apps and services and get involved in things that state use to control entirely, not like defence and diplomacy. Are you saying then that these states are replacing some of the functions that traditional states have failed? I would say they are complementing them in ways that we need to pay attention to. For instance, Facebook has a counterterrorism team that is larger than the US State Department and I think it says something that in some ways governments are glad to see happening, because there is more help for fighting counterterrorism, or for fighting terrorism online. On the other hand there is lots of visibility from governments and to let these units are doing so that is something we need to pay careful attention to. You are starting to see governments wake up to this threat whether it is in the EU or in the FDC this week, basically demanding information on deals these companies have done to grow. Are they too late to start to recognise the threat these net states pose? I did not think it is too great but the approach needs to be different. Instead of focusing on user data, we need to think about all the different ways that net states collects data on users beyond when we use our apps and services. For instance if someone types and something to search in Google or a post on Facebook, that is one form of data and we can regulate that but we also need to think about our location data. What happens when we use Google ways and they have a GPS location? We need to be more sat down next about the kinds of data we are looking at when we use them. Thank you. Now - if you're a regular viewer of this programme, you'll know our producers are never shy of sending us somewhere hostile. New Hampshire this week, or Iowa last week, or is there anything more hostile than Westminster on a Brexit debate night? Yes, you and Katty just need to get away from it all. Take a break. And do you know - I might have just the thing It's almost fifty years since we sent anyone to the Moon - but today NASA has announced its looking for two candidates - to go to the moon in 2024! And they want - one man, and one woman. I can think of two perfect contenders. You must be joking. Three weeks and a moon capsule with Caddy K?

cents bhp as opposed to Fang Facebook Amazon Netflix Google the big tech companies in the US in China it's clear that the big technology companies have to play second fiddle to the party if necessary giving up data on citizens if they are asked to and it's a very different state of affairs from the one we see in the United States where the still minimal regulation Europe somewhere in between where the European Commission is trying to regulate the tech companies the course mostly American but it still seems to me a kind of unresolved problem in all democracy is how do we contend with the fact that the public sphere has been completely transformed was still operating with regulations that were created for public sphere that was dominated by television and newspapers those days are gone I don't think many people fully got their heads around that the book is the square the town near folks thanks for joining me a pleasure so let me see if I got the straight that there have always been networks much stronger now there is a signs to them and who controls them so in layman's terms if you were to look at these programmes say as a network Q would have the producers have the director Nathan then you have the presenters men if you look really closely catty you would see a hub of the network the real power is not right that what was then the power structure right at the centre of this network the person who controls it all somewhat is up nicely what he was saying the absolutely I think he didn't actually say my name he was about to say and obviously the person whose main hierarchy on this programme and Christian say if you ever want to say that I'm facile as proof Ferguson did I let him get away with it she was Yeah I was found it quite easy I would However put my this through the screen of a real go back and watch a version of those sounds good Yes OK and the white house position will go into more detail today on the president's health check the house press secretary Sarah Sanders said Dr Elly Jackson would give a detailed read out and answer a few questions at today's press briefing that Mr. Trump doesn't smoke I don't drink alcohol but he's partial to a diet Coke or two and plenty that fast food nonetheless Mr. Trump's private doctor has claimed that he could be the healthiest person ever to be elected to the presidency and what we've learnt today catch it is not only die cases not only MacDonald but also you starburst and how do we know the President likes stubbornness well the majority leader Kevin McCarthy in the house and he was on air force one and he noticed that when the president went for the sweetie jar he started picking out the pink and the red ones he only lives eats clean hit and more power to Mr. McCarthy because if you look at the pictures from moral Argo at the weekend who has got the Stardust sprinkled Mr. McCarthy various right next to the president said obviously worth this is the way to the president's heart It's actually one of my one in 5 as well always Yes West Ham the everyone has their favourites for my my favourite is clearly the green ones I'm hoping you're not also agreement because we have to fight over the Christian and that would be very boring because I will get the green ones you would be left with red ones the pink and red pink or red is the colour of their riches were Catty wearing today we shot the whole budget of the pro The annual budget of prey burst today can I just say I am and Kirsty producers all think rebels say about that later but actually his brother did send a job with his name on it to the President and apparently the President did smile he liked it like Yeah and a couple of a couple of Republicans away I think this is interesting the that she referred to his own germ phobia in that context she most recently that Christopher steel dossier and allegations of a certain goings-on in Moscow he said that would happen to me because I am a German foe as everybody knows but that his few things the President has said about health and perhaps that issue of being slightly obsessive Yes that exercise is a disaster he says he has friends who work out and they have

What makes them valuable is that they've been generated exclusively for me, by a software tool called MetaMask. In the lingo of cryptography, they're known as my seed phrase. They might read like an incoherent stream of consciousness, but these words can be transformed into a key that unlocks a digital bank account, or even an online identity. It just takes a few more steps. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  On the screen, I'm instructed to keep my seed phrase secure: Write it down, or keep it in a secure place on your computer. I scribble the 12 words onto a notepad, click a button and my seed phrase is transformed into a string of 64 seemingly patternless characters:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  1b0be2162cedb2744d016943bb14e71de6af95a63af3790d6b41b1e719dc5c66</p><p>  This is what's called a ''private key'' in the world of cryptography: a way of proving identity, in the same, limited way that real-world keys attest to your identity when you unlock your front door. My seed phrase will generate that exact sequence of characters every time, but there's no known way to reverse-engineer the original phrase from the key, which is why it is so important to keep the seed phrase in a safe location.</p><p>  That private key number is then run through two additional transformations, creating a new string:</p><p>  0x6c2ecd6388c550e8d99ada34a1cd55bedd052ad9</p><p>  That string is my address on the Ethereum blockchain.</p><p>Ethereum belongs to the same family as the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, whose value has increased more than 1,000 percent in just the past year. Ethereum has its own currencies, most notably Ether, but the platform has a wider scope than just money. You can think of my Ethereum address as having elements of a bank account, an email address and a Social Security number. For now, it exists only on my computer as an inert string of nonsense, but the second I try to perform any kind of transaction -- say, contributing to a crowdfunding campaign or voting in an online referendum -- that address is broadcast out to an improvised worldwide network of computers that tries to verify the transaction. The results of that verification are then broadcast to the wider network again, where more machines enter into a kind of competition to perform complex mathematical calculations, the winner of which gets to record that transaction in the single, canonical record of every transaction ever made in the history of Ethereum. Because those transactions are registered in a sequence of ''blocks'' of data, that record is called the blockchain.</p><p>  The whole exchange takes no more than a few minutes to complete. From my perspective, the experience barely differs from the usual routines of online life. But on a technical level, something miraculous is happening -- something that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. I've managed to complete a secure transaction without any of the traditional institutions that we rely on to establish trust. No intermediary brokered the deal; no social-media network captured the data from my transaction to better target its advertising; no credit bureau tracked the activity to build a portrait of my financial trustworthiness.</p><p>  And the platform that makes all this possible? No one owns it. There are no venture investors backing Ethereum Inc., because there is no Ethereum Inc. As an organizational form, Ethereum is far closer to a democracy than a private corporation. No imperial chief executive calls the shots. You earn the privilege of helping to steer Ethereum's ship of state by joining the community and doing the work. Like Bitcoin and most other blockchain platforms, Ethereum is more a swarm than a formal entity. Its borders are porous; its hierarchy is deliberately flattened.</p><p>  Oh, one other thing: Some members of that swarm have already accumulated a paper net worth in the billions from their labors, as the value of one ''coin'' of Ether rose from $8 on Jan. 1, 2017, to $843 exactly one year later.</p><p>  You may be inclined to dismiss these transformations. After all, Bitcoin and Ether's runaway valuation looks like a case study in irrational exuberance. And why should you care about an arcane technical breakthrough that right now doesn't feel all that different from signing in to a website to make a credit card payment?</p><p>  But that dismissal would be shortsighted. If there's one thing we've learned from the recent history of the internet, it's that seemingly esoteric decisions about software architecture can unleash profound global forces once the technology moves into wider circulation. If the email standards adopted in the 1970s had included public-private key cryptography as a default setting, we might have avoided the cataclysmic email hacks that have afflicted everyone from Sony to John Podesta, and millions of ordinary consumers might be spared routinized identity theft. If Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, had included a protocol for mapping our social identity in his original specs, we might not have Facebook.</p><p>  The true believers behind blockchain platforms like Ethereum argue that a network of distributed trust is one of those advances in software architecture that will prove, in the long run, to have historic significance. That promise has helped fuel the huge jump in cryptocurrency valuations. But in a way, the Bitcoin bubble may ultimately turn out to be a distraction from the true significance of the blockchain. The real promise of these new technologies, many of their evangelists believe, lies not in displacing our currencies but in replacing much of what we now think of as the internet, while at the same time returning the online world to a more decentralized and egalitarian system. If you believe the evangelists, the blockchain is the future. But it is also a way of getting back to the internet's roots.</p><p>  Once the inspiration for utopian dreams of infinite libraries and global connectivity, the internet has seemingly become, over the past year, a universal scapegoat: the cause of almost every social ill that confronts us. Russian trolls destroy the democratic system with fake news on Facebook; hate speech flourishes on Twitter and Reddit; the vast fortunes of the geek elite worsen income equality. For many of us who participated in the early days of the web, the last few years have felt almost postlapsarian. The web had promised a new kind of egalitarian media, populated by small magazines, bloggers and self-organizing encyclopedias; the information titans that dominated mass culture in the 20th century would give way to a more decentralized system, defined by collaborative networks, not hierarchies and broadcast channels. The wider culture would come to mirror the peer-to-peer architecture of the internet itself. The web in those days was hardly a utopia -- there were financial bubbles and spammers and a thousand other problems -- but beneath those flaws, we assumed, there was an underlying story of progress.</p><p>  Last year marked the point at which that narrative finally collapsed. The existence of internet skeptics is nothing new, of course; the difference now is that the critical voices increasingly belong to former enthusiasts. ''We have to fix the internet,'' Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs's biographer, wrote in an essay published a few weeks after Donald Trump was elected president. ''After 40 years, it has begun to corrode, both itself and us.'' The former Google strategist James Williams told The Guardian: ''The dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will.'' In a blog post, Brad Burnham, a managing partner at Union Square Ventures, a top New York venture-capital firm, bemoaned the collateral damage from the quasi monopolies of the digital age: ''Publishers find themselves becoming commodity content suppliers in a sea of undifferentiated content in the Facebook news feed. Websites see their fortunes upended by small changes in Google's search algorithms. And manufacturers watch helplessly as sales dwindle when Amazon decides to source products directly in China and redirect demand to their own products.'' (Full disclosure: Burnham's firm invested in a company I started in 2006; we have had no financial relationship since it sold in 2011.) Even Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web itself, wrote a blog post voicing his concerns that the advertising-based model of social media and search engines creates a climate where ''misinformation, or 'fake news,' which is surprising, shocking or designed to appeal to our biases, can spread like wildfire.''</p><p>  For most critics, the solution to these immense structural issues has been to propose either a new mindfulness about the dangers of these tools -- turning off our smartphones, keeping kids off social media -- or the strong arm of regulation and antitrust: making the tech giants subject to the same scrutiny as other industries that are vital to the public interest, like the railroads or telephone networks of an earlier age. Both those ideas are commendable: We probably should develop a new set of habits governing how we interact with social media, and it seems entirely sensible that companies as powerful as Google and Facebook should face the same regulatory scrutiny as, say, television networks. But those interventions are unlikely to fix the core problems that the online world confronts. After all, it was not just the antitrust division of the Department of Justice that challenged Microsoft's monopoly power in the 1990s; it was also the emergence of new software and hardware -- the web, open-source software and Apple products -- that helped undermine Microsoft's dominant position.</p><p>  The blockchain evangelists behind platforms like Ethereum believe that a comparable array of advances in software, cryptography and distributed systems has the ability to tackle today's digital problems: the corrosive incentives of online advertising; the quasi monopolies of Facebook, Google and Amazon; Russian misinformation campaigns. If they succeed, their creations may challenge the hegemony of the tech giants far more effectively than any antitrust regulation. They even claim to offer an alternative to the winner-take-all model of capitalism than has driven wealth inequality to heights not seen since the age of the robber barons.</p><p>  That remedy is not yet visible in any product that would be intelligible to an ordinary tech consumer. The only blockchain project that has crossed over into mainstream recognition so far is Bitcoin, which is in the middle of a speculative bubble that makes the 1990s internet I.P.O. frenzy look like a neighborhood garage sale. And herein lies the cognitive dissonance that confronts anyone trying to make sense of the blockchain: the potential power of this would-be revolution is being actively undercut by the crowd it is attracting, a veritable goon squad of charlatans, false prophets and mercenaries. Not for the first time, technologists pursuing a vision of an open and decentralized network have found themselves surrounded by a wave of opportunists looking to make an overnight fortune. The question is whether, after the bubble has burst, the very real promise of the blockchain can endure.</p><p>  To some students of modern technological history, the internet's fall from grace follows an inevitable historical script. As Tim Wu argued in his 2010 book, ''The Master Switch,'' all the major information technologies of the 20th century adhered to a similar developmental pattern, starting out as the playthings of hobbyists and researchers motivated by curiosity and community, and ending up in the hands of multinational corporations fixated on maximizing shareholder value. Wu calls this pattern the Cycle, and on the surface at least, the internet has followed the Cycle with convincing fidelity. The internet began as a hodgepodge of government-funded academic research projects and side-hustle hobbies. But 20 years after the web first crested into the popular imagination, it has produced in Google, Facebook and Amazon -- and indirectly, Apple -- what may well be the most powerful and valuable corporations in the history of capitalism.</p><p>  Blockchain advocates don't accept the inevitability of the Cycle. The roots of the internet were in fact more radically open and decentralized than previous information technologies, they argue, and had we managed to stay true to those roots, it could have remained that way. The online world would not be dominated by a handful of information-age titans; our news platforms would be less vulnerable to manipulation and fraud; identity theft would be far less common; advertising dollars would be distributed across a wider range of media properties.</p><p>  To understand why, it helps to think of the internet as two fundamentally different kinds of systems stacked on top of each other, like layers in an archaeological dig. One layer is composed of the software protocols that were developed in the 1970s and 1980s and hit critical mass, at least in terms of audience, in the 1990s. (A protocol is the software version of a lingua franca, a way that multiple computers agree to communicate with one another. There are protocols that govern the flow of the internet's raw data, and protocols for sending email messages, and protocols that define the addresses of web pages.) And then above them, a second layer of web-based services -- Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter -- that largely came to power in the following decade.</p><p>  The first layer -- call it InternetOne -- was founded on open protocols, which in turn were defined and maintained by academic researchers and international-standards bodies, owned by no one. In fact, that original openness continues to be all around us, in ways we probably don't appreciate enough. Email is still based on the open protocols POP, SMTP and IMAP; websites are still served up using the open protocol HTTP; bits are still circulated via the original open protocols of the internet, TCP/IP. You don't need to understand anything about how these software conventions work on a technical level to enjoy their benefits. The key characteristic they all share is that anyone can use them, free of charge. You don't need to pay a licensing fee to some corporation that owns HTTP if you want to put up a web page; you don't have to sell a part of your identity to advertisers if you want to send an email using SMTP. Along with Wikipedia, the open protocols of the internet constitute the most impressive example of commons-based production in human history.</p><p>  To see how enormous but also invisible the benefits of such protocols have been, imagine that one of those key standards had not been developed: for instance, the open standard we use for defining our geographic location, GPS. Originally developed by the United States military, the Global Positioning System was first made available for civilian use during the Reagan administration. For about a decade, it was largely used by the aviation industry, until individual consumers began to use it in car navigation systems. And now we have smartphones that can pick up a signal from GPS satellites orbiting above us, and we use that extraordinary power to do everything from locating nearby restaurants to playing Pok\u00c3\u00a9mon Go to coordinating disaster-relief efforts.</p><p>  But what if the military had kept GPS out of the public domain? Presumably, sometime in the 1990s, a market signal would have gone out to the innovators of Silicon Valley and other tech hubs, suggesting that consumers were interested in establishing their exact geographic coordinates so that those locations could be projected onto digital maps. There would have been a few years of furious competition among rival companies, who would toss their own proprietary satellites into orbit and advance their own unique protocols, but eventually the market would have settled on one dominant model, given all the efficiencies that result from a single, common way of verifying location. Call that imaginary firm GeoBook. Initially, the embrace of GeoBook would have been a leap forward for consumers and other companies trying to build location awareness into their hardware and software. But slowly, a darker narrative would have emerged: a single private corporation, tracking the movements of billions of people around the planet, building an advertising behemoth based on our shifting locations. Any start-up trying to build a geo-aware application would have been vulnerable to the whims of mighty GeoBook. Appropriately angry polemics would have been written denouncing the public menace of this Big Brother in the sky.</p><p>  But none of that happened, for a simple reason. Geolocation, like the location of web pages and email addresses and domain names, is a problem we solved with an open protocol. And because it's a problem we don't have, we rarely think about how beautifully GPS does work and how many different applications have been built on its foundation.</p><p>  The open, decentralized web turns out to be alive and well on the InternetOne layer. But since we settled on the World Wide Web in the mid-'90s, we've adopted very few new open-standard protocols. The biggest problems that technologists tackled after 1995 -- many of which revolved around identity, community and payment mechanisms -- were left to the private sector to solve. This is what led, in the early 2000s, to a powerful new layer of internet services, which we might call InternetTwo.</p><p>  For all their brilliance, the inventors of the open protocols that shaped the internet failed to include some key elements that would later prove critical to the future of online culture. Perhaps most important, they did not create a secure open standard that established human identity on the network. Units of information could be defined -- pages, links, messages -- but people did not have their own protocol: no way to define and share your real name, your location, your interests or (perhaps most crucial) your relationships to other people online.</p><p>  This turns out to have been a major oversight, because identity is the sort of problem that benefits from one universally recognized solution. It's what Vitalik Buterin, a founder of Ethereum, describes as ''base-layer'' infrastructure: things like language, roads and postal services, platforms where commerce and competition are actually assisted by having an underlying layer in the public domain. Offline, we don't have an open market for physical passports or Social Security numbers; we have a few reputable authorities -- most of them backed by the power of the state -- that we use to confirm to others that we are who we say we are. But online, the private sector swooped in to fill that vacuum, and because identity had that characteristic of being a universal problem, the market was heavily incentivized to settle on one common standard for defining yourself and the people you know.</p><p>  The self-reinforcing feedback loops that economists call ''increasing returns'' or ''network effects'' kicked in, and after a period of experimentation in which we dabbled in social-media start-ups like Myspace and Friendster, the market settled on what is essentially a proprietary standard for establishing who you are and whom you know. That standard is Facebook. With more than two billion users, Facebook is far larger than the entire internet at the peak of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. And that user growth has made it the world's sixth-most-valuable corporation, just 14 years after it was founded. Facebook is the ultimate embodiment of the chasm that divides InternetOne and InternetTwo economies. No private company owned the protocols that defined email or GPS or the open web. But one single corporation owns the data that define social identity for two billion people today -- and one single person, Mark Zuckerberg, holds the majority of the voting power in that corporation.</p><p>  If you see the rise of the centralized web as an inevitable turn of the Cycle, and the open-protocol idealism of the early web as a kind of adolescent false consciousness, then there's less reason to fret about all the ways we've abandoned the vision of InternetOne. Either we're living in a fallen state today and there's no way to get back to Eden, or Eden itself was a kind of fantasy that was always going to be corrupted by concentrated power. In either case, there's no point in trying to restore the architecture of InternetOne; our only hope is to use the power of the state to rein in these corporate giants, through regulation and antitrust action. It's a variation of the old Audre Lorde maxim: ''The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house.'' You can't fix the problems technology has created for us by throwing more technological solutions at it. You need forces outside the domain of software and servers to break up cartels with this much power.</p><p>  But the thing about the master's house, in this analogy, is that it's a duplex. The upper floor has indeed been built with tools that cannot be used to dismantle it. But the open protocols beneath them still have the potential to build something better.</p><p>  One of the most persuasive advocates of an open-protocol revival is Juan Benet, a Mexican-born programmer now living on a suburban side street in Palo Alto, Calif., in a three-bedroom rental that he shares with his girlfriend and another programmer, plus a rotating cast of guests, some of whom belong to Benet's organization, Protocol Labs. On a warm day in September, Benet greeted me at his door wearing a black Protocol Labs hoodie. The interior of the space brought to mind the incubator/frat house of HBO's ''Silicon Valley,'' its living room commandeered by an array of black computer monitors. In the entrance hallway, the words ''Welcome to Rivendell'' were scrawled out on a whiteboard, a nod to the Elven city from ''Lord of the Rings.'' ''We call this house Rivendell,'' Benet said sheepishly. ''It's not a very good Rivendell. It doesn't have enough books, or waterfalls, or elves.''</p><p>  Benet, who is 29, considers himself a child of the first peer-to-peer revolution that briefly flourished in the late 1990s and early 2000s, driven in large part by networks like BitTorrent that distributed media files, often illegally. That initial flowering was in many ways a logical outgrowth of the internet's decentralized, open-protocol roots. The web had shown that you could publish documents reliably in a commons-based network. Services like BitTorrent or Skype took that logic to the next level, allowing ordinary users to add new functionality to the internet: creating a distributed library of (largely pirated) media, as with BitTorrent, or helping people make phone calls over the internet, as with Skype.</p><p>  Sitting in the living room/office at Rivendell, Benet told me that he thinks of the early 2000s, with the ascent of Skype and BitTorrent, as ''the 'summer' of peer-to-peer'' -- its salad days. ''But then peer-to-peer hit a wall, because people started to prefer centralized architectures,'' he said. ''And partly because the peer-to-peer business models were piracy-driven.'' A graduate of Stanford's computer-science program, Benet talks in a manner reminiscent of Elon Musk: As he speaks, his eyes dart across an empty space above your head, almost as though he's reading an invisible teleprompter to find the words. He is passionate about the technology Protocol Labs is developing, but also keen to put it in a wider context. For Benet, the shift from distributed systems to more centralized approaches set in motion changes that few could have predicted. ''The rules of the game, the rules that govern all of this technology, matter a lot,'' he said. ''The structure of what we build now will paint a very different picture of the way things will be five or 10 years in the future.'' He continued: ''It was clear to me then that peer-to-peer was this extraordinary thing. What was not clear to me then was how at risk it is. It was not clear to me that you had to take up the baton, that it's now your turn to protect it.''</p><p>  Protocol Labs is Benet's attempt to take up that baton, and its first project is a radical overhaul of the internet's file system, including the basic scheme we use to address the location of pages on the web. Benet calls his system IPFS, short for InterPlanetary File System. The current protocol -- HTTP -- pulls down web pages from a single location at a time and has no built-in mechanism for archiving the online pages. IPFS allows users to download a page simultaneously from multiple locations and includes what programmers call ''historic versioning,'' so that past iterations do not vanish from the historical record. To support the protocol, Benet is also creating a system called Filecoin that will allow users to effectively rent out unused hard-drive space. (Think of it as a sort of Airbnb for data.) ''Right now there are tons of hard drives around the planet that are doing nothing, or close to nothing, to the point where their owners are just losing money,'' Benet said. ''So you can bring online a massive amount of supply, which will bring down the costs of storage.'' But as its name suggests, Protocol Labs has an ambition that extends beyond these projects; Benet's larger mission is to support many new open-source protocols in the years to come.</p><p>  Why did the internet follow the path from open to closed? One part of the explanation lies in sins of omission: By the time a new generation of coders began to tackle the problems that InternetOne left unsolved, there were near-limitless sources of capital to invest in those efforts, so long as the coders kept their systems closed. The secret to the success of the open protocols of InternetOne is that they were developed in an age when most people didn't care about online networks, so they were able to stealthily reach critical mass without having to contend with wealthy conglomerates and venture capitalists. By the mid-2000s, though, a promising new start-up like Facebook could attract millions of dollars in financing even before it became a household brand. And that private-sector money ensured that the company's key software would remain closed, in order to capture as much value as possible for shareholders.</p><p>  And yet -- as the venture capitalist Chris Dixon points out -- there was another factor, too, one that was more technical than financial in nature. ''Let's say you're trying to build an open Twitter,'' Dixon explained while sitting in a conference room at the New York offices of Andreessen Horowitz, where he is a general partner. ''I'm @cdixon at Twitter. Where do you store that? You need a database.'' A closed architecture like Facebook's or Twitter's puts all the information about its users -- their handles, their likes and photos, the map of connections they have to other individuals on the network -- into a private database that is maintained by the company. Whenever you look at your Facebook newsfeed, you are granted access to some infinitesimally small section of that database, seeing only the information that is relevant to you.</p><p>  Running Facebook's database is an unimaginably complex operation, relying on hundreds of thousands of servers scattered around the world, overseen by some of the most brilliant engineers on the planet. From Facebook's point of view, they're providing a valuable service to humanity: creating a common social graph for almost everyone on earth. The fact that they have to sell ads to pay the bills for that service -- and the fact that the scale of their network gives them staggering power over the minds of two billion people around the world -- is an unfortunate, but inevitable, price to pay for a shared social graph. And that trade-off did in fact make sense in the mid-2000s; creating a single database capable of tracking the interactions of hundreds of millions of people -- much less two billion -- was the kind of problem that could be tackled only by a single organization. But as Benet and his fellow blockchain evangelists are eager to prove, that might not be true anymore.</p><p>  So how can you get meaningful adoption of base-layer protocols in an age when the big tech companies have already attracted billions of users and collectively sit on hundreds of billions of dollars in cash? If you happen to believe that the internet, in its current incarnation, is causing significant and growing harm to society, then this seemingly esoteric problem -- the difficulty of getting people to adopt new open-source technology standards -- turns out to have momentous consequences. If we can't figure out a way to introduce new, rival base-layer infrastructure, then we're stuck with the internet we have today. The best we can hope for is government interventions to scale back the power of Facebook or Google, or some kind of consumer revolt that encourages that marketplace to shift to less hegemonic online services, the digital equivalent of forswearing big agriculture for local farmers' markets. Neither approach would upend the underlying dynamics of InternetTwo.</p><p>  The first hint of a meaningful challenge to the closed-protocol era arrived in 2008, not long after Zuckerberg opened the first international headquarters for his growing company. A mysterious programmer (or group of programmers) going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto circulated a paper on a cryptography mailing list. The paper was called ''Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,'' and in it, Nakamoto outlined an ingenious system for a digital currency that did not require a centralized trusted authority to verify transactions. At the time, Facebook and Bitcoin seemed to belong to entirely different spheres -- one was a booming venture-backed social-media start-up that let you share birthday greetings and connect with old friends, while the other was a byzantine scheme for cryptographic currency from an obscure email list. But 10 years later, the ideas that Nakamoto unleashed with that paper now pose the most significant challenge to the hegemony of InternetTwo giants like Facebook.</p><p>  The paradox about Bitcoin is that it may well turn out to be a genuinely revolutionary breakthrough and at the same time a colossal failure as a currency. As I write, Bitcoin has increased in value by nearly 100,000 percent over the past five years, making a fortune for its early investors but also branding it as a spectacularly unstable payment mechanism. The process for creating new Bitcoins has also turned out to be a staggering energy drain.</p><p>  History is replete with stories of new technologies whose initial applications end up having little to do with their eventual use. All the focus on Bitcoin as a payment system may similarly prove to be a distraction, a technological red herring. Nakamoto pitched Bitcoin as a ''peer-to-peer electronic-cash system'' in the initial manifesto, but at its heart, the innovation he (or she or they) was proposing had a more general structure, with two key features.</p><p>  First, Bitcoin offered a kind of proof that you could create a secure database -- the blockchain -- scattered across hundreds or thousands of computers, with no single authority controlling and verifying the authenticity of the data.</p><p>  Second, Nakamoto designed Bitcoin so that the work of maintaining that distributed ledger was itself rewarded with small, increasingly scarce Bitcoin payments. If you dedicated half your computer's processing cycles to helping the Bitcoin network get its math right -- and thus fend off the hackers and scam artists -- you received a small sliver of the currency. Nakamoto designed the system so that Bitcoins would grow increasingly difficult to earn over time, ensuring a certain amount of scarcity in the system. If you helped Bitcoin keep that database secure in the early days, you would earn more Bitcoin than later arrivals. This process has come to be called ''mining.''</p><p>  For our purposes, forget everything else about the Bitcoin frenzy, and just keep these two things in mind: What Nakamoto ushered into the world was a way of agreeing on the contents of a database without anyone being ''in charge'' of the database, and a way of compensating people for helping make that database more valuable, without those people being on an official payroll or owning shares in a corporate entity. Together, those two ideas solved the distributed-database problem and the funding problem. Suddenly there was a way of supporting open protocols that wasn't available during the infancy of Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>  These two features have now been replicated in dozens of new systems inspired by Bitcoin. One of those systems is Ethereum, proposed in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin when he was just 19. Ethereum does have its currencies, but at its heart Ethereum was designed less to facilitate electronic payments than to allow people to run applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain. There are currently hundreds of Ethereum apps in development, ranging from prediction markets to Facebook clones to crowdfunding services. Almost all of them are in pre-alpha stage, not ready for consumer adoption. Despite the embryonic state of the applications, the Ether currency has seen its own miniature version of the Bitcoin bubble, most likely making Buterin an immense fortune.</p><p>  These currencies can be used in clever ways. Juan Benet's Filecoin system will rely on Ethereum technology and reward users and developers who adopt its IPFS protocol or help maintain the shared database it requires. Protocol Labs is creating its own cryptocurrency, also called Filecoin, and has plans to sell some of those coins on the open market in the coming months. (In the summer of 2017, the company raised $135 million in the first 60 minutes of what Benet calls a ''presale'' of the tokens to accredited investors.) Many cryptocurrencies are first made available to the public through a process known as an initial coin offering, or I.C.O.</p><p>  The I.C.O. abbreviation is a deliberate echo of the initial public offering that so defined the first internet bubble in the 1990s. But there is a crucial difference between the two. Speculators can buy in during an I.C.O., but they are not buying an ownership stake in a private company and its proprietary software, the way they might in a traditional I.P.O. Afterward, the coins will continue to be created in exchange for labor -- in the case of Filecoin, by anyone who helps maintain the Filecoin network. Developers who help refine the software can earn the coins, as can ordinary users who lend out spare hard-drive space to expand the network's storage capacity. The Filecoin is a way of signaling that someone, somewhere, has added value to the network.</p><p>  Advocates like Chris Dixon have started referring to the compensation side of the equation in terms of ''tokens,'' not coins, to emphasize that the technology here isn't necessarily aiming to disrupt existing currency systems. ''I like the metaphor of a token because it makes it very clear that it's like an arcade,'' he says. ''You go to the arcade, and in the arcade you can use these tokens. But we're not trying to replace the U.S. government. It's not meant to be a real currency; it's meant to be a pseudo-currency inside this world.'' Dan Finlay, a creator of MetaMask, echoes Dixon's argument. ''To me, what's interesting about this is that we get to program new value systems,'' he says. ''They don't have to resemble money.''</p><p>  Pseudo or not, the idea of an I.C.O. has already inspired a host of shady offerings, some of them endorsed by celebrities who would seem to be unlikely blockchain enthusiasts, like DJ Khaled, Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather. In a blog post published in October 2017, Fred Wilson, a founder of Union Square Ventures and an early advocate of the blockchain revolution, thundered against the spread of I.C.O.s. ''I hate it,'' Wilson wrote, adding that most I.C.O.s ''are scams. And the celebrities and others who promote them on their social-media channels in an effort to enrich themselves are behaving badly and possibly violating securities laws.'' Arguably the most striking thing about the surge of interest in I.C.O.s -- and in existing currencies like Bitcoin or Ether -- is how much financial speculation has already gravitated to platforms that have effectively zero adoption among ordinary consumers. At least during the internet bubble of late 1990s, ordinary people were buying books on Amazon or reading newspapers online; there was clear evidence that the web was going to become a mainstream platform. Today, the hype cycles are so accelerated that billions of dollars are chasing a technology that almost no one outside the cryptocommunity understands, much less uses.</p><p>  Let's say, for the sake of argument, that the hype is warranted, and blockchain platforms like Ethereum become a fundamental part of our digital infrastructure. How would a distributed ledger and a token economy somehow challenge one of the tech giants? One of Fred Wilson's partners at Union Square Ventures, Brad Burnham, suggests a scenario revolving around another tech giant that has run afoul of regulators and public opinion in the last year: Uber. ''Uber is basically just a coordination platform between drivers and passengers,'' Burnham says. ''Yes, it was really innovative, and there were a bunch of things in the beginning about reducing the anxiety of whether the driver was coming or not, and the map -- and a whole bunch of things that you should give them a lot of credit for.'' But when a new service like Uber starts to take off, there's a strong incentive for the marketplace to consolidate around a single leader. The fact that more passengers are starting to use the Uber app attracts more drivers to the service, which in turn attracts more passengers. People have their credit cards stored with Uber; they have the app installed already; there are far more Uber drivers on the road. And so the switching costs of trying out some other rival service eventually become prohibitive, even if the chief executive seems to be a jerk or if consumers would, in the abstract, prefer a competitive marketplace with a dozen Ubers. ''At some point, the innovation around the coordination becomes less and less innovative,'' Burnham says.</p><p>  The blockchain world proposes something different. Imagine some group like Protocol Labs decides there's a case to be made for adding another ''basic layer'' to the stack. Just as GPS gave us a way of discovering and sharing our location, this new protocol would define a simple request: I am here and would like to go there. A distributed ledger might record all its users' past trips, credit cards, favorite locations -- all the metadata that services like Uber or Amazon use to encourage lock-in. Call it, for the sake of argument, the Transit protocol. The standards for sending a Transit request out onto the internet would be entirely open; anyone who wanted to build an app to respond to that request would be free to do so. Cities could build Transit apps that allowed taxi drivers to field requests. But so could bike-share collectives, or rickshaw drivers. Developers could create shared marketplace apps where all the potential vehicles using Transit could vie for your business. When you walked out on the sidewalk and tried to get a ride, you wouldn't have to place your allegiance with a single provider before hailing. You would simply announce that you were standing at 67th and Madison and needed to get to Union Square. And then you'd get a flurry of competing offers. You could even theoretically get an offer from the M.T.A., which could build a service to remind Transit users that it might be much cheaper and faster just to jump on the 6 train.</p><p>  How would Transit reach critical mass when Uber and Lyft already dominate the ride-sharing market? This is where the tokens come in. Early adopters of Transit would be rewarded with Transit tokens, which could themselves be used to purchase Transit services or be traded on exchanges for traditional currency. As in the Bitcoin model, tokens would be doled out less generously as Transit grew more popular. In the early days, a developer who built an iPhone app that uses Transit might see a windfall of tokens; Uber drivers who started using Transit as a second option for finding passengers could collect tokens as a reward for embracing the system; adventurous consumers would be rewarded with tokens for using Transit in its early days, when there are fewer drivers available compared with the existing proprietary networks like Uber or Lyft.</p><p>  As Transit began to take off, it would attract speculators, who would put a monetary price on the token and drive even more interest in the protocol by inflating its value, which in turn would attract more developers, drivers and customers. If the whole system ends up working as its advocates believe, the result is a more competitive but at the same time more equitable marketplace. Instead of all the economic value being captured by the shareholders of one or two large corporations that dominate the market, the economic value is distributed across a much wider group: the early developers of Transit, the app creators who make the protocol work in a consumer-friendly form, the early-adopter drivers and passengers, the first wave of speculators. Token economies introduce a strange new set of elements that do not fit the traditional models: instead of creating value by owning something, as in the shareholder equity model, people create value by improving the underlying protocol, either by helping to maintain the ledger (as in Bitcoin mining), or by writing apps atop it, or simply by using the service. The lines between founders, investors and customers are far blurrier than in traditional corporate models; all the incentives are explicitly designed to steer away from winner-take-all outcomes. And yet at the same time, the whole system depends on an initial speculative phase in which outsiders are betting on the token to rise in value.</p><p>  ''You think about the '90s internet bubble and all the great infrastructure we got out of that,'' Dixon says. ''You're basically taking that effect and shrinking it down to the size of an application.''</p><p>  Even decentralized cryptomovements have their key nodes. For Ethereum, one of those nodes is the Brooklyn headquarters of an organization called ConsenSys, founded by Joseph Lubin, an early Ethereum pioneer. In November, Amanda Gutterman, the 26-year-old chief marketing officer for ConsenSys, gave me a tour of the space. In our first few minutes together, she offered the obligatory cup of coffee, only to discover that the drip-coffee machine in the kitchen was bone dry. ''How can we fix the internet if we can't even make coffee?'' she said with a laugh.</p><p>  Planted in industrial Bushwick, a stone's throw from the pizza mecca Roberta's, ''headquarters'' seemed an unlikely word. The front door was festooned with graffiti and stickers; inside, the stairwells of the space appeared to have been last renovated during the Coolidge administration. Just about three years old, the ConsenSys network now includes more than 550 employees in 28 countries, and the operation has never raised a dime of venture capital. As an organization, ConsenSys does not quite fit any of the usual categories: It is technically a corporation, but it has elements that also resemble nonprofits and workers' collectives. The shared goal of ConsenSys members is strengthening and expanding the Ethereum blockchain. They support developers creating new apps and tools for the platform, one of which is MetaMask, the software that generated my Ethereum address. But they also offer consulting-style services for companies, nonprofits or governments looking for ways to integrate Ethereum's smart contracts into their own systems.</p><p>  The true test of the blockchain will revolve -- like so many of the online crises of the past few years -- around the problem of identity. Today your digital identity is scattered across dozens, or even hundreds, of different sites: Amazon has your credit-card information and your purchase history; Facebook knows your friends and family; Equifax maintains your credit history. When you use any of those services, you are effectively asking for permission to borrow some of that information about yourself in order perform a task: ordering a Christmas present for your uncle, checking Instagram to see pictures from the office party last night. But all these different fragments of your identity don't belong to you; they belong to Facebook and Amazon and Google, who are free to sell bits of that information about you to advertisers without consulting you. You, of course, are free to delete those accounts if you choose, and if you stop checking Facebook, Zuckerberg and the Facebook shareholders will stop making money by renting out your attention to their true customers. But your Facebook or Google identity isn't portable. If you want to join another promising social network that is maybe a little less infected with Russian bots, you can't extract your social network from Twitter and deposit it in the new service. You have to build the network again from scratch (and persuade all your friends to do the same).</p><p>  The blockchain evangelists think this entire approach is backward. You should own your digital identity -- which could include everything from your date of birth to your friend networks to your purchasing history -- and you should be free to lend parts of that identity out to services as you see fit. Given that identity was not baked into the original internet protocols, and given the difficulty of managing a distributed database in the days before Bitcoin, this form of ''self-sovereign'' identity -- as the parlance has it -- was a practical impossibility. Now it is an attainable goal. A number of blockchain-based services are trying to tackle this problem, including a new identity system called uPort that has been spun out of ConsenSys and another one called Blockstack that is currently based on the Bitcoin platform. (Tim Berners-Lee is leading the development of a comparable system, called Solid, that would also give users control over their own data.) These rival protocols all have slightly different frameworks, but they all share a general vision of how identity should work on a truly decentralized internet.</p><p>  What would prevent a new blockchain-based identity standard from following Tim Wu's Cycle, the same one that brought Facebook to such a dominant position? Perhaps nothing. But imagine how that sequence would play out in practice. Someone creates a new protocol to define your social network via Ethereum. It might be as simple as a list of other Ethereum addresses; in other words, Here are the public addresses of people I like and trust. That way of defining your social network might well take off and ultimately supplant the closed systems that define your network on Facebook. Perhaps someday, every single person on the planet might use that standard to map their social connections, just as every single person on the internet uses TCP/IP to share data. But even if this new form of identity became ubiquitous, it wouldn't present the same opportunities for abuse and manipulation that you find in the closed systems that have become de facto standards. I might allow a Facebook-style service to use my social map to filter news or gossip or music for me, based on the activity of my friends, but if that service annoyed me, I'd be free to sample other alternatives without the switching costs. An open identity standard would give ordinary people the opportunity to sell their attention to the highest bidder, or choose to keep it out of the marketplace altogether.</p><p>  Gutterman suggests that the same kind of system could be applied to even more critical forms of identity, like health care data. Instead of storing, say, your genome on servers belonging to a private corporation, the information would instead be stored inside a personal data archive. ''There may be many corporate entities that I don't want seeing that data, but maybe I'd like to donate that data to a medical study,'' she says. ''I could use my blockchain-based self-sovereign ID to [allow] one group to use it and not another. Or I could sell it over here and give it away over there.''</p><p>  The token architecture would give a blockchain-based identity standard an additional edge over closed standards like Facebook's. As many critics have observed, ordinary users on social-media platforms create almost all the content without compensation, while the companies capture all the economic value from that content through advertising sales. A token-based social network would at least give early adopters a piece of the action, rewarding them for their labors in making the new platform appealing. ''If someone can really figure out a version of Facebook that lets users own a piece of the network and get paid,'' Dixon says, ''that could be pretty compelling.''</p><p>  Would that information be more secure in a distributed blockchain than behind the elaborate firewalls of giant corporations like Google or Facebook? In this one respect, the Bitcoin story is actually instructive: It may never be stable enough to function as a currency, but it does offer convincing proof of just how secure a distributed ledger can be. ''Look at the market cap of Bitcoin or Ethereum: $80 billion, $25 billion, whatever,'' Dixon says. ''That means if you successfully attack that system, you could walk away with more than a billion dollars. You know what a 'bug bounty' is? Someone says, 'If you hack my system, I'll give you a million dollars.' So Bitcoin is now a nine-year-old multibillion-dollar bug bounty, and no one's hacked it. It feels like pretty good proof.''</p><p>  Additional security would come from the decentralized nature of these new identity protocols. In the identity system proposed by Blockstack, the actual information about your identity -- your social connections, your purchasing history -- could be stored anywhere online. The blockchain would simply provide cryptographically secure keys to unlock that information and share it with other trusted providers. A system with a centralized repository with data for hundreds of millions of users -- what security experts call ''honey pots'' -- is far more appealing to hackers. Which would you rather do: steal a hundred million credit histories by hacking into a hundred million separate personal computers and sni\u00ef\u00ac\u0192ng around until you found the right data on each machine? Or just hack into one honey pot at Equifax and walk away with the same amount of data in a matter of hours? As Gutterman puts it, ''It's the difference between robbing a house versus robbing the entire village.''</p><p>  So much of the blockchain's architecture is shaped by predictions about how that architecture might be abused once it finds a wider audience. That is part of its charm and its power. The blockchain channels the energy of speculative bubbles by allowing tokens to be shared widely among true supporters of the platform. It safeguards against any individual or small group gaining control of the entire database. Its cryptography is designed to protect against surveillance states or identity thieves. In this, the blockchain displays a familial resemblance to political constitutions: Its rules are designed with one eye on how those rules might be exploited down the line.</p><p>  Much has been made of the anarcho-libertarian streak in Bitcoin and other nonfiat currencies; the community is rife with words and phrases (''self-sovereign'') that sound as if they could be slogans for some militia compound in Montana. And yet in its potential to break up large concentrations of power and explore less-proprietary models of ownership, the blockchain idea offers a tantalizing possibility for those who would like to distribute wealth more equitably and break up the cartels of the digital age.</p><p>  The blockchain worldview can also sound libertarian in the sense that it proposes nonstate solutions to capitalist excesses like information monopolies. But to believe in the blockchain is not necessarily to oppose regulation, if that regulation is designed with complementary aims. Brad Burnham, for instance, suggests that regulators should insist that everyone have ''a right to a private data store,'' where all the various facets of their online identity would be maintained. But governments wouldn't be required to design those identity protocols. They would be developed on the blockchain, open source. Ideologically speaking, that private data store would be a true team effort: built as an intellectual commons, funded by token speculators, supported by the regulatory state.</p><p>  Like the original internet itself, the blockchain is an idea with radical -- almost communitarian -- possibilities that at the same time has attracted some of the most frivolous and regressive appetites of capitalism. We spent our first years online in a world defined by open protocols and intellectual commons; we spent the second phase in a world increasingly dominated by closed architectures and proprietary databases. We have learned enough from this history to support the hypothesis that open works better than closed, at least where base-layer issues are concerned. But we don't have an easy route back to the open-protocol era. Some messianic next-generation internet protocol is not likely to emerge out of Department of Defense research, the way the first-generation internet did nearly 50 years ago.</p><p>  Yes, the blockchain may seem like the very worst of speculative capitalism right now, and yes, it is demonically challenging to understand. But the beautiful thing about open protocols is that they can be steered in surprising new directions by the people who discover and champion them in their infancy. Right now, the only real hope for a revival of the open-protocol ethos lies in the blockchain. Whether it eventually lives up to its egalitarian promise will in large part depend on the people who embrace the platform, who take up the baton, as Juan Benet puts it, from those early online pioneers. If you think the internet is not working in its current incarnation, you can't change the system through think-pieces and F.C.C. regulations alone. You need new code.</p><p>  Sign up for our newsletter to get the best of The New York Times Magazine delivered to your inbox every week.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTOS: PHOTO (PHOTOGRAPH BY JENUE &amp;

What makes them valuable is that they've been generated exclusively for me, by a software tool called MetaMask. In the lingo of cryptography, they're known as my seed phrase. They might read like an incoherent stream of consciousness, but these words can be transformed into a key that unlocks a digital bank account, or even an online identity. It just takes a few more steps.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the screen, I'm instructed to keep my seed phrase secure: Write it down, or keep it in a secure place on your computer. I scribble the 12 words onto a notepad, click a button and my seed phrase is transformed into a string of 64 seemingly patternless characters:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1b0be2162cedb2744d016943bb14e71de6af95a63af3790d6b41b1e719dc5c66</p><p>This is what's called a \"private key\" in the world of cryptography: a way of proving identity, in the same, limited way that real-world keys attest to your identity when you unlock your front door. My seed phrase will generate that exact sequence of characters every time, but there's no known way to reverse-engineer the original phrase from the key, which is why it is so important to keep the seed phrase in a safe location.</p><p>That private key number is then run through two additional transformations, creating a new string:</p><p>0x6c2ecd6388c550e8d99ada34a1cd55bedd052ad9</p><p>That string is my address on the Ethereum blockchain.</p><p>Ethereum belongs to the same family as the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, whose value has increased more than 1,000 percent in just the past year. Ethereum has its own currencies, most notably Ether, but the platform has a wider scope than just money. You can think of my Ethereum address as having elements of a bank account, an email address and a Social Security number. For now, it exists only on my computer as an inert string of nonsense, but the second I try to perform any kind of transaction \u2014 say, contributing to a crowdfunding campaign or voting in an online referendum \u2014 that address is broadcast out to an improvised worldwide network of computers that tries to verify the transaction. The results of that verification are then broadcast to the wider network again, where more machines enter into a kind of competition to perform complex mathematical calculations, the winner of which gets to record that transaction in the single, canonical record of every transaction ever made in the history of Ethereum. Because those transactions are registered in a sequence of \"blocks\" of data, that record is called the blockchain.</p><p>The whole exchange takes no more than a few minutes to complete. From my perspective, the experience barely differs from the usual routines of online life. But on a technical level, something miraculous is happening \u2014 something that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. I've managed to complete a secure transaction without any of the traditional institutions that we rely on to establish trust. No intermediary brokered the deal; no social-media network captured the data from my transaction to better target its advertising; no credit bureau tracked the activity to build a portrait of my financial trustworthiness.</p><p>And the platform that makes all this possible? No one owns it. There are no venture investors backing Ethereum Inc., because there is no Ethereum Inc. As an organizational form, Ethereum is far closer to a democracy than a private corporation. No imperial chief executive calls the shots. You earn the privilege of helping to steer Ethereum's ship of state by joining the community and doing the work. Like Bitcoin and most other blockchain platforms, Ethereum is more a swarm than a formal entity. Its borders are porous; its hierarchy is deliberately flattened.</p><p>Oh, one other thing: Some members of that swarm have already accumulated a paper net worth in the billions from their labors, as the value of one \"coin\" of Ether rose from $8 on Jan. 1, 2017, to $843 exactly one year later.</p><p>You may be inclined to dismiss these transformations. After all, Bitcoin and Ether's runaway valuation looks like a case study in irrational exuberance. And why should you care about an arcane technical breakthrough that right now doesn't feel all that different from signing in to a website to make a credit card payment?</p><p>But that dismissal would be shortsighted. If there's one thing we've learned from the recent history of the internet, it's that seemingly esoteric decisions about software architecture can unleash profound global forces once the technology moves into wider circulation. If the email standards adopted in the 1970s had included public-private key cryptography as a default setting, we might have avoided the cataclysmic email hacks that have afflicted everyone from Sony to John Podesta, and millions of ordinary consumers might be spared routinized identity theft. If Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, had included a protocol for mapping our social identity in his original specs, we might not have Facebook.</p><p>The true believers behind blockchain platforms like Ethereum argue that a network of distributed trust is one of those advances in software architecture that will prove, in the long run, to have historic significance. That promise has helped fuel the huge jump in cryptocurrency valuations. But in a way, the Bitcoin bubble may ultimately turn out to be a distraction from the true significance of the blockchain. The real promise of these new technologies, many of their evangelists believe, lies not in displacing our currencies but in replacing much of what we now think of as the internet, while at the same time returning the online world to a more decentralized and egalitarian system. If you believe the evangelists, the blockchain is the future. But it is also a way of getting back to the internet's roots.</p><p>Once the inspiration\u00a0for utopian dreams of infinite libraries and global connectivity, the internet has seemingly become, over the past year, a universal scapegoat: the cause of almost every social ill that confronts us. Russian trolls destroy the democratic system with fake news on Facebook; hate speech flourishes on Twitter and Reddit; the vast fortunes of the geek elite worsen income equality. For many of us who participated in the early days of the web, the last few years have felt almost postlapsarian. The web had promised a new kind of egalitarian media, populated by small magazines, bloggers and self-organizing encyclopedias; the information titans that dominated mass culture in the 20th century would give way to a more decentralized system, defined by collaborative networks, not hierarchies and broadcast channels. The wider culture would come to mirror the peer-to-peer architecture of the internet itself. The web in those days was hardly a utopia \u2014 there were financial bubbles and spammers and a thousand other problems \u2014 but beneath those flaws, we assumed, there was an underlying story of progress.</p><p>Last year marked the point at which that narrative finally collapsed. The existence of internet skeptics is nothing new, of course; the difference now is that the critical voices increasingly belong to former enthusiasts. \"We have to fix the internet,\" Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs's biographer, wrote in an essay published a few weeks after Donald Trump was elected president. \"After 40 years, it has begun to corrode, both itself and us.\" The former Google strategist James Williams told The Guardian: \"The dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will.\" In a blog post, Brad Burnham, a managing partner at Union Square Ventures, a top New York venture-capital firm, bemoaned the collateral damage from the quasi monopolies of the digital age: \"Publishers find themselves becoming commodity content suppliers in a sea of undifferentiated content in the Facebook news feed. Websites see their fortunes upended by small changes in Google's search algorithms. And manufacturers watch helplessly as sales dwindle when Amazon decides to source products directly in China and redirect demand to their own products.\" (Full disclosure: Burnham's firm invested in a company I started in 2006; we have had no financial relationship since it sold in 2011.) Even Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web itself, wrote a blog post voicing his concerns that the advertising-based model of social media and search engines creates a climate where \"misinformation, or 'fake news,' which is surprising, shocking or designed to appeal to our biases, can spread like wildfire.</p><p>For most critics, the solution to these immense structural issues has been to propose either a new mindfulness about the dangers of these tools \u2014 turning off our smartphones, keeping kids off social media \u2014 or the strong arm of regulation and antitrust: making the tech giants subject to the same scrutiny as other industries that are vital to the public interest, like the railroads or telephone networks of an earlier age. Both those ideas are commendable: We probably should develop a new set of habits governing how we interact with social media, and it seems entirely sensible that companies as powerful as Google and Facebook should face the same regulatory scrutiny as, say, television networks. But those interventions are unlikely to fix the core problems that the online world confronts. After all, it was not just the antitrust division of the Department of Justice that challenged Microsoft's monopoly power in the 1990s; it was also the emergence of new software and hardware \u2014 the web, open-source software and Apple products \u2014 that helped undermine Microsoft's dominant position.</p><p>The blockchain evangelists behind platforms like Ethereum believe that a comparable array of advances in software, cryptography and distributed systems has the ability to tackle today's digital problems: the corrosive incentives of online advertising; the quasi monopolies of Facebook, Google and Amazon; Russian misinformation campaigns. If they succeed, their creations may challenge the hegemony of the tech giants far more effectively than any antitrust regulation. They even claim to offer an alternative to the winner-take-all model of capitalism than has driven wealth inequality to heights not seen since the age of the robber barons.</p><p>That remedy is not yet visible in any product that would be intelligible to an ordinary tech consumer. The only blockchain project that has crossed over into mainstream recognition so far is Bitcoin, which is in the middle of a speculative bubble that makes the 1990s internet I.P.O. frenzy look like a neighborhood garage sale. And herein lies the cognitive dissonance that confronts anyone trying to make sense of the blockchain: the potential power of this would-be revolution is being actively undercut by the crowd it is attracting, a veritable goon squad of charlatans, false prophets and mercenaries. Not for the first time, technologists pursuing a vision of an open and decentralized network have found themselves surrounded by a wave of opportunists looking to make an overnight fortune. The question is whether, after the bubble has burst, the very real promise of the blockchain can endure.</p><p>To some students\u00a0of modern technological history, the internet's fall from grace follows an inevitable historical script. As Tim Wu argued in his 2010 book, \"The Master Switch,\" all the major information technologies of the 20th century adhered to a similar developmental pattern, starting out as the playthings of hobbyists and researchers motivated by curiosity and community, and ending up in the hands of multinational corporations fixated on maximizing shareholder value. Wu calls this pattern the Cycle, and on the surface at least, the internet has followed the Cycle with convincing fidelity. The internet began as a hodgepodge of government-funded academic research projects and side-hustle hobbies. But 20 years after the web first crested into the popular imagination, it has produced in Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 and indirectly, Apple \u2014 what may well be the most powerful and valuable corporations in the history of capitalism.</p><p>Blockchain advocates don't accept the inevitability of the Cycle. The roots of the internet were in fact more radically open and decentralized than previous information technologies, they argue, and had we managed to stay true to those roots, it could have remained that way. The online world would not be dominated by a handful of information-age titans; our news platforms would be less vulnerable to manipulation and fraud; identity theft would be far less common; advertising dollars would be distributed across a wider range of media properties.</p><p>To understand why, it helps to think of the internet as two fundamentally different kinds of systems stacked on top of each other, like layers in an archaeological dig. One layer is composed of the software protocols that were developed in the 1970s and 1980s and hit critical mass, at least in terms of audience, in the 1990s. (A protocol is the software version of a lingua franca, a way that multiple computers agree to communicate with one another. There are protocols that govern the flow of the internet's raw data, and protocols for sending email messages, and protocols that define the addresses of web pages.) And then above them, a second layer of web-based services \u2014 Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter \u2014 that largely came to power in the following decade.</p><p>The first layer \u2014 call it InternetOne \u2014 was founded on open protocols, which in turn were defined and maintained by academic researchers and international-standards bodies, owned by no one. In fact, that original openness continues to be all around us, in ways we probably don't appreciate enough. Email is still based on the open protocols POP, SMTP and IMAP; websites are still served up using the open protocol HTTP; bits are still circulated via the original open protocols of the internet, TCP/IP. You don't need to understand anything about how these software conventions work on a technical level to enjoy their benefits. The key characteristic they all share is that anyone can use them, free of charge. You don't need to pay a licensing fee to some corporation that owns HTTP if you want to put up a web page; you don't have to sell a part of your identity to advertisers if you want to send an email using SMTP. Along with Wikipedia, the open protocols of the internet constitute the most impressive example of commons-based production in human history.</p><p>CreditPhoto illustration by Delcan &amp; Company. Balloons by Jenue &amp; Laura Ortega.</p><p>To see how enormous but also invisible the benefits of such protocols have been, imagine that one of those key standards had not been developed: for instance, the open standard we use for defining our geographic location, GPS. Originally developed by the United States military, the Global Positioning System was first made available for civilian use during the Reagan administration. For about a decade, it was largely used by the aviation industry, until individual consumers began to use it in car navigation systems. And now we have smartphones that can pick up a signal from GPS satellites orbiting above us, and we use that extraordinary power to do everything from locating nearby restaurants to playing Pok\u00e9mon Go to coordinating disaster-relief efforts.</p><p>But what if the military had kept GPS out of the public domain? Presumably, sometime in the 1990s, a market signal would have gone out to the innovators of Silicon Valley and other tech hubs, suggesting that consumers were interested in establishing their exact geographic coordinates so that those locations could be projected onto digital maps. There would have been a few years of furious competition among rival companies, who would toss their own proprietary satellites into orbit and advance their own unique protocols, but eventually the market would have settled on one dominant model, given all the efficiencies that result from a single, common way of verifying location. Call that imaginary firm GeoBook. Initially, the embrace of GeoBook would have been a leap forward for consumers and other companies trying to build location awareness into their hardware and software. But slowly, a darker narrative would have emerged: a single private corporation, tracking the movements of billions of people around the planet, building an advertising behemoth based on our shifting locations. Any start-up trying to build a geo-aware application would have been vulnerable to the whims of mighty GeoBook. Appropriately angry polemics would have been written denouncing the public menace of this Big Brother in the sky.</p><p>But none of that happened, for a simple reason. Geolocation, like the location of web pages and email addresses and domain names, is a problem we solved with an open protocol. And because it's a problem we don't have, we rarely think about how beautifully GPS does work and how many different applications have been built on its foundation.</p><p>The open, decentralized web turns out to be alive and well on the InternetOne layer. But since we settled on the World Wide Web in the mid-'90s, we've adopted very few new open-standard protocols. The biggest problems that technologists tackled after 1995 \u2014 many of which revolved around identity, community and payment mechanisms \u2014 were left to the private sector to solve. This is what led, in the early 2000s, to a powerful new layer of internet services, which we might call InternetTwo.</p><p>For all their brilliance, the inventors of the open protocols that shaped the internet failed to include some key elements that would later prove critical to the future of online culture. Perhaps most important, they did not create a secure open standard that established human identity on the network. Units of information could be defined \u2014 pages, links, messages \u2014 but\u00a0people\u00a0did not have their own protocol: no way to define and share your real name, your location, your interests or (perhaps most crucial) your relationships to other people online.</p><p>This turns out to have been a major oversight, because identity is the sort of problem that benefits from one universally recognized solution. It's what Vitalik Buterin, a founder of Ethereum, describes as \"base-layer\" infrastructure: things like language, roads and postal services, platforms where commerce and competition are actually assisted by having an underlying layer in the public domain. Offline, we don't have an open market for physical passports or Social Security numbers; we have a few reputable authorities \u2014 most of them backed by the power of the state \u2014 that we use to confirm to others that we are who we say we are. But online, the private sector swooped in to fill that vacuum, and because identity had that characteristic of being a universal problem, the market was heavily incentivized to settle on one common standard for defining yourself and the people you know.</p><p>The self-reinforcing feedback loops that economists call \"increasing returns\" or \"network effects\" kicked in, and after a period of experimentation in which we dabbled in social-media start-ups like Myspace and Friendster, the market settled on what is essentially a proprietary standard for establishing who you are and whom you know. That standard is Facebook. With more than two billion users, Facebook is far larger than the entire internet at the peak of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. And that user growth has made it the world's sixth-most-valuable corporation, just 14 years after it was founded. Facebook is the ultimate embodiment of the chasm that divides InternetOne and InternetTwo economies. No private company owned the protocols that defined email or GPS or the open web. But one single corporation owns the data that define social identity for two billion people today \u2014 and one single person, Mark Zuckerberg, holds the majority of the voting power in that corporation.</p><p>If you see the rise of the centralized web as an inevitable turn of the Cycle, and the open-protocol idealism of the early web as a kind of adolescent false consciousness, then there's less reason to fret about all the ways we've abandoned the vision of InternetOne. Either we're living in a fallen state today and there's no way to get back to Eden, or Eden itself was a kind of fantasy that was always going to be corrupted by concentrated power. In either case, there's no point in trying to restore the architecture of InternetOne; our only hope is to use the power of the state to rein in these corporate giants, through regulation and antitrust action. It's a variation of the old Audre Lorde maxim: \"The master's tools will never dismantle the master's house.\" You can't fix the problems technology has created for us by throwing more technological solutions at it. You need forces outside the domain of software and servers to break up cartels with this much power.</p><p>But the thing about the master's house, in this analogy, is that it's a duplex. The upper floor has indeed been built with tools that cannot be used to dismantle it. But the open protocols beneath them still have the potential to build something better.</p><p>One of the most\u00a0persuasive advocates of an open-protocol revival is Juan Benet, a Mexican-born programmer now living on a suburban side street in Palo Alto, Calif., in a three-bedroom rental that he shares with his girlfriend and another programmer, plus a rotating cast of guests, some of whom belong to Benet's organization, Protocol Labs. On a warm day in September, Benet greeted me at his door wearing a black Protocol Labs hoodie. The interior of the space brought to mind the incubator/frat house of HBO's \"Silicon Valley,\" its living room commandeered by an array of black computer monitors. In the entrance hallway, the words \"Welcome to Rivendell\" were scrawled out on a whiteboard, a nod to the Elven city from \"Lord of the Rings.\" \"We call this house Rivendell,\" Benet said sheepishly. \"It's not a very good Rivendell. It doesn't have enough books, or waterfalls, or elves.\"</p><p>Benet, who is 29, considers himself a child of the first peer-to-peer revolution that briefly flourished in the late 1990s and early 2000s, driven in large part by networks like BitTorrent that distributed media files, often illegally. That initial flowering was in many ways a logical outgrowth of the internet's decentralized, open-protocol roots. The web had shown that you could publish documents reliably in a commons-based network. Services like BitTorrent or Skype took that logic to the next level, allowing ordinary users to add new functionality to the internet: creating a distributed library of (largely pirated) media, as with BitTorrent, or helping people make phone calls over the internet, as with Skype.</p><p>Sitting in the living room/office at Rivendell, Benet told me that he thinks of the early 2000s, with the ascent of Skype and BitTorrent, as \"the 'summer' of peer-to-peer\" \u2014 its salad days. \"But then peer-to-peer hit a wall, because people started to prefer centralized architectures,\" he said. \"And partly because the peer-to-peer business models were piracy-driven.\" A graduate of Stanford's computer-science program, Benet talks in a manner reminiscent of Elon Musk: As he speaks, his eyes dart across an empty space above your head, almost as though he's reading an invisible teleprompter to find the words. He is passionate about the technology Protocol Labs is developing, but also keen to put it in a wider context. For Benet, the shift from distributed systems to more centralized approaches set in motion changes that few could have predicted. \"The rules of the game, the rules that govern all of this technology, matter a lot,\" he said. \"The structure of what we build now will paint a very different picture of the way things will be five or 10 years in the future.\" He continued: \"It was clear to me then that peer-to-peer was this extraordinary thing. What was not clear to me then was how at risk it is. It was not clear to me that you had to take up the baton, that it's now your turn to protect it.\"</p><p>Protocol Labs is Benet's attempt to take up that baton, and its first project is a radical overhaul of the internet's file system, including the basic scheme we use to address the location of pages on the web. Benet calls his system IPFS, short for InterPlanetary File System. The current protocol \u2014 HTTP \u2014 pulls down web pages from a single location at a time and has no built-in mechanism for archiving the online pages. IPFS allows users to download a page simultaneously from multiple locations and includes what programmers call \"historic versioning,\" so that past iterations do not vanish from the historical record. To support the protocol, Benet is also creating a system called Filecoin that will allow users to effectively rent out unused hard-drive space. (Think of it as a sort of Airbnb for data.) \"Right now there are tons of hard drives around the planet that are doing nothing, or close to nothing, to the point where their owners are just losing money,\" Benet said. \"So you can bring online a massive amount of supply, which will bring down the costs of storage.\" But as its name suggests, Protocol Labs has an ambition that extends beyond these projects; Benet's larger mission is to support many new open-source protocols in the years to come.</p><p>Why did the internet follow the path from open to closed? One part of the explanation lies in sins of omission: By the time a new generation of coders began to tackle the problems that InternetOne left unsolved, there were near-limitless sources of capital to invest in those efforts, so long as the coders kept their systems closed. The secret to the success of the open protocols of InternetOne is that they were developed in an age when most people didn't care about online networks, so they were able to stealthily reach critical mass without having to contend with wealthy conglomerates and venture capitalists. By the mid-2000s, though, a promising new start-up like Facebook could attract millions of dollars in financing even before it became a household brand. And that private-sector money ensured that the company's key software would remain closed, in order to capture as much value as possible for shareholders.</p><p>And yet \u2014 as the venture capitalist Chris Dixon points out \u2014 there was another factor, too, one that was more technical than financial in nature. \"Let's say you're trying to build an open Twitter,\" Dixon explained while sitting in a conference room at the New York offices of Andreessen Horowitz, where he is a general partner. \"I'm @cdixon at Twitter. Where do you store that? You need a database.\" A closed architecture like Facebook's or Twitter's puts all the information about its users \u2014 their handles, their likes and photos, the map of connections they have to other individuals on the network \u2014 into a private database that is maintained by the company. Whenever you look at your Facebook newsfeed, you are granted access to some infinitesimally small section of that database, seeing only the information that is relevant to you.</p><p>Running Facebook's database is an unimaginably complex operation, relying on hundreds of thousands of servers scattered around the world, overseen by some of the most brilliant engineers on the planet. From Facebook's point of view, they're providing a valuable service to humanity: creating a common social graph for almost everyone on earth. The fact that they have to sell ads to pay the bills for that service \u2014 and the fact that the scale of their network gives them staggering power over the minds of two billion people around the world \u2014 is an unfortunate, but inevitable, price to pay for a shared social graph. And that trade-off did in fact make sense in the mid-2000s; creating a single database capable of tracking the interactions of hundreds of millions of people \u2014 much less two billion \u2014 was the kind of problem that could be tackled only by a single organization. But as Benet and his fellow blockchain evangelists are eager to prove, that might not be true anymore.</p><p>So how can you get meaningful adoption of base-layer protocols in an age when the big tech companies have already attracted billions of users and collectively sit on hundreds of billions of dollars in cash? If you happen to believe that the internet, in its current incarnation, is causing significant and growing harm to society, then this seemingly esoteric problem \u2014 the difficulty of getting people to adopt new open-source technology standards \u2014 turns out to have momentous consequences. If we can't figure out a way to introduce new, rival base-layer infrastructure, then we're stuck with the internet we have today. The best we can hope for is government interventions to scale back the power of Facebook or Google, or some kind of consumer revolt that encourages that marketplace to shift to less hegemonic online services, the digital equivalent of forswearing big agriculture for local farmers' markets. Neither approach would upend the underlying dynamics of InternetTwo.</p><p>The first hint\u00a0of a meaningful challenge to the closed-protocol era arrived in 2008, not long after Zuckerberg opened the first international headquarters for his growing company. A mysterious programmer (or group of programmers) going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto circulated a paper on a cryptography mailing list. The paper was called \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" and in it, Nakamoto outlined an ingenious system for a digital currency that did not require a centralized trusted authority to verify transactions. At the time, Facebook and Bitcoin seemed to belong to entirely different spheres \u2014 one was a booming venture-backed social-media start-up that let you share birthday greetings and connect with old friends, while the other was a byzantine scheme for cryptographic currency from an obscure email list. But 10 years later, the ideas that Nakamoto unleashed with that paper now pose the most significant challenge to the hegemony of InternetTwo giants like Facebook.</p><p>The paradox about Bitcoin is that it may well turn out to be a genuinely revolutionary breakthrough and at the same time a colossal failure as a currency. As I write, Bitcoin has increased in value by nearly 100,000 percent over the past five years, making a fortune for its early investors but also branding it as a spectacularly unstable payment mechanism. The process for creating new Bitcoins has also turned out to be a staggering energy drain.</p><p>History is replete with stories of new technologies whose initial applications end up having little to do with their eventual use. All the focus on Bitcoin as a payment system may similarly prove to be a distraction, a technological red herring. Nakamoto pitched Bitcoin as a \"peer-to-peer electronic-cash system\" in the initial manifesto, but at its heart, the innovation he (or she or they) was proposing had a more general structure, with two key features.</p><p>First, Bitcoin offered a kind of proof that you could create a secure database \u2014 the blockchain \u2014 scattered across hundreds or thousands of computers, with no single authority controlling and verifying the authenticity of the data.</p><p>Second, Nakamoto designed Bitcoin so that the work of maintaining that distributed ledger was itself rewarded with small, increasingly scarce Bitcoin payments. If you dedicated half your computer's processing cycles to helping the Bitcoin network get its math right \u2014 and thus fend off the hackers and scam artists \u2014 you received a small sliver of the currency. Nakamoto designed the system so that Bitcoins would grow increasingly difficult to earn over time, ensuring a certain amount of scarcity in the system. If you helped Bitcoin keep that database secure in the early days, you would earn more Bitcoin than later arrivals. This process has come to be called \"mining.\"</p><p>CreditPhoto illustration by Delcan &amp; Company. Source image: Koosen/Shutterstock.</p><p>For our purposes, forget everything else about the Bitcoin frenzy, and just keep these two things in mind: What Nakamoto ushered into the world was a way of agreeing on the contents of a database without anyone being \"in charge\" of the database, and a way of compensating people for helping make that database more valuable, without those people being on an official payroll or owning shares in a corporate entity. Together, those two ideas solved the distributed-database problem and the funding problem. Suddenly there was a way of supporting open protocols that wasn't available during the infancy of Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>These two features have now been replicated in dozens of new systems inspired by Bitcoin. One of those systems is Ethereum, proposed in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin when he was just 19. Ethereum does have its currencies, but at its heart Ethereum was designed less to facilitate electronic payments than to allow people to run applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain. There are currently hundreds of Ethereum apps in development, ranging from prediction markets to Facebook clones to crowdfunding services. Almost all of them are in pre-alpha stage, not ready for consumer adoption. Despite the embryonic state of the applications, the Ether currency has seen its own miniature version of the Bitcoin bubble, most likely making Buterin an immense fortune.</p><p>These currencies can be used in clever ways. Juan Benet 's Filecoin system will rely on Ethereum technology and reward users and developers who adopt its IPFS protocol or help maintain the shared database it requires. Protocol Labs is creating its own cryptocurrency, also called Filecoin, and has plans to sell some of those coins on the open market in the coming months. (In the summer of 2017, the company raised $135 million in the first 60 minutes of what Benet calls a \"presale\" of the tokens to accredited investors.) Many cryptocurrencies are first made available to the public through a process known as an initial coin offering, or I.C.O.</p><p>The I.C.O. abbreviation is a deliberate echo of the initial public offering that so defined the first internet bubble in the 1990s. But there is a crucial difference between the two. Speculators can buy in during an I.C.O., but they are not buying an ownership stake in a private company and its proprietary software, the way they might in a traditional I.P.O. Afterward, the coins will continue to be created in exchange for labor \u2014 in the case of Filecoin, by anyone who helps maintain the Filecoin network. Developers who help refine the software can earn the coins, as can ordinary users who lend out spare hard-drive space to expand the network's storage capacity. The Filecoin is a way of signaling that someone, somewhere, has added value to the network.</p><p>Advocates like Chris Dixon have started referring to the compensation side of the equation in terms of \"tokens,\" not coins, to emphasize that the technology here isn't necessarily aiming to disrupt existing currency systems. \"I like the metaphor of a token because it makes it very clear that it's like an arcade,\" he says. \"You go to the arcade, and in the arcade you can use these tokens. But we're not trying to replace the U.S. government. It's not meant to be a real currency; it's meant to be a pseudo-currency inside this world.\" Dan Finlay, a creator of MetaMask, echoes Dixon's argument. \"To me, what's interesting about this is that we get to program new value systems,\" he says. \"They don't have to resemble money.\"</p><p>Pseudo or not, the idea of an I.C.O. has already inspired a host of shady offerings, some of them endorsed by celebrities who would seem to be unlikely blockchain enthusiasts, like DJ Khaled, Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather. In a blog post published in October 2017, Fred Wilson, a founder of Union Square Ventures and an early advocate of the blockchain revolution, thundered against the spread of I.C.O.s. \"I hate it,\" Wilson wrote, adding that most I.C.O.s \"are scams. And the celebrities and others who promote them on their social-media channels in an effort to enrich themselves are behaving badly and possibly violating securities laws.\" Arguably the most striking thing about the surge of interest in I.C.O.s \u2014 and in existing currencies like Bitcoin or Ether \u2014 is how much financial speculation has already gravitated to platforms that have effectively zero adoption among ordinary consumers. At least during the internet bubble of late 1990s, ordinary people were buying books on Amazon or reading newspapers online; there was clear evidence that the web was going to become a mainstream platform. Today, the hype cycles are so accelerated that billions of dollars are chasing a technology that almost no one outside the cryptocommunity understands, much less uses.</p><p>Let's say,\u00a0for the sake of argument, that the hype is warranted, and blockchain platforms like Ethereum become a fundamental part of our digital infrastructure. How would a distributed ledger and a token economy somehow challenge one of the tech giants? One of Fred Wilson's partners at Union Square Ventures, Brad Burnham, suggests a scenario revolving around another tech giant that has run afoul of regulators and public opinion in the last year: Uber. \"Uber is basically just a coordination platform between drivers and passengers,\" Burnham says. \"Yes, it was really innovative, and there were a bunch of things in the beginning about reducing the anxiety of whether the driver was coming or not, and the map \u2014 and a whole bunch of things that you should give them a lot of credit for.\" But when a new service like Uber starts to take off, there's a strong incentive for the marketplace to consolidate around a single leader. The fact that more passengers are starting to use the Uber app attracts more drivers to the service, which in turn attracts more passengers. People have their credit cards stored with Uber; they have the app installed already; there are far more Uber drivers on the road. And so the switching costs of trying out some other rival service eventually become prohibitive, even if the chief executive seems to be a jerk or if consumers would, in the abstract, prefer a competitive marketplace with a dozen Ubers. \"At some point, the innovation around the coordination becomes less and less innovative,\" Burnham says.</p><p>The blockchain world proposes something different. Imagine some group like Protocol Labs decides there's a case to be made for adding another \"basic layer\" to the stack. Just as GPS gave us a way of discovering and sharing our location, this new protocol would define a simple request: I am here and would like to go there. A distributed ledger might record all its users' past trips, credit cards, favorite locations \u2014 all the metadata that services like Uber or Amazon use to encourage lock-in. Call it, for the sake of argument, the Transit protocol. The standards for sending a Transit request out onto the internet would be entirely open; anyone who wanted to build an app to respond to that request would be free to do so. Cities could build Transit apps that allowed taxi drivers to field requests. But so could bike-share collectives, or rickshaw drivers. Developers could create shared marketplace apps where all the potential vehicles using Transit could vie for your business. When you walked out on the sidewalk and tried to get a ride, you wouldn't have to place your allegiance with a single provider before hailing. You would simply announce that you were standing at 67th and Madison and needed to get to Union Square. And then you'd get a flurry of competing offers. You could even theoretically get an offer from the M.T.A., which could build a service to remind Transit users that it might be much cheaper and faster just to jump on the 6 train.</p><p>How would Transit reach critical mass when Uber and Lyft already dominate the ride-sharing market? This is where the tokens come in. Early adopters of Transit would be rewarded with Transit tokens, which could themselves be used to purchase Transit services or be traded on exchanges for traditional currency. As in the Bitcoin model, tokens would be doled out less generously as Transit grew more popular. In the early days, a developer who built an iPhone app that uses Transit might see a windfall of tokens; Uber drivers who started using Transit as a second option for finding passengers could collect tokens as a reward for embracing the system; adventurous consumers would be rewarded with tokens for using Transit in its early days, when there are fewer drivers available compared with the existing proprietary networks like Uber or Lyft.</p><p>As Transit began to take off, it would attract speculators, who would put a monetary price on the token and drive even more interest in the protocol by inflating its value, which in turn would attract more developers, drivers and customers. If the whole system ends up working as its advocates believe, the result is a more competitive but at the same time more equitable marketplace. Instead of all the economic value being captured by the shareholders of one or two large corporations that dominate the market, the economic value is distributed across a much wider group: the early developers of Transit, the app creators who make the protocol work in a consumer-friendly form, the early-adopter drivers and passengers, the first wave of speculators. Token economies introduce a strange new set of elements that do not fit the traditional models: instead of creating value by owning something, as in the shareholder equity model, people create value by improving the underlying protocol, either by helping to maintain the ledger (as in Bitcoin mining), or by writing apps atop it, or simply by using the service. The lines between founders, investors and customers are far blurrier than in traditional corporate models; all the incentives are explicitly designed to steer away from winner-take-all outcomes. And yet at the same time, the whole system depends on an initial speculative phase in which outsiders are betting on the token to rise in value.</p><p>\"You think about the '90s internet bubble and all the great infrastructure we got out of that,\" Dixon says. \"You're basically taking that effect and shrinking it down to the size of an application.\"</p><p>Even decentralized cryptomovements\u00a0have their key nodes. For Ethereum, one of those nodes is the Brooklyn headquarters of an organization called ConsenSys, founded by Joseph Lubin, an early Ethereum pioneer. In November, Amanda Gutterman, the 26-year-old chief marketing officer for ConsenSys, gave me a tour of the space. In our first few minutes together, she offered the obligatory cup of coffee, only to discover that the drip-coffee machine in the kitchen was bone dry. \"How can we fix the internet if we can't even make coffee?\" she said with a laugh.</p><p>Planted in industrial Bushwick, a stone's throw from the pizza mecca Roberta's, \"headquarters\" seemed an unlikely word. The front door was festooned with graffiti and stickers; inside, the stairwells of the space appeared to have been last renovated during the Coolidge administration. Just about three years old, the ConsenSys network now includes more than 550 employees in 28 countries, and the operation has never raised a dime of venture capital. As an organization, ConsenSys does not quite fit any of the usual categories: It is technically a corporation, but it has elements that also resemble nonprofits and workers' collectives. The shared goal of ConsenSys members is strengthening and expanding the Ethereum blockchain. They support developers creating new apps and tools for the platform, one of which is MetaMask, the software that generated my Ethereum address. But they also offer consulting-style services for companies, nonprofits or governments looking for ways to integrate Ethereum's smart contracts into their own systems.</p><p>The true test of the blockchain will revolve \u2014 like so many of the online crises of the past few years \u2014 around the problem of identity. Today your digital identity is scattered across dozens, or even hundreds, of different sites: Amazon has your credit-card information and your purchase history; Facebook knows your friends and family; Equifax maintains your credit history. When you use any of those services, you are effectively asking for permission to borrow some of that information about yourself in order perform a task: ordering a Christmas present for your uncle, checking Instagram to see pictures from the office party last night. But all these different fragments of your identity don't belong to you; they belong to Facebook and Amazon and Google, who are free to sell bits of that information about you to advertisers without consulting you. You, of course, are free to delete those accounts if you choose, and if you stop checking Facebook, Zuckerberg and the Facebook shareholders will stop making money by renting out your attention to their true customers. But your Facebook or Google identity isn't portable. If you want to join another promising social network that is maybe a little less infected with Russian bots, you can't extract your social network from Twitter and deposit it in the new service. You have to build the network again from scratch (and persuade all your friends to do the same).</p><p>The blockchain evangelists think this entire approach is backward. You should own your digital identity \u2014 which could include everything from your date of birth to your friend networks to your purchasing history \u2014 and you should be free to lend parts of that identity out to services as you see fit. Given that identity was not baked into the original internet protocols, and given the difficulty of managing a distributed database in the days before Bitcoin, this form of \"self-sovereign\" identity \u2014 as the parlance has it \u2014 was a practical impossibility. Now it is an attainable goal. A number of blockchain-based services are trying to tackle this problem, including a new identity system called uPort that has been spun out of ConsenSys and another one called Blockstack that is currently based on the Bitcoin platform. (Tim Berners-Lee is leading the development of a comparable system, called Solid, that would also give users control over their own data.) These rival protocols all have slightly different frameworks, but they all share a general vision of how identity should work on a truly decentralized internet.</p><p>What would prevent a new blockchain-based identity standard from following Tim Wu's Cycle, the same one that brought Facebook to such a dominant position? Perhaps nothing. But imagine how that sequence would play out in practice. Someone creates a new protocol to define your social network via Ethereum. It might be as simple as a list of other Ethereum addresses; in other words,\u00a0Here are the public addresses of people I like and trust.\u00a0That way of defining your social network might well take off and ultimately supplant the closed systems that define your network on Facebook. Perhaps someday, every single person on the planet might use that standard to map their social connections, just as every single person on the internet uses TCP/IP to share data. But even if this new form of identity became ubiquitous, it wouldn't present the same opportunities for abuse and manipulation that you find in the closed systems that have become de facto standards. I might allow a Facebook-style service to use my social map to filter news or gossip or music for me, based on the activity of my friends, but if that service annoyed me, I'd be free to sample other alternatives without the switching costs. An open identity standard would give ordinary people the opportunity to sell their attention to the highest bidder, or choose to keep it out of the marketplace altogether.</p><p>Gutterman suggests that the same kind of system could be applied to even more critical forms of identity, like health care data. Instead of storing, say, your genome on servers belonging to a private corporation, the information would instead be stored inside a personal data archive. \"There may be many corporate entities that I don't want seeing that data, but maybe I'd like to donate that data to a medical study,\" she says. \"I could use my blockchain-based self-sovereign ID to [allow] one group to use it and not another. Or I could sell it over here and give it away over there.\"</p><p>The token architecture would give a blockchain-based identity standard an additional edge over closed standards like Facebook's. As many critics have observed, ordinary users on social-media platforms create almost all the content without compensation, while the companies capture all the economic value from that content through advertising sales. A token-based social network would at least give early adopters a piece of the action, rewarding them for their labors in making the new platform appealing. \"If someone can really figure out a version of Facebook that lets users own a piece of the network and get paid,\" Dixon says, \"that could be pretty compelling.\"</p><p>Would that information be more secure in a distributed blockchain than behind the elaborate firewalls of giant corporations like Google or Facebook? In this one respect, the Bitcoin story is actually instructive: It may never be stable enough to function as a currency, but it does offer convincing proof of just how secure a distributed ledger can be. \"Look at the market cap of Bitcoin or Ethereum: $80 billion, $25 billion, whatever,\" Dixon says. \"That means if you successfully attack that system, you could walk away with more than a billion dollars. You know what a 'bug bounty' is? Someone says, 'If you hack my system, I'll give you a million dollars.' So Bitcoin is now a nine-year-old multibillion-dollar bug bounty, and no one's hacked it. It feels like pretty good proof.\"</p><p>Additional security would come from the decentralized nature of these new identity protocols. In the identity system proposed by Blockstack, the actual information about your identity \u2014 your social connections, your purchasing history \u2014 could be stored anywhere online. The blockchain would simply provide cryptographically secure keys to unlock that information and share it with other trusted providers. A system with a centralized repository with data for hundreds of millions of users \u2014 what security experts call \"honey pots\" \u2014 is far more appealing to hackers. Which would you rather do: steal a hundred million credit histories by hacking into a hundred million separate personal computers and sni\ufb03ng around until you found the right data on each machine? Or just hack into one honey pot at Equifax and walk away with the same amount of data in a matter of hours? As Gutterman puts it, \"It's the difference between robbing a house versus robbing the entire village.\"</p><p>So much of\u00a0the blockchain's architecture is shaped by predictions about how that architecture might be abused once it finds a wider audience. That is part of its charm and its power. The blockchain channels the energy of speculative bubbles by allowing tokens to be shared widely among true supporters of the platform. It safeguards against any individual or small group gaining control of the entire database. Its cryptography is designed to protect against surveillance states or identity thieves. In this, the blockchain displays a familial resemblance to political constitutions: Its rules are designed with one eye on how those rules might be exploited down the line.</p><p>Much has been made of the anarcho-libertarian streak in Bitcoin and other nonfiat currencies; the community is rife with words and phrases (\"self-sovereign\") that sound as if they could be slogans for some militia compound in Montana. And yet in its potential to break up large concentrations of power and explore less-proprietary models of ownership, the blockchain idea offers a tantalizing possibility for those who would like to distribute wealth more equitably and break up the cartels of the digital age.</p><p>The blockchain worldview can also sound libertarian in the sense that it proposes nonstate solutions to capitalist excesses like information monopolies. But to believe in the blockchain is not necessarily to oppose regulation, if that regulation is designed with complementary aims. Brad Burnham, for instance, suggests that regulators should insist that everyone have \"a right to a private data store,\" where all the various facets of their online identity would be maintained. But governments wouldn't be required to design those identity protocols. They would be developed on the blockchain, open source. Ideologically speaking, that private data store would be a true team effort: built as an intellectual commons, funded by token speculators, supported by the regulatory state.</p><p>Like the original internet itself, the blockchain is an idea with radical \u2014 almost communitarian \u2014 possibilities that at the same time has attracted some of the most frivolous and regressive appetites of capitalism. We spent our first years online in a world defined by open protocols and intellectual commons; we spent the second phase in a world increasingly dominated by closed architectures and proprietary databases. We have learned enough from this history to support the hypothesis that open works better than closed, at least where base-layer issues are concerned. But we don't have an easy route back to the open-protocol era. Some messianic next-generation internet protocol is not likely to emerge out of Department of Defense research, the way the first-generation internet did nearly 50 years ago.</p><p>Yes, the blockchain may seem like the very worst of speculative capitalism right now, and yes, it is demonically challenging to understand. But the beautiful thing about open protocols is that they can be steered in surprising new directions by the people who discover and champion them in their infancy. Right now, the only real hope for a revival of the open-protocol ethos lies in the blockchain. Whether it eventually lives up to its egalitarian promise will in large part depend on the people who embrace the platform, who take up the baton, as Juan Benet puts it, from those early online pioneers. If you think the internet is not working in its current incarnation, you can't change the system through think-pieces and F.C.C. regulations alone. You need new code.</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;The writer is the author of 10 books, most recently \"Wonderland.\" He last wrote for the magazine about\u00a0the science of communicating with extraterrestrials.</p><p>Credit: The New York Times Magazine</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSGHA-108968369</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSGHA2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RJG-CV31-JDJN-625V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">427903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9127\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Business and Financial Times.

What makes them valuable is that they\u2019ve been generated exclusively for me, by a software tool called MetaMask. In the lingo of cryptography, they\u2019re known as my seed phrase. They might read like an incoherent stream of consciousness, but these words can be transformed into a key that unlocks a digital bank account, or even an online identity. It just takes a few more steps.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the screen, I\u2019m instructed to keep my seed phrase secure: Write it down, or keep it in a secure place on your computer. I scribble the 12 words onto a notepad, click a button and my seed phrase is transformed into a string of 64 seemingly patternless characters:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is what\u2019s called a \u201cprivate key\u201d in the world of cryptography: a way of proving identity, in the same, limited way that real-world keys attest to your identity when you unlock your front door. My seed phrase will generate that exact sequence of characters every time, but there\u2019s no known way to reverse-engineer the original phrase from the key, which is why it is so important to keep the seed phrase in a safe location.</p><p>That private key number is then run through two additional transformations, creating a new string:</p><p>That string is my address on the Ethereum blockchain.</p><p>Ethereum belongs to the same family as the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, whose value has increased more than 1,000 percent in just the past year. Ethereum has its own currencies, most notably Ether, but the platform has a wider scope than just money. You can think of my Ethereum address as having elements of a bank account, an email address and a Social Security number. For now, it exists only on my computer as an inert string of nonsense, but the second I try to perform any kind of transaction \u2014 say, contributing to a crowdfunding campaign or voting in an online referendum \u2014 that address is broadcast out to an improvised worldwide network of computers that tries to verify the transaction. The results of that verification are then broadcast to the wider network again, where more machines enter into a kind of competition to perform complex mathematical calculations, the winner of which gets to record that transaction in the single, canonical record of every transaction ever made in the history of Ethereum. Because those transactions are registered in a sequence of \u201cblocks\u201d of data, that record is called the blockchain.</p><p>The whole exchange takes no more than a few minutes to complete. From my perspective, the experience barely differs from the usual routines of online life. But on a technical level, something miraculous is happening \u2014 something that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. I\u2019ve managed to complete a secure transaction without any of the traditional institutions that we rely on to establish trust. No intermediary brokered the deal; no social-media network captured the data from my transaction to better target its advertising; no credit bureau tracked the activity to build a portrait of my financial trustworthiness.</p><p>And the platform that makes all this possible? No one owns it. There are no venture investors backing Ethereum Inc., because there is no Ethereum Inc. As an organizational form, Ethereum is far closer to a democracy than a private corporation. No imperial chief executive calls the shots. You earn the privilege of helping to steer Ethereum\u2019s ship of state by joining the community and doing the work. Like Bitcoin and most other blockchain platforms, Ethereum is more a swarm than a formal entity. Its borders are porous; its hierarchy is deliberately flattened.</p><p>Oh, one other thing: Some members of that swarm have already accumulated a paper net worth in the billions from their labors, as the value of one \u201ccoin\u201d of Ether rose from $8 on Jan. 1, 2017, to $843 exactly one year later.</p><p>You may be inclined to dismiss these transformations. After all, Bitcoin and Ether\u2019s runaway valuation looks like a case study in irrational exuberance. And why should you care about an arcane technical breakthrough that right now doesn\u2019t feel all that different from signing in to a website to make a credit card payment?</p><p>But that dismissal would be shortsighted. If there\u2019s one thing we\u2019ve learned from the recent history of the internet, it\u2019s that seemingly esoteric decisions about software architecture can unleash profound global forces once the technology moves into wider circulation. If the email standards adopted in the 1970s had included public-private key cryptography as a default setting, we might have avoided the cataclysmic email hacks that have afflicted everyone from Sony to John Podesta, and millions of ordinary consumers might be spared routinized identity theft. If Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, had included a protocol for mapping our social identity in his original specs, we might not have Facebook.</p><p>The true believers behind blockchain platforms like Ethereum argue that a network of distributed trust is one of those advances in software architecture that will prove, in the long run, to have historic significance. That promise has helped fuel the huge jump in cryptocurrency valuations. But in a way, the Bitcoin bubble may ultimately turn out to be a distraction from the true significance of the blockchain. The real promise of these new technologies, many of their evangelists believe, lies not in displacing our currencies but in replacing much of what we now think of as the internet, while at the same time returning the online world to a more decentralized and egalitarian system. If you believe the evangelists, the blockchain is the future. But it is also a way of getting back to the internet\u2019s roots.</p><p>Once the inspiration for utopian dreams of infinite libraries and global connectivity, the internet has seemingly become, over the past year, a universal scapegoat: the cause of almost every social ill that confronts us. Russian trolls destroy the democratic system with fake news on Facebook; hate speech flourishes on Twitter and Reddit; the vast fortunes of the geek elite worsen income equality. For many of us who participated in the early days of the web, the last few years have felt almost postlapsarian. The web had promised a new kind of egalitarian media, populated by small magazines, bloggers and self-organizing encyclopedias; the information titans that dominated mass culture in the 20th century would give way to a more decentralized system, defined by collaborative networks, not hierarchies and broadcast channels. The wider culture would come to mirror the peer-to-peer architecture of the internet itself. The web in those days was hardly a utopia \u2014 there were financial bubbles and spammers and a thousand other problems \u2014 but beneath those flaws, we assumed, there was an underlying story of progress.</p><p>Last year marked the point at which that narrative finally collapsed. The existence of internet skeptics is nothing new, of course; the difference now is that the critical voices increasingly belong to former enthusiasts. \u201cWe have to fix the internet,\u201d Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs\u2019s biographer, wrote in an essay published a few weeks after Donald Trump was elected president. \u201cAfter 40 years, it has begun to corrode, both itself and us.\u201d The former Google strategist James Williams told The Guardian: \u201cThe dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will.\u201d In a blog post, Brad Burnham, a managing partner at Union Square Ventures, a top New York venture-capital firm, bemoaned the collateral damage from the quasi monopolies of the digital age: \u201cPublishers find themselves becoming commodity content suppliers in a sea of undifferentiated content in the Facebook news feed. Websites see their fortunes upended by small changes in Google\u2019s search algorithms. And manufacturers watch helplessly as sales dwindle when Amazon decides to source products directly in China and redirect demand to their own products.\u201d (Full disclosure: Burnham\u2019s firm invested in a company I started in 2006; we have had no financial relationship since it sold in 2011.) Even Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web itself, wrote a blog post voicing his concerns that the advertising-based model of social media and search engines creates a climate where \u201cmisinformation, or \u2018fake news,\u2019 which is surprising, shocking or designed to appeal to our biases, can spread like wildfire.\u201d</p><p>For most critics, the solution to these immense structural issues has been to propose either a new mindfulness about the dangers of these tools \u2014 turning off our smartphones, keeping kids off social media \u2014 or the strong arm of regulation and antitrust: making the tech giants subject to the same scrutiny as other industries that are vital to the public interest, like the railroads or telephone networks of an earlier age. Both those ideas are commendable: We probably should develop a new set of habits governing how we interact with social media, and it seems entirely sensible that companies as powerful as Google and Facebook should face the same regulatory scrutiny as, say, television networks. But those interventions are unlikely to fix the core problems that the online world confronts. After all, it was not just the antitrust division of the Department of Justice that challenged Microsoft\u2019s monopoly power in the 1990s; it was also the emergence of new software and hardware \u2014 the web, open-source software and Apple products \u2014 that helped undermine Microsoft\u2019s dominant position.</p><p>The blockchain evangelists behind platforms like Ethereum believe that a comparable array of advances in software, cryptography and distributed systems has the ability to tackle today\u2019s digital problems: the corrosive incentives of online advertising; the quasi monopolies of Facebook, Google and Amazon; Russian misinformation campaigns. If they succeed, their creations may challenge the hegemony of the tech giants far more effectively than any antitrust regulation. They even claim to offer an alternative to the winner-take-all model of capitalism than has driven wealth inequality to heights not seen since the age of the robber barons.</p><p>That remedy is not yet visible in any product that would be intelligible to an ordinary tech consumer. The only blockchain project that has crossed over into mainstream recognition so far is Bitcoin, which is in the middle of a speculative bubble that makes the 1990s internet I.P.O. frenzy look like a neighborhood garage sale. And herein lies the cognitive dissonance that confronts anyone trying to make sense of the blockchain: the potential power of this would-be revolution is being actively undercut by the crowd it is attracting, a veritable goon squad of charlatans, false prophets and mercenaries. Not for the first time, technologists pursuing a vision of an open and decentralized network have found themselves surrounded by a wave of opportunists looking to make an overnight fortune. The question is whether, after the bubble has burst, the very real promise of the blockchain can endure.</p><p>To some students of modern technological history, the internet\u2019s fall from grace follows an inevitable historical script. As Tim Wu argued in his 2010 book, \u201cThe Master Switch,\u201d all the major information technologies of the 20th century adhered to a similar developmental pattern, starting out as the playthings of hobbyists and researchers motivated by curiosity and community, and ending up in the hands of multinational corporations fixated on maximizing shareholder value. Wu calls this pattern the Cycle, and on the surface at least, the internet has followed the Cycle with convincing fidelity. The internet began as a hodgepodge of government-funded academic research projects and side-hustle hobbies. But 20 years after the web first crested into the popular imagination, it has produced in Google, Facebook and Amazon \u2014 and indirectly, Apple \u2014 what may well be the most powerful and valuable corporations in the history of capitalism.</p><p>Blockchain advocates don\u2019t accept the inevitability of the Cycle. The roots of the internet were in fact more radically open and decentralized than previous information technologies, they argue, and had we managed to stay true to those roots, it could have remained that way. The online world would not be dominated by a handful of information-age titans; our news platforms would be less vulnerable to manipulation and fraud; identity theft would be far less common; advertising dollars would be distributed across a wider range of media properties.</p><p>To understand why, it helps to think of the internet as two fundamentally different kinds of systems stacked on top of each other, like layers in an archaeological dig. One layer is composed of the software protocols that were developed in the 1970s and 1980s and hit critical mass, at least in terms of audience, in the 1990s. (A protocol is the software version of a lingua franca, a way that multiple computers agree to communicate with one another. There are protocols that govern the flow of the internet\u2019s raw data, and protocols for sending email messages, and protocols that define the addresses of web pages.) And then above them, a second layer of web-based services \u2014 Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter \u2014 that largely came to power in the following decade.</p><p>The first layer \u2014 call it InternetOne \u2014 was founded on open protocols, which in turn were defined and maintained by academic researchers and international-standards bodies, owned by no one. In fact, that original openness continues to be all around us, in ways we probably don\u2019t appreciate enough. Email is still based on the open protocols POP, SMTP and IMAP; websites are still served up using the open protocol HTTP; bits are still circulated via the original open protocols of the internet, TCP/IP. You don\u2019t need to understand anything about how these software conventions work on a technical level to enjoy their benefits. The key characteristic they all share is that anyone can use them, free of charge. You don\u2019t need to pay a licensing fee to some corporation that owns HTTP if you want to put up a web page; you don\u2019t have to sell a part of your identity to advertisers if you want to send an email using SMTP. Along with Wikipedia, the open protocols of the internet constitute the most impressive example of commons-based production in human history.</p><p>To see how enormous but also invisible the benefits of such protocols have been, imagine that one of those key standards had not been developed: for instance, the open standard we use for defining our geographic location, GPS. Originally developed by the United States military, the Global Positioning System was first made available for civilian use during the Reagan administration. For about a decade, it was largely used by the aviation industry, until individual consumers began to use it in car navigation systems. And now we have smartphones that can pick up a signal from GPS satellites orbiting above us, and we use that extraordinary power to do everything from locating nearby restaurants to playing Pok\u00e9mon Go to coordinating disaster-relief efforts.</p><p>But what if the military had kept GPS out of the public domain? Presumably, sometime in the 1990s, a market signal would have gone out to the innovators of Silicon Valley and other tech hubs, suggesting that consumers were interested in establishing their exact geographic coordinates so that those locations could be projected onto digital maps. There would have been a few years of furious competition among rival companies, who would toss their own proprietary satellites into orbit and advance their own unique protocols, but eventually the market would have settled on one dominant model, given all the efficiencies that result from a single, common way of verifying location. Call that imaginary firm GeoBook. Initially, the embrace of GeoBook would have been a leap forward for consumers and other companies trying to build location awareness into their hardware and software. But slowly, a darker narrative would have emerged: a single private corporation, tracking the movements of billions of people around the planet, building an advertising behemoth based on our shifting locations. Any start-up trying to build a geo-aware application would have been vulnerable to the whims of mighty GeoBook. Appropriately angry polemics would have been written denouncing the public menace of this Big Brother in the sky.</p><p>But none of that happened, for a simple reason. Geolocation, like the location of web pages and email addresses and domain names, is a problem we solved with an open protocol. And because it\u2019s a problem we don\u2019t have, we rarely think about how beautifully GPS does work and how many different applications have been built on its foundation.</p><p>The open, decentralized web turns out to be alive and well on the InternetOne layer. But since we settled on the World Wide Web in the mid-\u201990s, we\u2019ve adopted very few new open-standard protocols. The biggest problems that technologists tackled after 1995 \u2014 many of which revolved around identity, community and payment mechanisms \u2014 were left to the private sector to solve. This is what led, in the early 2000s, to a powerful new layer of internet services, which we might call InternetTwo.</p><p>For all their brilliance, the inventors of the open protocols that shaped the internet failed to include some key elements that would later prove critical to the future of online culture. Perhaps most important, they did not create a secure open standard that established human identity on the network. Units of information could be defined \u2014 pages, links, messages \u2014 but people did not have their own protocol: no way to define and share your real name, your location, your interests or (perhaps most crucial) your relationships to other people online.</p><p>This turns out to have been a major oversight, because identity is the sort of problem that benefits from one universally recognized solution. It\u2019s what Vitalik Buterin, a founder of Ethereum, describes as \u201cbase-layer\u201d infrastructure: things like language, roads and postal services, platforms where commerce and competition are actually assisted by having an underlying layer in the public domain. Offline, we don\u2019t have an open market for physical passports or Social Security numbers; we have a few reputable authorities \u2014 most of them backed by the power of the state \u2014 that we use to confirm to others that we are who we say we are. But online, the private sector swooped in to fill that vacuum, and because identity had that characteristic of being a universal problem, the market was heavily incentivized to settle on one common standard for defining yourself and the people you know.</p><p>The self-reinforcing feedback loops that economists call \u201cincreasing returns\u201d or \u201cnetwork effects\u201d kicked in, and after a period of experimentation in which we dabbled in social-media start-ups like Myspace and Friendster, the market settled on what is essentially a proprietary standard for establishing who you are and whom you know. That standard is Facebook. With more than two billion users, Facebook is far larger than the entire internet at the peak of the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. And that user growth has made it the world\u2019s sixth-most-valuable corporation, just 14 years after it was founded. Facebook is the ultimate embodiment of the chasm that divides InternetOne and InternetTwo economies. No private company owned the protocols that defined email or GPS or the open web. But one single corporation owns the data that define social identity for two billion people today \u2014 and one single person, Mark Zuckerberg, holds the majority of the voting power in that corporation.</p><p>If you see the rise of the centralized web as an inevitable turn of the Cycle, and the open-protocol idealism of the early web as a kind of adolescent false consciousness, then there\u2019s less reason to fret about all the ways we\u2019ve abandoned the vision of InternetOne. Either we\u2019re living in a fallen state today and there\u2019s no way to get back to Eden, or Eden itself was a kind of fantasy that was always going to be corrupted by concentrated power. In either case, there\u2019s no point in trying to restore the architecture of InternetOne; our only hope is to use the power of the state to rein in these corporate giants, through regulation and antitrust action. It\u2019s a variation of the old Audre Lorde maxim: \u201cThe master\u2019s tools will never dismantle the master\u2019s house.\u201d You can\u2019t fix the problems technology has created for us by throwing more technological solutions at it. You need forces outside the domain of software and servers to break up cartels with this much power.</p><p>But the thing about the master\u2019s house, in this analogy, is that it\u2019s a duplex. The upper floor has indeed been built with tools that cannot be used to dismantle it. But the open protocols beneath them still have the potential to build something better.</p><p>One of the most persuasive advocates of an open-protocol revival is Juan Benet, a Mexican-born programmer now living on a suburban side street in Palo Alto, Calif., in a three-bedroom rental that he shares with his girlfriend and another programmer, plus a rotating cast of guests, some of whom belong to Benet\u2019s organization, Protocol Labs. On a warm day in September, Benet greeted me at his door wearing a black Protocol Labs hoodie. The interior of the space brought to mind the incubator/frat house of HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley,\u201d its living room commandeered by an array of black computer monitors. In the entrance hallway, the words \u201cWelcome to Rivendell\u201d were scrawled out on a whiteboard, a nod to the Elven city from \u201cLord of the Rings.\u201d \u201cWe call this house Rivendell,\u201d Benet said sheepishly. \u201cIt\u2019s not a very good Rivendell. It doesn\u2019t have enough books, or waterfalls, or elves.\u201d</p><p>Benet, who is 29, considers himself a child of the first peer-to-peer revolution that briefly flourished in the late 1990s and early 2000s, driven in large part by networks like BitTorrent that distributed media files, often illegally. That initial flowering was in many ways a logical outgrowth of the internet\u2019s decentralized, open-protocol roots. The web had shown that you could publish documents reliably in a commons-based network. Services like BitTorrent or Skype took that logic to the next level, allowing ordinary users to add new functionality to the internet: creating a distributed library of (largely pirated) media, as with BitTorrent, or helping people make phone calls over the internet, as with Skype.</p><p>Sitting in the living room/office at Rivendell, Benet told me that he thinks of the early 2000s, with the ascent of Skype and BitTorrent, as \u201cthe \u2018summer\u2019 of peer-to-peer\u201d \u2014 its salad days. \u201cBut then peer-to-peer hit a wall, because people started to prefer centralized architectures,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd partly because the peer-to-peer business models were piracy-driven.\u201d A graduate of Stanford\u2019s computer-science program, Benet talks in a manner reminiscent of Elon Musk: As he speaks, his eyes dart across an empty space above your head, almost as though he\u2019s reading an invisible teleprompter to find the words. He is passionate about the technology Protocol Labs is developing, but also keen to put it in a wider context. For Benet, the shift from distributed systems to more centralized approaches set in motion changes that few could have predicted. \u201cThe rules of the game, the rules that govern all of this technology, matter a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cThe structure of what we build now will paint a very different picture of the way things will be five or 10 years in the future.\u201d He continued: \u201cIt was clear to me then that peer-to-peer was this extraordinary thing. What was not clear to me then was how at risk it is. It was not clear to me that you had to take up the baton, that it\u2019s now your turn to protect it.\u201d</p><p>Protocol Labs is Benet\u2019s attempt to take up that baton, and its first project is a radical overhaul of the internet\u2019s file system, including the basic scheme we use to address the location of pages on the web. Benet calls his system IPFS, short for InterPlanetary File System. The current protocol \u2014 HTTP \u2014 pulls down web pages from a single location at a time and has no built-in mechanism for archiving the online pages. IPFS allows users to download a page simultaneously from multiple locations and includes what programmers call \u201chistoric versioning,\u201d so that past iterations do not vanish from the historical record. To support the protocol, Benet is also creating a system called Filecoin that will allow users to effectively rent out unused hard-drive space. (Think of it as a sort of Airbnb for data.) \u201cRight now there are tons of hard drives around the planet that are doing nothing, or close to nothing, to the point where their owners are just losing money,\u201d Benet said. \u201cSo you can bring online a massive amount of supply, which will bring down the costs of storage.\u201d But as its name suggests, Protocol Labs has an ambition that extends beyond these projects; Benet\u2019s larger mission is to support many new open-source protocols in the years to come.</p><p>Why did the internet follow the path from open to closed? One part of the explanation lies in sins of omission: By the time a new generation of coders began to tackle the problems that InternetOne left unsolved, there were near-limitless sources of capital to invest in those efforts, so long as the coders kept their systems closed. The secret to the success of the open protocols of InternetOne is that they were developed in an age when most people didn\u2019t care about online networks, so they were able to stealthily reach critical mass without having to contend with wealthy conglomerates and venture capitalists. By the mid-2000s, though, a promising new start-up like Facebook could attract millions of dollars in financing even before it became a household brand. And that private-sector money ensured that the company\u2019s key software would remain closed, in order to capture as much value as possible for shareholders.</p><p>And yet \u2014 as the venture capitalist Chris Dixon points out \u2014 there was another factor, too, one that was more technical than financial in nature. \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019re trying to build an open Twitter,\u201d Dixon explained while sitting in a conference room at the New York offices of Andreessen Horowitz, where he is a general partner. \u201cI\u2019m @cdixon at Twitter. Where do you store that? You need a database.\u201d A closed architecture like Facebook\u2019s or Twitter\u2019s puts all the information about its users \u2014 their handles, their likes and photos, the map of connections they have to other individuals on the network \u2014 into a private database that is maintained by the company. Whenever you look at your Facebook newsfeed, you are granted access to some infinitesimally small section of that database, seeing only the information that is relevant to you.</p><p>Running Facebook\u2019s database is an unimaginably complex operation, relying on hundreds of thousands of servers scattered around the world, overseen by some of the most brilliant engineers on the planet. From Facebook\u2019s point of view, they\u2019re providing a valuable service to humanity: creating a common social graph for almost everyone on earth. The fact that they have to sell ads to pay the bills for that service \u2014 and the fact that the scale of their network gives them staggering power over the minds of two billion people around the world \u2014 is an unfortunate, but inevitable, price to pay for a shared social graph. And that trade-off did in fact make sense in the mid-2000s; creating a single database capable of tracking the interactions of hundreds of millions of people \u2014 much less two billion \u2014 was the kind of problem that could be tackled only by a single organization. But as Benet and his fellow blockchain evangelists are eager to prove, that might not be true anymore.</p><p>So how can you get meaningful adoption of base-layer protocols in an age when the big tech companies have already attracted billions of users and collectively sit on hundreds of billions of dollars in cash? If you happen to believe that the internet, in its current incarnation, is causing significant and growing harm to society, then this seemingly esoteric problem \u2014 the difficulty of getting people to adopt new open-source technology standards \u2014 turns out to have momentous consequences. If we can\u2019t figure out a way to introduce new, rival base-layer infrastructure, then we\u2019re stuck with the internet we have today. The best we can hope for is government interventions to scale back the power of Facebook or Google, or some kind of consumer revolt that encourages that marketplace to shift to less hegemonic online services, the digital equivalent of forswearing big agriculture for local farmers\u2019 markets. Neither approach would upend the underlying dynamics of InternetTwo.</p><p>The first hint of a meaningful challenge to the closed-protocol era arrived in 2008, not long after Zuckerberg opened the first international headquarters for his growing company. A mysterious programmer (or group of programmers) going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto circulated a paper on a cryptography mailing list. The paper was called \u201cBitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\u201d and in it, Nakamoto outlined an ingenious system for a digital currency that did not require a centralized trusted authority to verify transactions. At the time, Facebook and Bitcoin seemed to belong to entirely different spheres \u2014 one was a booming venture-backed social-media start-up that let you share birthday greetings and connect with old friends, while the other was a byzantine scheme for cryptographic currency from an obscure email list. But 10 years later, the ideas that Nakamoto unleashed with that paper now pose the most significant challenge to the hegemony of InternetTwo giants like Facebook.</p><p>The paradox about Bitcoin is that it may well turn out to be a genuinely revolutionary breakthrough and at the same time a colossal failure as a currency. As I write, Bitcoin has increased in value by nearly 100,000 percent over the past five years, making a fortune for its early investors but also branding it as a spectacularly unstable payment mechanism. The process for creating new Bitcoins has also turned out to be a staggering energy drain.</p><p>History is replete with stories of new technologies whose initial applications end up having little to do with their eventual use. All the focus on Bitcoin as a payment system may similarly prove to be a distraction, a technological red herring. Nakamoto pitched Bitcoin as a \u201cpeer-to-peer electronic-cash system\u201d in the initial manifesto, but at its heart, the innovation he (or she or they) was proposing had a more general structure, with two key features.</p><p>First, Bitcoin offered a kind of proof that you could create a secure database \u2014 the blockchain \u2014 scattered across hundreds or thousands of computers, with no single authority controlling and verifying the authenticity of the data.</p><p>Second, Nakamoto designed Bitcoin so that the work of maintaining that distributed ledger was itself rewarded with small, increasingly scarce Bitcoin payments. If you dedicated half your computer\u2019s processing cycles to helping the Bitcoin network get its math right \u2014 and thus fend off the hackers and scam artists \u2014 you received a small sliver of the currency. Nakamoto designed the system so that Bitcoins would grow increasingly difficult to earn over time, ensuring a certain amount of scarcity in the system. If you helped Bitcoin keep that database secure in the early days, you would earn more Bitcoin than later arrivals. This process has come to be called \u201cmining.\u201d</p><p>For our purposes, forget everything else about the Bitcoin frenzy, and just keep these two things in mind: What Nakamoto ushered into the world was a way of agreeing on the contents of a database without anyone being \u201cin charge\u201d of the database, and a way of compensating people for helping make that database more valuable, without those people being on an official payroll or owning shares in a corporate entity. Together, those two ideas solved the distributed-database problem and the funding problem. Suddenly there was a way of supporting open protocols that wasn\u2019t available during the infancy of Facebook and Twitter.</p><p>These two features have now been replicated in dozens of new systems inspired by Bitcoin. One of those systems is Ethereum, proposed in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin when he was just 19. Ethereum does have its currencies, but at its heart Ethereum was designed less to facilitate electronic payments than to allow people to run applications on top of the Ethereum blockchain. There are currently hundreds of Ethereum apps in development, ranging from prediction markets to Facebook clones to crowdfunding services. Almost all of them are in pre-alpha stage, not ready for consumer adoption. Despite the embryonic state of the applications, the Ether currency has seen its own miniature version of the Bitcoin bubble, most likely making Buterin an immense fortune.</p><p>These currencies can be used in clever ways. Juan Benet\u2019s Filecoin system will rely on Ethereum technology and reward users and developers who adopt its IPFS protocol or help maintain the shared database it requires. Protocol Labs is creating its own cryptocurrency, also called Filecoin, and has plans to sell some of those coins on the open market in the coming months. (In the summer of 2017, the company raised $135 million in the first 60 minutes of what Benet calls a \u201cpresale\u201d of the tokens to accredited investors.) Many cryptocurrencies are first made available to the public through a process known as an initial coin offering, or I.C.O.</p><p>The I.C.O. abbreviation is a deliberate echo of the initial public offering that so defined the first internet bubble in the 1990s. But there is a crucial difference between the two. Speculators can buy in during an I.C.O., but they are not buying an ownership stake in a private company and its proprietary software, the way they might in a traditional I.P.O. Afterward, the coins will continue to be created in exchange for labor \u2014 in the case of Filecoin, by anyone who helps maintain the Filecoin network. Developers who help refine the software can earn the coins, as can ordinary users who lend out spare hard-drive space to expand the network\u2019s storage capacity. The Filecoin is a way of signaling that someone, somewhere, has added value to the network.</p><p>Advocates like Chris Dixon have started referring to the compensation side of the equation in terms of \u201ctokens,\u201d not coins, to emphasize that the technology here isn\u2019t necessarily aiming to disrupt existing currency systems. \u201cI like the metaphor of a token because it makes it very clear that it\u2019s like an arcade,\u201d he says. \u201cYou go to the arcade, and in the arcade you can use these tokens. But we\u2019re not trying to replace the U.S. government. It\u2019s not meant to be a real currency; it\u2019s meant to be a pseudo-currency inside this world.\u201d Dan Finlay, a creator of MetaMask, echoes Dixon\u2019s argument. \u201cTo me, what\u2019s interesting about this is that we get to program new value systems,\u201d he says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to resemble money.\u201d</p><p>Pseudo or not, the idea of an I.C.O. has already inspired a host of shady offerings, some of them endorsed by celebrities who would seem to be unlikely blockchain enthusiasts, like DJ Khaled, Paris Hilton and Floyd Mayweather. In a blog post published in October 2017, Fred Wilson, a founder of Union Square Ventures and an early advocate of the blockchain revolution, thundered against the spread of I.C.O.s. \u201cI hate it,\u201d Wilson wrote, adding that most I.C.O.s \u201care scams. And the celebrities and others who promote them on their social-media channels in an effort to enrich themselves are behaving badly and possibly violating securities laws.\u201d Arguably the most striking thing about the surge of interest in I.C.O.s \u2014 and in existing currencies like Bitcoin or Ether \u2014 is how much financial speculation has already gravitated to platforms that have effectively zero adoption among ordinary consumers. At least during the internet bubble of late 1990s, ordinary people were buying books on Amazon or reading newspapers online; there was clear evidence that the web was going to become a mainstream platform. Today, the hype cycles are so accelerated that billions of dollars are chasing a technology that almost no one outside the cryptocommunity understands, much less uses.</p><p>Let\u2019s say, for the sake of argument, that the hype is warranted, and blockchain platforms like Ethereum become a fundamental part of our digital infrastructure. How would a distributed ledger and a token economy somehow challenge one of the tech giants? One of Fred Wilson\u2019s partners at Union Square Ventures, Brad Burnham, suggests a scenario revolving around another tech giant that has run afoul of regulators and public opinion in the last year: Uber. \u201cUber is basically just a coordination platform between drivers and passengers,\u201d Burnham says. \u201cYes, it was really innovative, and there were a bunch of things in the beginning about reducing the anxiety of whether the driver was coming or not, and the map \u2014 and a whole bunch of things that you should give them a lot of credit for.\u201d But when a new service like Uber starts to take off, there\u2019s a strong incentive for the marketplace to consolidate around a single leader. The fact that more passengers are starting to use the Uber app attracts more drivers to the service, which in turn attracts more passengers. People have their credit cards stored with Uber; they have the app installed already; there are far more Uber drivers on the road. And so the switching costs of trying out some other rival service eventually become prohibitive, even if the chief executive seems to be a jerk or if consumers would, in the abstract, prefer a competitive marketplace with a dozen Ubers. \u201cAt some point, the innovation around the coordination becomes less and less innovative,\u201d Burnham says.</p><p>The blockchain world proposes something different. Imagine some group like Protocol Labs decides there\u2019s a case to be made for adding another \u201cbasic layer\u201d to the stack. Just as GPS gave us a way of discovering and sharing our location, this new protocol would define a simple request: I am here and would like to go there. A distributed ledger might record all its users\u2019 past trips, credit cards, favorite locations \u2014 all the metadata that services like Uber or Amazon use to encourage lock-in. Call it, for the sake of argument, the Transit protocol. The standards for sending a Transit request out onto the internet would be entirely open; anyone who wanted to build an app to respond to that request would be free to do so. Cities could build Transit apps that allowed taxi drivers to field requests. But so could bike-share collectives, or rickshaw drivers. Developers could create shared marketplace apps where all the potential vehicles using Transit could vie for your business. When you walked out on the sidewalk and tried to get a ride, you wouldn\u2019t have to place your allegiance with a single provider before hailing. You would simply announce that you were standing at 67th and Madison and needed to get to Union Square. And then you\u2019d get a flurry of competing offers. You could even theoretically get an offer from the M.T.A., which could build a service to remind Transit users that it might be much cheaper and faster just to jump on the 6 train.</p><p>How would Transit reach critical mass when Uber and Lyft already dominate the ride-sharing market? This is where the tokens come in. Early adopters of Transit would be rewarded with Transit tokens, which could themselves be used to purchase Transit services or be traded on exchanges for traditional currency. As in the Bitcoin model, tokens would be doled out less generously as Transit grew more popular. In the early days, a developer who built an iPhone app that uses Transit might see a windfall of tokens; Uber drivers who started using Transit as a second option for finding passengers could collect tokens as a reward for embracing the system; adventurous consumers would be rewarded with tokens for using Transit in its early days, when there are fewer drivers available compared with the existing proprietary networks like Uber or Lyft.</p><p>As Transit began to take off, it would attract speculators, who would put a monetary price on the token and drive even more interest in the protocol by inflating its value, which in turn would attract more developers, drivers and customers. If the whole system ends up working as its advocates believe, the result is a more competitive but at the same time more equitable marketplace. Instead of all the economic value being captured by the shareholders of one or two large corporations that dominate the market, the economic value is distributed across a much wider group: the early developers of Transit, the app creators who make the protocol work in a consumer-friendly form, the early-adopter drivers and passengers, the first wave of speculators. Token economies introduce a strange new set of elements that do not fit the traditional models: instead of creating value by owning something, as in the shareholder equity model, people create value by improving the underlying protocol, either by helping to maintain the ledger (as in Bitcoin mining), or by writing apps atop it, or simply by using the service. The lines between founders, investors and customers are far blurrier than in traditional corporate models; all the incentives are explicitly designed to steer away from winner-take-all outcomes. And yet at the same time, the whole system depends on an initial speculative phase in which outsiders are betting on the token to rise in value.</p><p>\u201cYou think about the \u201990s internet bubble and all the great infrastructure we got out of that,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cYou\u2019re basically taking that effect and shrinking it down to the size of an application.\u201d</p><p>Even decentralized cryptomovements have their key nodes. For Ethereum, one of those nodes is the Brooklyn headquarters of an organization called ConsenSys, founded by Joseph Lubin, an early Ethereum pioneer. In November, Amanda Gutterman, the 26-year-old chief marketing officer for ConsenSys, gave me a tour of the space. In our first few minutes together, she offered the obligatory cup of coffee, only to discover that the drip-coffee machine in the kitchen was bone dry. \u201cHow can we fix the internet if we can\u2019t even make coffee?\u201d she said with a laugh.</p><p>Planted in industrial Bushwick, a stone\u2019s throw from the pizza mecca Roberta\u2019s, \u201cheadquarters\u201d seemed an unlikely word. The front door was festooned with graffiti and stickers; inside, the stairwells of the space appeared to have been last renovated during the Coolidge administration. Just about three years old, the ConsenSys network now includes more than 550 employees in 28 countries, and the operation has never raised a dime of venture capital. As an organization, ConsenSys does not quite fit any of the usual categories: It is technically a corporation, but it has elements that also resemble nonprofits and workers\u2019 collectives. The shared goal of ConsenSys members is strengthening and expanding the Ethereum blockchain. They support developers creating new apps and tools for the platform, one of which is MetaMask, the software that generated my Ethereum address. But they also offer consulting-style services for companies, nonprofits or governments looking for ways to integrate Ethereum\u2019s smart contracts into their own systems.</p><p>The true test of the blockchain will revolve \u2014 like so many of the online crises of the past few years \u2014 around the problem of identity. Today your digital identity is scattered across dozens, or even hundreds, of different sites: Amazon has your credit-card information and your purchase history; Facebook knows your friends and family; Equifax maintains your credit history. When you use any of those services, you are effectively asking for permission to borrow some of that information about yourself in order perform a task: ordering a Christmas present for your uncle, checking Instagram to see pictures from the office party last night. But all these different fragments of your identity don\u2019t belong to you; they belong to Facebook and Amazon and Google, who are free to sell bits of that information about you to advertisers without consulting you. You, of course, are free to delete those accounts if you choose, and if you stop checking Facebook, Zuckerberg and the Facebook shareholders will stop making money by renting out your attention to their true customers. But your Facebook or Google identity isn\u2019t portable. If you want to join another promising social network that is maybe a little less infected with Russian bots, you can\u2019t extract your social network from Twitter and deposit it in the new service. You have to build the network again from scratch (and persuade all your friends to do the same).</p><p>The blockchain evangelists think this entire approach is backward. You should own your digital identity \u2014 which could include everything from your date of birth to your friend networks to your purchasing history \u2014 and you should be free to lend parts of that identity out to services as you see fit. Given that identity was not baked into the original internet protocols, and given the difficulty of managing a distributed database in the days before Bitcoin, this form of \u201cself-sovereign\u201d identity \u2014 as the parlance has it \u2014 was a practical impossibility. Now it is an attainable goal. A number of blockchain-based services are trying to tackle this problem, including a new identity system called uPort that has been spun out of ConsenSys and another one called Blockstack that is currently based on the Bitcoin platform. (Tim Berners-Lee is leading the development of a comparable system, called Solid, that would also give users control over their own data.) These rival protocols all have slightly different frameworks, but they all share a general vision of how identity should work on a truly decentralized internet.</p><p>What would prevent a new blockchain-based identity standard from following Tim Wu\u2019s Cycle, the same one that brought Facebook to such a dominant position? Perhaps nothing. But imagine how that sequence would play out in practice. Someone creates a new protocol to define your social network via Ethereum. It might be as simple as a list of other Ethereum addresses; in other words, Here are the public addresses of people I like and trust. That way of defining your social network might well take off and ultimately supplant the closed systems that define your network on Facebook. Perhaps someday, every single person on the planet might use that standard to map their social connections, just as every single person on the internet uses TCP/IP to share data. But even if this new form of identity became ubiquitous, it wouldn\u2019t present the same opportunities for abuse and manipulation that you find in the closed systems that have become de facto standards. I might allow a Facebook-style service to use my social map to filter news or gossip or music for me, based on the activity of my friends, but if that service annoyed me, I\u2019d be free to sample other alternatives without the switching costs. An open identity standard would give ordinary people the opportunity to sell their attention to the highest bidder, or choose to keep it out of the marketplace altogether.</p><p>Gutterman suggests that the same kind of system could be applied to even more critical forms of identity, like health care data. Instead of storing, say, your genome on servers belonging to a private corporation, the information would instead be stored inside a personal data archive. \u201cThere may be many corporate entities that I don\u2019t want seeing that data, but maybe I\u2019d like to donate that data to a medical study,\u201d she says. \u201cI could use my blockchain-based self-sovereign ID to [allow] one group to use it and not another. Or I could sell it over here and give it away over there.\u201d</p><p>The token architecture would give a blockchain-based identity standard an additional edge over closed standards like Facebook\u2019s. As many critics have observed, ordinary users on social-media platforms create almost all the content without compensation, while the companies capture all the economic value from that content through advertising sales. A token-based social network would at least give early adopters a piece of the action, rewarding them for their labors in making the new platform appealing. \u201cIf someone can really figure out a version of Facebook that lets users own a piece of the network and get paid,\u201d Dixon says, \u201cthat could be pretty compelling.\u201d</p><p>Would that information be more secure in a distributed blockchain than behind the elaborate firewalls of giant corporations like Google or Facebook? In this one respect, the Bitcoin story is actually instructive: It may never be stable enough to function as a currency, but it does offer convincing proof of just how secure a distributed ledger can be. \u201cLook at the market cap of Bitcoin or Ethereum: $80 billion, $25 billion, whatever,\u201d Dixon says. \u201cThat means if you successfully attack that system, you could walk away with more than a billion dollars. You know what a \u2018bug bounty\u2019 is? Someone says, \u2018If you hack my system, I\u2019ll give you a million dollars.\u2019 So Bitcoin is now a nine-year-old multibillion-dollar bug bounty, and no one\u2019s hacked it. It feels like pretty good proof.\u201d</p><p>Additional security would come from the decentralized nature of these new identity protocols. In the identity system proposed by Blockstack, the actual information about your identity \u2014 your social connections, your purchasing history \u2014 could be stored anywhere online. The blockchain would simply provide cryptographically secure keys to unlock that information and share it with other trusted providers. A system with a centralized repository with data for hundreds of millions of users \u2014 what security experts call \u201choney pots\u201d \u2014 is far more appealing to hackers. Which would you rather do: steal a hundred million credit histories by hacking into a hundred million separate personal computers and sni\\xAC\\x83ng around until you found the right data on each machine? Or just hack into one honey pot at Equifax and walk away with the same amount of data in a matter of hours? As Gutterman puts it, \u201cIt\u2019s the difference between robbing a house versus robbing the entire village.\u201d</p><p>So much of the blockchain\u2019s architecture is shaped by predictions about how that architecture might be abused once it finds a wider audience. That is part of its charm and its power. The blockchain channels the energy of speculative bubbles by allowing tokens to be shared widely among true supporters of the platform. It safeguards against any individual or small group gaining control of the entire database. Its cryptography is designed to protect against surveillance states or identity thieves. In this, the blockchain displays a familial resemblance to political constitutions: Its rules are designed with one eye on how those rules might be exploited down the line.</p><p>Much has been made of the anarcho-libertarian streak in Bitcoin and other nonfiat currencies; the community is rife with words and phrases (\u201cself-sovereign\u201d) that sound as if they could be slogans for some militia compound in Montana. And yet in its potential to break up large concentrations of power and explore less-proprietary models of ownership, the blockchain idea offers a tantalizing possibility for those who would like to distribute wealth more equitably and break up the cartels of the digital age.</p><p>The blockchain worldview can also sound libertarian in the sense that it proposes nonstate solutions to capitalist excesses like information monopolies. But to believe in the blockchain is not necessarily to oppose regulation, if that regulation is designed with complementary aims. Brad Burnham, for instance, suggests that regulators should insist that everyone have \u201ca right to a private data store,\u201d where all the various facets of their online identity would be maintained. But governments wouldn\u2019t be required to design those identity protocols. They would be developed on the blockchain, open source. Ideologically speaking, that private data store would be a true team effort: built as an intellectual commons, funded by token speculators, supported by the regulatory state.</p><p>Like the original internet itself, the blockchain is an idea with radical \u2014 almost communitarian \u2014 possibilities that at the same time has attracted some of the most frivolous and regressive appetites of capitalism. We spent our first years online in a world defined by open protocols and intellectual commons; we spent the second phase in a world increasingly dominated by closed architectures and proprietary databases. We have learned enough from this history to support the hypothesis that open works better than closed, at least where base-layer issues are concerned. But we don\u2019t have an easy route back to the open-protocol era. Some messianic next-generation internet protocol is not likely to emerge out of Department of Defense research, the way the first-generation internet did nearly 50 years ago.</p><p>Yes, the blockchain may seem like the very worst of speculative capitalism right now, and yes, it is demonically challenging to understand. But the beautiful thing about open protocols is that they can be steered in surprising new directions by the people who discover and champion them in their infancy. Right now, the only real hope for a revival of the open-protocol ethos lies in the blockchain. Whether it eventually lives up to its egalitarian promise will in large part depend on the people who embrace the platform, who take up the baton, as Juan Benet puts it, from those early online pioneers. If you think the internet is not working in its current incarnation, you can\u2019t change the system through think-pieces and F.C.C. regulations alone. You need new code.</p><p>Steven Johnson is the author of 10 books, most recently \u201cWonderland.\u201d He last wrote for the magazine about the science of communicating with extraterrestrials. </p><p>PHOTO:  (PHOTOGRAPH BY Photo illustration by Delcan &amp;

It was about the urgent imperative of drawing up a cyber code of conduct for the world. Nadella said he was hopeful that a new set of rules involving the tech companies and governments could be negotiated in Geneva. He would like it modelled after the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 that protects civilians during wartime. Nadella wants a \"digital Geneva convention\" that will protect individual Internet users and civilian infrastructure from cyber attacks by nation states during peacetime.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nadella's pitch is part of a campaign launched by Microsoftsince the beginning of this year to convince governments to negotiate global rules of the road for the digital domain. Last week, Brad Smith, president and chief legal officer of Microsoft, made the case in much greater detail before the international community in Geneva.</p><p>Smith invoked the memory of Jean Henri Dunant, whose efforts led to the First Geneva Convention of 1864 that barred attacks on sick and wounded soldiers, along with medics and volunteers engaged in their evacuation. Dunant also founded the International Committee of the Red Cross that provides the neutral institutional framework for the implementation of the First Geneva Convention, and the three others that followed in the steady expansion of the international humanitarian law.</p><p>If Dunant was moved to address the problems created by new technologies for warfare in the mid-19th century, the Microsoftleadership is saying the world must now address the mounting challenges from the emerging digital warfare and the impending cyber arms race between the major powers.</p><p>As societies become increasingly dependent on the Internet, the costs of criminal activity and international rivalries could turn out to be crippling. Microsoftestimates that cyber hacking is likely to cost the global economy nearly $ 3 trillion by 2020. Even more worrying is the growing militarisation of the Internet that is leading to the development of capabilities to cripple the cyber infrastructure of adversaries. Governments across the world are also turning the cyber domain into a medium for espionage, theft of intellectual property, interventions in political processes, and provoking social unrest.</p><p>Microsoftproposes building upon emerging norms on cyber security - developed between the US and China as well as in multilateral forums - to draft a comprehensive digital Geneva Convention. The company points to its own investments in the development of technology to prevent cyber attacks, and similar efforts by other high tech majors like Facebook and Google. It has highlighted several principles that governments and tech companies must adopt to secure the cyber space (See box).</p><p>Diplomats, however, are doubtful if governments can be nudged into signing a Convention that limits their strategic options amidst the current tensions between the major powers, and their active development of offensive cyber capabilities. Meanwhile, growing cyber capacities for asymmetric warfare among states and non-state actors make it even harder to construct an international consensus.</p><p>Sceptics suggest that Microsoftmay be presenting its own interests and those of the big tech companies as universal interests. While no one doubts that the top tech companies will continue to have a big role in producing, managing and securing the cyber domain, many governments may not be ready to accept that large transnational tech companies must be treated as independent actors and put at the heart of the international regulation of digital space.</p><p>There is considerable variation in the views of the major powers on the nature of the cyber domain and the role of states in it. Russia and China, as well as many developing nations, have begun to put the state at the centre of managing the cyber space. Even in the developed capitalist states, the national security apparatus is unwilling to give up its freedom of action and defer to some of the private sector conditions, for example on avoiding backdoors to smartphones, and reporting system vulnerabilities to vendors like Microsoft.</p><p>More broadly, in Europe and North America, there is increasing distrust of the mega tech companies. On both the left and right, there is deep resentment against the extraordinary dominance of these corporations. Civil society activists agree that addressing the question of cyber attacks is very important, but insist that the tech companies can't be exempted from the principle of separating private profit and public good.</p><p>While critical questioning is in order, there is no denying that the world has addressed such questions in the past: for example, on the adoption of telecommunication technologies, the regulation of atomic energy, and the banning of chemical and biological weapons. The scientific community and industry have, indeed, contributed to the evolution of global norms on emerging technologies.</p><p>The issues raised by Microsoftdo deserve serious and critical attention in India. The outcomes from this debate could have a lasting impact on India's own digital future in both commercial and national security realms. The tech companies based in Bengaluru and the government in Delhi must join hands to shape the discourse on the digital Geneva Convention and secure India's national interests.</p><p>MICROSOFT'S SUGGESTIONS </p><p>GOVERNMENTS SHOULD:</p><p>AVOID targeting high-tech companies, the private sector or critical infrastructure</p><p>ASSIST private sector efforts to detect, contain, respond to and recover from cyber attacks</p><p>REFRAIN from stealing proprietary information from private companies and pass them on to their competitors</p><p>REPORT system vulnerabilities to private vendors and not stockpile, sell or exploit them for political or financial gain</p><p>NOT INSERT 'backdoors' in mass market commercial products</p><p>EXERCISE restraint in developing cyber weapons; any that are developed should be limited, precise in their targeting and not be reusable</p><p>LIMIT offensive operations to avoid mass and indiscriminate cyber attacks</p><p>ACTIVELY PREVENT proliferation of cyber weapons through the use of intelligence, law enforcement and sanctions</p><p>CREATE an independent organisation, consisting of technical experts from across the governments, the private sector, academia and civil society, that can investigate cyber attacks and publicly share evidence on who was responsible. It would be akin to the International Atomic Energy Agency that maintains the firewall between civilian and military uses of nuclear energy</p><p>HI-TECH COMPANIES SHOULD:</p><p>REINFORCE government efforts with an accord among themselves to become a \"neutral Digital Switzerland\" that will protect customers everywhere, and not aid cyber attacks on users anywhere.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDEXP-0034269654</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDEXP2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PY4-1VM1-JB5M-W4FP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">364854</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1137\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Indian Express, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Express</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 13, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Economic growth, scientific discovery and innovation are all at risk. Privacy-enhancing technologies could be the answer.</p><p>Over the past 30 years, society has become used to free services on the internet. Users fell in love with the accessibility and openness of the search engines, email and video-sharing sites; the deal felt like a bargain at a time when data was a new resource of unknown value. Users trusted companies to store their information and grew accustomed to convenient, seamless online experiences. They shared and connected with abandon.</p><p>In parallel with the progressing digitalization of almost every area of life, artificial intelligence (AI) and analytics capabilities grew tremendously, enabling companies to transform random data trails into meaningful insights that helped them greatly improve business processes. Targeted marketing, location-based searches and personalized promotions became the name of the game. This eventually led to the ability to combine data from various sources into large datasets, and to mine them for granular user profiles of unprecedented detail in order to establish correlations between disparate aspects of consumer behaviour, making individual health risks and electoral choices ever more predictable \u2013 for those who held the data.Have you read?</p><p>Why we need to talk about big data 3 reasons why data is not the new oil - and why this matters to India How privacy tech is redefining the data economy</p><p>As data became recognized as the \u2018new oil\u2019, driving growth and innovation, the public started to understand how this new resource had made them vulnerable. Election interference. Insecure data collection. Privacy infringement. Simple tasks such as registering at a hotel, booking a car rental or ordering takeaway today run the risk of exposing consumer data. Epitomized by the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the problem of data abuse is now rampant. It turns out that even the technology used to create a smart home further jeopardizes privacy.</p><p>Public opinion swung from enthusiasm for free digital services to disillusionment and aversion to Big Tech and their data-sharing practices. The term \u2018dataveillance\u2019 was coined, reflecting the public's increasing concern and the gap of mistrust that had opened between consumers, enterprises and public institutions. Today, trust in institutions is at an all-time low.</p><p>With no simple opt-out of digital life, the call for legislation intensified and seemed to be the right way to regain order.Could regulation restore trust?</p><p>European and American legislators took up this challenge. The problem with data privacy regulation, however, is that it mainly limits what organizations can do with data \u2014 which has the adverse effect of limiting collaboration in the various fields that would be hugely beneficial to human progress.</p><p>Data sharing and collaboration between multiple parties has led to tremendous breakthroughs in the past decade. Think of medical multi-party studies benefiting from large sets of pooled patient data; smarter urban transportation thanks to real-time location data; or financial fraud detection based on cross-bank data analysis.What is the World Economic Forum doing on cybersecurity</p><p>The World Economic Forum Platform for Shaping the Future of Cybersecurity and Digital Trust aims to spearhead global cooperation and collective responses to growing cyber challenges, ultimately to harness and safeguard the full benefits of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The platform seeks to deliver impact through facilitating the creation of security-by-design and security-by-default solutions across industry sectors, developing policy frameworks where needed; encouraging broader cooperative arrangements and shaping global governance; building communities to successfully tackle cyber challenges across the public and private sectors; and impacting agenda setting, to elevate some of the most pressing issues.World Economic Forum Centre for Cybersecurity</p><p>Platform activities focus on three main challenges:</p><p>Strengthening Global Cooperation for Digital Trust and Security - to increase global cooperation between the public and private sectors in addressing key challenges to security and trust posed by a digital landscape currently lacking effective cooperation at legal and policy levels, effective market incentives, and cooperation between stakeholders at the operational level across the ecosystem.Securing Future Digital Networks and Technology - to identify cybersecurity challenges and opportunities posed by new technologies and accelerate solutions and incentives to ensure digital trust in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.Building Skills and Capabilities for the Digital Future - to coordinate and promote initiatives to address the global deficit in professional skills, effective leadership and adequate capabilities in the cyber domain.</p><p>The platform is working on a number of ongoing activities to meet these challenges. Current initiatives include our successful work with a range of public- and private-sector partners to develop a clear and coherent cybersecurity vision for the electricity industry in the form of Board Principles for managing cyber risk in the electricity ecosystem and a complete framework, created in collaboration with the Forum\u2019s investment community, enabling investors to assess the security preparedness of target companies, contributing to raising internal cybersecurity awareness.</p><p>For more information, please contact <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@c4c-weforum.org\">info@c4c-weforum.org</email> We are in danger of entering an age of isolation</p><p>Current and upcoming regulations don't seem to take the collaborative opportunities of the data economy into account. In May 2018, a National Institutes of Health study on Type 2 diabetes was put on pause. The reason? The research included Finnish health records, which - under GDPR, the EU's data-protection regulations - could no longer be provided to the US researchers. Instead of sharing to advance their knowledge around the disease, the collaborators \u2013 and, ultimately, patients - were unable to leverage the benefits of the larger datasets.</p><p>If collaborations such as these, which enable the advancement of humanity, are unable to proceed due to data-privacy regulations, should society expect a regressive future? Will organizations have to resurrect the silos that existed before data-collaboration tools became available? Will this leave businesses in heavily regulated industries without the ability to exchange knowledge? Efficiency, growth, scientific discoveries and, critically, innovation could be hampered.</p><p>Encouragingly, however, there is a new breed of privacy-enhancing technology that can enable organizations to collaborate without the need for trust.</p><p>Cryptography has long been recognized as a method to protect data in transit (being sent from A to B) or at rest (in storage). Previously, data needed to be decrypted to be processed or analysed, but advances in cryptography are making it possible to perform analysis on encrypted data. They rely on math, not hardware or software. Privacy-enhancing technologies can now make data unseen and irretrievable, while - at the same time - both accessible and available for computation.</p><p>Homomorphic encryption (HE) is one such technique. HE allows data to remain encrypted while it is being used, analysed and processed. To visualize what this means: imagine securing personal data in a black box. This black box can be given to another entity, locked, without the key. That other entity can 'shake' this proverbial box, move the data around and perform analytics, without ever taking possession of the actual data inside.

Next up, Jeff Bezos?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While no one has accused Mr. Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon, the world's richest man and the owner of The Washington Post, of mishandling the data of tens of millions of customers (although Amazon has been the victim of hackers) or making his platform vulnerable for Russian infiltration, the man is becoming the embodiment of Big Tech, for better or for worse.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As Amazon expands in every direction, boosting by the day its already formidable power in retail, logistics, data, cloud computing, entertainment, electronic devices, payment services, web services and groceries, it's time to question whether the company has gone from benign online seller of books to corporate behemoth potentially capable of terrible societal disruption.</p><p>We all know that Donald Trump has no love for Amazon, a global digital and hardware empire valued at US$700-billion, up by almost two-thirds in one year. The Trumpian Tweet machine gun has blasted Amazon for allegedly dodging taxes, ripping off the U.S. Postal Service and gutting retailers. We could dismiss his anti-Amazon rants as cynical attacks on Mr. Bezos himself, in his role as the owner of a newspaper that delights in highlighting Mr. Trump's every flaw and boneheaded decision. But Mr. Trump isn't all wrong on the Amazon file, in the sense that Amazon's sheer heft and influence in almost every aspect of everyday commercial life means the consequences of the company's reach deserve examination.</p><p>Already, society is seeing some of the negative effects of Amazon's relentless expansion. Last year, it delivered five billion packages worldwide through its premium Prime service alone. They came in cardboard boxes that were thrown away or had to be recycled, mostly at taxpayer expense. Amazon delivers those packages by truck to your door. As home deliveries soar, so too will road congestion and pollution spewed from the trucks. Whether or not you are an Amazon customer, you are already paying the price for its phenomenal success.</p><p>At the same time, Amazon, which may soon surpass Apple as the world's most valuable company, has the chutzpah to hold a municipal shakedown competition to find a spot suitable for its second headquarters.</p><p>Cities across the United States and Canada, some with rotted bridges and schools and potholed streets, are trying to attract Amazon by offering lavish tax breaks (New Jersey offered US$7-billion incentives if Amazon were to pick Newark). Amazon's popularity has been bad news for traditional retailers. Many are dying. One investment firm publishes a \"Death by Amazon\" list of the retailers suffering the most from Amazon's onslaught: Macy's trades at less than half its 2015 high; Sears Canada has gone bankrupt and so have the U.S. operations of Toys \"R\" Us.</p><p>\"We believe [retail] defaults in 2018 could match or exceed last year's record level,\" S&amp;P Global Ratings analyst Robert Schulz said in a recent report. Even as retailers big and small vanish at alarming rates, municipal governments are asking few questions about the consequences of declining Main Street employment and shuttered stores. The lost tax income has to be replaced and squeezing house owners is the obvious solution. Watch your house taxes rise as online retailing takes off. The bigger concern may be concentration of power.</p><p>While Amazon's overall share of total retail sales is still small, at about 4 per cent in the United States in 2017, its share of online commerce is estimated at 40 per cent to 50 per cent.</p><p>It is the third largest streaming media company and the top provider of cloud computing. It is, or soon will be, the biggest clothing retailer. So far, the anti-trust case against Amazon is not clear, since competition regulators in the Western world seem more concerned about price than market power and the preservation of competition. Amazon cannot be accused of price gouging, though it could raise prices substantially once it's dominant in certain retail categories.</p><p>But there is no doubt that Amazon can, and has, clobbered competitors. Look what its arrival did to the traditional book market. Sometimes Amazon can affect competition even before it actually launches a competing service. The Blue Apron case comes to mind. Shortly before the American company, which provides recipes and packaged ingredients for home cooking, went public last June, Amazon filed a trademark to launch a copycat service. Blue Apron shares immediately plummeted on investor fears that Amazon would get into the same game (the shares have since gone from US$11 to less than US$2).</p><p>The bigger threat may not come from Amazon's clout in retailing, but in search. Today, you might search a product on Google and buy it on Amazon. Tomorrow, you may do both on Amazon. As Amazon's search capabilities expand, Google may become redundant. As its logistics business expands, FedEx, DHL and other delivery companies will come under pressure. If they were smart, they would band together and set up a shopfront to compete with Amazon, but they are running out of time. Amazon's logistics, retailing and data power is becoming hard to beat. As Mr. Big Tech, Mr. Bezos has been celebrated more than scrutinized. Mr. Zuckerberg's long honeymoon is over. It's Mr. Bezos's time to answer some hard questions, too.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20180414rbregulyrobcolumn</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S3J-TKK1-JCRP-C2N3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"897\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

Image: Steve Jurvetson    Chief executives from four of the biggest US technology companies will face a moment of reckoning on Wednesday in an extraordinary joint appearance before congress that will air bipartisan concerns that they are using their dominance to crush rivals at the expense of consumers.    The house antitrust subcommittee will hear testimony live-streamed from Amazon.com\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Alphabet\u2019s Sundar Pichai and Apple\u2019s Tim Cook as part of its year-long inquiry into technology industry competition. The panel is armed with more than a million pages of internal company documents gathered as part of its probe.    Representative David Cicilline, the panel\u2019s Democratic chairman, wanted to hear from the CEOs together as he concludes his investigation into whether the companies are squashing smaller rivals and foreclosing competition. In a coup for Cicilline, the session will mark the first time these tech leaders will appear before lawmakers together. It\u2019s also Bezos\u2019s debut on the witness stand.   They will not be able to simply run out the clock or duck by giving general or evasive answers   The participation of all four CEOs \u2014 who command enterprises with a combined value of nearly US$5-trillion \u2014 signals the degree of pressure they\u2019re facing from an American public increasingly outraged by the industry\u2019s inability to police itself. They\u2019ll likely face questions about whether they\u2019ve done enough to contain privacy breaches, election misinformation and the spread of racist and violent content.    \u201cThey will not be able to simply run out the clock or duck by giving general or evasive answers,\u201d said William Kovacic, a former member of the US Federal Trade Commission who is now a professor at George Washington University.   Concerns   Republicans will likely air concerns shared by President Donald Trump that the companies hold an anti-conservative bias. Bezos has become a Trump target over his ownership of the Washington Post, which has closely covered the administration\u2019s foibles.    The hearing comes as the coronavirus pandemic leaves millions of homebound workers, parents and teachers more reliant than ever on the companies\u2019 online platforms to earn a living, buy groceries, stay connected and educate their children. And the remote video hearing may diminish some of the spectacle, depriving lawmakers of the opportunity to berate the executives in person while also potentially creating hiccups as participants fumble with their mute buttons.    The companies face a variety of complaints about their business practices, from charges that Amazon abuses its power over the third-party merchants that sell on its site to allegations that Facebook acquires companies to eliminate potential rivals. Critics have claimed that Google\u2019s dominance of search and online advertising allows it to preference its own products and squeeze publishers. And some app makers contend that Apple uses its grip on high-end devices to force apps into its payment system, extracting high fees in the process and deciding which ones survive.    The companies, all of which are expected to announce earnings the day after the hearing, have also gone on acquisitions sprees this year, waving off watchdog scrutiny. They all declined to, or didn\u2019t return requests for, comment.    Here\u2019s a look at how the hearing may break down by witness.    Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos   Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos: Market player or umpire, or both?   The world\u2019s richest man is making his debut before the US congress, giving lawmakers a fresh target. Bezos should expect a tough grilling from Cicilline, who holds up the e-commerce behemoth as the prime example of how Big Tech firms use their size to prioritise their own commercial interests over customers\u2019 needs.    Cicilline has also questioned whether an Amazon lawyer told the truth in previous testimony. During a hearing last year, Cicilline slammed Amazon for undermining third-party sellers. He pressed a company lawyer, Nate Sutton, about the relationship, prompting Sutton to deny that Amazon uses individual seller data to launch competing goods.    Subsequent media reports contended that company employees did just that, causing Cicilline to suggest that Sutton may have been untruthful. He said Bezos needed to appear to clear up the matter.    Amazon faces antitrust probes by the FTC, California and the European Union, which are all looking at the company\u2019s role as a marketplace.    Cicilline\u2019s staffers include Lina Khan, who helped provide the intellectual underpinning of a movement for revamped competition enforcement with her legal scholarship on Amazon.    Mark Zuckerberg   Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg: Protecting free speech or digital ad business?   The CEO who\u2019s arguably provoked the greatest amount of outrage among both parties\u2019 lawmakers, Zuckerberg has been a frequent visitor to Capitol Hill in recent years.    He gave two days of testimony on the company\u2019s privacy practices in 2018 as part of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a UK political consultancy with ties to Trump\u2019s presidential campaign harvested data on millions of the site\u2019s users without their knowledge. Last year, he faced sceptical lawmakers about the company\u2019s digital currency, libra.    Now Zuckerberg is grappling with an ongoing advertiser boycott led by civil rights groups because of what they say are his failures to tackle racism, discrimination, voter suppression and election misinformation on his platform. Cicilline has called Facebook\u2019s policy of allowing politicians to post advertisements that are demonstrably false \u201ca business decision\u201d, rather than a move to protect free speech. Facebook last week started adding voting information labels to posts about the 2020 US election, including those shared by Trump and Democratic candidate Joe Biden.   Zuckerberg is grappling with an ongoing advertiser boycott led by civil rights groups   Democrats may ask about Zuckerberg\u2019s meetings with Trump and whether his hands-off approach to misleading content is designed to appease the White House, which has vowed to punish social media companies for their supposed anti-conservative bias.    Facebook is the subject of federal antitrust probes by the justice department and FTC, which share jurisdiction for enforcement of competition laws but rarely double up on targets. It\u2019s also under investigation by 45 state attorneys-general. Critics have focused on how the company extracts user data to power its advertising operation, as well as its acquisition strategy.    Congress also has been asking questions about Zuckerberg\u2019s purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp, as well as whether Facebook\u2019s treatment of apps it didn\u2019t buy, including Vine, Snapchat, FourSquare and TikTok, were efforts to squelch competition.    In response, Zuckerberg is preparing to argue that hindering American technological innovation only helps China, that Facebook faces threats from companies including TikTok and that the success of properties it acquired was the result of its investment.    Although Zuckerberg has previously faced lawmakers, his testimony on Wednesday will be his first focused on antitrust.    Google CEO Sundar Pichai   Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai: Staring down a DOJ antitrust lawsuit   While Bezos and Zuckerberg may draw the most rhetorical fireworks, Pichai may be facing the most immediate danger with attorney-general William Barr weeks away from filing a justice department antitrust lawsuit against Google for its dominance in the digital advertising market.    The company is also being investigated by a 48-state coalition led by Texas attorney-general Ken Paxton, who is also focusing on digital ads. Other states are looking into the company\u2019s dominance of online search and its mobile operating system. Some of them could also join the justice department case.    Google has argued that regulators should establish a broad definition of the ads market, including television. The company also has pointed to the insurgent challenge from Amazon for digital ad spending.    Google is also facing criticism for the way it collects data and how it handles disinformation on services like YouTube. Google\u2019s $2.1-billion deal for device-maker Fitbit is undergoing an extended antitrust review, a takeover seen as a test for regulators.    Although Pichai previously testified before the judiciary committee in 2018 over anti-conservative bias, he may be best remembered in congress for the empty chair behind the \u201cGoogle\u201d nameplate when he angered lawmakers earlier that year by skipping a senate intelligence committee hearing on foreign election meddling.    Apple CEO Tim Cook   Apple\u2019s Tim Cook: Master of deflection amid App Store probe   Of all the CEOs, Tim Cook has been the most successful in deflecting scrutiny from Washington. He\u2019s forged strong relationships with the White House, appeared on business councils with Trump and pushed the company\u2019s trade interests. Apple has largely avoided conservatives\u2019 accusations over liberal bias. Cook has also dodged the kind of criticism that Democrats have launched against Zuckerberg for courting Republicans.    While it has stayed out of the political crossfire, Apple is the subject of a justice department antitrust probe for rules that require many app makers to use the company\u2019s payment system. App makers such as Spotify Technology are raising red flags, particularly in Europe, with complaints about the fees Apple charges on its App Store, especially when the company has competing offerings.    Apple defended the fees it charges developers who sell software and services through its App Store, saying recently that the 30% cut is standard industry practice and \u201cis similar in magnitude to the commission rates charged by many other app stores and digital content marketplaces\u201d.    Cook previously testified in 2013 about Apple\u2019s payment of taxes, although he hasn\u2019t appeared before congress during the backlash to tech power that has grown during Trump\u2019s presidency.

This is FIRST MOVE, and here is your need-to-know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big Tech, bigger questions. Bezos, Cook, Zuckerberg, and Pichai defending their firms in D.C.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">COVID cost Boeing, GM and General Electric taking an earnings hit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And a Kodak moment. The company's CEO talks Trump, fresh funding and re- invention.</p><p>It's Wednesday. Let's make a move.</p><p>Welcome once again to FIRST MOVE. Great to be with you, wherever you are joining us from in the world. Today, I can tell you we have a lot of F words. Steady, stay with me.</p><p>We've got the Fed. Its policy statement is out later today. We've got the FAANGs, too. The heads of Facebook, Apple, Amazon and Alphabet appearing before a house antitrust hearing, and of course we've got the fiscal drama playing out on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers still at odds while millions of Americans begin losing crucial benefits this week.</p><p>The outlook may be fraught, but futures are higher, as you can see guidance from the likes of Starbucks and chipmaker AMD helping to offset yesterday's weakening results from McDonald's and 3M. We've also got shares of Boeing and GM higher premarket, too. A wider than expected $2.4 billion loss for Boeing. GM's loss narrower in fact than feared, but revenues there missed, too.</p><p>We've got all the details coming up in the show. It's simply a tough time to be a carmaker. Let's be clear. To Japan now where Nissan's stock plummeted more than 10 percent after the company warned of a record annual loss of $4.5 billion. The entire Japanese index weaker today, in fact.</p><p>Meanwhile in Hong Kong, they're reporting its fourth straight quarter of falling growth, down some nine percent in the second quarter. A marked contrast, and I'll give it to you, to China's 3.2 percent expansion in the same period.</p><p>Tough to compare these two numbers, but the direction, perhaps, is important most of all. All of this coming at a time when Hong Kong is battling a surge in COVID-19 cases. We'll be heading to Hong Kong for the latest shortly.</p><p>For now though, the new COVID communication reality will be at play in Washington today, too. The nation's biggest tech titans testifying via WebEx to the House antitrust subcommittee. Even with social distancing, expect Congress to bear its fangs at the FAANGs.</p><p>All right, let's get more on this in the drivers. Donie O'Sullivan joins us now. Donie, great to have you with us. This is no ordinary hearing, let's be clear. In the past when we've seen this kind of thing, it's been vaguely cringe worthy with lawmakers not really understanding what these tech titans do.</p><p>This comes after months of investigation. They may have fangs, but will it have bite?</p><p>DONIE O'SULLIVAN, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Yes. Absolutely. Today is going to be fascinating. It's really a historic hearing, a historic day for Silicon Valley.</p><p>The last time there was an antitrust hearing about this in the technology space was when Bill Gates appeared before Congress about 22 years ago.</p><p>And you're right, this committee is very, very well briefed. Today really is sort of just the cherry on the top of an investigation that has been going on for months.</p><p>The Committee has picked up more than, I think 1.5 million documents and has done hundreds of hours of interviews already. And the CEOs of Apple, Facebook, and -- Apple, Facebook, excuse me, Julia, sorry, I am losing track, but the only CEO who has not appeared before Congress is Jeff Bezos.</p><p>So while the other guys might have a bit of experience in this space, the world's richest man, it's going to be fascinating to hear from him today. We don't see him under pressure in interviews a lot either, so it is really going to be quite interesting to see how Bezos performs -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. We've never seen him in front of Congress. We rarely see him in interviews, too, and it was Google that was alluding you there. It's tough to keep track of all of these names. At least, I had it typed in front of me earlier.</p><p>Amazon should come under scrutiny though, even just the last few weeks, we have seen the rise in Amazon's power. We have seen the need and the necessity of things like smart phones for Apple.</p><p>The key question for these lawmakers is, do they help ultimately consumers and small businesses, or do they hurt them? Because the defense that we're going to hear from these big shots is, look, we're actually net good for society, you need to promote American innovation, not restrict it.</p><p>[09:05:17]</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Absolutely. And unsurprisingly, you know, we've seen the opening testimony of some of these CEOs and they all make that point. They say that America is a better country because of them, that they are drivers of employment, et cetera.</p><p>Look, I mean, I think for each company, for Amazon, a lot of this there will be questions about, you know, how it uses data from third-party companies that sell on its website to then develop products or to acquire companies to sell products that could then undercut some of the independent retailers that sell on Amazon.</p><p>When it comes to Apple, there's going to be a lot of questions about the App Store. And when it comes to Google, the search ranking. That's obviously a big issue we've seen it in Europe, too.</p><p>When it comes to Facebook, I guess, perhaps the company that's under the most scrutiny here is obviously, there will be questions about their acquisitions of Instagram, of WhatsApp and now GIPHY, but you know, I do think that today will go much further beyond just the sort of merger and acquisition questions, too, really about the true power that companies, especially Facebook have, in speech and in the election here in the United States and the role they have at controlling what the public and voters see and do not see.</p><p>So I think it's going to be a fascinating few hours. I think you're right. A lot of the people on this committee are extremely well-briefed. But no doubt, we'll also see a lot of partisan questions, too, particularly after Donald Trump, Jr. was briefly suspended from tweeting on Twitter yesterday after sharing COVID-19 misinformation, so there will be lots of those regular questions about perceived anti-conservative bias on the part of Silicon Valley.</p><p>So, it should be a fun few hours, not probably too fun for the CEO, though -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, probably more fun than being there in person, actually. At least, they've got a bit of distance due to the COVID concerns, of course. They're sort of dialing in rather than anything else.</p><p>Your points though are critical, whichever way you look at this, is it too much power ultimately in too few hands? Donie, how do we go from here to lawmakers going, okay, we've got all this information now, do we need to take action or don't we? Because it does seem to be Democrats and Republicans that are on board. It's a bipartisan effort here, perhaps to regulate these, however that looks.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Yes, it's possible. I mean, look, there have now been different tech hearings for a few years, especially since the 2016 election and Cambridge Analytica, and really we've seen very little or no legislation, frankly, that really affects these companies in a major way.</p><p>But it is a bipartisan issue that both Republicans and Democrats want to crack down on these companies, but sometimes they want to crack down on them in different ways.</p><p>Also, you know, an important role here is the role of the Attorney Generals in individual states, many of which have individual investigations in each state into some of these companies around antitrust.</p><p>So, you know, I think it is going to be a big leap to go from this hearing and all of these hearings to whether we actually see new laws on the books and you know, whether Republicans and Democrats come together on some issues around this, despite having very different motivations for doing so, well, that's going to be one of the big issues, I think, that the lobbyists for these four companies are going to be working very, very hard on in the coming months -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I'm so glad you mentioned the lobbyists. Yes, a lot of pushback and working behind-the-scenes to prevent anything that really does have bite. Donie, great to have you with us. It's going to be a fascinating day. Donie O'Sullivan there, thank you.</p><p>O'SULLIVAN: Thank you.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, to Hong Kong now, which is on high alert. Chief Executive Carrie Lam warning the city is quote, \"on the verge of a large scale community outbreak of the virus.\" Meanwhile, Mainland China reports the single highest day jump since early April, with more than 100 new coronavirus cases.</p><p>Will Ripley is live in Hong Kong with all the details. Will, let's start in Hong Kong where you are. It's a dramatic phrase when we're hearing this from Carrie Lam. Give us context. What are we talking about in terms of outbreak numbers? What are we looking at?</p><p>WILL RIPLEY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: We're not seeing, Julia, an exponential explosion in terms of the daily infection rate. It's held steady for the last eight days at more than 100. Today, it was 118.</p><p>While that is obviously is concerning, you have to put it in context. There are seven million people who live here in Hong Kong and the social distancing measures, the strictest so far this pandemic are now in effect here.</p><p>You have restaurants closed completely for dine-in service. Mask wearing is mandatory whenever you step outside your home basically. You get a big fine.</p><p>The beaches are closed. People can only gather in groups of two even throughout, you know, exercising or you know, walking having a coffee, only two people can be together at any one time.</p><p>So, the city is hoping that the numbers will continue to stabilize and then go down. But the concern is, is that a lot of these local cases, and most of these 118 are community spread, they still can't trace them. They don't know where they're coming from.</p><p>[09:10:17]</p><p>RIPLEY: And you have a healthcare system that every time you get a patient of a certain age or has a pre-existing condition, that takes up one more bed and this city is really running low on beds.</p><p>China has actually volunteered to come in and build a field hospital at the Expo Center near the airport, similar to one that they built in Wuhan. That could be open early next month and that would be for patients with mild symptoms.</p><p>The more serious patients would need those precious beds at hospitals.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. That's interesting, Will, and just very quickly on that, what are people saying about the prospect of China lending help here?</p><p>RIPLEY: You know, people are just starting to hear about it. Obviously, the city says that they requested China's assistance. Is this an attempt to use soft power to try to win over hearts and minds? We'll see if it works.</p><p>I mean, there are certainly plenty of people here in Hong Kong who are happy to have -- to be a part of China and then there are obviously, as we saw with the protests that are no longer happening in large part because of the pandemic, and also the National Security Law, many people aren't. But we haven't heard a whole lot of chatter about it, Julia.</p><p>China, by the way, 101 cases reported today, that is the biggest number they've had since April. Most of those cases in Xinjiang, which you might recognize because that's the home of the Uighur Muslims where China is accused of running essentially reeducation camps, 89 of those 101 were in that far kind of western province.</p><p>But this does -- this obviously is a concerning trend for China to have their biggest number since April, but 1.4 billion people there, 101 cases reported in the last 24 hours -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, you know, our minds work exactly the same way, whether it's China's help as far as Hong Kong is concerned or the relative numbers here. A hundred cases versus 1.4 billion population. Yes. Will Ripley, thank you so much for that.</p><p>All right, let me bring you up to speed with some of the other stories making headlines around the world. Turning now to a CNN exclusive in what is being described as a Sputnik moment for Russia.</p><p>Moscow says it is working to approve a coronavirus vaccine in less than two weeks. We're just learning there are plans for mass production this autumn. But the push for the vaccine so quickly is raising serious safety concerns at the same time.</p><p>CNN's Matthew Chance joins us now from Moscow. This announcement took a lot of people, I think, by surprise. What do we know, Matthew, in terms of data, in terms of steps and processes that are being followed and where they are in terms of phases here of trialing this vaccine?</p><p>MATTHEW CHANCE, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, you're right, Julia, first of all. I think it has taken a lot of people off guard, but actually this production or this move to approve the Russian vaccine has been in the pipeline for some time.</p><p>What Russian officials confirmed to us yesterday is that at the 10th of August, which is not very long from now, is the date which they're aiming for, but it could be approved, they say, even before then. So that's like with staggering speed with which the Russians have deployed vast resources in their state to try and develop a vaccine, seem to have got there.</p><p>Of course there's lots of skepticism about how effective this vaccine would be, how safe it will be. What the Russians say is the reason it's got there so quickly is because the technology they've used to manufacture or create this vaccine is technology they've used in the past successfully. They've got lots of clinical data on it.</p><p>They've simply taken an old vaccine, to simplify it, and adjusted it to make it relevant to coronavirus. That's what the Russians say.</p><p>But of course you can't dismiss the whole idea that Russia has basically ignored the conventions when it comes to human trials. I mean, the scientists that developed this vaccine in Russia, they were injecting it into themselves and their staff members before human trials formally began and then soldiers were used in the first round of testing and we learned yesterday as well that the third phase of human trials, which is crucial because it sort of looks at the overall safety and overall effectiveness of any vaccine, that will only be done in parallel to the inoculation or the vaccination of people in vulnerable categories, particularly frontline medical workers.</p><p>So they're going to approve it and carry out the final phase of human trials sort of in parallel with each other, which is sort of unprecedented, perhaps, or at least extremely unusual. And of course it's fueled this idea that this virus may not be all it seems and may not be as effective as the Russians like to put across.</p><p>Part of the problem with that, just to answer the second part of your question, is that the data that the Russians have accumulated throughout the trials that they've done so far has not been made public. It's not been subject to peer review.</p><p>I'm told, you know, over the past 24 hours that that's going to change by the first week of August. They're going to make the results public. They're going to publish them. They are going to open them to peer review.</p><p>So I expect there's going to be a lot of scrutiny here in Russia and around the world to see how effective those results have really been and that vaccine really is -- Julia.</p><p>[09:15:18]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I mean, we have to wait and see what the data says, to your point, Matthew, exactly, but I can't help but remember that we've also had a conversation on this show about at least accusations of potential theft or at least trying to tap in and access information about vaccine research from other nations, directed from Russia.</p><p>CHANCE: Yes, I mean, this is the other part of the sort of concern and the skepticism that surrounds the progress that Russia says it has made with this vaccine.</p><p>I mean, first of all, you've got enormous pressure from the Kremlin, political pressure. It sees this as a sort of prestige project it wants to do. Putin wants it -- Vladimir Putin, the Russian President wants to be the first. He wants to be able to say, look, Russia has stepped in and saved the world from this global pandemic. And I think that's one of the drivers for them cutting corners in the way that they have.</p><p>And then in addition, there have been these other allegations, which in fairness, have been categorically denied by the Kremlin, that Russian spies have been hacking into research labs in the United States, in Canada, and in Britain, to try and steal research vaccine secrets.</p><p>Now, whether or not that contributed to the position that Russia is in now in terms of its vaccine, we don't know. Certainly the Russians say that it definitely hasn't contributed to it.</p><p>But nevertheless, it adds to that sort of cloud of skepticism that hangs over this apparent progress in the Russian vaccine.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, they want this to be, as you pointed out, a Sputnik moment. The question, is it? We'll wait and see. The data matters. Matthew Chance in Moscow, thank you so much for that.</p><p>The Haj underway in Mecca, but it is dramatically different this year. Muslims are circling their holiest site wearing masks walking along socially distant paths. Saudi Arabia is allowing only a tiny fraction of the usual number of participants because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>All right, we're going to take a break here on FIRST MOVE. But still to come, tales of a fabled manufacturer's earnings from Boeing's and General Motors, and Kodak's chemical comeback. We will put you in the picture with the CEO.</p><p>It's all coming up. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:20:26]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE, live from New York, where we're still on target for a higher open this Wednesday on what could be a challenging day for investors. Let's call it that.</p><p>We've got the Federal Reserve releasing its latest policy statement later today. Jay Powell and company, certain to promise more monetary muscle if necessary, especially with so much uncertainty over the size of the next fiscal package coming from Congress. What does he have to say? We shall see.</p><p>Meanwhile, FAANGs stocks are higher premarket. Little fear it seems ahead of a historic congressional antitrust hearing today featuring the heads of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet. That said, take a look at the big swings in tech over the past four trading sessions alone. There's definitely uncertainty over the path forward after the NASDAQ's spectacular 16 percent run-up so far this year. It could just be consolidation.</p><p>Hey, this action anything but normal. That we agree.</p><p>A deluge of tech earnings comes out tomorrow after the closing bell, too. Today, we've got results from two of America's most fabled manufacturers Boeing and GM. Clare Sebastian joins me now. Clare, what can you tell us?</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, it was a pretty miserable quarter, Julia, I think by any measure and I think the question that you get from both of these companies given that they saw prolonged production stoppages, huge drops in demand, is this as bad as it's going to get? Was the second quarter the worst that we're going to see during this pandemic?</p><p>So let's take a look at Boeing to begin with. They reported a net loss of $2.4 billion. Revenues are down 25 percent year-on-year. Bear in mind that even last year, things were not that great because of the 737 MAX, which continues to impact them.</p><p>They only delivered, Julia, 20 aircraft during the quarter. That led to a 65 percent drop in commercial airplanes revenue, which is their biggest segment so that they are scaling back. They are preparing for a future where they have to be smaller.</p><p>Production is coming down pretty much across all of their major aircraft lines, the 737 line that necessarily won't come up in 2022. That's a year behind what they had scheduled in the past quarter, cuts for the 777 and 777X. Cuts for the 787.</p><p>They confirmed as well that the 747, that production will end the iconic Jumbo Jet in 2022. And we know already that Boeing has announced a 10 percent workforce reduction, that's about 16,000 jobs.</p><p>In a letter to staff today, the CEO, David Calhoun, said that more could be coming as the demand continues to come down and they might have to reassess their workforce even further -- Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And Clare, very quickly, on GM as well. We knew it was going to be a devastating quarter in terms of sales, also cash burn for these concerning. Very quickly, give us the top lines here.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Yes, we knew it was bad. Sales were down 34 percent on the quarter. Having said that, it wasn't quite as bad as people had feared. They lost $800 million in the quarter. That was not add bad as people worried about, and that despite, Julia, an eight-week production stoppage, eight weeks out of 13 weeks production was impacted.</p><p>So they are saying that the business is resilient. They are used to austerity and making cost cut and they believe they are positioned well going forward.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The question is what comes forward? Clare Sebastian, thank you so much for that.</p><p>To Europe now, showing signs of getting a grip on coronavirus just as they were. Fresh outbreaks now sweeping across the continent. Germany has seen a spike in cases and in Britain, the Prime Minister says there are signs a second wave may be coming.</p><p>Here in the United States, as the tally of coronavirus deaths approaches 150,000, the President had this to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP (R), PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You can look at large portions of our country, it's corona free.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: As you can see, and I can give you a look, deaths are still increasing in 29 states. Meanwhile, much attention has also been paid to a doctor, one specific doctor among others as we discussed on the show yesterday, and again on Twitter on Monday night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: She said that she has had tremendous success with hundreds of different patients and I thought her voice was an important voice.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: He was talking about Stella Immanuel, a pediatrician and preacher from Houston. She's known for touting highly unconventional theories involving alien DNA, demons and the unproven drug, hydroxychloroquine.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. STELLA IMMANUEL, PEDIATRICIAN AND PREACHER: This virus has a cure. It is called hydroxychloroquine, zinc and Zithromax. I know people want to talk about masks? Hello? You don't need masks.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Wow. We've got a lot to discuss. Elizabeth Cohen joins us now from CNN Health. Elizabeth, always great to have you on the show. Let's just do a setup. Where are we in terms of cases, in terms of death rate, just in the United States? Let's hone in there.</p><p>[09:25:15]</p><p>ELIZABETH COHEN, CNN SENIOR MEDICAL CORRESPONDENT: You know, the cases -- the case numbers, sorry, Julia, continue to climb. We continue to have hot spots such as California, Florida, Texas. Many areas are suffering shortages of hospital beds, especially ICU beds. So this continues to be a problem.</p><p>Now, the death rate, we have improved the death rate since the beginning of this outbreak because doctors have gotten better about learning how to treat these patients. But obviously when you have more than 100,000 deaths, that still is obviously a huge issue and there are forecasts that these deaths will continue and that we're going in the wrong direction in the United States. That's probably the best way to put it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, the cleanest way to put it. The other question, and it keeps coming up and we have discussed it many times, hydroxychloroquine. I just want to play something very quickly. Dr. Fauci was asked about this yesterday. This is what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: I go along with the F.D.A. The overwhelming prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Elizabeth, the doctor that we were just playing earlier was saying look, I've had hundreds of patients recover, talking about it as a cure.</p><p>What does the data, the trials, the randomized data trials that we have tell us about the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment, a cure, I use the word carefully, for COVID?</p><p>COHEN: It shows that it doesn't work. There have now been multiple random clinical trials where people, some people were given hydroxychloroquine and others given a placebo and they showed that hydroxychloroquine did not work to treat COVID or to prevent COVID.</p><p>In the beginning we weren't sure and that's why they did these trials. They did them in the U.K., in the United States and other places, and they showed over and over again that not only didn't they work, but that there seems to be the possibility that hydroxychloroquine actually hurts some people because hydroxychloroquine has been known for many years to have possible cardiac problems.</p><p>Now, Julia, you brought up that critics say, wait a minute, I used it on my patients and it worked or look at this study over here. They used it on this group of patients and they got better.</p><p>Julia, I'm going to bring you back to the chocolate chip cookie analogy that you and I have talked about many times. If you have a cold and I give you a chocolate chip cookie and a few days later you're better, you might say, oh, must have been that cookie. It wasn't the cookie. It's because most people get better.</p><p>It's the same thing with COVID. Obviously people die from COVID, but most people do get better. You can't credit the hydroxychloroquine for getting them better.</p><p>They might have gotten better all by themselves. That's why you do these randomized controlled clinical trials. You give some people hydroxychloroquine, you give some people a placebo and you see if there is a difference. What they have shown is there is not a difference.</p><p>It is incredibly disingenuous for a doctor to say I gave my patients hydroxychloroquine and, look, they got better. Anybody, a third grader, should know that this is incredibly false logic.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, unless you have a control, you can't tell whether they would have recovered with or without a specific drug, and that's the bottom line. Elizabeth Cohen, thank you very much. Thank you for a reminder of my cookie. Thank you.</p><p>All right, we are counting down the market open. Stay with us.</p><p>[09:31:52]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE and the U.S. stock markets are open for the third session today and I can give you a look at what we're seeing in terms of price action.</p><p>The NASDAQ as you can see, outperforming, up some seven tenths of one percent. Taking back around half of yesterday's losses. We're awaiting the Federal Reserve's policy statement later today.</p><p>Jay Powell's press conference, of course, too. What does he say about the economic outlook? Meanwhile, chipmaker AMD, one of the biggest gainers on the NASDAQ after raising its guidance. Right now, it's up more than 10 percent. We also hope to have an update on stimulus talks later today.</p><p>The Democrats and the Republicans seemingly still far apart in the early innings of those negotiations. The bottom line is new aid may take a while to get to some needy Americans.</p><p>Also in D.C., CEOs from some of the most powerful and influential tech companies will be the focus of a historic antitrust hearing, the first of its kind by the U.S. Congress in more than 20 years. The heads of Google parent, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook will face questions about their dominance of the tech economy. Clare Sebastian has all the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): When these four CEOs come before Congress, albeit remotely, it will be hard to know who is the most powerful in the room.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): Google controls nearly all the search market in the United States. Amazon controls nearly half of all online commerce in the United States. Facebook has approximately 2.7 billion monthly active users across its platforms.</p><p>And finally, Apple is under increasing scrutiny for abusing its role as a player and referee in the App Store.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): A year-long congressional investigation is looking for ways to check the power in what experts say will require a new understanding of U.S. Competition Law.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM KOVACIC, FORMER CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION: The major point of these hearings is to move away from a conception of competition law and focusing on the well-being of citizens as purchasers of goods and services and to adopt a broader conception that looks at the citizen as an employee, as a resident of a community, as a consumer of news.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): The four companies have all denied anticompetitive behavior.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NATHAN SUTTON, ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL, AMAZON: We do not use any seller data to compete with them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN: (voice over): Apple even commissioning a study last week that found its App Store commission rates were in line with others.</p><p>Several have also voiced concerns that regulation might make them less competitive globally.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I worry that if you regulate for the sake of regulating it, does a lot of unintended consequences. If you take a technology like artificial intelligence, you know, it will have implications for our national security and how -- or for other important areas of society.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): And yet, even as the COVID-19 pandemic has made these companies ever more essential and more valuable, they have been facing growing backlash.</p><p>Protests over safety at Amazon and an advertiser boycott at Facebook over hate speech.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KOVACIC: I think they come into the hearing not with a halo, but with great concerns about exactly whose side they're on and that should be a matter of concern.</p><p>Again, you look at the mood of the Congress, you look at how Republicans join Democrats today in scolding these companies. That's a combustible environment for the leading enterprises.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[09:35:12]</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice over): The House investigation is expected to lead to a recommendation for new legislation, perhaps bringing greater scrutiny of tech acquisitions.</p><p>Deals like Facebook's purchases of WhatsApp and Instagram and google buying YouTube and Fitbit. It could also ramp up the pressure on other ongoing investigations.</p><p>A delicate moment for these titans of tech.</p><p>Clare Sebastian, CNN, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, let's talk this through. Scott Galloway is Professor of Marketing at NYU Stern School of Business. Scott, always great to have you on the show.</p><p>You've already written the questions for these lawmakers, so they should be great when they perform today. But you say Big Tech is going to walk away the winner anyway. Why?</p><p>SCOTT GALLOWAY, PROFESSOR OF MARKETING, NYU STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: Well, I think, just as most wars are won or lost before you step on the field, I think this confrontation has already been won because Big Tech showing up as a group means it will be difficult to focus or go very deep on any one. I think there is safety in numbers.</p><p>Also, Julia, I don't think you can ignore that the remote nature of this hearing means that the most -- you know, the odds for kind of an unscripted real moment that changes public view is less likely. I think it's easier for them to control the environment.</p><p>And essentially these companies are very good at delaying weapons of mass distraction and that is they'll play slow ball, they'll delay, and I think there's going to be different treatment of the four.</p><p>And also the antitrust concerns for Apple are much different than the antitrust concerns for Facebook. So one demanding that they all testify together and also keeping it remote, I think it plays to the advantage of the Big Tech firms.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: I'm trying to remember back in 2018 when Mark Zuckerberg testified and he said he would get back to lawmakers, I think 46 times, if not more, \"I'll get back to you.\"</p><p>Why does public opinion matter and why does today and what they say actually matter if they've done a year of investigation to decide whether or not individually these companies need tackling?</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, every one of the people questioning them is up for re- election and I think this is an opportunity for them to put forward some assertions after a lot of the work they've done that these firms are bad for the economy, bad for the tax base, bad for our elections, bad for teen depression, and then they will get a crisp response from the American public.</p><p>Effectively what this is, no decisions are going to be made today, but they'll get a gauge on sentiment around one thing, and that is as a congressperson, is my likelihood to claim power more likely if I, in fact, begin to go after these guys or put pressure on the D.O.J. or the F.T.C. to begin antitrust action.</p><p>To date, there have been very few elected representatives who really take the time to develop the domain expertise and push for the breakup. Other than Senator Warren, it is difficult, no senator or congressperson has really taken up this issue.</p><p>So this is an opportunity to gauge sentiment and build a base for whether or not there should be a big issue -- and all of these folks run again in November.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes. Net-net, is the public harmed? Do they even know they're harmed or do they see greater value in the utility value of being on Facebook, or particularly what we've seen in the last few weeks, the ability to go to somewhere like Amazon and shop when you can't go in store?</p><p>GALLOWAY: That's a correct question, and current antitrust law is based on consumer harm and you have a difficult time saying that you're incurring consumer harm or prices are increasing when the product is free.</p><p>I would argue that the prices we pay as parents when our teen depression is up and self-harm among young girls is up 120 percent because Facebook has no incentives to put in place any safeguards against teen depression, I would argue that your small business person in the fastest growing parts of our economy have absolutely been cauterized because they're controlled by duopolies, whether it is search, whether it is hardware, whether it is social.</p><p>There hasn't been a major social network in America that started since 2011 with Pinterest, whether you are a tax payer, your costs have gotten higher because Big Tech does not pay their fair share of taxes.</p><p>I would argue, Julia that the costs incurred on citizens, on parents, and on entrepreneurs has skyrocketed at the hand of these firms. We have a proud legacy of antitrust where we go in and oxygenate the market by breaking up these firms, encouraging competition and encouraging them to behave better, and the price we are paying as a commonwealth and as citizens has skyrocketed.</p><p>So yes, I think this can play a critical role in helping consumers and voters understand that our economy is suffering, our commonwealth is suffering at the concentration -- increasing concentration of power across fewer and fewer firms.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Jeff Bezos, he is the unknown quantity. We all get a sense of how powerful Amazon is in terms of -- what -- a 40 percent, probably more now share now of the e-commerce market, far smaller, admittedly growing fraction of the overall retail market.</p><p>But we've never really heard from him and we've certainly never seen him on D.C., in the Capitol. What do you think we get from him today?</p><p>[09:40:16]</p><p>GALLOWAY: Well, you brought up a critical point. Expect Jeff Bezos to talk about the fact that they are only four percent or five percent of retail, you know, how can we be a threat? But that's not really the right metric.</p><p>In a five-week period coming out of the depths of the market in March, Amazon was able to add -- add the value to their market capitalization of the world's largest company, Walmart. This is a company that has more soft power, I think than any other entity in the world with the exception of China.</p><p>He owns \"The Washington Post,\" which plays a big role in reelecting or not these individuals. He also has more lobbyists. Amazon has more lobbyists, get this, Julia, in Washington than there are sitting U.S. senators. So there is tremendous soft power.</p><p>A lot of eyes on Mr. Bezos because it's the first time he has testified, but you're talking about an individual that commands the wealth and the GDP of Luxembourg and Kuwait combined, but what a lot of people would argue is paying a lower tax rate than anybody on the stage or any of us.</p><p>So there is going to be, I think -- it will very interesting to see what kind of -- if he gets fire or if he gets fawning. He's very likable, and let's be honest, this is -- a lot of this comes down to likability. Expect Tim Cook to have an auburn college football helmet in his screen shot, expect Jeff Bezos to talk about his mother who gave birth to him at the age of 17. This will be an attempt to be likable and to deflect any real questions.</p><p>But you're right, everyone is going to be focused on the wealthiest man in the world, Jeff Bezos.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: You also make the point that Amazon paid $162 million in Federal tax last year, Walmart paid almost $3 million. Someone should definitely pull that one out as well, Scott, but in their statements -- in their opening statements, they're going to point that they are American businesses. They actually foster innovation.</p><p>They need to be protected from foreign interference at a time when everybody is looking around the world and going actually, we do need to strengthen our own assets and our own innovation.</p><p>Does any of this fly? Particularly to your point about lawmakers caring about re-election, what message does sell to voters at this moment?</p><p>GALLOWAY: That's a correct question, Julia. So you expect, especially Mark Zuckerberg to wrap himself in an American flag and create a nationalist argument that we need Facebook and we need someone of that size to fend off the Chinese apps that are coming for our children.</p><p>And what we've found throughout history is, depending on a national champion, whether it's Air France or trying to prop up NTT, the Japanese telco, it almost never works.</p><p>Now, if and when you spin a company, for example, when eBay spun PayPal, PayPal was a more robust competitor against other payment companies domestic and abroad than they were as a larger conglomerate.</p><p>So this notion -- you're going to hear two words from Mark Zuckerberg over and over, Tik and Tok. So, the correct question is, how can America remain competitive?</p><p>Typically, when we break these companies up, it unlocks tremendous innovation. It unlocks tremendous upside and antitrust is one of the things, Julia that we always get right that typically taxpayers win, entrepreneurs win. The shareholders of the company win.</p><p>Can you imagine the valuation on AWS as an independent company? There is no peer play way to play the Cloud right now.</p><p>So the bottom line is, we don't break them up because they're bad people or some sort of punishment, we break them up because we want to expand our tax base and we want the markets to keep roaring upward.</p><p>There's only one party that loses in a breakup traditionally and that's the CEO who wants to be on the iron throne of all the Westeros, just not one of the realms.</p><p>So this is good for the company and we break them up because we're capitalists, Julia.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Yes, in this case, not better together. Scott Galloway, thank you so much for that. Professor of Marketing at NYU Stern School of Business. Always great to chat with you, sir. Thank you.</p><p>All right, coming up after the break, Kodak's big moment. One of the most recognizable brands pivot towards pharmaceuticals. The CEO live, next.</p><p>[09:47:14]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Kodak, one of the world's most recognizable brands is having its moment to quote one of its old slogans.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Life is filled with moments just waiting to be taken.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Kodak struggled to adapt to the digital revolution, well, now it's being handed a $765 million loan under the U.S. Defense Production Act. Kodak will now make pharmaceutical ingredients, reducing America's dependency on foreign drug makers.</p><p>Picture this. Kodak's stock soared 200 percent on Tuesday, thanks to that deal. Right now, it's up another 150 percent. Its legacy of handling film puts it in a good position to work with chemicals just like its rival Fuji Film did years ago.</p><p>Jim Continenza is CEO and Executive Chairman of Kodak, and he joins us now. Jim, fantastic to have you on the show. I don't think anyone was surprised by the decision to try and sure up supply chains for pharmaceuticals, but people saw the name Kodak and thought, hang on a second, why are you best placed to do this?</p><p>JIM CONTINENZA, CEO AND EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN, KODAK: Well, you know, Kodak has been in the chemical business for well over a hundred years. It's the foundation of who we are. We currently today are making unregulated key starting materials for some other pharmaceuticals. So we're in this business, just not in a large way, and this is a chance for us to expand.</p><p>And then we look at Eastman Business Park, we have 1,200 acres, we have several facilities that we will be putting into this entity as we build out to help lower the cost. We have our own power, steam, rail, waste treatment, chemical treatment. It's just utilizing the park which lowers the cost greatly and it's doing something that's in our DNA. We've been doing it for a hundred years.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: The White House Trade Adviser, Peter Navarro said, by the time this thing ramps up, 25 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredients for generics we need in the United States are going to be right at this facility. That's incredible. How quickly can you do that?</p><p>CONTINENZA: Well, it usually takes about three years to build out, approximately three to three and a half years. But during this time, we'll still be manufacturing. We'll be manufacturing in batch manufacturing, moving to continuous manufacturing. So it will be a combination of two items.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And where do you see the biggest bottlenecks?</p><p>CONTINENZA: You know, again, it will be in the buildout when we transition over from the batch to the continuous. That will probably be our biggest bottleneck. But we're prepared for it, and then from there, we'll innovate and continue to get more efficiencies out of it.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: So there are a number of companies in the United States that perhaps could have handled this, too. What about your relationship with the U.S. administration? Why do you think they specifically came to you guys and said, look, we're going to rely on you to build this out.</p><p>[09:50:12]</p><p>CONTINENZA: Okay, I mean, I think we're in the best position to do it. Again, find another company that has been chemicals for over a hundred years that has the facilities sitting there and ready to go and is doing it today. I would say we're probably the best suited.</p><p>I know they looked at several. We weren't the only one, I can guarantee that. And again, you heard Dr. Navarro yesterday state how they made this decision. They looked at others and we are the most suited and best suited to do this.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: How many people are you going to have to hire, Jim?</p><p>CONTINENZA: Now, approximately 300 up in the greater area of New York, and then about 30 to 50 in Minneapolis and approximately about 1,200 indirect jobs. So, we're excited to bring those jobs back to New York. It's a great area. It's a great park. We're bringing those jobs back to upstate New York and it's been phenomenal.</p><p>And Governor Cuomo has been a huge supporter over the years and one reason that park is even there is because of the support he has given it over the years.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: And just talk to me about what happened in light of COVID as well. Because I know you were looking at making masks, you were looking at the screens as well. You sort of talked about the bipartisan push that took place here to try and help you do that. I think this is important for people to understand as well.</p><p>CONTINENZA: I can tell you, I'm not political, I'm a businessman. We run a company. And never once, and I mean never once did Adam Bohler's group, the DFC ever want to bring up a party, bring up anything. This is a necessity. We need to get this done.</p><p>Dr. Navarro did the same. Governor Cuomo, how can I help? What can we do to be helpful? Again, this park exists because of the help of Senator Schumer and Governor Cuomo over the years, and then obviously, you know, Dr. Navarro and Adam.</p><p>It was just, let's get this done for the American people. You're best positioned to do this. We need to shore up this and we need to do it quick.</p><p>As Dr. Navarro calls everything, Trump time and that means you do 30 days' worth of work in four days.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Well, I like the sound of that and that idea is exactly how this Defense Production Act should be used, so we will watch your progress. Great to have you on, sir. Thank you so much.</p><p>CONTINENZA: Thank you so much.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Jim Continenza, CEO and Executive Chairman there of Kodak.</p><p>All right, a new achievement for the United States' top soldier in the fight against COVID-19, a run on Dr. Anthony Fauci's baseball card is proving his status as an American icon. We'll take a look after this break.</p><p>CHATTERLEY: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. Dr. Fauci has risen to cult status here in the United States. Well, now, he has even been pictured on his very own baseball card. It's become the bestselling card ever for Top's limited edition series.</p><p>The card shows him mid pitch during that terrible -- I'm not judging -- throw before the Washington Nationals season opener. But his fans clearly don't care how bad that was.</p><p>They snatched up more than 51,000 of his cards in just 24 hours. Yes, better than I could do. That's all I can say.</p><p>[09:55:05]</p><p>CHATTERLEY: All right, in two hours' time, the CEOs of Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Amazon will testify to Congress on their dominance of the tech industry via video conference.</p><p>We should expect fireworks. Amazon's CEO, Jeff Bezos has never testified to lawmakers before. Facebook continually under fire over fact checking and hate speech ahead of the presidential election here in the United States.</p><p>Apple and Alphabet both stand accused of exercising monopolistic powers -- all four companies will argue that they play a key role in the U.S. economy and represent American values in the face of rising Chinese competition.</p><p>Stay with CNN for full coverage of this historic event across all platforms coming up from 12:00 Eastern.</p><p>And that's it for the show. You've been watching FIRST MOVE. I'm Julia Chatterley. Stay safe and I'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>[10:00:00]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2020072901cbk41</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G8-W551-JB20-G0M5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7800\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002HQL</classCode><className>NISSAN MOTOR CO LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000299K</classCode><className>GENERAL ELECTRIC CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS336412 AIRCRAFT ENGINE &amp;

At issue was Microsoft's practice of bundling the company's new internet browser with its Windows operating software in a way that disadvantaged browsers made by other companies and created preferential links to other Microsoft products.</p><p>In 1998, Windows was powering about 90% of the world's personal computers.</p><p>\"How ironic that in the United States, where freedom and innovation are core values, these regulators are trying to punish an American company that has worked hard and successfully to deliver on these values,\" Gates said in a CNN interview, shortly after the lawsuits were filed that year.</p><p>In September 1998, Microsoft eclipsed General Electric as the world's most valuable public company, reaching a market capitalization of $261 billion. On July 27, Bezos' personal wealth nearly matched that mark, at $256 billion, and Amazon stock, trading at about $3,000 per share at the end of regular trading Tuesday, had a market capitalization of $5.2 trillion.</p><p>It is currently holding down the No. 3 position among the world's most valuable public companies.</p><p>How the operators of the world's biggest tech companies wield their vast financial and structural power will once again be the focus of U.S. lawmakers today and Bezos will not be alone in the calling to account.</p><p>Joining him in the virtual hearing will be Apple CEO Tim Cook, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Alphabet/Google CEO Sundar Pichai.</p><p>Each of those companies is facing its own criticisms and inquiries when it comes to taking advantage of scale and/or market position to shoulder out, or absorb, competition. Those include Facebook's acquisition history, including the practice of swallowing emerging competitors; Apple's control and curation of its popular app store; and Google's domination of the online search and advertising realm.</p><p>Bezos' appearance is earning the most attention as he is the only one of the four witnesses who is making his debut appearance in front of federal lawmakers. And his virtual hot seat may be a few degrees warmer than his colleagues' thanks to a damning report earlier this year by The Wall Street Journal. The April story offered details reflecting how Amazon was leveraging its access to information on products offered for sale on its platform by third-party sellers to create and market its own competing products.</p><p>\"In one instance, Amazon employees accessed documents and data about a bestselling car-trunk organizer sold by a third-party vendor,\" The Wall Street Journal reported. \"The information included total sales, how much the vendor paid Amazon for marketing and shipping, and how much Amazon made on each sale.</p><p>\"Amazon's private-label arm later introduced its own car-trunk organizers.\"</p><p>The House antitrust subcommittee has been conducting its own, wide-ranging antitrust investigation for over a year and noted the in-person testimony of those at the top of the Big Tech pyramid was necessary to complete its work.</p><p>\"Since last June, the subcommittee has been investigating the dominance of a small number of digital platforms and the adequacy of existing antitrust laws and enforcement,\" House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D- N.Y., and Antitrust Subcommittee Chairman David Cicilline, D-R.I., said in a joint statement. \"Given the central role these corporations play in the lives of the American people, it is critical that their CEOs are forthcoming. As we have said from the start, their testimony is essential for us to complete this investigation.\"</p><p>Google has been under additional scrutiny since late last summer when a group of state attorneys general announced the launch of a collaborative investigation. Utah is among the states participating in the expansive inquiry, and Attorney General Sean Reyes said at the time of the announcement it was time to determine whether the internet search giant has \"played by the rules and acted fairly.\"</p><p>\"The question for us today is whether Google has strayed from its founding principles to not do evil in its search and relentless drive to be the market-dominant player,\" Reyes said. \"That is what our investigation together, bipartisan, jointly will uncover.\"</p><p>Numerous outlets have reported in recent weeks that the Justice Department and the group of state attorneys general were close to launching formal actions focused on Google. A virtual meeting on June 26 between DOJ officials and representatives of the state group was purported to have been an opportunity to discuss legal strategy as well as determining whether the two concurrent investigations would emerge in a single legal effort or move forward as separate suits, as was the case in the benchmark Microsoft antitrust action.</p><p>Google's response to the announcement of the investigation last September mirrored, in many ways, the tack taken by Gates when his company was under federal scrutiny.</p><p>\"Google's services help people, create more choice, and support thousands of jobs and small businesses across the United States,\" wrote Kent Walker, Google senior vice president of global affairs. \"Google is one of America's top spenders on research and development, making investments that spur innovation: Things that were science fiction a few years ago are now free for everyone - translating any language instantaneously, learning about objects by pointing your phone, getting an answer to pretty much any question you might have.</p><p>\"At the same time, it's of course right that governments should have oversight to ensure that all successful companies, including ours, are complying with the law.\"</p><p>In a Deseret News interview Tuesday, Reyes' deputy and antitrust specialist David Sonnenreich\u00a0said the investigation is at a point where there is little he can say about its status, but he did confirm that the work is ongoing and his office remains very involved in the effort.</p><p>Sonnenreich noted that the law enforcement investigation of Big Tech in which the Utah Attorney General's Office is participating is in a markedly different lane than the work federal lawmakers are engaging. While Congress, through its inquiries, is grappling with whether current antitrust law, which has gone essentially unchanged for a century, is sufficient to address issues raised by the evolving realm of high technology, the Justice Department and state attorneys general are focused on identifying what, if any, illegal conduct has occurred under the current rules.</p><p>Watch today's virtual hearing live via the House Judiciary Committee's website, judiciary.house.gov/calendar/eventsingle.aspx?Event ID=3113.</p><p>email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:araymond@deseretnews.com\">araymond@deseretnews.com</email></p><p>Follow the leader</p><p>Stay in the loop on Jazz hoops with Utah Jazz beat writer Sarah Todd on Twitter @NBASarah</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DESNWS-51860299</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DESNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G2-D971-DY6J-M183-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">164282</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1263\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Deseret News Publishing Co.</copyright><publicationName>Deseret Morning News (Salt Lake City)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000299K</classCode><className>GENERAL ELECTRIC CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

'It bears emphasizing that other senior executives now run the businesses that are the actual subject of the Committee's investigation.'Jason del Rey from Vox noted[5]:The House Judiciary Committee is investigating Amazon, along with Apple, Facebook, and Google, because of the unprecedented power they wield over the way Americans shop, search, and communicate online. </p><p>Bezos's willingness to testify is an acknowledgment of the seriousness of the probe, which could result in lawmakers recommending legal action from federal regulators or an overhaul of antitrust laws to rein in Big Tech.

While Bezos's comments were about his US business, similar concerns have been raised in India by third-party sellers and smaller offline traders. In fact, the Indian government has asked online retailers not to indulge in anti-competitive practices and recently mentioned 'inclusive' growth in its draft e-commerce policy, indicating offline traders should not get hit by the growth of e-commerce. </p><p>\"We have a policy against using seller-specific data to aid our private label business. But I can't guarantee you that policy has never been violated,\" Bezos, the richest man in the world, said. He was speaking during the US Congress hearing on 'Big Tech' and anti-competition, where the CEOs of Google, Facebook and Apple also testified. According to Bezos, the company is investigating the matter, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.In India too, e-commerce players have been pushing their private labels, which sellers and industry executives say are often made cheaper than other brands. This makes it harder for independent sellers to compete with those prices. Overall, in-house labels' contribution to total sales ranges from high single digits to early double digits. For example, Amazon India's in-house labels include Solimo, Symbol and Presto, while Flipkart's own brands are SmartBuy and MarQ. In India, there is additional competition from sellers backed by or closely working with e-commerce platforms, said Mohit Anand, an online seller. Entities like Cloudtail, Appario and TechConnect are some of the largest sellers on Amazon India and Walmart-owned Flipkart. Both these e-tailers maintain their policies are not biased against third-party sellers and don't favour their own brands.\"Rules are meant only for sellers, while the platforms exploit those rules for anti-competitive practices. Reforms are the need of the hour in our industry, and we can't keep depending on self-regulation. Amazon India, as well as Flipkart, are openly indulging in wilful and systemic exploitation of sellers selling on the platform. Our government has remained silent on this issue,\" said a spokesperson of Aiova, a group of small sellers.\"Sellers are forced with no option, as someone said during the hearing (in the US). In India, we don't have any other option apart from selling to the 'alpha-sellers', or preferred sellers, who move most e-commerce orders,\" added Anand.

(YouTube screenshot)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A global backlash against facial recognition technologies due to the bias found to be intrinsic in some of the tools has prompted one of Israel's leading startups in the field to warn against a wholesale rejection of the field.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Adam Devine, chief marketing officer at Israel's controversial AnyVision, a global leader in visual intelligence technology, said governments should allow only specialized providers \u2014 who know how to protect privacy and prevent bias \u2014 to sell facial recognition software. Nor should they be sold to organizations that are not going to use them correctly, he said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But \"don't throw the baby out with the bathwater,\" he urged.</p><p>AnyVision was recently accused by media of providing the Israel Defense Forces with tools for mass surveillance in the Palestinian territories. Microsoft in March divested its holdings in AnyVision, even though the tech giant said it couldn't substantiate claims that the startup's technology was used unethically after it hired a team of lawyers headed by former US attorney general Eric Holder looked into the matter.</p><p>Facial recognition technology as a whole has come under fire by civil liberties activists who say the tools are biased against people of color and infringe upon citizens' privacy. The technology, which uses visual images to help computers identify people is in wide use, from unlocking phones to picking out a suspect's face at borders or mass gatherings. Since increased use of the technology could help keep crime and terror in check, a global debate is now raging regarding the pros and cons of this technology.</p><p>A man yells at police as demonstrators protest in support of the Black Lives Matter movement in Washington, DC, on June 23, 2020. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)</p><p>On June 25, Boston became the second-largest city in the world after San Francisco to ban the use of facial recognition technology by police and city agencies, based on the idea that the technology is inaccurate when it comes to people of color.</p><p>Unable to tell Black people apart</p><p>Robert Williams, a Black man living in a suburb of Detroit, was arrested earlier this year at his home, in front of his wife and two young daughters, and locked up for nearly 30 hours. Facial recognition technology used by Michigan State Police had mistaken him for another Black man, because the tech used by the force is unable to tell Black people apart.</p><p>The only thing Williams had in common with the suspect caught by the surveillance camera of a watch shop was that they are both large-framed Black men, said the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The organization last month called for lawmakers \"to stop law enforcement use of face recognition technology.\"</p><p>Williams's story comes as tech firms in the US, including IBM, Amazon and Microsoft, were planning to pause or end sales of their facial recognition technology to police in the US. Amazon on June 10 announced a one-year pause on allowing law enforcement to use its Rekognition platform, two days after IBM said it would no longer offer its general-purpose facial recognition or analysis software, out of potential human rights, bias and privacy concerns.</p><p>Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO, speaks at The Economic Club of Washington's Milestone Celebration in Washington, on September 13, 2018 (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)</p><p>\"We've advocated that governments should put in place stronger regulations to govern the ethical use of facial recognition technology, and in recent days, Congress appears ready to take on this challenge,\" Amazon said in a statement. \"We hope this one-year moratorium might give Congress enough time to implement appropriate rules, and we stand ready to help if requested.\"</p><p>The ACLU said the stand taken by these firms comes years after activists started to sound warnings about the technology.</p><p>\"For years, racial justice and civil rights advocates had been warning that this technology in law enforcement hands would be the end of privacy as we know it,\" ACLU director Kade Crockford wrote in a blog post on June 16, after the tech firms made their announcements. \"It would supercharge police abuses, and it would be used to harm and target Black and brown communities in particular.\"</p><p>\"But the companies ignored these warnings and refused to get out of this surveillance business. It wasn't until there was a national reckoning over anti-Black police violence and systemic racism, and these companies getting caught in activists' crosshairs for their role in perpetuating racism, that the tech giants conceded \u2014 even if only a little,\" Crockford wrote.</p><p>A 2018 MIT study that looked into three commercially released facial-analysis software products of major tech firms showed both a skin-type and gender bias. The software had an error rate of 0.8% in identifying the gender of light skinned men, as opposed to more than 34% for darker skinned women, for example.</p><p>A demonstrator waves an American flag with \"Black Lives Matter\" spray painted on it near the White House on June 19, 2020. (AP/Andrew Harnik)</p><p>AnyVision, a Holon, Israel-based startup founded in 2015 by Neil Robertson and Eylon Ethstein, uses artificial intelligence technology to recognize faces, bodies and objects for security, medical and business purposes, among others.</p><p>Its recognition technology software is used to \"authenticate legitimate users and customers; detect targets; track criminals and terrorists; and locate missing persons in a wide range of settings, including banks, educational institutions, correctional facilities, airports, casinos, businesses, and special events,\" according to the database of Start-Up Nation Central, which tracks the Israeli tech industry.</p><p>The firm had raised a total of $74 million from investors, including Microsoft's venture capital arm, Qualcomm Ventures; LightSpeed Venture Partners; Robert Bosch GmbH; and Eldridge Industries, according to Start-Up Nation Central.</p><p>Last year Israeli business newspaper The Marker reported that the IDF uses technology provided by AnyVision at West Bank checkpoints, and in cameras dotting the Palestinian Authority. The cameras and database were being used to identify and track potential Palestinian assailants, the report said. Then, in October, an MSNBC report queried why Microsoft was funding an Israeli firm that helps surveil West Bank Palestinians.</p><p>A Palestinian man uses a biometric gate as he crosses into Israel at the Qalandiya crossing in Jerusalem, on July 11, 2019. (Sebastian Scheiner/AP)</p><p>The report led Microsoft to probe the matter, and in March this year the US tech giant said it was pulling out of its investment in AnyVision, even though its own investigation couldn't substantiate claims that the startup's technology was being used unethically.</p><p>\"After careful consideration, Microsoft and AnyVision have agreed that it is in the best interest of both enterprises for Microsoft to divest its shareholding in AnyVision,\" said Microsoft in a statement.</p><p>Besides divesting from the firm, Microsoft also said it will stop making minority investments in companies that sell facial-recognition technology.</p><p>Microsoft also said the audit underscored the challenges of being a minority investor in a company selling sensitive technology, because it may not have enough oversight or control over how the technology is used.</p><p>Now, headlines in the US and globally have further raised the heat against these technologies.</p><p>Adam Devine, chief marketing officer at AnyVision (Courtesy)</p><p>AnyVision's Devine declined to comment on the Microsoft and AnyVision relationship beyond what the US tech giant said at the time of divestment. But he added that no other tech firm has pulled out from its investment in the Israeli startup and that \"sales have not been impacted by the Microsoft divestiture.\"</p><p>Interest in the company's products, which have netted sales worth \"many millions\" of dollars around the world, is up, he said, thanks to a \"desire to improve the safety of people and premises.\"</p><p>Customers use AnyVision's facial recognition technologies to open doors, for remote authentication and identification for a secure transaction and for security purposes, \"to identify known people on watch lists to prevent threats.\"</p><p>Shortly after the outbreak of the coronavirus, AnyVision installed thermal cameras at Sheba Medical Center in Ramat Gan, Israel's largest hospital, to let officials spot hospital staff with a fever.</p><p>The facial recognition software can reportedly identify \"in seconds\" anyone who came into contact with an infected staffer, and allows officials to determine precisely who should go into isolation.</p><p>The backlash against facial recognition companies \"is not affecting us in any in any material way right now, other than businesses and individuals are looking at our website,\" Devine said. \"We are probably getting more inbound interest as people really want to understand what facial recognition is actually about.\"</p><p>Forcing the conversation</p><p>Devine said the recent headlines about facial recognition technologies is forcing a long-overdue conversation and, he hoped, legislation.</p><p>\"It is good that this is happening\u2026 it will force organizations like the ACLU to really understand what good face recognition is and be able to differentiate it from bad facial recognition.\" In fact, it will force \"every player in the market to get educated,\" Devine said.</p><p>He added that a high-quality facial recognition product, like those of AnyVision or some of its peers, is created with built-in privacy controls and \"care around bias at its core,\" with algorithms trained to \"equally and accurately recognize every face, every gender and every orientation, without bias.\"</p><p>\"It is purely about education, like a child,\" Devine said. \"An algorithm is a blank slate. No person is born with bias; that bias is learned. In the same way, no algorithm is born with bias, it has to be trained in or trained out of the algorithm.\"</p><p>In other words, an algorithm's developers need to supply it with a wide enough range of training data.</p><p>An illustrative image of AI (artificial intelligence) and facial recognition technologies (KENGKAT; iStock by Getty Images)</p><p>The MIT study was looking at open-source algorithms that were \"poorly trained,\" he said, and that reflected poorly on the whole industry. Following the study, the public assumed that facial recognition was intrinsically biased. But that is an \"uneducated, flawed statement,\" he maintained.</p><p>The widespread concern today is that law enforcement officers are able to upload to open source platforms images of protesters and identify them so that they could be arrested.</p><p>There is a big difference between open source facial recognition technologies that are free for anyone to use, like those offered by some big tech firms, and those of specialized businesses like AnyVision, Devine said.</p><p>\"There is no way our software or other software like ours could ever be used for that purpose,\" Devine said. \"It is technically not possible, based on the way we sell it and based on privacy controls.\"</p><p>AnyVision's software, for example, identifies only specific people that are already on a criminal or wanted watchlist, he said, and it has controls that prevent users from adding faces to watchlists without permission.</p><p>An illustrative image of a surveillance camera with face recognition system (Scharfsinn86; iStock by Getty Images)</p><p>In addition, the software has automated bystander blurring, which ensures only the faces of people on watchlists are seen clearly.</p><p>Using AnyVision software, users cannot \"reverse engineer\" the identification of a person, by uploading a picture to find out who the person is, Devine said. And the software is engineered to \"eliminate bias\" with a core algorithm that was trained on the most diverse datasets in the most diverse, real-world environments, he said.</p><p>\"At the moment, we have no police customers in the US. I wish we did,\" said Devine. \"I would like for every police organization in the entire world to be using the kind of facial recognition that we produce.\"</p><p>Devine doesn't worry that facial recognition technology will be banned completely. \"Too much good has come for the safety of the world from safety recognition for it to be banned,\" he said. \"There may be a case where it is banned for certain cases, and I think that is fine.\"</p><p>There should, however, be legislation in place requiring firms developing the algorithms to make sure they are accurate and bias-free, and setting out the specific cases in which the technology can be used.</p><p>Regulatory vacuum</p><p>\"There is a regulatory vacuum\" regarding facial recognition technologies, said Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler, a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute who studies the impact of technology on democracy.</p><p>\"There are no rules, not even ethical ones for now,\" and the field is not regulated in any democratic country. \"This vacuum needs to be solved. The harm connected to facial recognition is wider and deeper than we thought at the beginning.\"</p><p>But banning facial recognition will only give countries like China an edge, she said. Western countries would be putting \"our head in the sand, if we don't develop them.\"</p><p>Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler, a research fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute. (Courtesy)</p><p>The right thing to do at the moment, she said, is to \"take an ethical pause,\" as suggested by Amazon, to div out how to solve the problems and set out criteria for going forward.</p><p>Strict regulations should limit what the technology can be used to look for, and it should never be allowed to infer additional private information about a person, such as a disease or a sexual leaning, Shwartz Altshuler said.</p><p>The algorithms also need to be \"transparent,\" Shwartz Altshuler added, with developers being open about what data they were trained on. This information may be difficult for the layman to understand, but professionals would be able to vet it. And there should always be the ability to have a human supervise the software's conclusions, on a case-by-case basis, she said.</p><p>comments View commentsHide comments 2020 The Times of Israel.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/34/159370663779.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/588/1673/34/159370663779.jpeg</url></p><p>Israeli startup AnyVision uses artificial intelligence to recognize faces, bodies and objects for security and other purposes.

But the enormous cash sums on the sidelines meant it actually started the week at higher levels.</p><p>But last night a number of broking houses started to point out to the investment community what a Biden presidency would mean to US markets.</p><p>They included Boston-based Christine Todd, who is head of US fixed income for Amundi, Europe's largest investment manager. Todd travelled to Australia last November to alert markets to what a Bernie Sanders presidency might look like (Biden was then a rank outsider for Democratic nomination).</p><p>This week Todd and Amundi put out a special bulletin showing that while Biden might be better for markets than Sanders, he would still dramatically reduce US share values, particularly when combined with the higher COVID-19 infection rates.</p><p>I will quote from the Amundi warning to explain what's ahead. Almost certainly our market will also be impacted if Biden stays ahead in the polls, even though the US polls are often wrong.</p><p>Trump has not led in a single major poll so far this year. No prior candidate for president has seen a lead this large at this point if the race. The slide in Trump's approval rating has been most noticeable among senior citizens.</p><p>But until the latest fall, the market was not pricing in risks associated with a potential Biden presidency and/or a Democratic sweep of congress.</p><p>Biden's agenda would have sweeping implications for every industry and sector of the economy, with significant investment fallout - particularly if Democrats control both houses. And Biden's tax plan would reduce after-tax corporate earnings considerably.</p><p>President Trump reduced the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 per cent. Biden's agenda lifts corporate taxes back to an effective tax rate of 26 per cent.</p><p>Todd and Amundi calculate that Biden's tax increase agenda would reduce the S&amp;P 500 earnings estimate for 2021 by roughly $US20 per share, from $US170 to $US150. As a rule of thumb, every percentage point change in the effective corporate tax rate should change S&amp;P 500 earnings by 1.2 per cent, or $US2 per share.</p><p>Todd's and Amundi's bulletin concentrated on corporate taxation but the Biden agenda also has a range of increased taxes for higher-income individual Americans, including a 12.4 per cent Social Security payroll tax on income earned above $US400,000, evenly split between employers and employees; an increase in the top individual income tax rate for taxable incomes above $US400,000 from 37 per cent to 39.6 per cent; taxing long-term capital gains and qualified dividends at the ordinary income tax rate of 39.6 per cent on income above $US1m and eliminating the so-called step-up basis for capital gains taxation.</p><p>In addition, Biden plans to cap the tax benefit of itemised deductions at 28 per cent of value, which means that taxpayers in the brackets with tax rates higher than 28 per cent will face limited itemised deductions.</p><p>The money raised by the higher corporate and individual taxes will be directed towards increased access to healthcare and support minority communities through a new affordable housing program. There will also be substantial investment in infrastructure.</p><p>A key part of the Trump administration has been the reduction in regulation. Biden will re-regulate many areas.</p><p>Todd and Amundi say a reversal in the reduction of regulations during the Trump administration may hurt financials, big tech, energy, healthcare and any labour-intensive business.</p><p>Longer term, larger industry incumbents with strong competitive positions can most easily absorb increased regulations and pass on increased costs. Past examples of this include tobacco, utilities, managed care and defence.</p><p>Todd and Amundi believe Biden may keep a tough stance on China, though with less harsh rhetoric than Trump.</p><p>Can Trump come back? It will not be easy. His two best chance is the fact that many middle-class blacks believe the race issue has been hijacked by lawless Americans and are nervous. More important, California's ban on independent contracting caused a huge swing to Republicans in a recent Californian equivalent of a by-election. Biden plans to embrace that agenda, which will cause huge disruption in the US small business community.</p><p>None of these matters is on the opinion polling agenda.</p><p>We are looking at a different America under Biden and one that will not be anywhere near as favourable to the sharemarket. It will also require some flexibility in Australian foreign affairs and defence policy. Meanwhile, if the Biden/COVID-19 US correction continues, Australian June 30 superannuation balances will be lower.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-c77a149eb66d11ea899a64b9c3b5ea700dd3345035be9b3b24331a1269c9d807</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6070-7FJ1-JD3N-52GG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"840\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 26, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DF5U</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNV7</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000340</classCode><className>COMPANY EARNINGS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001680</classCode><className>TAX INCREASES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

The instances circulated on social media yesterday just hours after the plan was posted by the campaign online. Biden campaign claiming simply a matter of some missing citations, but it was a similar allegation that helped sink Biden's 1998 presidential campaign.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">CNN's Arlette Saenz joins us live from Manchester, New Hampshire. Arlette, forgive me here, having lived through the '87, '88 campaign, this is a pretty amateur mistake for the frontrunner's campaign to take on a substantial policy rollout when they had to know when team Biden got together planning to announce his campaign, the one thing they cannot do is plagiarize.</p><p>ARLETTE SAENZ, CNN POLITICAL REPORTER: Well, John, this was certainly a glitch in their rollout. Biden had been talking about this climate change plan that was going to be coming for weeks now, and he was pushing back against criticism that he might take a middle ground approach to climate change. And in that plan that was released yesterday, Biden embraced parts of the Green New Deal which has become a litmus test for many of these 2020 Democratic candidates. He called the Green New Deal a crucial framework for combatting climate change and said that he aimed to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.</p><p>But then, they did run into a little bit of trouble when it came to the actual plan that was released itself when it was revealed that some passages in that plan bore similar language to proposals that had been put forth by progressive organizations either on their websites or in letters. And the Biden campaign said that as soon as they realized that some of these citations were missing that they were to quickly amend that in their plan.</p><p>But of course, to put a little context on this as you mentioned Biden's first presidential campaign back in the 1988 race was derailed by charges of plagiarism both on the campaign trail and also during his time in law school. So this is certainly something that they are going to have to be mindful of going forward especially as you look back at the former vice president's own personal history with this.</p><p>John?</p><p>KING: It's supposed to be a campaign A team. This was not an A performance. Arlette Saenz live for us in New Hampshire, appreciate it.</p><p>And just to Arlette's point as we come back (INAUDIBLE) I just going to read, this is Joe Biden in a New York Times story, we can show the front page of the New York Times first on this day September 18, 1987.</p><p>Mr. Biden said today as he did 22 years ago that he had misunderstood the rules of citation and footnoting. This is about him plagiarizing while in college. I was wrong, but I was not malevolent in any way. I did not intentionally move to mislead anybody and I didn't to this day. I didn't to this day issue. That's exactly what they're saying now.</p><p>I'm sorry when this is your issue -- when this has been an issue in the past, how? How? This is a staff issue. I'm sure the former vice president had probably nothing to do with this, but he's the leader of the organization. Hello?</p><p>KAROUN DEMIRJIAN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Also these days as opposed to the '80s or 22 years before that, they have software to do this. It's quite simple to just check everything just to be on the safe side and make sure if you don't trust drawing the eyeballs that you're not going to make this sort of public error because somebody's going to catch it. It shows a bit of lack of forethought I suppose is the polite way of saying it or, you know, I guess the worst case scenario is potentially a little bit too much arrogance that you can just do this and not having anybody looking at you.</p><p>KING: It's lazy or it's arrogant. And let me flip the thing, you would think he would be happy to quote progressive groups on his website. As they're attacking him, this is a great embrace.</p><p>OLIVIER KNOX, CHIEF WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, SIRIUSXM: It could've been a lot worse. What if he'd taken from a center-right think-tank instead of from progressive group?</p><p>KING: Well, let's move on. This is a -- I'll call this a style issue. This is a leadership issue. This is a competence issue.</p><p>He wants to be president of the United States. This is a leadership and competence issue, you can't do this stuff. You just can't. You do it in our business, you get fired.</p><p>And so, here's a policy issue that the former vice president has to deal with today. His campaign taking a bold stance in a Democratic primary, saying, that the vice president still supports the Hyde Amendment which bans the use of federal funding for family planning overseas including abortion counseling and abortion, any abortions overseas. The campaign says the vice president stands by that. That was his position as a United States senator. Within minutes of them confirming this, NBC news report it, the campaign has now confirmed it to CNN. Four of the candidates, Beto O'Rourke, Jay Inslee, Bernie Sanders, and Julian Castro, we can put up the tweets.</p><p>Beto O'Rourke, \"No matter your income or where you live, every woman should have access to healthcare including abortion.\" Jay Inslee, \"I voted against the Hyde Amendment in 1983, it was wrong men wrong now.\" Bernie Sanders, \"No middle ground on women's rights. Abortion is a constitutional right.\" Julian Castro says, \"The age of abortion is healthcare. Time to repeal the Hyde Amendment.\"</p><p>I'm going to note too these are four men. The women in the field have yet to weigh in. This is a risky policy position. He's the frontrunner, he thinks he can think about the general election where this would be safer ground, but we have debates in a couple of weeks. Welcome.</p><p>[12:35:03] LAURA BARRON- LOPEZ, NATIONAL POLITICAL REPORTER, POLITICO: Yes, and someone like Elizabeth Warren, even Gillibrand I think have already put out in their proposals that they support repealing the Hyde Amendment. This is a big piece of their larger plan to protect abortion rights after they've seen the onslaught in southern states to restrict. And so this has become a really big issue in the primary since those states started restricting because there has been among the Democratic primary this worry that now there is a chance that this will reach the Supreme Court and there will be a revisiting of Roe v. Wade.</p><p>KING: And as I mentioned, I mentioned the four men as we've been speaking. Kirsten Gillibrand, a senator from New York, another Democratic candidate has tweeted on this saying we must repeal the Hyde Amendment. So, we don't know who will be on the stage with Joe Biden. There's going to be two debates because there's 20 candidates, but we know there's going to be a fair amount of this.</p><p>KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Yes, and this speaks to the larger picture of what's happening right now. Quickly these Democratic candidates came out criticizing him for this. The president was quick to criticize him over the plagiarism charge, tweeting about it saying it was going to be a big problem for him. So you're saying that Joe Biden is under a microscope and every single move he makes is being criticized, not only by the president but by everyone who is hoping to beat him out to be the Democratic nominee. So when they make mistakes like this that about the plagiarism, you can just see that that is the question about why he is the frontrunner.</p><p>KING: Every frontrunner is tested. We shall see if he is up to the challenge.</p><p>Up next for us, Bernie Sanders, another top Democratic takes the fight for a higher minimum wage into the lion's den.</p><p>[12:40:51] KING: Bernie Sanders taking his fight against what he calls corporate greed directly to one of the biggest corporations in the world. Senator Sanders addressing Walmart's annual shareholders meeting this morning calling on the retail giant to give employees a bigger voice on its corporate board and to pay them a $15 minimum wage.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: The issue that we are dealing with today is pretty simple. Walmart is the largest private employer in America. And yet, despite the incredible wealth of its owner, Walmart pays many of its employees starvation wages. Frankly, the American people are sick and tired of subsidizing the greed of some of the largest and most profitable corporations in this country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: Now before Sanders spoke, Walmart preemptively defending itself on Twitter. Its Vice President of Corporate Affairs Dan Bartlett criticizing what he calls the senator's, quote, outdated view of Walmart, and pointing to the company's record on college education, workforce training, and cutting carbon emissions. Not long after Sanders spoke, the Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said he thought the minimum wage was, quote, lagging behind.</p><p>So it's a dispute between Senator Sanders and Walmart, but it's a bigger issue as Senator Sanders making the point there that the corporations are greedy and workers are getting the shaft. We're in this phase of the campaign where we're getting ready for the first debates. He's in second place, it's effective, right, for his message. There will be those who say no, but.</p><p>KNOX: Yes, it's effective and it helps him stand out in a field where a lot of the Democrats agree on the core premise of this message. Answer the question you asked on (INAUDIBLE) he was designated as a proxy by a shareholder. He himself does not appear that he actually directly owns any Walmart stock.</p><p>Walmart, unlike Target and Costco and Amazon, Walmart seems to be lagging a little behind some of those competitors in terms of increasing their worker wage. And so this gives them a great opportunity, a lot of theater, and helps them competing against people like Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>LOPEZ: Right. And raising minimum the wage is a big theme of Sanders' campaign. I mean, even in 2018 before he announced he also did this same aggressive tactic -- he used the same aggressive tactics with Disney and he went to California and organized with, you know, the hotel hospitality workers that worked for Disney and took them on and got that company also to directly respond to him in that argument there.</p><p>So it's -- as Olivier said it's important for him to do this because Warren has also been equally aggressive in taking on corporations especially big tech.</p><p>COLLINS: Yes. And I think with this new pattern we're seeing is where they're calling them out specifically by name, going in front of them like he is doing today. So that's something that we're going to see I think emerging as a trend in 2020. But also he's trying to contrast himself with people like Joe Biden who is going after those working-class voters, and so he's trying to distinguish himself from Joe Biden not only just Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>KING: And a lot of Democrats criticized candidate Trump when he did this in 2016 with automakers and other company. Now you see them, you mentioned, you know, Jay Inslee and several of the Democrats recently in front of McDonald's, a campaign of McDonald's workers, Elizabeth Warren you mentioned said I'm looking at you Amazon recently.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: But it's in a way, you know, Trump has set the tone for a lot of what politics is now and you can't ignore that we're in that new environment. And Trump was an excellent marketer. He is really good at making the things stick in people's brains and a really good way of doing that is by giving people some intangible on something very visual. And if you know it's a big specific company that everybody knows that it's just down the street potentially in terms of their storefront, and that's when that you can really, you know, remember and grab them.</p><p>LOPEZ: One quick difference though is that Trump will sometimes attack companies because he feels as though he's been slighted by them. Not necessarily as a means to get to a policy, but because I've been personally attacked so now I want to lash back out at that company.</p><p>KING: That's a good point.</p><p>Up next for us, speaking of President Trump, he's surrounded by allies on his trip today but on certain issues, the president very much alone.</p><p>[12:49:19] KING: President Trump mixing ceremony and controversy as he wraps up his final day in the United Kingdom today. The president now moved onto Ireland, you might saw at the top of the program, meeting with the Irish prime minister earlier this hour. This morning, the president and the first lady taking part in the D-Day commemorative event. Tomorrow marks 75 years since the large scale allied operation that led to the end of World War II. President Trump, his part in the ceremony, reading a prayer from President Franklin Eleanor Roosevelt.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: All mighty God, our sons, pride of our nation, this day have set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our republic, our religion, and our civilization and to set free a suffering humanity.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) [12:50:09] KING: That event championing the partnership between the allies that helped bring peace after years of war. Earlier today though in an interview, the president highlighted the vast chasm between his views and those of most of the world leaders who were with him today. And let's start with one of these issues. There was an interview with \"Good Morning Britain\" and Piers Morgan. Let's start with climate change.</p><p>The president has said things like this before, but my seven-year-old has a basic understanding of the difference between weather and climate. Here is the president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: I believe that there is a change in weather and I think it changes both ways. Don't forget, it used to be called global warming that wasn't working then it was called climate change. Now it's actually called extreme weather.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: The president sees a branding problem, not a global climate crisis.</p><p>BARRON-LOPEZ: Right. I mean, it still is global warming. The globe is warming. Scientists have a consensus on this and they're now really sounding the alarm saying that by 2050 the planet could face an essential crisis. So, I'm not sure why Trump is so fixated on the branding. Again, this is partially probably because he doesn't believe in climate change and has long called it a hoax.</p><p>KING: He doesn't want to do anything about it. Right.</p><p>BARRON-LOPEZ: And this could also end up being a political problem for Republicans down the line as Democrats have been trying to push it and make it a bigger issue.</p><p>KING: A big issue in the campaign especially among the Democrats now. We'll see how it plays once the Democrats have a nominee. And today he is standing around all the other leaders who are still the Paris climate accord who frankly thinks he is just lost on --</p><p>KNOX: One of the really interesting parts of this visit to the U.K. was when he and Theresa May did that press conference. And at the top of that press conference in their prepared statements, she basically recited all of the significant issues with which -- on which London and Washington disagree. She included the Paris climate accord, she mentioned the Iran nuclear deal. It was a very interesting moment for her to say -- I mean, maybe as she is heading for the exits to say, you know, we don't -- there's a lot on which we don't agree even though we're as close as we are.</p><p>KING: Right, she did it politely but she laid it out. Here's another thing, I'm going to read this because we don't have access to the entire interview on tape from the president's interview. Let me just read it and you make your judgment at home. Talking about Vietnam, of course, did not serve in the Vietnam War. He got deferments. Some have questioned the legitimacy of the health issue of bone spurs which he got the deferments. Here is the president.</p><p>\"Well, I was never a fan of that war. I'll be honest with you I thought it was a terrible war. I thought it was very far away. Nobody ever -- you know, you're talking about Vietnam. And at that time, nobody had ever heard of the country. They were saying what are we doing? So many people are dying. What is happening over there? So I was never a fan.\" I would not have minded serving at all, the president said. I would have been honored. I think I make up for it now.</p><p>That last part I suspect will not sit well with active servicemen, some of them, military veterans. But the fact nobody knew where it was. I remember sitting next to my dad growing up, eight, nine, 10- years-old, I remember kids in the neighborhood being drafted. Vietnam -- some of them coming home missing a limb. Vietnam was everything. Maybe (INAUDIBLE) where I didn't watch the evening news or something but what is that nobody knew what it was?</p><p>COLLINS: Yes, the idea that people didn't know where they were sending their fathers, brothers, uncles, whoever to go to this war is not really believable. But also the president is saying he was asked if he would have minded serving in another war because he's essentially saying he didn't believe in Vietnam. And he says that he thinks he is making up for not serving in the military by increasing defense spending as the president. And that is a comment that generated a lot of eyeballs today.</p><p>DEMIRJIAN: I think it shows that it's a fairly (INAUDIBLE) response that doesn't take into account the seriousness of the protest movement as he was summarizing it there, and does not take account the gravity of the service for those who did serve in the Vietnam War even if they didn't agree with it. So it's just generally a little bit of a tone- deaf sort of presentation of a pretty major chapter of American history that you think the president would be more familiar with and more sensitive in describing.</p><p>KING: Let me sneak in one more. After the horrible shooting at Virginia Beach the other day the president was asked a question about silencers and said this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: Nobody has talked about silencers very much. They did talk about the bump stock and we had it banned. And we're looking at that. I am going to, you know, seriously look at it. I don't love the idea of it. I don't like the idea -- what's happening is crazy.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KING: After Parkland he talked a lot about gun control then he backed off pressure from the NRA and some of his aides. Any indication he's doing anything here? KNOX: No. We're looking at it as Trump speak for I want to get out of this question right now, and I want to diffuse this issue in the short term. It's not usually an indication that they're actually looking at a real serious policy process to try to determine a policy outcome.</p><p>KING: Wish we had more time for that but we don't.</p><p>Up next, new poll numbers from the Rust Belt, the new reasons for the president to be a little worried.</p><p>[12:59:20] KING: Before we go, some new poll numbers out of a key 2020 battleground state. You might remember President Trump won Michigan 16 electoral votes by a razor-thin two-tenths of a percent back in 2016. But, if the election were today in Michigan, a Detroit News Glengariff Group poll out this morning finds the Democrats winning big time in some cases. Joe Biden with 53 percent to 41 percent for the president, a 12-point lead. Identical numbers there for Bernie Sanders. Pete Buttigieg with a six-point lead over the president. Elizabeth Warren, a four-point lead and a three-point lead for Kamala Harris.</p><p>It is early but if you're going to watch one state in the 2020 math, watch Michigan. It's got to be interesting.</p><p>Thanks for joining us today in the INSIDE POLITICS. See you back here this time tomorrow. Busy news day, stay with us. Brianna Keilar starts right now. Have a great afternoon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2019060502CNV15</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8N-T9M1-JB20-G1FX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3296\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 5, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002LAF</classCode><className>WAL-MART STORES INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS452311 WAREHOUSE CLUBS &amp;

President Donald Trump has shown more interest in politically driven attacks than serious policy work, they said.</p><p>Expect Biden to pursue threshold limits for transactions, as floated by Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said American Enterprise Institute visiting scholar Mark Jamison. Under Biden, Klobuchar and Warren would likely be some of the most influential members of Congress if they don't land jobs within the administration, said International Center for Law &amp; Economics Competition Policy Director Sam Bowman.</p><p>Trump hasn't done a lot of substantive work on tech issues like privacy and antitrust, said Utah State University senior research fellow Will Rinehart. He agreed Democrats will be interested in adjusting antitrust thresholds. A Democratic presidential victory could mean a lot of momentum for flipping the Senate, and a unified government could pass substantial changes to competition law, he argued: It hasn't been a huge item for Biden, but it has been a major priority for Democrats on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Trump targets tech companies when they behave in ways he finds \"personally inconvenient or objectionable,\" said Cato Institute senior fellow Julian Sanchez. Either administration is likely to pursue additional regulation but with different approaches, he said: Republicans have a widespread belief that platforms are biased against conservatives and a modification to Communications Decency Act Section 230 is warranted. Democrats have a desire for more aggressive moderation to crack down on harmful content, he argued.</p><p>Republicans seem to think Big Tech is against them, and Democrats are worried about concentration of power, said Technology Policy Institute President Scott Wallsten. Privacy is more of an issue for Democrats than Republicans, but the GOP is increasingly concerned about a state privacy patchwork, he added. There's growing demand on the right for federal legislation, with states setting the tone, said Sanchez. A Biden administration could mean the U.S. is more likely to pursue privacy regulation resembling the EU's general data protection regulation, said Jamison: Both parties seem to be interested in federal privacy, but they differ on specifics.</p><p>Trump's antitrust objectives have clearly been motivated by political ends, said Bowman. Any antitrust case against Google before the election could be seen as politically advantageous for the Trump administration, he said. It's unlikely a Biden administration would drop an antitrust case against Google, given criticism from the left, but it won't be a major priority because Biden hasn't given Big Tech the same focus as Trump, he said.</p><p>Biden said in January that Section 230 should be \"revoked.\" The Democratic nominee also said breaking up Big Tech companies like Facebook deserves a \"hard look.\" On privacy, he said the U.S. should consider \"standards not unlike the Europeans.\" His running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., expressed interest in addressing issues of algorithmic bias and racial discrimination. Policy experts agreed that would be an area of focus under Biden. Neither of the campaigns commented Wednesday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONSED-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONSED2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VB-3N71-DYRJ-1040-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">274795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"553\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Consumer Electronics Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001RFI</classCode><className>AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>UTAH STATE UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>CATO INSTITUTE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC8733 NONCOMMERCIAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

President Donald Trump has shown more interest in politically driven attacks than serious policy work, they said.</p><p>Expect Biden to pursue threshold limits for transactions, as floated by Sens. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said American Enterprise Institute visiting scholar Mark Jamison. Under Biden, Klobuchar and Warren would likely be some of the most influential members of Congress if they don't land jobs within the administration, said International Center for Law &amp; Economics Competition Policy Director Sam Bowman.</p><p>Trump hasn't done a lot of substantive work on tech issues like privacy and antitrust, said Utah State University senior research fellow Will Rinehart. He agreed Democrats will be interested in adjusting antitrust thresholds. A Democratic presidential victory could mean a lot of momentum for flipping the Senate, and a unified government could pass substantial changes to competition law, he argued: It hasn't been a huge item for Biden, but it has been a major priority for Democrats on Capitol Hill.</p><p>Trump targets tech companies when they behave in ways he finds \"personally inconvenient or objectionable,\" said Cato Institute senior fellow Julian Sanchez. Either administration is likely to pursue additional regulation but with different approaches, he said: Republicans have a widespread belief that platforms are biased against conservatives and a modification to Communications Decency Act Section 230 is warranted. Democrats have a desire for more aggressive moderation to crack down on harmful content, he argued.</p><p>Republicans seem to think Big Tech is against them, and Democrats are worried about concentration of power, said Technology Policy Institute President Scott Wallsten. Privacy is more of an issue for Democrats than Republicans, but the GOP is increasingly concerned about a state privacy patchwork, he added. There's growing demand on the right for federal legislation, with states setting the tone, said Sanchez. A Biden administration could mean the U.S. is more likely to pursue privacy regulation resembling the EU's general data protection regulation, said Jamison: Both parties seem to be interested in federal privacy, but they differ on specifics.</p><p>Trump's antitrust objectives have clearly been motivated by political ends, said Bowman. Any antitrust case against Google before the election could be seen as politically advantageous for the Trump administration, he said. It's unlikely a Biden administration would drop an antitrust case against Google, given criticism from the left, but it won't be a major priority because Biden hasn't given Big Tech the same focus as Trump, he said.</p><p>Biden said in January that Section 230 should be \"revoked.\" The Democratic nominee also said breaking up Big Tech companies like Facebook deserves a \"hard look.\" On privacy, he said the U.S. should consider \"standards not unlike the Europeans.\" His running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., expressed interest in addressing issues of algorithmic bias and racial discrimination. Policy experts agreed that would be an area of focus under Biden. Neither of the campaigns commented Wednesday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60VB-3N71-DYRJ-002X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"553\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Contrary to popular opinion, this is not the messiest environment for a US general election (they\u2019ve had them during the civil war, the Spanish Flu and the Great Depression) but it ranks high!   In SA, we\u2019re at risk of getting polarised coverage of those elections. Before 1994, The Republicans got the one-sided media coverage by mainstream South African media; after 1994 our mainstream local media has tended to heavily favour Democrats.   .lm-item-bottom,.lm-item-desc,.lm-item-link,.lm-item-top{text-align:center;border-radius: 2px;}.lm-underline{position:relative}.lm-underline:after{position:absolute;content:' ';right:5%;left:5%;bottom:0;height:1px;background-image:linear-gradient(90deg,transparent,#fff,transparent)}.lm-item-1 .lm-item-bottom,.lm-item-1 .lm-item-top{background-color:#212e52}.lm-item{vertical-align:top;float:left;display:inline-block;position:relative;cursor:default}.lm-item:after,.lm-item:before{z-index:-1;content:' ';position:absolute;left:10px;top:80%;bottom:18px;right:10px;-webkit-transform-origin:bottom center;transform-origin:bottom center}.lm-item:after{-webkit-transform:rotate(6deg) translate3d(15px,0,0);transform:rotate(6deg) translate3d(15px,0,0)}.lm-item:before{-webkit-transform:rotate(-6deg) translate3d(-15px,0,0);transform:rotate(-6deg) translate3d(-15px,0,0)}.lm-item-top{padding-top:15px}.template-1 .lm-item-top{border-top-left-radius:7px;border-top-right-radius:7px}.lm-item-title{color:#fff;font-size:1.5em}.lm-item-price{background:rgba(255,255,255,.05);margin-top:15px;font-size:35px;line-height:30px;padding:15px 10px 10px;color:#fff;font-weight:700}.lm-item-price i{font-size:15px}.lm-item-price .small-pre{font-size:10px;position:relative;top:-16px;right:-5px}.lm-item-body{padding:15px 0 0;background:#fff;border:1px solid #ebebeb}.lm-item-desc{height:auto;font-size:14px;padding:0 10px}.lm-item-desc strong{color:#868686}.lm-item-desc p{color:#868686;margin:0}.lm-item-link a{text-decoration:none}.lm-item-bottom{border-bottom-left-radius:7px;border-bottom-right-radius:7px;padding:15px 5px;color:rgba(255,255,255,.7);font-weight:100;min-height:20px}.lm-item-bottom span{color:#fff;font-weight:400;margin-right:3px;-webkit-transform:skewX(-10deg);transform:skewX(-10deg);display:inline-block}#insider-gold-col ul .inner,#insider-gold-col ul li a.toggle:hover{color:#259990}.lm-item-link a.moreinfo{font-size:16px;line-height:35px;padding:3px 20px 0;border-color:#39bdb4;color:#39bdb4;background-color:#fff}.lm-item-link a.moreinfo:hover{background-color:#fff;color:#259990;border-color:#259990}.template-2 a.mny-button.style-4{top:-5px;position:relative}.lm-item-desc-short{text-align:center;height:auto;font-size:14px;padding:10px 15px}.lm-item-desc-short p{color:#8995b4;margin:10px 0 0 0}        INSIDER GOLD    Subscribe for full access to all our share and unit trust data tools, our award-winning articles, and support quality journalism in the process.

Our own new democracy was born in an environment of ultimately (relatively) bloodless na\u00efve optimism. In the US, it was born after a savage revolutionary war (eight years of pitched battles) with a group of primary protagonists who were all dodgy, knew each other as all dodgy and (most importantly) treated each other as dodgy. They designed a framework based on a degree of healthy mutual scepticism.  The result is a framework that is more complicated than our own, and ultimately more robust.   The US is a Federation of States and therefore its election is not a \u201cnational\u201d election, it\u2019s a series of \u201cstate\u201d elections. The presidential winner is determined by the electoral college, rather than the national popular vote. Each state has as many \u201celectors\u201d in the Electoral College as it has Representatives and Senators in the United States Congress, and the District of Columbia (Washington) has three electors. Each state gets 2 senators, and then seats in the House of Representatives are split up for population size prorate (approximately 1:710 000). Thus small population states enjoy extra clout in the electoral colleges. Just to be sure so the maths is very clear: 435 electoral college votes per House + 2\u00d750 votes per senate seat + 3 for Washington = 538 across all states. You need 270 electoral college votes to win. The winner of the popular vote in a state receives all of its electoral college votes (except Maine and Nebraska). This means that polls and popularity ratings are imperfect indicators for election forecasting. This was brought into sharp relief in the 2016 election when Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 2.9million. This was because she enjoyed good turnouts in populous states like California, Illinois and NewYork, but lost traditionally Democrat rustbelt states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Also 3rd party candidates took 5% of the poll.   How will policy change under a Biden presidency or a re-elected Trump, and will Covid-19 affect the outcome? While the election is substantially a referendum on Trump\u2019s presidency, there are other permutations such as control of the House of Representatives and Senate. The House reflects the population prorate, while the Senate is equal weighted by states (each state elects 2 senators). Congressmen serve two-year terms, while senators serve six years. (Simplistically, the House initiates legislation while Senate vets it). These permutations affect a president\u2019s scope to manoeuvre. Of course, by infecting Trump the impact of Covid just got a bit personal \u2013 more on that further down.   So what are the main battlefield issues?   Protecting the economy and engineering a recovery: Trump will focus on growth and continuing prior policy strategies; Biden will focus on redirecting growth.  Taxes: Trump will push for fresh tax cuts, including for corporates and probably payroll or personal income tax cuts. Biden will push for selectively raising corporate tax revenues and raising taxes on upper-income individuals.   De-regulation: Biden favours re-instating various regulations reduced under Trump.  Federal budget: Both parties want fiscal stimulus to boost growth, but pressure to cut the deficit will rise as the economy recovers.  Social Justice and Security: Will be addressed by both sides through fiscal policy.  Sectoral Issues (as relates to stock markets and other markets):  Energy: Trump is pro-fossil fuels; Biden favours alternatives. (Energy is 2% of S&amp;P500).  \u2022 Health care: Biden favours expanded public role; Republicans propose to scale back Obamacare. Healthcare is 18% of GDP and 14% of S&amp;P500.  Finance: Biden favors re-instating various regulations eliminated or eased under Trump.  Big-Tech: while Biden favours data-use restrictions and possible break-ups, the difference between the candidates in this key market sector are not significant. Tech is &gt;30% of the market and also subject to definition e.g. is Amazon Tech/retailer/both?   Trade: Both parties favour tariffs and other restrictions and using trade as a geopolitical tool. Trump may further limit investment in China (including portfolio).    Simplistically then the battlefield is Tax, Health and International Relations. Many market observer\u2019s would be tempted to blame Trump over the Sino-US trade war, in reality Hillary Clinton was also pro-trade war. In some ways the Chinese could well prefer a Republican win since Democrats are more likely to make an issue of human rights and enlist the help of allies. Then again, the Democrats may be more diplomatic in their conduct of a dispute.   So who is the likelier winner?    Since 1900, only 5 of 15 incumbents lost re-election bids (favours Trump). Smaller, rural states have a larger share of electoral college votes than population (favours Trump). Economic performance matters enormously, Trump\u2019s advantage in this regard has faded due to Covid, so how the re-opening proceeds will be important. His abrasive and blustery manner has not been an asset to presidential popularity \u2013 Trump has a low overall and swing-state approval rating. That said, Trump\u2019s base is narrow but solid and likely to  turn out; turnout is less certain for the Democrats, but their pool wider. Kamala Harris for vice-president reflects a choice to widen that turnout. Swing voters are key.   Covid is a wildcard; re-opening can spur resurgences, either through potential \u201csecond waves\u201d next winter or rolling breakouts. It also threw in wildcard value by infecting Trump. Could it also cause further unsettlement by infecting either Biden, Mike Pence or Kamala Harris?   The electoral college structure means that there are marginal (\u201cswing\u201d) vote areas that matter disproportionately. These are Florida (29 electoral votes), Pennsylvania (20), Ohio (18), Michigan (16), North Carolina (15), Arizona (11) and Wisconsin (10).   Florida is always important, but Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin may again determine the result. Polls in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin by Real Clear Politics (polls) and Predictit Markets both indicate a firm lead to Biden. According to 270towin.com the Democrats have 188 safe seats and the Republicans have 88 safe seats. The Republicans must win all the toss-up states to win (which feat Trump achieved in 2016).   The following graph was published by Blackrock in an investment note using data from polling site FiveThirtyEight.com:   Sources: BlackRock Investment Institute, with data from FiveThirtyEight, September 2020.    Notes: Orange = advantage of Biden over Trump in national polls. The yellow line shows Biden\u2019s average advantage in six decisive states: Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.   The first presidential debate took place on 29th Sept, and thereafter the next ones are scheduled for the 15th and 22nd October. The UK Times summed up the debate (debacle?) best in my view; \u201clast night was not a debate in any meaningful sense \u2013 it was an ill-tempered and at times incomprehensible squabble between two angry septuagenarians who palpably loathe each other\u201d. Perhaps Biden was a slight winner in being able to come through in a pit fight.   Of course, Trumps Covid wildcard means that the vice-presidential debate happening next week could assume an unusual degree of importance, both for Mike Pence as prospective acting President and for Kamala Harris as heir presumptive to a relatively elderly candidate.   In the contest for the House, it\u2019s already all over bar the shouting for the Democrats; betting odds reflect 1:6 odds for a Dem win, and 7:2 for a Republican win. The Senate is currently held 53-47 by Republicans and there are 35 seats (currently 23-R and 12-D) up for grabs. The betting markets are even odds on Republicans &lt; 50 seats.   Betting markets are smart, but certainly not perfect, as both Brexit and Trump 2016 sharply reminded us. Until September 30, Trump took 55% of bets vs 40% for Biden in the last two weeks on my preferred political betting site (the other 5% of the market is made up of outlier candidates) \u2013 a pattern for a wildcard win. After the debate debacle, these odds flipped exactly in Bidens favour, and Trumps Covid case extended the trend. The key takeaway from these insights is that while those national polls show Biden with big margins; the race (per that Blackrock chart) is much tighter where it counts (in the swing states).   So what is the relative difference between Trump and Biden as far as investment markets are concerned? Markets prefer predictability and continuity (i.e. incumbents) and Trump\u2019s policies of corporate and personal tax cuts and de-regulation are market-friendly. Yet Trump can be disruptive and unpredictable, and often reactive rather than strategic. Biden represents change and is less conventionally market-friendly than Trump but may also be viewed as more predictable, and more inclined to fiscal stimulus to support the economy.   Biden is being marketed as a moderate and \u201csafe pair of hands\u201d. He will be less sensitive than Trump to stock markets, but he is a moderate career politician who will not risk the economy. Taxes will go up to satisfy the party and because of longer-term budget considerations. His initial emphasis will be Covid and supporting economic recovery. Thereafter he may seek to repair relations with traditional allies and organisations and reinforce ObamaCare. It is certainly possible that a Biden win would be more positive for  international markets.   Could Trump be aggressive on domestic and foreign policy if he wins, or will be more moderate without another election to win? Aggressive policies could include trying to force trade spats with China, Europe, Japan to conclusion, more isolationism and further curtailing of ObamaCare and drug price regulation. His more moderate policies could include an infrastructure program and tax cuts focused on lower- and middle-income groups.   Of course the political power cocktail must needs consider Congress. A split government is often considered positive for markets, which likes \u201cconstrained\u201d government activity. A sweep (Presidency, House, Senate) by the Democrats could bring forceful change in macro and sector policies, while a Republican sweep would bring aggressive extension of current policies.   The historic outcomes on the market are actually slightly in favour of Dem presidents over Republican, equivalent in the case of clean sweeps either way, slightly favourable to a Republican congress and generally unfavourable to a \u201csplit\u201d Congress (i.e. House and Senate under different leadership).   Capital markets would probably prefer a Trump victory, especially if Democrats retain the House. Markets can live with Biden, but may be nervous about a Dem sweep. All things considered this doesn\u2019t look like an election in which a clear result would significantly affect the markets. Indeed, the result for markets to truly fear is \u201cno result\u201d. Markets did not enjoy the last significant electoral stand-off experienced in Florida in 2000 over voting machines and markets are potentially more fragile this time (notwithstanding the cocktail of monetary opiates that have supercharged markets during the Covid crisis). Make no mistake, \u201cno result\u201d is dangerous to markets.   My favourite betting market may be suggesting a quick result on its odds. The results date betting has 03rd Nov at 4:1, 4th Nov at 5:4, 5-8th Nov at 7:2 and 9th + Nov at 27:10 BUT the latter 2 date groupings comprise 85% of bets in this category. Bottom line: there is definite surprise possibility in \u201cno result\u201d. Still \u2013 I\u2019ve seen several fund managers referring to the \u201cno result\u201d possibility, which suggests that perhaps it is beginning to feature in the overall market price picture. However, as the Covid crash in March reminded us \u2013 \u201chalfbaked\u201d and \u201cfully cooked\u201d are not the same thing for equity prices!!   The spectre of \u201cno result\u201d has gained traction through the issue of mail voting. As outsiders, we might consider the practice strange. Nevertheless the howls of outrage from Trump seem disingenuous when you consider the following notes from October 2017 we found on the US election Assessment Commission website:   The % of voters who cast their ballots on a voting machine at a polling place on Election Day has declined steadily over the past decade, while the number of states offering early voting, no-excuse absentee voting, and vote by mail has increased.  The total number of voters who voted early, absentee or by mail more than doubled from 24.9 million in 2004 to 57.2 million in 2016; an increase from 1/5 to 2/5 of all ballots cast.  The number of U.S. citizens voting early more than doubled from nearly 10.2 million early ballots cast in 2004 to 24.1 million early ballots cast in 2016.  In 2016, 16 states showed a combined percentage of greater than 50% of votes cast early, by mail, or via absentee voting.    The change over time in mail voting is reflected in the following graphic from EAC.gov:      If Trump was that concerned about the threat to democracy from postal voting, he has had plenty of time to raise and address the matter.   We would be remiss in not considering the implications of Trumps Covid case. Clearly it restricts his ability to physically campaign. His party will have to go into overdrive to compensate. His offset will have to be ferocious campaigning online \u2013 and he will only be truly effective in that domain if he proves to be asymptomatic. It certainly does mean that there will be more focus on the Vice-Presidential candidates. We should also note the possibility of a Boris Johnson style sympathy effect \u2013 his popularity went up after he got sick from it \u2013 even though he had initially advocated a herd immunity stance to the pandemic. Note that the Boris Johnson pre and post Covid was not the same Prime Minister, his stance on heath certainly softened. So while a knee jerk response might be that this just improved odds for the Democrats and reduced the risk of a \u201cno result\u201d deadlock, nothing should be taken for granted!   On the face of it, like an apprentice that has run out of excuses, Trump looks set to be told \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d   However this election is probably not over until either the Supreme Court or Congress and all State Governors stamp it!

He offered a mild critique of Amazon\u2019s sweeping transformation of global commerce\u2014a stark contrast with anti-corporate crusaders like Sen. Bernie Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren.</p><p>\u201cSeriously, think of the change that is taking place and why people are frightened. Nothing bad \u2014 you\u2019ve done good things. But 200,000 salespeople are out of work because people are shopping online now,\u201d Biden said, according to reporting from The Seattle Times. The publication described the former vice president\u2019s tone as \u201cmore pleading than scolding.\u201d</p><p>Biden later moved on to more comfortable topics under the roof of Amazon, revisiting his own credentials and again making the argument that Republicans, out from under Trump\u2019s thrall if Democrats win in 2020, would be more likely to cooperate on bipartisan efforts.</p><p>Zapolsky, his host, served as Amazon counsel for 20 years, steering Amazon through various regulatory hurdles and navigating the legal intricacies of the nearly trillion dollar company\u2019s notoriously thorny labor and employment practices.

David Cicilline, a major tech critic and chair of the House antitrust subcommittee, two months before Amazon appeared before the committee as part of a House antitrust probe into big tech companies.</p><p>While Warren has made taking Big Tech down a notch a cornerstone of her campaign, Sanders also has a long history of Amazon-specific ire. Last year, Sanders invited Amazon workers to share their experiences working for the company, criticizing one of \u201cthe wealthiest corporations in the world\u201d for low wages and unjust labor practices. He even introduced legislation to tax corporations for the federal assistance their low-wage workers seek to make ends meet, a bill he named the \u201cStop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies\u201d (BEZOS) act in a pointed dig at Amazon\u2019s chief executive\u2014the second richest man in the world.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYBST-2315353132</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYBST2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJ4-0031-DY0W-40XV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464369</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"396\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Newsweek/Daily Beast Company LLC</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Beast</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 18, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Seattle Times</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Sanders, Bernard</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Biden, Joseph R Jr</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Warren, Elizabeth</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Political campaigns</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Antitrust</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>TitleKeyword: Joe Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>TitleKeyword: Amazon</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>TitleKeyword: 2020 Election</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>TitleKeyword: 2020 Contenders</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 511110</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000769</classCode><className>FUNDRAISING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001371</classCode><className>HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001342</classCode><className>POLITICAL CANDIDATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp;

Regulators must also address the unfair competition of tech giants that profit from media\u2019s content without investing back into journalism or abiding by advertising regulations that apply to traditional media. The next president should also work to restore net-neutrality protections to ensure a level playing field on the internet, and regulate the internet as an essential public utility.</p><p>Biden is saying good things so far. He favors net neutrality regulations created during the Obama era. His campaign pledges to use antitrust enforcement and other tools to hold big-tech companies accountable, although he\u2019s decidedly more moderate on this front than Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who wants to break up companies.</p><p>In his foreign policy plan, Biden pledges to restore daily press briefings at the White House and departments of State and Defense. \u201cOur foreign policy relies on the informed consent of the American public,\u201d it states. The same goes for domestic policy.</p><p>Although Biden\u2019s Obama administration service is generally a selling point, that administration disappointingly did some things to undermine the press and the public\u2019s ability to learn about government misconduct. It spied on reporters, seized records from The Associated Press and prosecuted more people for leaking information to the public than all previous administrations combined.</p><p>Biden should clarify how his commitment to transparency has evolved. Perhaps, after journalists\u2019 three years of stellar public-service reporting of Trump administration havoc, he\u2019s among Democrats with a renewed appreciation of the Fourth Estate.</p><p>Biden was a strong supporter of the free and independent press during his Senate career. When the Federal Communications Commission weakened media-ownership regulations, enabling more consolidation, he co-sponsored the Media Ownership Act of 2007, an attempt to force the FCC to be more transparent and explore ways to increase the representation of women and minorities in broadcast ownership. It did not advance.</p><p>In 2008, Biden co-sponsored a Senate resolution disapproving the FCC\u2019s media-ownership rules. It passed the Senate but did not advance in the House.</p><p>That issue has as much staying power as Biden\u2019s career. The FCC keeps hacking away at bedrock regulations intended to promote diversity, competition and localism in media, and losing court challenges.

Regulators must also address the unfair competition of tech giants that profit from media's content without investing back into journalism or abiding by advertising regulations that apply to traditional media. The next president should also work to restore net-neutrality protections to ensure a level playing field on the internet, and regulate the internet as an essential public utility.</p><p> Biden is saying good things so far. He favors net neutrality regulations created during the Obama era. His campaign pledges to use antitrust enforcement and other tools to hold big-tech companies accountable, although he's decidedly more moderate on this front than Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who wants to break up companies.</p><p> In his foreign policy plan, Biden pledges to restore daily press briefings at the White House and departments of State and Defense. \"Our foreign policy relies on the informed consent of the American public,\" it states. The same goes for domestic policy.</p><p> Although Biden's Obama administration service is generally a selling point, that administration disappointingly did some things to undermine the press and the public's ability to learn about government misconduct. It spied on reporters, seized records from The Associated Press and prosecuted more people for leaking information to the public than all previous administrations combined.</p><p> Biden should clarify how his commitment to transparency has evolved. Perhaps, after journalists' three years of stellar public-service reporting of Trump administration havoc, he's among Democrats with a renewed appreciation of the Fourth Estate.</p><p> Biden was a strong supporter of the free and independent press during his Senate career. When the Federal Communications Commission weakened media-ownership regulations, enabling more consolidation, he co-sponsored the Media Ownership Act of 2007, an attempt to force the FCC to be more transparent and explore ways to increase the representation of women and minorities in broadcast ownership. It did not advance.</p><p> In 2008, Biden co-sponsored a Senate resolution disapproving the FCC's media-ownership rules. It passed the Senate but did not advance in the House.</p><p> That issue has as much staying power as Biden's career. The FCC keeps hacking away at bedrock regulations intended to promote diversity, competition and localism in media, and losing court challenges. In the latest ruling, a federal court roasted the FCC in September for shoddy work analyzing the impact its rules would have on ownership diversity.</p><p> The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated the bulk of the FCC's media-ownership rule-making over the last three years, saying \"its analysis is so insubstantial that we cannot say it provides a reliable foundation for the Commission's conclusions.\"</p><p> Meanwhile Americans are approaching the 2020 vote with a dearth of independent news organizations to counter propaganda and misinformation. That benefits unscrupulous politicos and foreign governments seeking to divide and weaken the U.S. and its democracy.</p><p> Nearly 1,800 local newspapers have been lost since 2004, creating vast news deserts across the nation.

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NEIL CAVUTO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Thank you, Trace, very much.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, so much for the warm weather putting the kibosh on the coronavirus. In Dallas and in Miami Beach, in both of those cities and states, there are lingering problems and escalating cases, so much so that, in Texas right now, bars are shut down. And, right now, we have a situation where, in Florida, they're looking to make sure that no bar serves liquor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All of this at a time when they're looking at crowd control and a spike in cases because crowds have not been under control. So, they're back to looking at distancing provisions, back to looking at how many can go to a restaurant, in Texas, for example, goals of about three-quarters full back to about half-full.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">No indications when thing will be reversed. But what makes this significant today, it's the first time we have seen states not only pause on the reopening phases, but in some cases reverse them.</p><p>The significance of that at the corner of Wall and Broad was pronounced, a major sell-off in the Dow Jones industrials today, on the fear that the longer it takes these states to recover, the more delayed the recovery. We are on that as well.</p><p>Welcome, everybody. I'm Neil Cavuto, and this is \"Your World.\"</p><p>First to the fast-moving developments in Texas that spurred a lot of this activity today -- Casey.</p><p>CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Neil.</p><p>In fact, we're about an hour or so away from Texas releasing the updated numbers. But I can tell you that, over the last three days, this state reported more than 1,700 -- or 17,000 -- 17,000 new coronavirus cases, again, over a three-day period of time.</p><p>And another important metric to watch is the positivity rate. That also climbed in this state to about 10.5 percent over the last couple of days. So, in response today, the Texas governor announced a new set of executive orders that not only requires bars to close, which happened at noon local time, only allowed to remain open in a delivery or a carry-out capacity, but dine-in restaurants, as you mentioned, has to reduce -- must reduce capacity from 75 percent to 50.</p><p>That starts on Monday. Now, Abbott also has halted elective surgeries in four of the state's largest cities, Dallas, Houston, Austin, and San Antonio. The intention there is to help free up hospital beds and resources to accommodate the latest surge.</p><p>More than 4,700 people are now in Texas hospitals. That's a figure that has more than doubled in just the last week. And the Houston area is now on what's called red alert. Listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. UMAIR SHAH, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, HARRIS COUNTY, TEXAS, PUBLIC HEALTH: Now seeing increased tests that are coming back positive. That then drives what we're seeing in the numbers. Cases are going up, hospitalizations are going up, and we're obviously seeing the filling in the ICUs here locally.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEGALL: Now, in Florida, nearly 9,000 new cases reported in just the last 24 hours. That is a new record.</p><p>Today, the secretary of business and professional regulation immediately suspended the on-site consumption of alcohol at all bars. This is largely in response to the state's surge of infections among young people. We heard about that today in the coronavirus task briefing.</p><p>Arizona's governor, meantime, yesterday announcing that his state will hit the pause button on reopenings for now. That's a total of six states implementing those types of measures.</p><p>The Grand Canyon State has been experiencing record increases of not only new cases, but also hospitalizations. Arizona's total ICU bed capacity is inching closer and closer to 90 percent -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Casey, thank you very, very much.</p><p>To Casey's point here, to give you a nationalized view on this -- and he touched on Arizona, where half the cases that have been reported are relatively young people, in their 20s, 30s and 40s, half the cases that are coming in right now affecting that demographic, and a lot of top medical professionals are still scratching their heads over that one.</p><p>We're going to talk to a very good one in just a few minutes.</p><p>In the meantime, getting the read about some of the big changes in Texas, we have got chief Nim Kidd with us right now from the Texas Division of Emergency Management.</p><p>Chief, thank you very much for taking the time.</p><p>How would you describe things there right now?</p><p>NIM KIDD, TEXAS DIVISION OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT CHIEF: So, Neil, we're doing a fast-moving job of making sure that we have the right amount of personal protective equipment and testing availability for anybody in Texas that wants a test.</p><p>Today, there are over 892 local testing sites that you can go get a COVID- 19 test. We have backstopped that with personal protective equipment with our partners at FEMA, and pushing that out there, so all of our health care workers have the right PPE.</p><p>I think it's important to note there are still over 12,400 hospital beds available in the state. And then, on average statewide, only about 11 percent of the people that are in hospitals today are there because of COVID-19.</p><p>CAVUTO: Chief, the measures that Governor Abbott took today to sort of slow this down, in some cases reversed it, a lot of attention has been paid that the bars and the limited and now going back on capacity from about three- quarters full to half-full.</p><p>But I also noticed river rafting and other types of outdoor activities have been banned for the time being. Do you think that is enough, from your vantage point, or will more have to be done?</p><p>KIDD: I think we want to take a look at where we are right now, Neil, because what we have done through our contact tracing and epidemiological studies and investigations found that a lot of this increase had to do with sentinel events, with Mother's Day, Memorial Day, and a lot of graduations and parties...</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>KIDD: ... where people came together after those and weren't following the social distancing guidelines that we had asked them to do.</p><p>The health and safety of Texans will always be our number one priority. This pause right now is also to make sure that we can put the proper enforcement mechanisms in place at the restaurants and at these places where people are getting together without thinking about their safety.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, Chief, a very profound point, because it's been echoed in other states, not just yours, in Arizona and Florida, where a lot of those distancing guidelines, capacity guidelines are often ignored.</p><p>Now, governors always have the option and authorities like yourself have the option of saying, it's not only a good idea, we're going to enforce this.</p><p>Are we at that stage now, you think?</p><p>KIDD: So, I do know, at the local level, the governor has authorized many of those officials to enforce the wearing of masks in businesses. And we're seeing a lot of our state do that.</p><p>We think the enforcement is -- we're not a one-size-fits-all state, Neil. We're a very large state. And while we may have an 11 percent average of people in hospitals with COVID-19 in some cases, we have only 1 or 2 percent in others.</p><p>So, the statewide approach is really about local government and working well with our governor.</p><p>CAVUTO: Sir, thank you very much. I know you have your work cut out for you. We very much appreciate you taking the time.</p><p>There was that task force briefing we told you a little bit earlier, again, where Dr. Fauci, Dr. Birx virtually the entire team, minus the president -- it was the vice president who led this discussion today -- outlined some of the issues at hand here and why it is striking that so many younger people are being affected by this.</p><p>We're going to get in that with a top doctor in a second.</p><p>First to Kristin Fisher on what was outlined by the doctors there and the medical community now with this sudden spike -- Kristin.</p><p>KRISTIN FISHER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, Neil, on a day when you have new coronavirus cases in the United States hitting an all-time high, you have six states pumping the brakes on plans to reopen, the vice president continued to paint a very rosy picture of how this pandemic is playing out across the country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: As we stand here today, all 50 states and territories across this country are opening up safely and responsibly.</p><p>But with cases rising, particularly over the past week throughout the South, President Trump directed our task force to brief the American people.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER: Now, this was the task force's first briefing in two months. President Trump did not attend. In fact, it wasn't even held at the White House. It was held here at the Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p>But there were two constants from those near daily briefings that we all got so used to back in March and April, and that is Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci.</p><p>Now, Dr. Fauci says that we are facing serious problems in states like Texas, Florida and Arizona. He did not assign blame, but he did say that maybe some states opened too soon, maybe some people have not been properly social distancing.</p><p>And then the other culprit, the propensity of this virus to spread asymptomatically and the range of severity.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, NIAID DIRECTOR: All of the decades that I have been involved in chasing infectious diseases, I have never seen anything that is so protean in its ability to make people sick or not.</p><p>There's no other infectious disease that goes from 40 percent of the people having no symptoms, to some having mild symptoms, to some having severe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>FISHER: As for Dr. Birx, she will now be accompanying the vice president on a tour of the three states with the worst outbreak, Florida, Texas and Arizona. That is set to start on Sunday, but no word as to when this next briefing may be or if we're going to have to wait another two months -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Kristin Fisher, thank you very, very much. Great job, Kristin Fisher in Washington on all of that.</p><p>Want to go to Dr. Nicole Saphier right now.</p><p>She had been warning about just following basic guidelines, trying to remember individual responsibility and watch out for others.</p><p>And, Doctor, I'm looking at what's going on, and a lot of people were violating those basic kind of guidelines here, whether we're talking about social distancing capacity in some restaurants or what have you doing things that pack them together.</p><p>I'm wondering if this is in the early stages of seeing the problems that happen when you do that.</p><p>DR. NICOLE SAPHIER, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, Neil, there's a lot to dissect here.</p><p>And specifically when we're talking about Arizona, my home state, they shut down similar time when we did New Jersey a couple of months ago. And so when Dr. Fauci said that maybe they reopened too soon, my question is, maybe they shut down far too soon.</p><p>Unfortunately, the civil unrest that we have talked about a lot has led to a psychology that may be even greater than the pathology itself. And so you if -- they were unnecessarily shut down perhaps in the beginning, which is why people have started going out.</p><p>What I think we're seeing in the Southwest and all across the South is the reverse -- reverse summer effect. Yes, we know warmer weather and the U.V. lights will kill off the virus. But, unfortunately, when temperatures reach 110 degrees, people start flocking inside, Neil.</p><p>And that's exactly what happens out there.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>SAPHIER: So, now all of a sudden, we see people indoors. They don't have those stay-at-home orders. They don't have big social distancing orders.</p><p>So people are congregating indoors, and you're going to start seeing increased viral transmission. However, Neil, as everybody keeps saying, one good thing that we need to keep looking for is, the average age of people testing positive in Arizona is about 39 years old.</p><p>That's phenomenal. That's great, in the sense that we know, the older you are, the more at risk you are of having a severe course of COVID-19. However, I say that with caution, Neil, because even in those younger population, say, 35 to 34, they're still approaching a 5 percent mortality or fatality rate with COVID-19.</p><p>So, no, it's -- they cannot just think that this is not going to affect them, especially in the United States, as we have talked before, where we're dealing with a chronic illness epidemic. It's not just about age. It is also about comorbidities and preexisting conditions.</p><p>So, although it is very optimistic that it's the younger populations being -- testing positive right now, which is why the hospital systems are not overrun as much as they were in the Northeast, and we're not seeing the same death spikes, it's -- we still need to be very cautious, because COVID-19 can affect people of all ages.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes, you're right about that. And we're seeing evidence of that.</p><p>Dr. Saphier, thank you very, very much.</p><p>SAPHIER: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: And to the doctor's point here, again, the young that are being tested and found out to make up a majority of the cases certainly out of states like Arizona is something they're keeping a very, very close eye on it.</p><p>By the way, we should also point out the fact that slowing reopenings are very much happening, certainly in places not only like Florida and Texas, but in Alaska, Montana, and Utah that report obviously a spike in cases of their own. Whether they warrant some of this activity, it's way too soon to tell, but we're keeping an eye on that as well.</p><p>And keep in mind that we have the capacity to do more testing, and so you're going to have more cases when you do a lot more testing. And we are certainly picking up the pace on that in all of these states, including, notably, the ones that have the most cases.</p><p>So, we're looking at that and monitoring that and the distinctions of that.</p><p>In the meantime, some developments in protests happening around this country on the same day that Minneapolis moved one step closer to voting to remove its police department, and, in New York, where they're moving very quickly to defund a good part of it, about a billion dollars of it.</p><p>The push and the protests on that -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: Getting rid of the police department, it's very close to that in Minneapolis right now, where the Council unanimously supporting a measure that would essentially do that, just take it apart.</p><p>Mike Tobin has more from Chicago.</p><p>Hey, Mike.</p><p>MIKE TOBIN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Neil.</p><p>The obstacle that the City Council of Minneapolis is up against is the city's charter, which mandates a police force. So the action taken today was to change the language of the charter. And that puts this goal of dumping the police force at least into the realm of possibility.</p><p>Now, to get there, it's got to get through a couple of committees before August 5. That way, the change in the charter could get on the ballot for the November election. It takes a referendum to change the charter, but the first step was for the City Council to approve it, which they did by unanimous vote.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVE FLETCHER, MINNEAPOLIS CITY COUNCIL MEMBER: An opportunity to change the course of public safety in this country. I believe we are called to do that. I believe we are capable of doing that. I believe there is no better city to take up this charge.</p><p>And the path that we're going to chart will steal the best ideas from everywhere.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TOBIN: The police force will be replaced with a department of community safety and violence prevention.</p><p>Council members talk about a holistic public health approach to policing, but concede they don't have a completed plan to replace the police.</p><p>Barry Clegg is chairman of the Charter Commission. And that's one of the commissions that this language would need to get through before it gets on the ballot. And he says he would prefer that the Council members figure this thing out first, and then vote on it -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Mike, thank you very, very much.</p><p>Mike Tobin on all of that.</p><p>Fast-moving developments on New York on pretty much the same issue. Not so much, do we need a police department, but do we need to give it $6 billion every year?</p><p>So, for the better part of four days now, a movement to occupy City Hall, protesting the need to give that whole $6 billion and find a way to slowly and gradually defund it?</p><p>Alex Hogan has more on that -- Alex?</p><p>ALEX HOGAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Neil, it's another day of protests here for the occupy city hall movement.</p><p>As you can see behind me, hundreds of people are here. Hundreds of them slept here overnight. The group says they plan to stay here until the end of the month, when the city's budget is due.</p><p>They want to see the mayor cut $1 billion from the NYPD's $6 billion dollar budget and redirect that to social services. And they say that is just for starters.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TATIANA HILL, OCCUPY CITY HALL ORGANIZER: Education needs to happen in our communities. We need to have housing. It's a human right. And it's denied to many folks. And that creates crimes of survival. It creates negativity. It creates drama. It creates violence.</p><p>We want to mitigate those things by giving people the services that they need to live healthy and full lives.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Well, my thing is that it's not -- this is not about black or white. This is about rightness. And the police department have shown a double standard in the treatment of people of color in this city for far too long.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HOGAN: The mayor says protesters can stay as long as they remain peaceful and people in the area are safe.</p><p>Crowds spent weeks protesting police brutality following the death of George Floyd. The NYPD took no time suspending a police officer after a video emerged of the cop apparently using an illegal choke hold on a black man in Queens last week.</p><p>The NYPD officer, David Afanador, was arrested yesterday on charges of strangulation. And if he's convicted, he could spend up to seven years behind bars.</p><p>Meantime, back here at this protest today, what we're seeing, it looks like a lot of sitting, but every hour there is a new kind of program, some things like de-escalation methods, how to use Narcan, which is a lifesaving drug, and, of course, continuing to talk about the budget -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Alex, thank you very, very much, Alex Hogan.</p><p>We will be having more on that. They are going to continue these protests, as she said, until they start seeing progress on these de-budgeting efforts, something that no doubt worries Ted Williams, a former D.C. homicide detective, much, much more.</p><p>Well, a lot of these protesters are very serious on that. We're already seeing it one step closer in Minneapolis, certainly in cities like New York a step closer to getting a lot less dough for police there. What do you think of all this?</p><p>TED WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, Neil, public safety is paramount in a civilized society.</p><p>I understand that, when you look at what happened with George Floyd, where you have a police officer with his knee on his neck, and you can see eight minutes of that man's life moving out of him, that that brings visceral effects on the public as a whole.</p><p>But we cannot throw the baby out with the bathwater. And I say that simply to say that you keep defund of police departments, and the only person, when you do that, that you're pleasing are the criminal element that's out there.</p><p>So we have to be very careful. I do believe in reformation, though, and I think that police departments should be reformed.</p><p>CAVUTO: You know, Ted, I'm also wondering about this effort in Congress to find an agreeable police reform bill, whatever you want to call it, in the House.</p><p>It's supposedly dead on arrival in the Senate, the Senate measure a nonstarter in the House. Calls to maybe outlaw choke holds, that sort of thing, but little agreement on almost anything else. So where do you see that going?</p><p>WILLIAMS: I see it going nowhere, unfortunately. I think it's a mess what is going on in Washington, D.C., here in the Congress on both sides of the aisle.</p><p>But I would have to say that when you're talking about the reformation of police departments, that has to be on the lower level in -- within a city or a state government. It cannot be looked at upon from Washington, D.C., to carry that water.</p><p>And so, therefore, there are a lot of things that mayors and a governor can do on a local level to bring about a civilized police department, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right. We will see. It's just amazing how quickly all of this had sort of mushroomed, Ted. And you had predicted that it would. You were concerned then. You're obviously concerned now.</p><p>Ted Williams, good seeing you again. Be safe, be healthy, my friend.</p><p>WILLIAMS: My pleasure, my friend.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right.</p><p>In the meantime here, what to make of this from the perspective of a United States senator, Senator John Kennedy on these efforts to defund beliefs, and a separate effort right now, speaking of Washington, D.C., to make it a state -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, just how would our flag look with 51 stars on it?</p><p>The District of Columbia keen on becoming the 51st and becoming one step closer in the House. Let's see where it goes from here -- after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, the quest right now to make the District of Columbia a state.</p><p>They have attempted this before, but this is further along than many thought they would get, the House voting to make Washington, D.C., the 51st state.</p><p>But, as our Chad Pergram can tell you, it's a big leap from there.</p><p>Explain the process, Chad.</p><p>CHAD PERGRAM, FOX NEWS CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT: That's right.</p><p>Well, they tried this back in the early 1990s. It failed. It passed today. The vote was 232-180, mostly party-line, one Democratic defection, Collin Peterson of Minnesota. All Republicans voted no.</p><p>Also, another no, Justin Amash, the independent representative from Michigan.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. JUSTIN AMASH (I-MI): I think we need to exhaust all of the alternatives, for example, some retrocession to Virginia -- to Maryland, just as they have done with Virginia before.</p><p>But I'm not confident that this bill is the way to do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERGRAM: The founders originally carved Washington out of land from Maryland and Virginia. That is so no state could boast that it was home to the capital</p><p>D.C. would likely send two Democratic senators to Capitol Hill. When they added states before, like Alaska and Hawaii, they did so as a political compromise. That is so the states would politically offset one another, but there's no counterbalance now.</p><p>And that doesn't bother House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): That shouldn't be the -- how we have enfranchisement in our country. They talk about the toos, too black, too Democratic, too whatever.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PERGRAM: ... do pay taxes.</p><p>Matt Gaetz, the Republican representative from Florida, he says he would like to abolish taxation for residents of the District of Columbia.</p><p>And remember, Neil, back in the 1990s, they added on the D.C. license plates the phrase \"Taxation Without Representation\" -- back to you.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: A lot of taxation.</p><p>All right, thank you very, very much, Chad Pergram, on all of that.</p><p>Senator John Kennedy on these fast-moving developments.</p><p>On this statehood for D.C. push, what do you think, Senator?</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): I think it's all about power, like everything else in Washington, D.C.</p><p>I mean, I haven't studied the issue as extensively as some, Neil. But some say it would be unconstitutional. If you look at Article 1 of the Constitution, the idea of our founders was that there would be an independent district, not beholden to any state, not influenced by any state.</p><p>Another argument I have heard is that the land for the District came from Maryland and Virginia. Virginia's land has been given back, but if D.C. no longer was D.C., D.C. wouldn't own the land, that Maryland would.</p><p>It would cost the District of Columbia a lot of money. Congress puts up about 700 million bucks a year, I think, to -- to defray the District's expenses.</p><p>Others, I have heard say, well, we haven't been particularly impressed with the way the mayor and her colleagues have handled the recent felony rioting in D.C. I think it's fair criticism. I think the mayor's, for her politics, has allowed that to happen.</p><p>I listened to Speaker Pelosi, who I respect, talk about it has nothing to do with -- with disenfranchisement or enfranchisement. That is a bunch of bull, and she knows it. She knows that D.C. is heavily, heavily, heavily Democratic, and they would pick up a congressional seat and two Senate seats.</p><p>And that's what it will -- that's what it's going to come down to, like everything else in Washington.</p><p>CAVUTO: But, to your point, it would be an uphill battle to happen.</p><p>I do, while I have you, Senator, want to get your thoughts on the sudden spike in cases and the move in Texas to reverse things, Florida to outlaw bars serving alcohol, Arizona, the spike there.</p><p>What do you make of all of this?</p><p>KENNEDY: A lot of it was predictable. Some of it is additional testing. We're discovering more cases because we're doing a better job of testing. But that's not the only reason.</p><p>A lot of -- we opened up the economy, and people are moving around more. Some of this was predictable.</p><p>But the real reason that I think that the cases are spiking is because people aren't taking precautions. You have got to wear a mask. You have got to stay six feet apart. You have got to wash -- wash your hands. I know some people don't like to wear a mask. And you don't have...</p><p>CAVUTO: But the president doesn't wear a mask, and a lot of the key people around him, they don't wear masks.</p><p>Do you think they're providing a good example here and that, because of that, maybe people are saying, well, he's not doing it, I won't do it?</p><p>KENNEDY: Well, we don't have a law that you have to wear a mask. I mean, this isn't China.</p><p>CAVUTO: True.</p><p>KENNEDY: If you don't wear a mask, you're not going to be bayonetted and thrown into Shawshank Prison.</p><p>But all I can do is to what I do. I don't wear one mask. I wear two when I'm on an airplane. And I wear one every -- everywhere else. I think a mask, it does protect other people. I think it protects you.</p><p>From day one, the authorities said, oh...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: Do you think it would be good -- do you think it would be good, then, for those in power, including the president -- and they are uncomfortable -- I get that and all -- but to wear one, at least to kind of incentivize people, look, we're going to make this worse if we don't do stuff like this?</p><p>KENNEDY: Look, that's up to -- it's up to the president.</p><p>I mean, I understand some would like me to say, well, the president ought to wear a mask. It's up to the president. It's up to every American. This is America. I wear a mask. I think it stops, not only other people from getting the virus, but it stops you from getting the virus.</p><p>And my reason for wearing a mask is very simple. I don't want to get the virus because I don't want to die. Duh.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, there is that.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: There is that.</p><p>KENNEDY: And I just think, if we did -- if we did a better job of following the -- what the experts, the health experts, are telling us, we -- it wouldn't eliminate the virus, but it would -- it would control it.</p><p>We have also got a lot of problems with young people. I got a 24-year-old son.</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>KENNEDY: He thinks he's bulletproof. He thinks he's going to live forever.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>KENNEDY: They have got to be -- they have got to be a -- do a better job.</p><p>I'm very proud of my son, Neil.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>CAVUTO: I hear you on -- Senator, I hear you on stubborn kids. I hear you on the stubborn kids, and they think they're bulletproof.</p><p>Very good having you, sir. Continued good health.</p><p>KENNEDY: Well, my son, I'm proud -- I'm proud of my son.</p><p>CAVUTO: Good.</p><p>KENNEDY: He went to college, and he's got no visible tattoos.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, there's progress there.</p><p>Senator, thank you very much.</p><p>KENNEDY: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: Be healthy. Be well. Be safe, and your family.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>KENNEDY: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right Senator John Kennedy on all of that.</p><p>Well, you had it with Facebook. You think that it's unfair. You think that it goes a step too far. There is an alternative, and a lot of conservatives, a lot of companies, they are running to it right now.</p><p>Meet the head of that firm after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: To hear a lot of conservatives tell it, when it comes to Facebook or Twitter, not fair, not balanced, not right, not having it, and a lot are leaving those sites because they feel that their commentaries are either shut down or their views not shared or even advertising attached to them is not allowed.</p><p>Enter John Matze, who's come up with an alternative that is drawing them like flies right now, because it is an unbiased center, a social media center that draws on the idea, let everyone speak.</p><p>In fact, it's built on that French term. I believe it's Parler, that just says, essentially, speak to speak.</p><p>John Matze is the guy who runs it.</p><p>Good to have you, John. Thank you for coming.</p><p>JOHN MATZE, CEO, PARLER: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: Explain to me how this works, how it might differ from, let's say, a Twitter or Facebook, or some of these better known sites?</p><p>MATZE: Well, it'll feel very similar to Twitter, which I'm sure many people are accustomed to.</p><p>However, we take a really -- we take a really firm stance that we want to be unbiased. That means we don't judge it based off of any third-party editorial board, no fact-checking bias. We judge the content based on how we would apply Supreme Court rulings, the FCC and other -- other already prerequisite material in the U.S. Constitution, apply that to the community, and moderate in that fashion.</p><p>And it seems to be really popular. People really, really like it. In fact, yesterday, we even were ahead of Twitter on the app store, which was very cool. We were number one for news yesterday.</p><p>And so people are really, really...</p><p>CAVUTO: Wow.</p><p>MATZE: ... liking the idea.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, now, who is coming to you?</p><p>And I -- I know a lot of disenchanted conservatives in particular are coming, because they say, when it comes to Twitter, Facebook, they're policing their content or actually taking it down at times.</p><p>Is that fair to say, then, that you are more of a conservative-oriented site, or are liberals welcome, everybody's welcome? How would you describe it?</p><p>MATZE: Well, we are -- we're a town square. That's how I view us. So everyone's welcome, any kind of discussion. We want that discussion, right? We want people to actually have conversations again. The country's too partisan right now.</p><p>And when you go on these sites, it feels like a battleground. And so the idea is that you're going to get on Parler and have discussions with people. We're seeing a lot of popularity with conservatives. They seem to be the ones that are most affected by Twitter censorship or Facebook censorship.</p><p>And so they feel that it's this time to do something, especially in the midst of an election where you're seeing the president being fact-checked and content removed, or at least, if it's not removed, it's covered up with some kind of warning message.</p><p>And that's not appropriate, especially not an election year. We need fair elections, and they shouldn't interfere.</p><p>CAVUTO: Now, do you have any fact-checking? Or if anyone on the right or the left or anyone makes an outrageous comment, everything goes through, people can say what they want, even if it's not verified?</p><p>MATZE: Well, they can make any claim they'd like, but they're going to be met with a lot of commenters, a lot of people who are going to disagree with them. That's how society works, right?</p><p>If you make a claim, people are going to come and fact-check you organically. You don't need an editorial board of experts to determine what's true and what's not.</p><p>The First Amendment was given to us so that we could all talk about issues, not have a single point of authority determine what is correct and what's not.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, how do you then handle people who are going to look at this, though, and what you're doing and saying, all right, well, they're really, with a wink and a nod, a conservative site?</p><p>When, in fact, I understand what you're doing here. There's no one going to police that except the users themselves.</p><p>MATZE: Mm-hmm.</p><p>Well, you're going to see a lot of people on the other side of the aisle coming over very soon. In fact, we're seeing them in waves now, not to the extent that they're high-profile individuals, but you're seeing a lot of people on the left who are actually curious, going, wait, why are all these conservatives on this site? What is this about?</p><p>And they're going to come. And they will. And they will come in bigger numbers, and we're going to see some bigger names come over too when they won't don't want to miss out on the conversation. They're going to -- they can't resist. They're going to want to come over.</p><p>CAVUTO: It's fascinating.</p><p>MATZE: And so I think that, eventually, we're going to see that movement, but right -- but, right now, conservatives need this kind of place, right? This is something that they need in an election year, when they're experiencing censorship or some kind of bias against them, whether it's perceived or real.</p><p>In my opinion, I think it's real, but many perceive it to being real. And that's what's important, is that people want a place they can feel like they're appreciated, and their voice matters, and they can speak.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, we will watch it very closely.</p><p>John Matze, I notice you pronounce it Parler, so you're skewing the French pronunciation. I understand that. Parler, it is.</p><p>Thank you very much. We will be monitoring you very closely.</p><p>MATZE: Thank you.</p><p>CAVUTO: This is getting a lot of attention. A lot of people have already wandered over from those popular sites to just check his out, where they say they can freely express their opinion. And, if other users, readers don't like it, well, they will give them their opinion as well.</p><p>All right, in the meantime here, you hear about cases of the virus spiking. What you don't hear too much about, even with the sell-off in the markets, is all the buying that's been spiking.</p><p>Consumers like you have been busy. We will explain.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, don't get used to those unoccupied middle seats on airplanes much longer.</p><p>American Airlines will allow full-capacity flights -- that means the middle seat too -- early next month, this as industry CEOs, all the big ones, were meeting at the White House today with the vice president of the United States.</p><p>Keep in mind, they're getting about $80 billion in aid right now, but a lot of things, the way they are going now, they're going to need more help. There's talk about giving a tax credit voucher to Americans to encourage them to take vacations and hop on a plane.</p><p>That's a little early in the going here, but Blake Burman on how everything fared with all the big execs today.</p><p>Hey, Blake.</p><p>BLAKE BURMAN, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hi there, Neil.</p><p>This was some face time in the Roosevelt Room earlier this afternoon between the vice president, Mike Pence, and executives from some of the largest airliners in this country.</p><p>Going into this, we were expecting the leaders of United, American, Delta, Southwest and JetBlue to be a part of that meeting. Going into the meeting here, I was told that the topic of conversation would center on safety measures, like masks and temperature checks, as there is so much focus, and rightfully so, on how to go about reopening the economy safely.</p><p>Now, many of the airlines do have policies regarding masks. But the White House today did not take an official position on whether everyone should be wearing a mask when they step out into the public.</p><p>When asked about facial coverings this afternoon, the vice president said , that should be more of a targeted decision.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PENCE: What's most important here is that people listen to the leadership in their state and the leadership in their local community and adhere to that guidance, whether it have to do with facial coverings, whether it have to do with the size of gatherings.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BURMAN: Neil, so many potential topics of discussion, but I was also told that contact tracing would likely come up in the meeting.</p><p>Some of the airlines have had reservations, I guess you could say, in the past about just how much personal information on passengers they should be handing over to the federal government -- Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Thank you, my friend, very much, Blake Burman.</p><p>Well, a lot of problems going on in the economy and people worried about filling up airplanes and all the rest. And there's the coronavirus uptick in cases here.</p><p>But the one thing you might have missed is a bit of a startlingly good news, personal spending surging more than 8 percent in the latest month. And this continues a pattern we have seen in some retail sales figures, a lot of mortgage activity and filings.</p><p>So, behind the scenes, as Heather Zumarraga will tell you, you have got things percolating.</p><p>Heather, good to have you.</p><p>What do you make of all this?</p><p>HEATHER ZUMARRAGA, FINANCIAL ANALYST: Hi, Neil.</p><p>Well, yes, spending increased actually to a record 8.2 percent in the month of May, on the backs of a very bad April, while personal income is actually declining. So, although we have a surging spike in cases, the Dow tanking 700 points today, the economic data is or was getting better.</p><p>CAVUTO: So, looking at that, people, once freed out of their homes, I mean, they want to shop or they want to get out. They want to go to bars.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: Yes.</p><p>CAVUTO: That's a problem right now in Texas. It's going to be a problem in Florida for a while, at least if they want something alcoholic.</p><p>But, having said that, what do you make of how this spike could affect all of this?</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: Well, you look at Disney down here also in Florida, and they're postponing their reopening, Macy's laying off 3,000 workers today.</p><p>Apple and Microsoft, big tech titans, closing some of their stores as well. So, while Texas is closing down, it's a targeted approach, bars and certain areas of their economy where the virus may be spreading, in Florida, we are still staying open for now.</p><p>But it will pose a headwind and a challenge for the stock market and the economy. I do expect the market to continue dropping perhaps next week, as we end what has been a phenomenal quarter in the stock market.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, Heather, a good point. Obviously, markets sell off on the idea that there's going to be delay in the reopenings, and that would delay the strength of the recovery or what they have been seeing, the strong numbers.</p><p>So, we will see.</p><p>Heather, always good seeing you.</p><p>ZUMARRAGA: Thanks, Neil.</p><p>CAVUTO: Continued good health. Be safe.</p><p>In the meantime here, we have talked about spikes and everything else, but when you look at overall what has been happening in this economy, it's been fairly remarkable.</p><p>Other developments that people are missing -- right after this.</p><p>CAVUTO: All right, when it comes to the polls, the trend has not been the president's friend. Things can change.</p><p>But, as things stand now, just looking at a RealClearPolitics average of polls that are out, he is behind Joe Biden by a lot, and in some of the battleground states that he won to tip his electoral victory, he's trailing right now.</p><p>As things stand right now, Joe Biden would have at least 340 electoral votes, if he maintains the lead in the states that he does. But anything can happen, as Phil Wegmann would tell you, of RealClearPolitics fame, as well.</p><p>Phil, what do you make of these poll numbers, particularly in these battleground states, where the president stands right now?</p><p>PHILIP WEGMANN, REALCLEARPOLITICS: If you look at those four FOX News polls, and then also similar polling coming out of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, if the election was held tomorrow, it could possibly be an unmitigated disaster for President Trump.</p><p>Like you said a second ago, things can and will change ahead of November. But compare today to 2016, President Trump is neck and neck with Joe Biden in both Georgia and Texas. In 2020 -- excuse me -- in 2016, he enjoyed healthy and consistent leads there ahead of Hillary Clinton.</p><p>So this is a different race.</p><p>CAVUTO: What explains it? Now, he's still got his passionate base.</p><p>But I think we were discussing not too long ago the voting sentiment might be, fear the other guy, right, whether it's Trump voters and how they feel about Biden, Biden voters and how they feel about Trump. Could you explain that?</p><p>WEGMANN: Well, that base is not going to leave President Trump. They have been consistent supporters of him.</p><p>But I think that the challenge that President Trump and his campaign are running into right now is how to define his candidacy and what he would do during a second term. You saw just yesterday, when he was talking to Sean Hannity, that he kind of stumbled on that question of what he wanted to do in the next four years.</p><p>CAVUTO: Right.</p><p>WEGMANN: And, remarkably, today, you had senator Chuck Grassley tweeting that he wanted someone to take a Wall Street Journal editorial into the Oval Office calling on President Trump to define what he was running for, because this really is going to be a referendum.</p><p>And Republicans, they're afraid that he could lose.</p><p>CAVUTO: Well, I read the Wall Street Journal editorial, where it was chastising him for getting off-message with these attacks on the press and other individuals.</p><p>When he's on-message, talking about some of this stuff, focused like a laser beam, with the virus or the economy, it's a very different story.</p><p>WEGMANN: Very true. He still leads Joe Biden when it comes to how voters see his handling of the economy.</p><p>But on the issue of the pandemic, this has to be concerning for him. In those states that FOX News polled, a lot of voters said that they would favor Joe Biden's handling of the pandemic.</p><p>And this is concerning, particularly...</p><p>CAVUTO: Yes.</p><p>WEGMANN: ... particularly in states like Florida, where seniors, they favor Trump by about one point.</p><p>That's a critical demographic for him to win. This is a demographic that is most susceptible to this disease.</p><p>CAVUTO: We will watch it closely.</p><p>Phil Wegmann, thank you very much.</p><p>In fact, we're going to be watching it a lot tomorrow beginning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern time, and get the read from Mark Cuban, a Texan, by the way, with what's going on there. He likes Joe Biden. Also, Asa Hutchinson, the governor of Arkansas, he likes the president of the United States.</p><p>What they say is both at stake in this crucial election year. It's pretty much how everything goes with the virus.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2020062601cb140</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6073-H8P1-DXH2-605S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7102\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 26, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>INTERVIEW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Consumers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Minneapolis</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Texas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Florida</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Joe Biden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Elections</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Parler</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Washington, D.C.</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Aviation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>John Matze</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>John Kennedy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Senate</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>California</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health and Medicine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Diseases</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Republican Party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DECC</classCode><className>ENTERTAINMENT &amp;
