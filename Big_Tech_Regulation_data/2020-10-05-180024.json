You could use a smartphone to call up a car as if you were some kind of baller. You could video-chat with people anywhere in the world, like \"The Jetsons\" - and maybe some of those people would use the new tech to throw off the yoke of repression, somehow. They were the days of miracle and wonder.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But tech also felt confusing. There were so many new things - every year, new phones with so much more power, made by so many new companies, all running so many new and purportedly revolutionary apps - that it was easy to get lost in the hype. It was also easy to pick the wrong horse. There was no guarantee that this or that novelty would last until next year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So to get the most out of innovations and avoid betting on the also-rans, my inaugural advice to readers was to follow these steps: Buy hardware from Apple. Use online services made by Google. And get digital media from Amazon.</p><p>Now the time has come to amend and update that advice - which is fitting, because this will be my final column in these pages. (I'm not going far: I'll be writing for The New York Times's Opinion section starting next year.)</p><p>The tech industry in 2018 is far more consequential than it was in 2014, when I started this job. It's bigger, more pervasive and in every way more dangerous. It is also less amenable to outside pressure: The companies that run the show are more powerful than ever, and in many cases governments - especially in the United States - have proved ineffective at curbing their excesses.</p><p>How should you, as an ethical and upstanding user of tech, navigate this misbegotten industry? I offer three new maxims for surviving the next era of tech. I hope you heed them; the world rides on your choices.</p><p>Don't just look at the product. Look at the business model.</p><p>Not long ago - in the nascent days of smartphones, mobile apps and the mysterious \"cloud\" - wading into the market for new tech was often risky. You might buy a phone or tablet whose maker would quickly go belly-up. A lot of stuff didn't work well: Backing up your data was a headache, keeping your photos organized across different devices was a nightmare. And even technologies that did work left you plagued with guilt and worry. Remember the curse of email spam, or how you had to pay through the nose for texting?</p><p>Something strange and unexpected has happened in the last five years: A lot of tech got pretty good. Slowly but surely, many of our basic struggles were fixed. Nothing is perfect, but for most people, the mobile era has brought simplicity to tech for the first time.</p><p>But ubiquitous quality has given rise to a new problem: If everything just works, how are you supposed to choose what to buy?</p><p>My advice: Don't just consider how well a product works, but look at who's making it and how it is sold. Before you dive into any new doodad, consider a company's ethics, morals, branding and messaging. If you aren't comfortable, look to alternatives. (Last year, for instance, I switched to Lyft from Uber, and I've never looked back.) Most important, when you're choosing tech, it's wise to consider the business model - because it's in the buying and the selling of a product, rather than in the using, that you can best figure out its dangers.</p><p>For instance: Even though Google's Pixel line of phones is very good - a far more affordable option with some features that iPhone users might kill for - I stick with Apple's phones because I appreciate the simplicity of the trade. I pay Apple a huge sum of money for the device, and it takes extraordinary care in protecting me from some of the worst digital scourges.</p><p>I don't doubt Google's capacity to make great devices. But because Google makes most of its money from ads, and because the internet ad business lies at the heart of just about every terrible thing online, I'd rather not fall deeper into that swamp.</p><p>Similarly, I found Facebook's new video-chatting machine, Portal, to be very good, but I'll never buy it. Besides Facebook's dependence on targeted ads, the company has repeatedly breached its users' trust, not to mention the casual disregard it has shown for larger ideas like democracy. Portal is nice, but it's not <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">that</emphasis> nice.</p><p>Avoid feeding the giants.</p><p>One thing that hasn't changed in the last five years is who's running the show. When I started writing this column, Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft were tech's biggest and most influential companies. Today, even with recent stock-market troubles, the same five giants sit at the top of the world.</p><p>I've railed against this sort of concentration again and again - the tech giants' increasing domination ruins innovation, undermines consumer choice and generally makes a lot of the industry ungovernable. Lawmakers around the world are now taking notice, and it's possible that in the next five years, we'll see greater regulatory curbs to the behemoths' size and scope.</p><p>But you don't have to wait for politicians to weigh in. Your choices as a consumer matter, too - and for a better, healthier tech industry, it's best to avoid mindlessly feeding the giants whenever you can. If you have a choice between something made by one of the Big Five and some indie brand, choose the indie.</p><p>Here's one example: Even though I like Apple's hardware and appreciate its business model, I've stayed away from Apple Music, its subscription streaming service. For me, Spotify is superior in just about every way. Its app works better (its music recommendation algorithm is eerily good), it releases innovative features at a faster clip, and its songs play on more types of devices.</p><p>Best of all, Spotify is an independent company. So when I pay for it, I am, in a small way, spreading the wealth in the industry.</p><p>There are some downsides to this. Apple has shamelessly given its own service priority on its devices - so Siri, for example, will play music from Apple's service but not from Spotify. But it's precisely this sort of mischief that I'm hoping to dissuade by putting my money elsewhere.</p><p>There are lots of other examples for looking beyond the big guys. You can use Dropbox instead of storing all your stuff with Apple and Google. Rather than Microsoft Word or Google Docs, I write in Ulysses, a lightweight composing app that is faster and more elegant than any big-tech competitor. Whatever tech you're in the market for, there's most likely some innovative thing made by a non-giant that deserves consideration, if not your money.</p><p>Adopt late. Slow down.</p><p>One reason the tech industry feels as terrible as it now does is that many of us failed to appreciate the collective power of our choices. Ten years ago, smartphones looked like fun gadgets and social media seemed like a harmless pastime - and few saw the implications for society in their ubiquity, not least the people running the companies and making this stuff.</p><p>The lesson of the last decade is that our private tech choices can alter economies and societies. They matter. And they matter most in the mindless rush, when everyone seems to be jumping on board the latest new thing, because it's in these heady moments that we lose sight of the precise risks of turning ourselves over to tech.</p><p>That's why the most important lesson I've gleaned in writing this column is this: Just slow down. Don't jump on the newest thing. If it isn't plagued with bugs or security nightmares, some other unexpected, emergent risk probably lies within it - and whatever its short-term benefits, you may live to regret it.</p><p>Yes, tech could make everything better. But we should be on guard for the ways it could make things worse - how self-driving cars could induce sprawl, how the \"internet of things\" could provoke apocalypse, how social media could ruin democracy.</p><p>Are these unlikely dangers? Maybe. But we live in unpredictable times. The unlikely happens. Be careful. Go slow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000006234941</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TVP-2Y91-DYR7-C360-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1368\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 1, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp; MANAGEMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST00096KX</classCode><className>NEW BUSINESSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000354</classCode><className>COMPUTER NETWORKS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N518112MM</classCode><className>WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000962</classCode><className>WEBSITES &amp; PORTALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp; CELLULAR TELEPHONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CYWJ</classCode><className>SMARTPHONES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001536</classCode><className>SEARCH ENGINES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A075</classCode><className>TEXT MESSAGING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000CYWK</classCode><className>MOBILE APPLICATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000CF4G</classCode><className>TABLET COMPUTERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001702</classCode><className>TELEPHONIC EQUIPMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000580</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Whatever tech you\u2019re in the market for, there\u2019s most likely some innovative thing made by a non-giant that deserves consideration, if not your money.</p><p>Adopt late. Slow down. </p><p>One reason the tech industry feels as terrible as it now does is that many of us failed to appreciate the collective power of our choices. Ten years ago, smartphones looked like fun gadgets and social media seemed like a harmless pastime \u2014 and few saw the implications for society in their ubiquity, not least the people running the companies and making this stuff.</p><p>The lesson of the last decade is that our private tech choices can alter economies and societies. They matter. And they matter most in the mindless rush, when everyone seems to be jumping on board the latest new thing, because it\u2019s in these heady moments that we lose sight of the precise risks of turning ourselves over to tech.</p><p>That\u2019s why the most important lesson I\u2019ve gleaned in writing this column is this: Just slow down. Don\u2019t jump on the newest thing. If it isn\u2019t plagued with bugs or security nightmares, some other unexpected, emergent risk probably lies within it \u2014 and whatever its short-term benefits, you may live to regret it.</p><p>Yes, tech could make everything better.

But as some of those startups grew into behemoths, they turned this force on its head. Far from leveling the playing field, Big Tech now largely owns it, and rather than democratizing the economy, the Internet has ended up exacerbating the world's inequality problem. </p><p>Big Tech's rise has made a few people extremely wealthy. The richest among them, Amazon owner Jeff Bezos, lost $7 billion - more than the total wealth of several countries, including Burundi and Sierra Leone ($3 billion each) - in a single day last week. And yet the biggest risk he faces as a result is falling to second place in the global wealth ranking, after another tech founder, Bill Gates. Meanwhile, some 736 million people still lived in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) in 2015, and billions more lived on less than $2.50 per day. Many workers worldwide - including low-level employees at tech companies like Amazon and freelancers who use platforms like Uber to find customers - face poor and deteriorating working conditions and stagnant wages. As labor's share of income declines, capital's share increases - trends that benefit the wealthy above all. Given the power of major tech companies to stifle competition, reversing these trends will require government intervention. And, indeed, taming Big Tech has become a major issue ahead of the 2020 presidential election in the United States. In particular, Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren - in my view, the two strongest candidates vying for the Democratic Party's nomination to challenge President Donald Trump - have called for breaking up major tech companies. But the solutions being proposed, including by legal scholars like Lina Khan, tend to focus on making better use of antitrust laws. This approach is unlikely to work, because markets have changed dramatically since antitrust laws were conceived. In the late nineteenth century, Leon Walras produced the first models of how competitive markets work, showing how buyers and sellers decide, based on prices, how much to buy and sell. Walras visualized an auctioneer responsible for bringing buyers and sellers together and adjusting prices until market equilibrium - when aggregate demand for each good equals aggregate supply - is achieved. Subsequent work, such as that by Kenneth Arrow and Gerard Debreu, expanded upon the Walrasian model, but the auctioneer remained in the background. With the emergence of digital platforms like Alibaba, Amazon, and Uber, however, everything changed. These platforms perform the work of Walras's imaginary auctioneer, only they are real - and profit-driven. They may even be willing to make large initial losses - as Amazon did for its first seven years in operation, when it accumulated some $2 billion in debt - in order to maximize later gains. They know that they need only reach the point where they can reap the benefits of economies of scale, bringing enough buyers and sellers to the \"auction\" to make search, information, and transaction costs plummet. In this sense, digital platforms are natural monopolies. Applying antitrust laws to break them up would thus eliminate their most fundamental advantage and destroy their ability to deliver benefits to economies and consumers. This dilemma is not altogether new. Some central banks, such as the Reserve Bank of India, were once private organizations. But giving a single private agent power over something as consequential as money creation was quickly determined to be too risky. And dividing the responsibility among several authorities would make it impossible for any to serve a transaction-smoothing function, resulting in a costly fragmentation of the monetary system. It is worth noting one other potential barrier to using antitrust laws to break up Big Tech. In the US, at least, such laws have focused primarily on protecting consumers. Recognizing that, many digital platforms have avoided hurting consumers, instead gouging the sellers who use their services to connect to buyers. But there is growing research - such as that conducted by Suresh Naidu, Eric Posner, and Glen Weyl - indicating that antitrust law should also be applied to protecting workers. Still, given the ways digital platforms have transformed markets, governments must think beyond antitrust. One approach worth considering focuses not on breaking up tech giants, but rather on ensuring that their profits are more widely shared. This could be achieved, say, with regulations that require platforms over a certain size to disperse shares to a large number of individuals and also to funds dedicated to providing domestic and global public goods. For the most influential platforms, governments may consider pushing a gradual shift to non-profit models, akin to public utilities. To be sure, this approach should be used sparingly, to avoid excessive and burdensome state intervention in the economy. But it is not in society's interest to have a single organization that is integral to the functioning of the entire economy - whether a central bank or digital platform - run by a small coterie of individuals for their own gain. The precise contours of a strategy for constraining Big Tech will emerge - and evolve - over time. But I am hopeful that either Sanders or Warren - two politicians who seem to have the right \"moral intention\" - would be able to lead that process in a way that serves the interests of consumers, workers, and business owners alike.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Statesman.

But as some of those startups grew into behemoths, they turned this force on its head. Far from levelling the playing field, Big Tech now largely owns it, and rather than democratising the economy, the Internet has ended up exacerbating the world's inequality problem.Big Tech's rise has made a few people extremely wealthy. The richest among them, Amazon owner Jeff Bezos, lost $7 billion \u2014 more than the\u00a0total wealth\u00a0of several countries, including Burundi and Sierra Leone ($3 billion each), in a single day last week. </p><p>And yet the biggest risk he faces as a result is\u00a0falling\u00a0to second place in the global wealth ranking, after another tech founder,\u00a0Bill Gates.Meanwhile, some 736 million people still lived in extreme poverty, less than $1.90 per day, in 2015, and billions more lived on less than $2.50 per day. Many workers worldwide, including low-level employees at tech companies like Amazon and freelancers who use platforms like Uber to find customers, face poor and deteriorating working conditions and stagnant wages. As labour's share of income declines, capital's share increases, trends that benefit the wealthy above all.Given the power of major tech companies to stifle competition, reversing these trends will require government intervention. And, indeed, taming Big Tech has become a major issue ahead of the 2020 presidential election in the United States. In particular, senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, in my view, the two strongest candidates vying for the Democratic Party's nomination to challenge President Donald Trump, have called for\u00a0breaking up\u00a0major tech companies.But the solutions being proposed, including by legal scholars like Lina Khan, tend to focus on making\u00a0better use of antitrust laws. This approach is unlikely to work, because markets have\u00a0changed dramatically\u00a0since antitrust laws were conceived.In the late nineteenth century, L\u00e9on Walras produced the first models of how competitive markets work, showing how buyers and sellers decide, based on prices, how much to buy and sell. Walras visualised an auctioneer responsible for bringing buyers and sellers together and adjusting prices until market equilibrium, when aggregate demand for each good equals aggregate supply, is achieved. Subsequent work, such as that by\u00a0Kenneth Arrow\u00a0and G\u00e9rard Debreu,\u00a0expanded upon the Walrasian model, but the auctioneer remained in the background.With the emergence of digital platforms like Alibaba, Amazon and Uber, however, everything changed. These platforms perform the work of Walras's imaginary auctioneer, only they are real, and profit-driven. They may even be willing to make large initial losses, as Amazon did for its first seven years in operation, when it accumulated some\u00a0$2 billion in debt, in order to maximise later gains. They know that they need only reach the point where they can reap the benefits of economies of scale, bringing enough buyers and sellers to the 'auction' to make search, information, and transaction costs plummet.In this sense, digital platforms are natural monopolies. Applying antitrust laws to break them up would thus eliminate their most fundamental advantage and destroy their ability to deliver benefits to economies and consumers.This dilemma is not altogether new. Some central banks, such as the Reserve Bank of India, were once private organisations. But giving a single private agent power over something as consequential as money creation was quickly determined to be too risky. And dividing the responsibility among several authorities would make it impossible for any to serve a transaction-smoothing function, resulting in a costly fragmentation of the monetary system.It is worth noting one other potential barrier to using antitrust laws to break up Big Tech. In the US, at least, such laws have focused primarily on protecting consumers. Recognising that, many digital platforms have avoided hurting consumers, instead gouging the sellers who use their services to connect to buyers. But there is growing research, such as that\u00a0conducted\u00a0by Suresh Naidu, Eric Posner and Glen Weyl, indicating that antitrust law should also be applied to protecting workers.Still, given the ways digital platforms have transformed markets, governments must think beyond antitrust. One approach worth considering focuses not on breaking up tech giants, but rather on ensuring that their profits are more widely shared. This could be achieved, say, with regulations that require platforms over a certain size to disperse shares to a large number of individuals and also to funds dedicated to providing domestic and global public goods.For the most influential platforms, governments may consider pushing a gradual shift to non-profit models, akin to public utilities. To be sure, this approach should be used sparingly, to avoid excessive and burdensome state intervention in the economy. But it is not in society's interest to have a single organisation that is integral to the functioning of the entire economy, whether a central bank or digital platform, run by a small coterie of individuals for their own gain.The precise contours of a strategy for constraining Big Tech will emerge, and evolve, over time. But I am hopeful that either Sanders or Warren, two politicians who seem to have the right 'moral intention', would be able to lead that process in a way that serves the interests of consumers, workers and business owners alike.\u00a0Kaushik Basu, former chief economist of the World Bank and former chief economic adviser to the government of India, is professor of economics at Cornell University and non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u00a9Project Syndicate, 2016.\u00a0<br/>www.project-syndicate.org<br/>MENAFN0311201900280000ID1099213727</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOENG-1099213727</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOENG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XDS-29X1-F04Y-T453-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300986</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"990\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Global English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 2, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DMKX</classCode><className>BUSINESS REPORTS &amp;

How should they be controlled?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NOT long ago, being the boss of a big Western tech firm was a dream job. As the billions rolled in, so did the plaudits: Google, Facebook, Amazon and others were making the world a better place. Today these companies are accused of being BAADD\u2014big, anti-competitive, addictive and destructive to democracy. Regulators fine them, politicians grill them and one-time backers warn of their power to cause harm. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Much of this techlash is misguided. The presumption that big businesses must necessarily be wicked is plain wrong. Apple is to be admired as the world's most valuable listed company for the simple reason that it makes things people want to buy, even while facing fierce competition. Many online services would be worse if their providers were smaller. Evidence for the link between smartphones and unhappiness is weak. Fake news is not only an online phenomenon.</p><p>But big tech platforms, particularly Facebook, Google and Amazon, do indeed raise a worry about fair competition. That is partly because they often benefit from legal exemptions. Unlike publishers, Facebook and Google are rarely held responsible for what users do on them; and for years most American buyers on Amazon did not pay sales tax. Nor do the titans simply compete in a market. Increasingly, they are the market itself, providing the infrastructure (or \"platforms\") for much of the digital economy. Many of their services appear to be free, but users \"pay\" for them by giving away their data. Powerful though they already are, their huge stockmarket valuations suggest that investors are counting on them to double or even triple in size in the next decade.</p><p>There is thus a justified fear that the tech titans will use their power to protect and extend their dominance, to the detriment of consumers (see page 21). The tricky task for policymakers is to restrain them without unduly stifling innovation.</p><p>The platforms have become so dominant because they benefit from \"network effects\". Size begets size: the more sellers Amazon, say, can attract, the more buyers will shop there, which attracts more sellers, and so on. By some estimates, Amazon captures over 40% of online shopping in America. With more than 2bn monthly users, Facebook holds sway over the media industry.  Firms cannot do without Google, which in some countries processes more than 90% of web searches. Facebook and Google control two-thirds of America's online ad revenues.</p><p>America's trustbusters have given tech giants the benefit of the doubt. They look for consumer harm, which is hard to establish when prices are falling and services are \"free\". The firms themselves stress that a giant-killing startup is just a click away and that they could be toppled by a new technology, such as the blockchain. Before Google and Facebook, Alta Vista and MySpace were the bee's knees. Who remembers them?</p><p>However, the barriers to entry are rising. Facebook not only owns the world's largest pool of personal data, but also its biggest \"social graph\"\u2014the list of its members and how they are connected. Amazon has more pricing information than any other firm. Voice assistants, such as Amazon's Alexa and Google's Assistant, will give them even more control over how people experience the internet. China's tech firms have the heft to compete, but are not about to get unfettered access to Western consumers. </p><p>If this trend runs its course, consumers will suffer as the tech industry becomes less vibrant. Less money will go into startups, most good ideas will be bought up by the titans and, one way or another, the profits will be captured by the giants.</p><p>The early signs are already visible. The European Commission has accused Google of using control of Android, its mobile operating system, to give its own apps a leg up. Facebook keeps buying firms which could one day lure users away: first Instagram, then WhatsApp and most recently tbh, an app that lets teenagers send each other compliments anonymously. Although Amazon is still increasing competition in aggregate, as industries from groceries to television can attest, it can also spot rivals and squeeze them from the market. </p><p>What to do? In the past, societies have tackled monopolies either by breaking them up, as with Standard Oil in 1911, or by regulating them as a public utility, as with AT&amp;T in 1913. Today both those approaches have big drawbacks. The traditional tools of utilities regulation, such as price controls and profit caps, are hard to apply, since most products are free and would come at a high price in forgone investment and innovation. Likewise, a full-scale break-up would cripple the platforms' economies of scale, worsening the service they offer consumers. And even then, in all likelihood one of the Googlettes or Facebabies would eventually sweep all before it as the inexorable logic of network effects reasserted itself.</p><p>The lack of a simple solution deprives politicians of easy slogans, but does not leave trustbusters impotent. Two broad changes of thinking would go a long way towards sensibly taming the titans. The first is to make better use of existing competition law. Trustbusters should scrutinise mergers to gauge whether a deal is likely to neutralise a potential long-term threat, even if the target is small at the time. Such scrutiny might have prevented Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and Google's of Waze, which makes navigation software. To ensure that the platforms do not favour their own products, oversight groups could be set up to deliberate on complaints from rivals\u2014a bit like the independent \"technical committee\" created by the antitrust case against Microsoft in 2001. Immunity to content liability must go, too.</p><p>Second, trustbusters need to think afresh about how tech markets work. A central insight, one increasingly discussed among economists and regulators, is that personal data are the currency in which customers actually buy services. Through that prism, the tech titans receive valuable information\u2014on their users' behaviour, friends and purchasing habits\u2014in return for their products. Just as America drew up sophisticated rules about intellectual property in the 19th century, so it needs a new set of laws to govern the ownership and exchange of data, with the aim of giving solid rights to individuals.</p><p>In essence this means giving people more control over their information. If a user so desires, key data should be made available in real time to other firms\u2014as banks in Europe are now required to do with customers' account information. Regulators could oblige platform firms to make anonymised bulk data available to competitors, in return for a fee, a bit like the compulsory licensing of a patent. Such data-sharing requirements could be calibrated to firms' size: the bigger platforms are, the more they have to share. These mechanisms would turn data from something titans hoard, to suppress competition, into something users share, to foster innovation.</p><p>None of this will be simple, but it would tame the titans without wrecking the gains they have brought. Users would find it easier to switch between services. Upstart competitors would have access to some of the data that larger firms hold and thus be better equipped to grow to maturity without being gobbled up. And shareholders could no longer assume monopoly profits for decades to come. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECON-RG6VFQS</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECON2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RF9-C2W1-DY2R-215W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7955</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-01-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1235\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Economist Newspapers Ltd.

Rich with detail, the report describes how Facebook researched ways to reduce the spread of divisive content on the platform, and in many cases set aside the recommendations of employees working on the problem. Here are Jeff Horwitz and Deepa Seetharaman:</p><p><br/>\"Our algorithms exploit the human brain's attraction to divisiveness,\" read a slide from a 2018 presentation. \"If left unchecked,\" it warned, Facebook would feed users \"more and more divisive content in an effort to gain user attention &amp; increase time on the platform.\" [...]<br/>Fixing the polarization problem would be difficult, requiring Facebook to rethink some of its core products. Most notably, the project forced Facebook to consider how it prioritized \"user engagement\"-a metric involving time spent, likes, shares and comments that for years had been the lodestar of its system.<br/>The first thing to say is that \"polarization\" can mean a lot of things, and that can make the discussion about Facebook's contribution to the problem difficult. You can use it in a narrow sense to talk about the way that a news feed full of partisan sentiment could divide the country. But you could also use it as an umbrella term to talk about initiatives related to what Facebook and other social networks have lately taken to calling \"platform integrity\" - removing hate speech, for example, or labeling misinformation.<br/>The second thing to say about \"polarization\" is that while it has a lot of negative effects, it's worth thinking about what your proposed alternative to it would be. Is it national unity? One-party rule? Or just everyone being more polite to one another? The question gets at the challenge of \"fighting\" polarization if you're a tech company CEO: even if you see it as an enemy, it's not clear what metric you would rally your company around to deal with it.<br/>Anyway, Facebook reacted to the Journal report with significant frustration. Guy Rosen, who oversees these efforts, published a blog post on Wednesday laying out some of the steps the company has taken since 2016 to fight \"polarization\" - here used in that umbrella-term sense of the word. The steps include shifting the News Feed to include more posts from friends and family than publishers; starting a fact-checking program; more rapidly detecting hate speech and other malicious content using machine-learning systems and an expanded content moderation workforce; and removing groups that violate Facebook policies from algorithmic recommendations.<br/>Rosen writes:<br/>We've taken a number of important steps to reduce the amount of content that could drive polarization on our platform, sometimes at the expense of revenues. This job won't ever be complete because at the end of the day, online discourse is an extension of society and ours is highly polarized. But it is our job to reduce polarization's impact on how people experience our products. We are committed to doing just that.<br/>Among the reasons the company was frustrated with the story, according to an internal Workplace post I saw, is that Facebook had spent \"several months\" talking with the Journal reporters about their findings. The company gave them a variety of executives to speak with on and off the record, including Joel Kaplan, its vice president of global public policy, who often pops up in stories like this to complain that some action might disproportionately hurt conservatives.<br/>In any case, there are two things I think are worth mentioning about this story and Facebook's response to it. One is an internal tension in the way Facebook thinks about polarization. And the other is my worry that asking Facebook to solve for divisiveness could distract from the related but distinct issues around the viral promotion of conspiracies, misinformation, and hate speech.<br/>First, that internal tension. On one hand, the initiatives Rosen describes to fight polarization are all real. Facebook has invested significantly in platform integrity over the past several years. And, as some Facebook employees told me yesterday, there are good reasons not to implement every suggestion a team brings you. Some might be less effective than other efforts that were implemented, for example, or they might have unintended negative consequences. Clearly some employees on the team feel like most of their ideas weren't used, or were watered down, including employees I've spoken with myself over the years. But that's true of a lot of teams at a lot of companies, and it doesn't mean that all their efforts were for nought.<br/>On the other hand, Facebook executives largely reject the idea that the platform is polarizing in the tearing-the-country-apart sense of the word. The C-suite read closely a working paper that my colleague Ezra Klein wrote about earlier this year that casts doubt on social networks' contribution to the problem. The paper by Levi Boxell, Matthew Gentzkow, and Jesse Shapiro studies what is known as \"affective polarization,\" which Klein defines as \"the difference between how warmly people view the political party they favor and the political party they oppose.\" They found that affective polarization had increased faster in the United States than anywhere else - but that in several large, modernized nations with high internet usage, polarization was actually decreasing. Klein wrote:<br/>One theory this lets us reject is that polarization is a byproduct of internet penetration or digital media usage. Internet usage has risen fastest in countries with falling polarization, and much of the run-up in US polarization predates digital media and is concentrated among older populations with more analogue news habits.<br/>Klein, who published a book on the subject this year, believes that social networks contribute to polarization in other ways. But the fact that there are many large countries where Facebook usage is high and polarization is decreasing helps to explain why the issue is not top of mind for Facebook's C-suite. As does Mark Zuckerberg's own stated inclination against platforms making editorial judgments on speech. (Which he reiterated at a virtual shareholders' meeting today.)<br/>So here you have a case where Facebook can be \"right\" in a platform integrity sense - look at all these anti-polarization initiatives! - while the Journal is right in a larger one: Facebook has been designed as a place for open discussion, and human nature ensures that those discussions will often be heated and polarizing, and the company has chosen to take a relatively light touch in managing the debates. And it does so because executives think the world benefits from raucous, few-holds-barred discussions, and because they aren't persuaded that those discussions are tearing countries apart.<br/>Where Facebook can't wriggle off the hook, I think, is in the Journal's revelation of just how important its algorithmic choices have been in the spread of polarizing speech. Again, here the problem isn't \"polarization\" in the abstract - but in concrete harms related to anti-science, conspiracy, and hate groups, which grow using Facebook's tools. The company often suggests that its embrace of free speech has created a neutral platform, when in fact its design choices often reward division with greater distribution.<br/>This is the part of the Journal's report that I found most compelling:<br/>The high number of extremist groups was concerning, the presentation says. Worse was Facebook's realization that its algorithms were responsible for their growth. The 2016 presentation states that \"64% of all extremist group joins are due to our recommendation tools\" and that most of the activity came from the platform's \"Groups You Should Join\" and \"Discover\" algorithms: \"Our recommendation systems grow the problem.\"<br/>Facebook says that extremist groups are no longer recommended. But just today, the disinformation researcher Nina Jankowicz joined an \"alternative health\" group on Facebook and immediately saw recommendations that she join other groups related to white supremacy, anti-vaccine activism, and QAnon.<br/>Ultimately, despite its efforts so far, Facebook continues to unwittingly recruit followers for bad actors, who use it to spread hate speech and misinformation detrimental to the public health. The good news is that the company has teams working on those problems, and surely will develop new solutions over time. The question raised by the Journal is, when that happens, how closely their bosses will listen to them.<br/>II.<br/>On Tuesday, Twitter added a link to two of President Trump's tweets , designating them as \"potentially misleading.\" It took this action because Trump, as part of a disinformation campaign alleging that voting by mail will trigger massive vote fraud, was appearing to interfere with the democratic process in violation of the company's policies.<br/>Trump was outraged about the links, and tweeted about being censored to his 80 million followers. He threatened to shut down social media companies. He said \"big action\" would follow. At the direction of a White House spokeswoman, right-wing trolls began to harass Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity, who has previously tweeted criticism of Trump. Members of Congress including Marco Rubio and Josh Hawley tweeted that Twitter's action could not stand, and that social platforms should lose Section 230 protections for moderating speech - willfully misunderstanding Section 230 in the way that they always do. Late in the day, there was word of a forthcoming executive order, with no other details.<br/>I could spend a lot of time here speculating about the coming battle between social networks and the Republican establishment, with Silicon Valley's struggling efforts to moderate their unwieldy platforms going head-to-head with Republicans' bad-faith attempts to portray them as politically biased. But the past few years have taught us that while Congress is happy to kick and scream about the failures of tech platforms, it remains loath to actually regulate them.<br/>It's true that we have seen some apparent retaliation from Trump against social networks - the strange fair housing suit filed against Facebook last year comes to mind. And several antitrust cases are currently underway that could result in significant action. But for the most part, as Makena Kelly writes today in The Verge, the bluster is as far as it ever really goes:<br/>The president has never followed through on his threats and used his considerable powers to place legal limits on how these companies operate. His fights with the tech companies last just long enough to generate headlines, but flame out before they can make a meaningful policy impact. And despite the wave of conservative anger currently raining down on Twitter, there's no reason to think this one will be any different.<br/>Those flameouts are most tangible in the courts. On the same day as Trump's tweets, the US Court of Appeals in Washington ruled against the nonprofit group Freedom Watch and fringe right figure Laura Loomer in a case purporting that Facebook, Google, and Twitter conspired to suppress conservative content online, according to Bloomberg. Whether it be Loomer or Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) fighting the bias battle, the courts have yet to rule in their favor.<br/>In fact, as former Twitter spokesman Nu Wexler noted, Trump has even less leverage over Twitter than he does over other tech companies. \"Twitter don't sell political ads, they're not big enough for an antitrust threat, and he's clearly hooked on the platform,\" Wexler tweeted. And whatever Trump may think, as the law professor Kate Klonick noted, \"The First Amendment protects Twitter from Trump. The First Amendment doesn't protect Trump from Twitter.\"<br/>Facts and logic aside, get ready: you're about to hear a lot more cries from people complaining that they have been censored by Twitter. And it will be all over Twitter.<br/>The RatioToday in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M1072113</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6042-MMR1-JBYT-H27S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2017\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 12, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

In 1890, prompted by the \"deep-seated abhorrence of the invasions of social privacy\" made possible by Kodak cameras, US lawyers Louis Brandeis and Samuel Warren wrote an influential tract called <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Right to Privacy</emphasis> that attempted to delineate the boundary between personal and public spheres.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For most of us, a degree of privacy is important, even if we may struggle to say why. \"Privacy is far from being dead,\" says digital anthropologist <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/jkrueckeberg?lang=en\">Jennifer Krueckeberg</url> at the University of Hamburg in Germany. \"It is an existential need, a condition in which we feel safe, comfortable and secure.\"</p><p>In the internet era, invasions of privacy come from two main directions. First, large parts of the web have been engineered by commercial companies to monitor our every online move in the name of profit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article-topic/google/\">Google</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article-topic/facebook/\">Facebook</url> and the like make their billions by selling advertising       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23731640-500-how-google-and-facebook-hooked-us-and-how-to-break-the-habit/\">targeted to desires we may not even be aware we have</url>.

If we do, our reward is better services, whether improved search results or more relevant recommendations. In practice, however, the near-monopoly positions of certain big tech firms make it very difficult for you to avoid giving them your personal data, and we have only very rudimentary control over how it is used.</p><p>Similar trade-offs exist in government monitoring of our online activities. The internet has become our main channel of communication. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23331100-600-encryption-wars-the-privacy-debate-raging-in-your-smartphone/\">end-to-end encryption of messaging services</url> such as WhatsApp or Telegram, for example, is a boon also to the privacy of those who would do society harm \u2013 and leads to the desire of security services to find \"back doors\" into such services.</p><p>Finding the correct balance between personal privacy and public security isn't a new challenge, but the existence of large amounts of data about all of us online has tipped that balance. In November, for example, a judge in Florida issued a warrant for police to search personal genetic profiles that more than a million people had uploaded to GEDmatch, a site used to trace ancestry, for matches to DNA from a crime scene. The law wouldn't allow police to take a million DNA swabs of random people on the street without reasonable grounds to believe they were implicated in a crime.</p><p>Something to hide?</p><p>Such new invasions of privacy are often justified by the \"nothing to hide\" argument: if you are doing nothing wrong, you have nothing to fear from surveillance and everything to gain through increased protection against criminals, extremists and terrorists. But that argument is valid only as long as your definition of what constitutes a criminal, extremist or terrorist coincides with the state's: just ask those involved in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2206831-does-people-power-make-a-difference-the-truth-about-protests/\">recent street protests in Hong Kong.</url></p><p>Public disquiet about privacy seems to be growing. A recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2019/11/15/americans-and-privacy-concerned-confused-and-feeling-lack-of-control-over-their-personal-information/\">survey in the US</url> conducted by the Pew Research Center, a think tank based in Washington DC, found that 81 per cent of people thought that the risks and downsides of companies collecting personal data outweighed the potential benefits; 66 per cent said the same about government data collection.</p><p>Some imbalance is perhaps to be expected as established norms and boundaries shift in the online world. Rules such as the European Union's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article-topic/gdpr/\">General Data Protection Regulation</url>, implemented last year, represent an attempt to reset the dial, at least in the commercial sphere. \"We're in the middle of renegotiating what privacy means,\" says Krueckeberg. She is confident that we can regain at least some control. \"People are not helpless victims of the internet.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSCI-mg24432601300</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWSCI2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR1-8NC1-DY5K-Y00D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158275</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"637\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 New Scientist Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>New Scientist</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"17543\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issn>ISSN: 0262 4079</issn><volume>Vol. 244</volume><issueNumber>No. 3260</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 11, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

No one is beyond the reach of this constant digital surveillance. Not even the president of the United States.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Times Privacy Project  was given a dataset with more than 50 billion location pings, and it took only minutes -- with assistance from publicly available information -- for us to deanonymize location data and track the whereabouts of President Trump. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  A single dot appeared on the screen, representing the precise location of someone in President Trump's entourage at 7:10 a.m. It lingered around the grounds of the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla., where the president was staying, for about an hour.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Then it was on the move.</p><p>  The dot traveled to the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, about 30 minutes north of the hotel, pinging again at 9:24 a.m. just outside the compound. The president was there to play golf with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan.</p><p>  There the dot stayed until at least 1:12 p.m., when it moved to the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, where the world leaders enjoyed a private lunch.</p><p>  By 5:08 p.m., the phone was back at Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>  The president had what he called a working dinner with Mr. Abe there that night.</p><p>  The device's owner was easy to trace, with the location pings revealing the outline of the person's work and life. The same phone pinged a dozen times at the nearby Secret Service field office and at events with elected officials. From computer screens more than 1,000 miles away, we could watch the person travel from exclusive areas at Palm Beach International Airport to Mar-a-Lago.</p><p>  The meticulous movements -- down to a few feet -- of the president's entourage were recorded by a smartphone we believe belonged to a Secret Service agent, whose home was also clearly identifiable in the data. Connecting the home to public deeds revealed the person's name, along with the name of the person's spouse, exposing even more details about both families.</p><p>  We could also see other stops this person made, apparently more connected with his private life than his public duties. The Secret Service declined to comment on our findings or describe its policies regarding location data.</p><p>  The vulnerability of the person we tracked in Mr. Trump's entourage is one that many if not all of us share: the apps (weather services, maps, perhaps even something as mundane as a coupon saver) collecting and sharing his phone's location.</p><p>  Americans have grown eerily accustomed to being tracked throughout their digital lives. But it's far from their fault. It's a result of a system in which data surveillance practices are hidden from consumers and in which much of the collection of information is done without the full knowledge of the device holders.</p><p>  For the nation's security agencies, however, privacy is critical to the safety of their operations across the country and abroad. If threats to that privacy have seemed abstract in the past, the trove of location data we have analyzed has brought them into sharp relief. Military and intelligence officials have long been concerned about how their movements could be exposed; now every move is.</p><p>  As a senior Defense Department official said to Times Opinion, even the Pentagon has told employees to expect that their privacy is compromised: ''We want our people to understand: They should make no assumptions about anonymity. You are not anonymous on this planet at this point in our existence. Everyone is trackable, traceable, discoverable to some degree.''</p><p>  We were able to track smartphones in nearly every major government building and facility in Washington. We could follow them back to homes and, ultimately, learn their owners' true identities. Even a prominent senator's national security adviser -- someone for whom privacy and security are everyday issues -- was identified and tracked in the data.</p><p>  While the Constitution prevents companies from sharing location data with the government without a warrant, there are no federal protections limiting how they use or share it otherwise. No such protections are being debated before Congress -- even though we found that we could track people through Congress's own halls as easily as any place else.</p><p>  When we reached out to some lawmakers to show what we found, the outrage proved bipartisan.</p><p>  ''This is terrifying,'' said Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, who has called for the federal government to take a tougher stance toward tech companies. ''It is terrifying not just because of the major national security implications, what Beijing could get ahold of. But it also raises personal privacy concerns for individuals and families. These companies are tracking our kids.''</p><p>  Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat running for president, voiced similar concerns. ''Tech companies are profiting by spying on Americans -- trampling on the right to privacy and risking our national security,'' she told us. ''They are throwing around their power to undermine our democracy with zero consequences. This report is another alarming case for why we need to break up big tech, adopt serious privacy regulations and hold top executives of these companies personally responsible.''</p><p>  Agencies can limit how their employees use location-sharing apps and services, but that doesn't mean those guidelines will be strictly enforced -- or extended to personal devices.</p><p>  But no matter how comprehensive an organization's policies and regulations are, getting everyone to follow them is nearly impossible, as many of these apps' surveillance practices are not visible to consumers.</p><p>  ''The human being is the weak link,'' said Martijn Rasser, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer who is now a senior fellow in the technology and national security program at the Center for a New American Security. ''It's really difficult to enforce a lot of these rules and regulations. Sometimes, all it takes is one person to violate the rules to completely negate the purpose of having those rules in the first place.''</p><p>  Despite the sensitivity of this information, it is widely exploited. Packaged with millions of other data points, location information is turned into marketing analysis and sold to financial institutions, real estate investors, advertising companies and others. Companies say they vet partners carefully and tend to work with larger players that have a clear business case for receiving the data.</p><p>  Like all data, the vast location files are vulnerable to hacks, leaks or sale. The data we reviewed was provided to Times Opinion by people who asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to share it and could face severe penalties for doing so.</p><p>  Multiple experts with ties to the United States' national security agencies warned in interviews that Russia, North Korea, China and other adversaries may be working to steal, buy or otherwise obtain this kind of data. Only months ago intelligence officials told Reuters that hackers working for the Chinese government were breaking into telecom networks to get location data for people moving throughout Asia.</p><p>  ''People literally go to work every day, sit down at a desk, check the sports, send an email or two to their girlfriend and then start looking for databases they can steal,'' said James Dempsey, the executive director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology. ''They just do that 9 to 5, every day.''</p><p>  The American government may conduct similar intelligence operations against its adversaries, experts said, though under stricter legal frameworks.</p><p>  Using the data, we identified people in positions of power by following smartphone pings at the White House, Capitol Hill, the Supreme Court and other government facilities. In many cases, the data trails led back to the smartphone users' homes. In this series, we did not name any of the identified people without their permission. And the data below has been obscured to protect device owners.</p><p>  Connecting a ping to a person was as easy as combining home and work locations with public information. A seemingly random set of movements turned into a clear individual pattern after we added just one other piece of information.</p><p>  Plenty of corroborating information is already floating around dark corners of the web, given the frequent high-profile data breaches of the past decade. Consider what China already knows: In 2015, a federal database containing the personal information of more than four million people with security clearances was stolen by Chinese hackers presumed to be state actors.</p><p>  ''From those very detailed documents, they may gather a good deal of information about a person,'' said David S. Kris, a co-founder of the consulting firm Culper Partners and former assistant attorney general for the national security division of the Department of Justice. Mr. Kris said he was included in the data that was hacked. ''The more you can combine location-based data into a mosaic with other information, the more likely you are to gain real insight into an adversary.''</p><p>  Location data potentially gives any enemy an opening for attack. Russians, whose intelligence apparatus has striven for decades to disrupt American democracy, could simply leak location information to embarrass the government, the legal system or particular officials.</p><p>  ''Think about Russia's efforts to undermine public trust and confidence in our democratic institutions,'' Suzanne Spaulding, senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a former under secretary at the Department of Homeland Security, told us. ''Think about all of the ways they could use location data to do that. Think about tracking judges everywhere they went and how you could use that to undermine confidence in our courts and our justice system.''</p><p>  After Ms. Spaulding raised the danger of tracking judges, we checked the data file for courthouse employees. In minutes, we found dozens of potential targets by watching smartphones sharing their precise locations inside Washington courthouses. One person whose movements we traced has a job in I.T. for the Supreme Court.</p><p>  In the hands of bad actors, such tracking could put the safety of people with political power -- and our national security -- at risk. Experts told Times Opinion that foreign governments could use the data to monitor sensitive sites and identify people with access to them, and their associates.</p><p>  ''Not everybody in the department has a national security position, not everybody has access to classified or higher-level stuff,'' the senior defense official said. ''But everyone in the department is of some interest or value to a lot of adversaries just by virtue of being a member of the Defense Department, just by working at the Pentagon.''</p><p>  The possibilities for blackmail are endless. Stolen details on sexual interests and extramarital affairs can provide opportunities for extortion. Targets could be coerced in ways large and small to take actions for a foreign government. Or the locations themselves could provide valuable intelligence about security practices, contacts, schedules and the identities of people in prominent and sensitive posts that give them access to state secrets or critical infrastructure.</p><p>  With no training and far more limited technical tools than those of a state intelligence service, we were able to use the location data -- date, time and length of stay -- to make basic inferences. By determining whether two people were in the same place at the same time, it was easy to zero in on spouses, co-workers or friends.</p><p>  Cataloging their movements revealed even more associations, creating the map of a robust social network that would be nearly impossible to determine through traditional surveillance. In cases where it was difficult to identify an individual, associations offered more clues about workplaces and interests.</p><p>  In one case, it proved difficult to confirm the identity of a man listed in public records who had a common name. Examining his associations revealed that he met multiple times with someone carrying another phone that was being tracked. That person was, we soon learned, his brother. That piece of information doubled the pool of digital breadcrumbs to follow, ultimately helping confirm both of their identities.</p><p>  Now consider elections. Bad actors could monitor candidates and elected leaders for intelligence that could be leaked or used to blackmail them. There are also no regulations limiting how long location data can be stored. Data swept up today may prove valuable in the future, as everyday citizens rise to positions of authority and influence only to have their precise movements from years gone by reviewed for damaging insights.</p><p>  Defense contractors and employees at secure locations like power plants are all at risk.</p><p>  We found smartphone pings at all of these sorts of sites. In one case, someone who spent weekdays at the Pentagon visited a mental health and substance abuse clinic multiple times.</p><p>  Even just commuting to work can be risky for people in prominent positions. ''The easiest way to figure out how to get to you is know you always have the same routine,'' said Mr. Rasser, the former C.I.A. officer. He said he mixes up his own routine, partly because the agency emphasized such methods when he joined.</p><p>  The threats will only grow as more data is collected and shared. More apps will enter the marketplace using tracking technology. And companies are becoming more sophisticated at collecting location data, adding signals from Wi-Fi networks and Bluetooth beacons. They also often rely on one-time consent or disclosures that don't explicitly state what's collected and shared.</p><p>  Experts emphasized how location data has joined many other kinds of sensitive information in the espionage toolkit, showing how intelligence agencies must continually adapt to the digital age.</p><p>  ''We need to learn to operate with fewer secrets,'' Ms. Spaulding said.</p><p>  Even areas once thought to be secure showed up in the data. Personal phones aren't generally allowed inside the C.I.A. or the National Security Agency. But while no pings registered inside the C.I.A. headquarters, we found thousands of pings in the parking lots outside, with trails that led to the homes of likely employees.</p><p>  Similarly, there were no blackout areas in many sensitive government buildings. We observed thousands of pings inside the Pentagon, on military bases, in F.B.I. headquarters and in Secret Service offices across the country. (Intelligence facilities also have secure areas where certain electronic devices aren't permitted.)</p><p>  The risks posed by location-tracking remain largely unaddressed by the government. Beginning last year, the Department of Defense prohibited geolocation features and functionality from being used by its workers on devices in ''operational areas'' like foreign military bases. For all other locations, the department said it would consider the risks and issue specific recommendations to personnel.</p><p>  For now, the department does not issue guidance to employees about downloading specific apps, including those that might share location data with third parties. ''Instead, we focused on certain core characteristics of the geolocation functionality and identified what risks those characteristics posed,'' a department spokesman, Lt. Col. Uriah L. Orland, said in an email.</p><p>  Agencies with a need for heightened security are left in a vulnerable position. Phones are ubiquitous, and so long as granular location tracking remains legal, even the Defense Department must play along. ''We cannot stop our work force of 3.6 million people from living their everyday lives,'' a senior department official told us.</p><p>  We haven't identified any serving elected representatives in our data, but we found a former House representative and dozens of prominent public officials, including chiefs of staff, security officials and congressional staff members.</p><p>  With their proximity to public figures with public schedules and their presence at training sites and field offices, Secret Service agents were particularly easy to identify. With little difficulty, we were able to track a Secret Service agent who spent most of his daytime hours in the West Wing of the White House. He also joined President Trump at the National Cathedral the day after the inauguration.</p><p>  While the data reviewed by Times Opinion is from three years ago, similar information is being collected daily and often resold to third parties, meaning anyone with current access to such data could feasibly, in near real time, track people within arm's reach of the president.</p><p>  ''If you want to take action against someone, you have to find them first,'' said Mr. Kris, the former Department of Justice official. ''I'm wary of breathless, pearl-clutching, speculative, sensationalistic counterintelligence concerns. This doesn't strike me as falling into that category. I think there is a legitimate concern here.''</p><p>  Leaked location data may open the door to other cyber vulnerabilities. Foreign actors could learn movement details and infer meeting locations, which could be used to conduct a type of scam where targets receive fake emails, including a phony link meant to steal your password or install malware.</p><p>  In 2017, Strava, a company that makes a fitness app, released a global map showing 700 million activities that clearly revealed American military bases abroad. The Department of Defense issued its recent guidance after discovering the problem. The data reviewed by Times Opinion revealed several points on domestic military bases as well, showing how some of the nation's most secure armed sites can be exposed.</p><p>  It's not necessary for someone to visit sensitive locations to be vulnerable to scrutiny or criticism. Location data could become a powerful political tool, exposing the private lives of wealthy elites who prefer to project a more egalitarian persona. It is not difficult to imagine efforts to undermine a political campaign by exposing a candidate's travels through private airports or visits to expensive restaurants and luxurious spas.</p><p>  The people who provided the trove of location information to Times Opinion did so to press for regulation and increased oversight of the location data market. Some solutions exist that could help improve privacy while allowing businesses to still perform some of the analysis they do today, like limiting the ability to identify individual paths, changing how long the information is stored and limiting how it's sold.</p><p>  So far, Washington has done virtually nothing to address the threats, and location data companies have every reason to keep refining their tracking, sucking up more data and selling it to the highest bidders.Stuart A.

From the latest tech gadget, smart phone, tablet or software application - they're in the know when it comes to gadgets. </p><p>They move quickly, appreciate innovation and are all about instant gratification. As such, they can be difficult to manage and impossible to retain. But retaining them is key, as an Experience study says that it will cost you more than $24,000 to replace a Millennial employee. Ouch. Optimizing efficiency and retaining your employees is going to be the key to your success. But how to optimize efficiency in a distracted world where social media reigns? Here are our best tips for how to use technology to boost Millennial efficiency at your organization.&lt;nl/&gt; Choose a versatile, modern line of business application.&lt;nl/&gt;If you haven't seen one of the hundreds of articles we've done on mobility and versatile software, listen up: the workforce is mobile. 45% of Millennials choose flexibility over pay - so you better make sure that your software can support that. Your employees shouldn't have to remote into an aging server or slow connection to access your documents. Consider a cloud move or choose a Software as a Service (SaaS) that has an application that will allow users to work from anywhere.&lt;nl/&gt; Give them a way to manage their workflow. One that's documented.&lt;nl/&gt;While Millennials prefer change (their average tenure is only 2 years), they also need continuity. If you don't have documented processes and workflows in place - the learning curve is exponential. But don't just take the time to make documentation - you need to have software that helps them be productive. Whether that's a task management software or project and time tracking software - pick one, stick with it and make sure they're trained on exactly how to work with the software to manage their workflows.&lt;nl/&gt; Help them manage their time more wisely - with plugins.&lt;nl/&gt;While no one wants to be told what you do - no business owner can ignore the massive distraction that exists on Twitter and Facebook. While blocking the website entirely is a little too Big Brother for most Millennial employees, most would appreciate insight on how to be more productive. The Google Chrome extension 'Stay Focusd' allows users to regulate how much time they spend on particular websites (ahem Tumblr, Reddit, Facebook, Twitter) and even block websites entirely. You can also use the 'nuclear' option which is not able to be cancelled and will block certain sites on your block list for a certain period of time. (Perfect for the procrastinator with a tight deadline).&lt;nl/&gt; Listen.&lt;nl/&gt;Sometimes business owners are so overwhelmingly 'talk' focused (memos, meetings and calls) that they forget they hired on talented, dynamic staff. Millennials are so plugged in, they often know the next big tech tool before most businesses. Embrace this quality and allow your employees to be beta testers for new productivity applications and tools. Processes are a great thing, but everything can be improved.&lt;nl/&gt; According to Time Magazine, 3 out of 4 employees will be Millennials by 2025. That's not as far off as you think. Start making the changes to help your Millennial employees be as efficient as possible and you're far more likely to keep them around in the long term and boost the bottom line in the process.&lt;nl/&gt;

Two global power centers are set to clash Wednesday as the CEOs of tech giants Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook testify before House lawmakers on allegations their companies are harming consumers by unfairly stifling the competition.    The hearing marks the first time the four tech moguls \u2014 whose companies are roughly worth a combined $5 trillion \u2014 have jointly testified before Congress, and it\u2019s the first congressional outing ever for Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s richest person. The session also arrives as scrutiny of the behemoths is surging across the globe, including an expected Justice Department antitrust case against Google and the recent launch of two European probes of potential anticompetitive behavior by Apple.      But whether Wednesday\u2019s showdown lives up to its historic billing may depend on a host of factors: The lawmakers could veer far from the antitrust script, into Democrats\u2019 concerns about online hate speech or GOP accusations of anti-conservative bias. Some Republicans have already accused Democrats of harboring \u201cpreconceived conclusions\u201d in favor of breaking up the tech giants, adding to the dangers of a partisan food fight breaking out.     Even the format of the questioning \u2014 four elite CEOs, all appearing by videoconference because of the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 could make it harder for the members to land a glove on the companies\u2019 varied issues, ranging from Google's and Facebook\u2019s command of digital ad revenue to Apple's control of its App Store and questions about whether Amazon misled Congress.    Here\u2019s what to expect as Bezos, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai testify before the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee \u2014 and the potential surprises that may await:   For Bezos: Did Amazon lie to Congress last year?   House lawmakers are expected to grill Bezos about whether a company lawyer misled the Judiciary Committee last summer by testifying that Amazon doesn\u2019t use the data it collects from third-party vendors to launch competing products on its platform.    The W all Street Journal subsequently reported that Amazon employees did in fact use the sellers\u2019 data to inform the company\u2019s own products. The revelation prompted Judiciary leaders to raise the specter of referring Amazon to prosecutors for perjury charges, while Amazon disputed the accuracy of the Journal's account and said it did not offer \"intentionally misleading\" testimony. Amazon also promised to conduct an internal investigation but hasn\u2019t offered any public updates on its progress.    Now that Bezos is appearing before them, some lawmakers  say they plan to push him to account for the discrepancy.    \u201cI do have concerns about testimony that was given to me under oath that I will be following up on from the last hearing,\u201d said subcommittee member Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), who questioned Amazon associate general counsel Nate Sutton about the practice at a hearing last July.    Meanwhile, the Journal last week raised similar questions about Amazon\u2019s treatment of tech startups that had sought investments from the company\u2019s venture capital fund.   For Zuckerberg: Facebook's thirst for growth   Facebook's past acquisitions of former rivals WhatsApp and Instagram have drawn significant attention on Capitol Hill in recent years. Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) told POLITICO last year that \"there ought to have been more review\" of the deals, which had won approval from regulators during the Obama administration. Others, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), have called for regulators to break up Facebook and have singled out those mergers as targets for rolling back.    The committee has also demanded answers from Facebook on whether it devotes resources to identifying and tracking promising startups. Lawmakers have expressed concern that Facebook and the other giants are uniquely positioned to duplicate, acquire or otherwise drive out up-and-coming rivals.    The company's massive trove of user data is also set to draw scrutiny. Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.), vice chair of the antitrust subcommittee, said he hopes to press the company about whether the massive amounts of personal information it collects from more than 2 billion users makes it too difficult for competitors to keep up.    \"There's a real fear that no other competitor could ever successfully launch a social media platform because it could never match Facebook's troves of data, which, given their record, it's a serious threat to users,\" he told POLITICO.   For Pichai: Google's dominance of digital ads and search   Google is the world\u2019s No. 1 player in the $162.3 billion market for online display ads, in part because it runs the most dominant search engine. Now it\u2019s facing rising scrutiny from state and federal regulators on both issues, which could become the subject of the DOJ\u2019s expected antitrust suit.    Critics of the company have long accused it of favoring its own services in search, to the detriment of its competitors and consumers looking for maps, videos or other services that Google also provides. Cicilline has separately voiced concern that the company's ability to hoover up online ad revenue has harmed smaller businesses, including news outlets. (Google and Facebook together account for a majority of the online ad revenue in the U.S.)    The committee has also accused the company of being less than forthright in its past testimony, including on questions such as what percentage of searches on the company's engine lead to website referrals not on Google.    Google has separately been a frequent target of Republican allegations of anti-conservative bias on its video sharing platform YouTube, a topic that is expected to come up again at Monday's hearing. Google and other major tech platforms deny those charges. Democrats, meanwhile, have taken issue with the company's handling of hate speech and misinformation on YouTube.   For Cook: Apple\u2019s App Store under the microscope   Apple, which to date hasn't drawn the same level of congressional scrutiny as the other companies testifying, is now facing a fresh investigation in Europe over whether its popular App Store violates the EU\u2019s competition rules. Competitors, publishers and app-makers have taken issue with Apple\u2019s 30 percent cut of app sales and subscriptions in the App Store.    State and federal regulators in the U.S. have also begun taking initial steps toward an antitrust investigation into those practices, POLITICO reported last month .    And key lawmakers have torn into Apple for its handling of the App Store.    \u201cBecause of the market power that Apple has, it is charging exorbitant rents \u2014 highway robbery, basically \u2014 bullying people to pay 30 percent or denying access to their market,\u201d Cicilline told The Verge in June . \u201cIt\u2019s crushing small developers who simply can\u2019t survive with those kinds of payments. If there were real competition in this marketplace, this wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d   For the House members: Can they avoid a free-for-all?   Democratic lawmakers, committee aides and advocacy groups say they expect the hearing to stay on track more than other past high-profile hearings with big tech CEOs  have done.     When Zuckerberg testified before Congress for the first time in 2018 at the height of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, for example, he fielded questions on everything from misinformation to competition, hate speech, privacy and allegations of anti-conservative bias on social media .    This time, Wednesday\u2019s hearing is not a one-off event \u2014 it\u2019s the subcommittee\u2019s sixth hearing as part of its more-than-yearlong investigation into Silicon Valley\u2019s antitrust problems. That means lawmakers have had an unusual amount of preparation, said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit that advocates against market concentration.    \u201cThe subcommittee members have been deeply involved in this investigation and many of them have a fine-grained understanding of the business models of these corporations,\u201d said Mitchell, a prominent big tech critic who testified before the committee last year. \u201cIt prevents things from veering off into all kinds of different directions.\u201d    But others expect that the lawmakers will once again wander off topic.    \u201cThe discussion will go well beyond antitrust,\u201d said Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel of tech trade group NetChoice, which counts Facebook, Google and Amazon as members. \u201cIt will go into issues of election interference, or conservative bias, or any of the other issues de jour on which we like to saddle tech,\u201d he said.    Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), one of the lawmakers who will be questioning the CEOs, told POLITICO he's expecting \"a free for all\" in question topics.   What about partisan squabbles?   The Democratic-led panel's investigation into tech and antitrust has mainly boasted bipartisan buy-in from the get-go , as Republican lawmakers have acknowledged.    \u201cI\u2019m very impressed with the bipartisan and cooperative nature of the process that we are going through,\" Buck said during an interview last week.    But partisan divides have erupted too. In February, for example, Republicans on the Judiciary Committee accused Chair Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) of harboring \u201cpre-conceived conclusions that America\u2019s large tech companies are inherently bad,\u201d and added: \u201cAmerica\u2019s leaders should not punish tech companies simply because those companies have succeeded.\"    And more recent disputes have emerged between Democrats and Republicans on how to handle Wednesday\u2019s hearing.    Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who took over as the top Republican on House Judiciary well into the committee\u2019s investigation , has criticized Democrats for not opening the hearing up to the full committee, which he said would allow questions on a wider range of members\u2019 tech concerns. Jordan has also raised the possibility that Republicans will delve into alleged political bias \u2014 even demanding that the hearing include Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, whose company has tangled with President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign over fact-checking but hasn\u2019t posed any major antitrust concerns.   The virtual format could shape the outcome   All four tech CEOs will testify together through an online videoconference, while Judiciary lawmakers will attend both virtually and in-person as part of a \u201chybrid\u201d format, senior Judiciary aides told reporters on Thursday.    Groups critical of the tech giants had pushed for the subcommittee to make the four CEOs testify individually instead of as a single group, expressing concern that Wednesday\u2019s format will make it harder to lawmakers to ask detailed questions and make it easier for the executives to dodge.    Having the CEOs testify jointly instead of on separate panels could cut down on the session\u2019s length. But even so, if past big tech hearings are any indication, the CEOs should be ready for a protracted siege.    The hearing also marks one of the highest profile virtual sessions of the coronavirus era, which has forced Congress to shift much of its regular business online. The virtual hearing is likely to test the limits of its format, with the possibility of technical snafus, cross talk, unmuted microphones and other glitches that could dilute the substance.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42702401851</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FW-YM61-F07F-82FB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1950\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Politico</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 28, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The hearing marks th...</p><p>Two global power centers are set to clash Wednesday as the CEOs of tech giants Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook testify before House lawmakers on allegations their companies are harming consumers by unfairly stifling the competition.    The hearing marks the first time the four tech moguls \u2014 whose companies are roughly worth a combined $5 trillion \u2014 have jointly testified before Congress, and it\u2019s the first congressional outing ever for Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s richest person. The session also arrives as scrutiny of the behemoths is surging across the globe, including an expected Justice Department antitrust case against Google and the recent launch of two European probes of potential anti-competitive behavior by Apple.    But whether Wednesday\u2019s showdown lives up to its historic billing may depend on a host of factors: The lawmakers could veer far from the antitrust script, into Democrats\u2019 concerns about online hate speech or GOP accusations of anti-conservative bias. Some Republicans have already accused Democrats of harboring \u201cpreconceived conclusions\u201d in favor of breaking up the tech giants, adding to the dangers of a partisan food fight breaking out.    Even the format of the questioning \u2014 four elite CEOs, all appearing by videoconference because of the coronavirus pandemic \u2014 could make it harder for the members to land a glove on the companies\u2019 varied issues, ranging from Google\u2019s and Facebook\u2019s command of digital ad revenue to Apple\u2019s control of its App Store and questions about whether Amazon misled Congress.    Here\u2019s what to expect as Bezos, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook and Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai testify before the House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee \u2014 and the potential surprises that may await:   For Bezos: Did Amazon lie to Congress last year?   Jeff Bezos | Jim Watson/AFP via     House lawmakers are expected to grill Bezos about whether a company lawyer misled the Judiciary Committee last summer by testifying that Amazon doesn\u2019t use the data it collects from third-party vendors to launch competing products on its platform.    The Wall Street Journal subsequently reported that Amazon employees did in fact use the sellers\u2019 data to inform the company\u2019s own products. The revelation prompted Judiciary leaders to raise the specter of referring Amazon to prosecutors for perjury charges, while Amazon disputed the accuracy of the Journal\u2019s account and said it did not offer \u201cintentionally misleading\u201d testimony. Amazon also promised to conduct an internal investigation but hasn\u2019t offered any public updates on its progress.    Now that Bezos is appearing before them, some lawmakers say they plan to push him to account for the discrepancy.    \u201cI do have concerns about testimony that was given to me under oath that I will be following up on from the last hearing,\u201d said subcommittee member Pramila Jayapal, who questioned Amazon associate general counsel Nate Sutton about the practice at a hearing last July.    Meanwhile, the Journal last week raised similar questions about Amazon\u2019s treatment of tech startups that had sought investments from the company\u2019s venture capital fund.   For Zuckerberg: Facebook\u2019s thirst for growth   Mark Zuckerberg | Drew Angerer/    Facebook\u2019s past acquisitions of former rivals WhatsApp and Instagram have drawn significant attention on Capitol Hill in recent years. Representative David Cicilline told POLITICO last year that \u201cthere ought to have been more review\u201d of the deals, which had won approval from regulators during the Obama administration. Others, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, have called for regulators to break up Facebook and have singled out those mergers as targets for rolling back.    The committee has also demanded answers from Facebook on whether it devotes resources to identifying and tracking promising startups. Lawmakers have expressed concern that Facebook and the other giants are uniquely positioned to duplicate, acquire or otherwise drive out up-and-coming rivals.    The company\u2019s massive trove of user data is also set to draw scrutiny. Representative Joe Neguse, vice chair of the antitrust subcommittee, said he hopes to press the company about whether the massive amounts of personal information it collects from more than 2 billion users makes it too difficult for competitors to keep up.    \u201cThere\u2019s a real fear that no other competitor could ever successfully launch a social media platform because it could never match Facebook\u2019s troves of data, which, given their record, it\u2019s a serious threat to users,\u201d he told POLITICO.   For Pichai: Google\u2019s dominance of digital ads and search   Sundar Pichai | Justin Sullivan/    Google is the world\u2019s No. 1 player in the $162.3 billion market for online display ads, in part because it runs the most dominant search engine. Now it\u2019s facing rising scrutiny from state and federal regulators on both issues, which could become the subject of the DOJ\u2019s expected antitrust suit.    Critics of the company have long accused it of favoring its own services in search, to the detriment of its competitors and consumers looking for maps, videos or other services that Google also provides. Cicilline has separately voiced concern that the company\u2019s ability to hoover up online ad revenue has harmed smaller businesses, including news outlets. (Google and Facebook together account for a majority of the online ad revenue in the U.S.)    The committee has also accused the company of being less than forthright in its past testimony, including on questions such as what percentage of searches on the company\u2019s engine lead to website referrals not on Google.    Google has separately been a frequent target of Republican allegations of anti-conservative bias on its video-sharing platform YouTube, a topic that is expected to come up again at Monday\u2019s hearing. Google and other major tech platforms deny those charges. Democrats, meanwhile, have taken issue with the company\u2019s handling of hate speech and misinformation on YouTube.   For Cook: Apple\u2019s App Store under the microscope   Tim Cook | Tom Brenner/    Apple, which to date hasn\u2019t drawn the same level of congressional scrutiny as the other companies testifying, is now facing a fresh investigation in Europe over whether its popular App Store violates the EU\u2019s competition rules. Competitors, publishers and app-makers have taken issue with Apple\u2019s 30 percent cut of app sales and subscriptions in the App Store.    State and federal regulators in the U.S. have also begun taking initial steps toward an antitrust investigation into those practices, POLITICO reported last month.    And key lawmakers have torn into Apple for its handling of the App Store.    \u201cBecause of the market power that Apple has, it is charging exorbitant rents \u2014 highway robbery, basically \u2014 bullying people to pay 30 percent or denying access to their market,\u201d Cicilline told The Verge in June. \u201cIt\u2019s crushing small developers who simply can\u2019t survive with those kinds of payments. If there were real competition in this marketplace, this wouldn\u2019t happen.\u201d   For the House members: Can they avoid a free-for-all?   Democratic lawmakers, committee aides and advocacy groups say they expect the hearing to stay on track more than other past high-profile hearings with Big Tech CEOs have done.    When Zuckerberg testified before Congress for the first time in 2018 at the height of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, for example, he fielded questions on everything from misinformation to competition, hate speech, privacy and allegations of anti-conservative bias on social media.    This time, Wednesday\u2019s hearing is not a one-off event \u2014 it\u2019s the subcommittee\u2019s sixth hearing as part of its more-than-yearlong investigation into Silicon Valley\u2019s antitrust problems. That means lawmakers have had an unusual amount of preparation, said Stacy Mitchell, co-director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, a nonprofit that advocates against market concentration.    More recent disputes have emerged between Democrats and Republicans on how to handle Wednesday\u2019s hearing.    \u201cThe subcommittee members have been deeply involved in this investigation and many of them have a fine-grained understanding of the business models of these corporations,\u201d said Mitchell, a prominent Big Tech critic who testified before the committee last year. \u201cIt prevents things from veering off into all kinds of different directions.\u201d    But others expect that the lawmakers will once again wander off-topic.    \u201cThe discussion will go well beyond antitrust,\u201d said Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel of tech trade group NetChoice, which counts Facebook, Google and Amazon as members. \u201cIt will go into issues of election interference, or conservative bias, or any of the other issues de jour on which we like to saddle tech,\u201d he said.    Representative Ken Buck, one of the lawmakers who will be questioning the CEOs, told POLITICO he\u2019s expecting \u201ca free for all\u201d in question topics.   What about partisan squabbles?   The Democratic-led panel\u2019s investigation into tech and antitrust has mainly boasted bipartisan buy-in from the get-go, as Republican lawmakers have acknowledged.    \u201cI\u2019m very impressed with the bipartisan and cooperative nature of the process that we are going through,\u201d Buck said during an interview last week.    But partisan divides have erupted too. In February, for example, Republicans on the Judiciary Committee accused Chair Jerry Nadler of harboring \u201cpre-conceived conclusions that America\u2019s large tech companies are inherently bad,\u201d and added, \u201cAmerica\u2019s leaders should not punish tech companies simply because those companies have succeeded.\u201d    And more recent disputes have emerged between Democrats and Republicans on how to handle Wednesday\u2019s hearing.    Representative Jim Jordan, who took over as the top Republican on House Judiciary well into the committee\u2019s investigation, has criticized Democrats for not opening the hearing up to the full committee, which he said would allow questions on a wider range of members\u2019 tech concerns. Jordan has also raised the possibility that Republicans will delve into alleged political bias \u2014 even demanding that the hearing include Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, whose company has tangled with President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign over fact-checking but hasn\u2019t posed any major antitrust concerns.   The virtual format could shape the outcome   All four tech CEOs will testify together through an online videoconference, while Judiciary lawmakers will attend both virtually and in-person as part of a \u201chybrid\u201d format, senior Judiciary aides told reporters on Thursday.    Groups critical of the tech giants had pushed for the subcommittee to make the four CEOs testify individually instead of as a single group, expressing concern that Wednesday\u2019s format will make it harder to lawmakers to ask detailed questions and make it easier for the executives to dodge.    Having the CEOs testify jointly instead of on separate panels could cut down on the session\u2019s length. But even so, if past Big Tech hearings are any indication, the CEOs should be ready for a protracted siege.    The hearing also marks one of the highest-profile virtual sessions of the coronavirus era, which has forced Congress to shift much of its regular business online. The virtual hearing is likely to test the limits of its format, with the possibility of technical snafus, cross talk, unmuted microphones and other glitches that could dilute the substance.

How to Get Ahead The most successful AI user...</p><p>Idea in Brief   The Challenge   As more companies deploy machine learning for AI-enabled products and services, they face the challenge of carving out a defensible market position, especially if they are latecomers.   How to Get Ahead   The most successful AI users capture a good pool of training data early and then exploit feedback data to open up a value gap\u2014in terms of prediction quality\u2014between themselves and later movers.   How to Catch Up   Latecomers can still secure a foothold if they can find sources of superior training data or feedback data, or if they tailor their predictions to a specific niche.      The past decade has brought tremendous advances in an exciting dimension of artificial intelligence\u2014machine learning. This technique for taking data inputs and turning them into predictions has enabled tech giants such as Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google to dramatically improve their products. It has also spurred start-ups to launch new products and platforms, sometimes even in competition with Big Tech.    Consider BenchSci, a Toronto-based company that seeks to speed the drug development process. It aims to make it easier for scientists to find needles in haystacks\u2014to zero in on the most crucial information embedded in pharma companies\u2019 internal databases and in the vast wealth of published scientific research. To get a new drug candidate into clinical trials, scientists must run costly and time-consuming experiments. BenchSci realized that scientists could conduct fewer of these\u2014and achieve greater success\u2014if they applied better insights from the huge number of experiments that had already been run.    Indeed, BenchSci found that if scientists took advantage of machine learning that read, classified, and then presented insights from scientific research, they could halve the number of experiments normally required to advance a drug to clinical trials. More specifically, they could use the technology to find the right biological reagents\u2014essential substances for influencing and measuring protein expression. Identifying those by combing through the published literature rather than rediscovering them from scratch helps significantly cut the time it takes to produce new drug candidates. That adds up to potential savings of over $17 billion annually, which, in an industry where the returns to R&amp;D have become razor-thin, could transform the market. In addition, many lives could be saved by bringing new drugs to market more quickly.    What is remarkable here is that BenchSci, in its specialized domain, is doing something akin to what Google has been doing for the whole of the internet: using machine learning to lead in search. Just as Google can help you figure out how to fix your dishwasher and save you a long trip to the library or a costly repair service, BenchSci helps scientists identify a suitable reagent without incurring the trouble or expense of excessive research and experimentation. Previously, scientists would often use Google or PubMed to search the literature (a process that took days), then read the literature (again spending days), and then order and test three to six reagents before choosing one (over a period of weeks). Now they search BenchSci in minutes and then order and test one to three reagents before choosing one (conducting fewer tests over fewer weeks).    Many companies are already working with AI and are aware of the practical steps for integrating it into their operations and leveraging its power. But as that proficiency grows, companies will need to consider a broader issue: How do you take advantage of machine learning to create a defensible moat around the business\u2014to create something that competitors can\u2019t easily imitate? In BenchSci\u2019s case, for instance, will its initial success attract competition from Google\u2014and if so, how does BenchSci retain its lead?    In the following pages, we explain how companies entering industries with an AI-enabled product or service can build a sustainable competitive advantage and raise entry barriers against latecomers. We note that moving early can often be a big plus, but it\u2019s not the whole story. As we discuss, late adopters of the new technology can still advance\u2014or at least recover some lost ground\u2014by finding a niche.   Making Predictions with AI   Businesses use machine learning to recognize patterns and then make predictions\u2014about what will appeal to customers, improve operations, or help make a product better. Before you can build a strategy around such predictions, however, you must understand the inputs necessary for the prediction process, the challenges involved in getting those inputs, and the role of feedback in enabling an algorithm to make better predictions over time.    A prediction, in the context of machine learning, is an information output that comes from entering some data and running an algorithm. For example, when your mobile navigation app serves up a prediction about the best route between two points, it uses input data on traffic conditions, speed limits, road size, and other factors. An algorithm is then employed to predict the fastest way to go and the time that will take.    The key challenge with any prediction process is that training data\u2014the inputs you need in order to start getting reasonable outcomes\u2014has to be either created (by, say, hiring experts to classify things) or procured from existing sources (say, health records). Some kinds of data are easy to acquire from public sources (think of weather and map information). Consumers may also willingly supply personal data if they perceive a benefit from doing so. Fitbit and Apple Watch users, for example, allow the companies to gather metrics about their exercise level, calorie intake, and so forth through devices that users wear to manage their health and fitness.      Moving early can often be a big plus, but it\u2019s not the whole story.      Obtaining training data to enable predictions can be difficult, however, if it requires the cooperation of a large number of individuals who do not directly benefit from providing it. For instance, a navigation app can collect data about traffic conditions by tracking users and getting reports from them. This allows the app to identify likely locations for traffic jams and to alert other drivers who are heading toward them. But drivers already caught in the snarls get little direct payoff from participating, and they may be troubled by the idea that the app knows where they are at any moment (and is potentially recording their movements). If people in traffic jams decline to share their data or actually switch off their geolocators, the app\u2019s ability to warn users of traffic problems will be compromised.    Another challenge may be the need to periodically update training data. This isn\u2019t always an issue; it won\u2019t apply if the basic context in which the prediction was made stays constant. Radiology, for example, analyzes human physiology, which is generally consistent from person to person and over time. Thus, after a certain point, the marginal value of an extra record in the training database is almost zero. However, in other cases algorithms may need to be frequently updated with completely new data reflecting changes in the underlying environment. With navigational apps, for instance, new roads or traffic circles, renamed streets, and similar changes will render the app\u2019s predictions less accurate over time unless the maps that form part of the initial training data are updated.    In many situations, algorithms can be continuously improved through the use of feedback data, which is obtained by mapping actual outcomes to the input data that generated predictions of those outcomes. This tool is particularly helpful in situations where there can be considerable variation within clearly defined boundaries. For instance, when your phone uses an image of you for security, you will have initially trained the phone to recognize you. But your face can change significantly. You may or may not be wearing glasses. You may have gotten a new hairstyle, put on makeup, or gained or lost weight. Thus the prediction that you are you may become less reliable if the phone relies solely on the initial training data. But what actually happens is that the phone updates its algorithm using all the images you provide each time you unlock it.    Creating these kinds of feedback loops is far from straightforward in dynamic contexts and where feedback cannot be easily categorized and sourced. Feedback data for the smartphone face-recognition app, for example, creates better predictions only if the sole person inputting facial data is the phone\u2019s owner. If other people look similar enough to get into the phone and continue using it, the phone\u2019s prediction that the user is the owner becomes unreliable.    It can also be dangerously easy to introduce biases into machine learning, especially if multiple factors are in play. Suppose a lender uses an AI-enabled process to assess the credit risk of loan applicants, considering their income level, employment history, demographic characteristics, and so forth. If the training data for the algorithm discriminates against a certain group\u2014say, people of color\u2014the feedback loop will perpetuate or even accentuate that bias, making it increasingly likely that applicants of color are rejected. Feedback is almost impossible to incorporate safely into an algorithm without carefully defined parameters and reliable, unbiased sources.   Building Competitive Advantage in Prediction   In many ways, building a sustainable business in machine learning is much like building a sustainable business in any industry. You have to come in with a sellable product, carve out a defensible early position, and make it harder for anyone to come in behind you. Whether you can do that depends on your answers to three questions:   1. Do you have enough training data?   At the get-go, a prediction machine needs to generate predictions that are good enough to be commercially viable. The definition of \u201cgood enough\u201d might be set by regulation (for example, an AI for making medical diagnoses must meet government standards), usability (a chatbot has to work smoothly enough for callers to respond to the machine rather than wait to speak to a human in the call center), or competition (a company seeking to enter the internet search market needs a certain level of predictive accuracy to compete with Google). One barrier to entry, therefore, is the amount of time and effort involved in creating or accessing sufficient training data to make good-enough predictions.    This barrier can be high. Take the case of radiology, where a prediction machine needs to be measurably better than highly skilled humans in order to be trusted with people\u2019s lives. That suggests that the first company to build a generally applicable AI for radiology (one that can read any scanned image) will have little competition at first because so much data is needed for success. But the initial advantage may be short-lived if the market is growing rapidly, because in a fast-growing market the payoff from having access to the training data will probably be large enough to attract multiple big companies with deep pockets.    This, of course, means that training-data entry requirements are subject to the economics of scale, like so much else. High-growth markets attract investments, and over time this raises the threshold for the next new entrant (and forces everyone already in the sector to spend more on developing or marketing their products). Thus the more data you can train your machines on, the bigger the hurdle for anyone coming after you, which brings us to the second question.   2. How fast are your feedback loops?   Prediction machines exploit what has traditionally been the human advantage\u2014they learn. If they can incorporate feedback data, then they can learn from outcomes and improve the quality of the next prediction.    The extent of this advantage, however, depends on the time it takes to get feedback. With a radiology scan, if an autopsy is required to assess whether a machine-learning algorithm correctly predicted cancer, then feedback will be slow, and although a company may have an early lead in collecting and reading scans, it will be limited in its ability to learn and thus sustain its lead. By contrast, if feedback data can be generated quickly after obtaining the prediction, then an early lead will translate into a sustained competitive advantage, because the minimum efficient scale will soon be out of the reach of even the biggest companies.    When Microsoft launched the Bing search engine in 2009, it had the company\u2019s full backing. Microsoft invested billions of dollars in it. Yet more than a decade later, Bing\u2019s market share remains far below Google\u2019s, in both search volume and search advertising revenue. One reason Bing found it hard to catch up was the feedback loop. In search, the time between the prediction (offering up a page with several suggested links in response to a query) and the feedback (the user\u2019s clicking on one of the links) is short\u2014usually seconds. In other words, the feedback loop is fast and powerful.    Peter Greenwood    By the time Bing entered the market, Google had already been operating an AI-based search engine for a decade or more, helping millions of users and performing billions of searches daily. Every time a user made a query, Google provided its prediction of the most relevant links, and then the user selected the best of those links, enabling Google to update its prediction model. That allowed for constant learning in light of a constantly expanding search space. With so much training data based on so many users, Google could identify new events and new trends more quickly than Bing could. In the end, the fast feedback loop, combined with other factors\u2014Google\u2019s continued investment in massive data-processing facilities, and the real or perceived costs to customers of switching to another engine\u2014meant that Bing always lagged. Other search engines that tried to compete with Google and Bing never even got started.   3. How good are your predictions?   The success of any product ultimately depends on what you get for what you pay. If consumers are offered two similar products at the same price, they will generally choose the one they perceive to be of higher quality.    Prediction quality, as we\u2019ve already noted, is often easy to assess. In radiology, search, advertising, and many other contexts, companies can design AIs with a clear, single metric for quality: accuracy. As in other industries, the highest-quality products benefit from higher demand. AI-based products are different from others, however, because for most other products, better quality costs more, and sellers of inferior goods survive by using cheaper materials or less-expensive manufacturing processes and then charging lower prices. This strategy isn\u2019t as feasible in the context of AI. Because AI is software-based, a low-quality prediction is as expensive to produce as a high-quality one, making discount pricing unrealistic. And if the better prediction is priced the same as the worse one, there is no reason to purchase the lower-quality one.    For Google, this is another factor explaining why its lead in search may be unassailable. Competitors\u2019 predictions often look pretty similar to Google\u2019s. Enter the word \u201cweather\u201d into Google or Bing, and the results will be much the same\u2014forecasts will pop up first. But if you enter a less common term, differences may emerge. If you type in, say, \u201cdisruption,\u201d Bing\u2019s first page will usually show dictionary definitions, while Google provides both definitions and links to research papers on the topic of disruptive innovation. Although Bing can perform as well as Google for some text queries, for others it\u2019s less accurate in predicting what consumers are looking for. And there are few if any other search categories where Bing is widely seen as superior.   Catching Up   The bottom line is that in AI, an early mover can build a scale-based competitive advantage if feedback loops are fast and performance quality is clear. So what does this mean for late movers? Buried in the three questions are clues to two ways in which a late entrant can carve out its own space in the market. Would-be contenders needn\u2019t choose between these approaches; they can try both.   Identify and secure alternative data sources.   In some markets for prediction tools, there may be reservoirs of potential training data that incumbents have not already captured. Going back to the example of radiology, tens of thousands of doctors are each reading thousands of scans a year, meaning that hundreds of millions (or even billions) of new data points are available.    Early entrants will have training data from a few hundred radiologists. Of course, once their software is running in the field, the number of scans and the amount of feedback in their database will increase substantially, but the billions of scans previously analyzed and verified represent an opportunity for laggards to catch up, assuming they are able to pool the scans and analyze them in the aggregate. If that\u2019s the case, they might be able to develop an AI that makes good-enough predictions to go to market, after which they too can benefit from feedback.    Latecomers could also consider training an AI using pathology or autopsy data rather than human diagnoses. That strategy would enable them to reach the quality threshold sooner (because biopsies and autopsies are more definitive than body scans), though the subsequent feedback loop would be slower.    Alternatively, instead of trying to find untapped sources of training data, latecomers could look for new sources of feedback data that enable faster learning than what incumbents are using. (BenchSci is an example of a company that has succeeded in doing this.) By being first with a novel supply of faster feedback data, the newcomer can then learn from the actions and choices of its users to make its product better. But in markets where feedback loops are already fairly rapid and where incumbents are operating at scale, the opportunities for pulling off this approach will be relatively limited. And significantly faster feedback would likely trigger a disruption of current practices, meaning that the new entrants would not really be competing with established companies but instead displacing them.   Differentiate the prediction.   Another tactic that can help late entrants become competitive is to redefine what makes a prediction \u201cbetter,\u201d even if only for some customers. In radiology, for example, such a strategy could be possible if there is market demand for different types of predictions. Early entrants most likely trained their algorithms with data from one hospital system, one type of hardware, or one country. By using training data (and then feedback data) from another system or another country, the newcomer could customize its AI for that user segment if it is sufficiently distinct. If, say, urban Americans and people in rural China tend to experience different health conditions, then a prediction machine built to diagnose one of those groups might not be as accurate for diagnosing patients in the other group.      Latecomers could look for new sources of feedback data that enable faster learning.      Creating predictions that rely on data coming from a particular type of hardware could also provide a market opportunity, if that business model results in lower costs or increases accessibility for customers. Many of today\u2019s AIs for radiology draw upon data from the most widely used X-ray machines, scanners, and ultrasound devices made by GE, Siemens, and other established manufacturers. However, if the algorithms are applied to data from other machines, the resulting predictions may be less accurate. Thus a late entrant could find a niche by offering a product tailored to that other equipment\u2014which might be attractive for medical facilities to use if it is cheaper to purchase or operate or is specialized to meet the needs of particular customers.   CONCLUSION   The potential of prediction machines is immense, and there is no doubt that the tech giants have a head start. But it\u2019s worth remembering that predictions are like precisely engineered products, highly adapted for specific purposes and contexts. If you can differentiate the purposes and contexts even a little, you can create a defensible space for your own product. Although the devil is in the details of how you collect and use data, your salvation rests there as well.    Nonetheless, the real key to competing successfully with Big Tech in industries powered by intelligent machines lies in a question that only a human can answer: What is it that you want to predict? Of course, figuring out the answer is not easy. Doing so necessitates a deep understanding of market dynamics and thoughtful analysis of the potential worth of specific predictions and the products and services in which they are embedded. It is therefore perhaps not surprising that the lead investor in BenchSci\u2019s Series A2 financing was not one of the many local Canadian tech investors but rather an AI-focused venture capital firm called Gradient Ventures\u2014owned by Google.

Merrill[1]  Cambridge Analytica thinks that I'm a 'Very Unlikely Republican.' Another political data firm, ALC Digital, has concluded I'm a 'Socially Conservative,' Republican, 'Boomer Voter.' In fact, I'm a 27-year-old millennial with no set party allegiance.For all the fanfare, the burgeoning field of mining our personal data remains an inexact art.One thing is certain: My personal data, and likely yours, is in more hands than ever. Tech firms, data brokers and political consultants build profiles of what they know \u2014 or think they can reasonably guess \u2014 about your purchasing habits, personality, hobbies and even what political issues you care about.You can find out what those companies know about you but be prepared to be stubborn. </p><p>Very stubborn. To demonstrate how this works, we've chosen a couple of representative companies from three major categories: data brokers, big tech firms and political data consultants.Few of them make it easy. Some will show you on their websites, others will make you ask for your digital profile via the U.S. mail. And then there's Cambridge Analytica, the controversial Trump campaign vendor that has come under intense fire in light of a report[2] in the British newspaper The Observer and in The New York Times that the company used improperly obtained data from Facebook to help build voter profiles.To find out what the chaps at the British data firm have on you, you're going to need both stamps and a 'cheque.'Once you see your data, you'll have a much better understanding of how this shadowy corner of the new economy works. You'll see what seemingly personal information they know about you and you'll probably have some hypotheses about where this data is coming from. You'll also probably see some predictions about who you are that are hilariously wrong.And if you do obtain your data from any of these companies, please let us know your thoughts at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:politicaldata@propublica.org[3]\">politicaldata@propublica.org[3]</email> We won't share or publish what you say (unless you tell us that's it's OK).; Cambridge Analytica and Other Political Consultants Making statistically informed guesses about Americans' political beliefs and pet issues is a common business these days, with dozens of firms selling data to candidates and issue groups about the purported leanings of individual American voters.Few of these firms have to give your data. But Cambridge Analytica is required to do so by an obscure European rule.Cambridge Analytica:Around the time of the 2016 election, Paul-Olivier Dehaye, a Belgian mathematician and founder of a website that helps people exercise their data protection rights called PersonalData.IO,[4] approached me with an idea for a story. He flagged some of Cambridge Analytica's claims about the power of its 'psychographic' targeting capabilities and suggested that I demand my data from them.So I sent off a request, following Dehaye's coaching, and citing the UK Data Protection Act 1998, the British implementation of a little-known European Union data-protection law that grants individuals (even Americans) the rights to see the data Europeans companies compile about individuals.It worked. I got back a spreadsheet of data about me. But it took months, cost ten pounds \u2014 and I had to give them a photo ID and two utility bills. Presumably they didn't want my personal data falling into the wrong hands.How You Can Request Your Data From Cambridge Analytica:Visit Cambridge Analytica's website here and fill out this web form[5]. After you submit the form, the page will immediately request that you email to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:data.compliance@cambridgeanalytica.org[6]\">data.compliance@cambridgeanalytica.org[6]</email> a photo ID and two copies of your utility bills or bank statements, to prove your identity. This page will also include the company's bank account details. Find a way to send them 10 GBP. You can try wiring this from your bank, though it may cost you an additional $25 or so \u2014 or ask a friend in the UK to go to their bank and get a cashier's check. Your American bank probably won't let you write a GBP-denominated check. Two services I tried, Xoom and TransferWise, weren't able to do it. Eventually, Cambridge Analytica will email you a small Excel spreadsheet of information and a letter. You might have to wait a few weeks. Celeste LeCompte, ProPublica's vice president of business development, requested her data on March 27 and still hasn't received it.;;Because the company is based in the United Kingdom, it had no choice but to fulfill my request. In recent weeks, the firm has come under intense fire after The New York Times and the British paper The Observer disclosed that it had used improperly obtained data from Facebook to build profiles of American voters. Facebook told me that data about me was likely transmitted to Cambridge Analytica because a person with whom I am 'friends' on the social network had taken the now-infamous 'This Is Your Digital Life' quiz. For what it's worth, my data shows no sign of anything derived from Facebook.What You Might Get Back From Cambridge Analytica:Cambridge Analytica had generated 13 data points about my views: 10 political issues, ranked by importance; two guesses at my partisan leanings (one blank); and a guess at whether I would turn out in the 2016 general election.  They told me that the lower the rank, the higher the predicted importance of the issue to me.Alongside that data labeled 'models' were two other types of data that are run-of-the-mill and widely used by political consultants. One sheet of 'core data' \u2014 that is, personal info, sliced and diced a few different ways, perhaps to be used more easily as parameters for a statistical model. It included my address, my electoral district, the census tract I live in and my date of birth.The spreadsheet included a few rows of 'election returns' \u2014 previous elections in New York State in which I had voted. (Intriguingly, Cambridge Analytica missed that I had voted in 2015's snoozefest of a vote-for-five-of-these-five judicial election. It also didn't know about elections in which I had voted in North Carolina, where I lived before I lived in New York.) ALC Digital ALC Digital is another data broker, which says that its info is 'audiences are built from multi-sourced, verified information about an individual.' Their data is distributed via Oracle Data Cloud, a service that lets advertisers target specific audience of people \u2014 like, perhaps, people who are Boomer Voters and also Republicans.The firm brags in an Oracle document posted online[7] about how hard it is to avoid their data collection efforts, saying, 'It has no cookies to erase and can't be 'cleared.' ALC Real World Data is rooted in reality, and doesn't rely on inferences or faulty models.' How You Can Request Your Data From ALC Digital:Here's how to find the predictions about your political beliefs data in Oracle Data Cloud:Visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bluekai.com/registry\">http://www.bluekai.com/registry</url>/[8]. If you use an ad blocker, there may not be much to see here. Click on the Branded Segments tab. Scroll on through until you find ALC Digital.You may have to scroll for a while before you find it.And not everyone appears to have data from ALC Digital, so don't be shocked if you can't find it. If you don't, there may be other fascinating companies with data about who you are in your Oracle file.What You Might Get Back From ALC Digital:When I downloaded the data last year, it said I was 'Socially Conservative,' 'Boomer Voter' \u2014 as well as a female voter and a tax reform supporter.Recently, when I checked my data, those categories had disappeared entirely from my data. I had nothing from ALC Digital.ALC Digital is not required to release this data. It is disclosed via the Oracle Data Cloud. Fran Green, the company's president, said that Aristotle, a longtime political data company, 'provides us with consumer data that populates these audiences.' She also said that 'we do not claim to know people's 'beliefs.''  Big Tech Big tech firms like Google and Facebook tend to make their money by selling ads, so they build extensive profiles of their users' interests and activities. They also depend on their users' goodwill to keep us voluntarily giving them our locations, our browsing histories and plain ol' lists of our friends and interests. (So far, these popular companies have not faced much regulation.) All three make it easy to download the data that they keep on you.Firms like Google and Facebook firms don't sell your data \u2014 because it's their competitive advantage. Google's privacy page[9] screams in 72 point type: 'We do not sell your personal information to anyone.' As websites that we visit frequently, they sell access to our attention, so companies that want to reach you in particular can do so with these companies' sites or other sites that feature their ads. Facebook How You Can Request Your Data From Facebook:You of course have to have a Facebook account and be logged in:Visit       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/settings\">https://www.facebook.com/settings</url>[10] on your computer. Click the 'Download a copy of your Facebook data' link. On the next page, click 'Start My Archive.' Enter your password, then click 'Start My Archive' again. You'll get an email immediately, and another one saying 'Your Facebook download is ready' when your data is ready to be downloaded. You'll get a notification on Facebook, too. Mine took just a few minutes. Once you get that email, click the link, then click Download Archive. Then reenter your password, which will start a zip file downloading.. Unzip the folder; depending on your computer's operating system, this might be called uncompressing or 'expanding.' You'll get a folder called something like 'facebook-jeremybmerrill,' but, of course, with your username instead of mine. Open the folder and double-click 'index.htm' to open it in your web browser.What You Might Get Back From FacebookFacebook designed its archive to first show you your profile information. That's all information you typed into Facebook and that you probably intended to be shared with your friends. It's no surprise that Facebook knows what city I live in or what my AIM screen name was \u2014 I told Facebook those things so that my friends would know.But it's a bit of a surprise that they decided to feature a list of my ex-girlfriends \u2014 what they blandly termed 'Previous Relationships' \u2014 so prominently.As you dig deeper in your archive, you'll find more information that you gave Facebook, but that you might not have expected the social network to keep hold of for years: if you're me, that's the Nickelback concert I apparently RSVPed to, posts about switching high schools and instant messages from my freshman year in college.But finally, you'll find the creepier information: what Facebook knows about you that you didn't tell it, on the 'Ads' page. You'll find 'Ads Topics' that Facebook decided you were interested in, like Housing, ESPN or the town of Ellijay, Georgia. And, you'll find a list of advertisers who have obtained your contact information and uploaded it to Facebook, as part of a so-called Custom Audience of specific people to whom they want to show their ads.You'll find more of that creepy information on your Ads Preferences page[11]. Despite Mark Zuckerberg telling Rep. Jerry McNerney, D-Calif., in a hearing earlier this month that 'all of your information is included in your 'download your information,'' my archive didn't include that list of ad categories that can be used to target ads to me. (Some other types of information aren't included in the download, like other people's posts you've liked. Those are listed here[12], along with where to find them \u2014 which, for most, is in your Activity Log[13].)  This area may include Facebook's guesses about who you are, boiled down from some of your activities. Most Americans' will have a guess about their politics[14] \u2014 Facebook says I'm a 'moderate' about US Politics \u2014 and some will have a guess about so-called 'multicultural affinity,'[15] which Facebook insists is not a guess about your ethnicity, but rather what sorts of content 'you are interested in or will respond well to.' For instance, Facebook recently added that I have a 'Multicultural Affinity: African American.' (I'm white \u2014 though, because Facebook's definition of 'multicultural affinity' is so strange, it's hard to tell if this is an error on Facebook's part.)Facebook also doesn't include your browsing history \u2014 the subject of back-and-forths between Mark Zuckerberg and several members of Congress \u2014 it says it keeps that just long enough to boil it down into those 'Ad Topics.'For people without Facebook accounts, Facebook says to email <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:datarequests@support.facebook.com[16]\">datarequests@support.facebook.com[16]</email> or fill out an online form[17] to download what Facebook knows about you. One puzzle here is how Facebook gathers data on people whose identities it may not know. It may know that a person using a phone from Atlanta, Georgia, has accessed a Facebook site and that the same person was last week in Austin, Texas, and before that Cincinnati, but it may not know that that person is me. It's in principle difficult for the company to give the data it collects about logged-out users if it doesn't know exactly who they are.; Google Like Facebook, Google will give you a zip archive of your data. Google's can be much bigger, because you might have stored gigabytes of files in Google Drive or years of emails in Gmail.But like Facebook, Google does not provide its guesses about your interests, which it uses to target ads. Those guesses are available elsewhere.How You Can Request Your Data From Google:Visit       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout/\">https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout/</url>[18] to use Google's cutely named Takeout service. You'll have to pick which data you want to download and examine. You should definitely select My Activity, Location History and Searches. You may not want to download gigabytes of emails, if you use Gmail, since that uses a lot of space and may take a while. (That's also information you shouldn't be surprised that Google keeps \u2014 you left it with Gmail so that you could use Google's search expertise to hold on to your emails. ) Google will present you with a few options for how to get your archive. The defaults are fine. Within a few hours, you should get an email with the subject 'Your Google data archive is ready.' Click Download Archive and log in again. That should start the download of a file named something like 'takeout-20180412T193535.zip.' Unzip the folder; depending on your computer's operating system, this might be called uncompressing or 'expanding.' You'll get a folder called Takeout. Open the file inside it called 'index.html' in your web browser to explore your archive.What You Might Get Back From Google:Once you open the index.html file, you'll see icons for the data you chose in step 2. Try exploring 'Ads' under 'My Activity' \u2014 you'll see a list of times you saw Google Ads, including on apps on your phone.Google also includes your search history, under 'Searches' \u2014 in my case, going back to 2013. Google knows what I had forgotten: I Googled a bunch of dinosaurs around Valentine's Day that year And it's not just web searches: the Sound Search history reminded me that at some point, I used that service to identify Natalie Imbruglia's song 'Torn.'Android phone users might want to check the 'Android' folder: Google keeps a list of each app you've used on your phone.Most of the data contained here are records of ways you've directly interacted with Google \u2014 and the company really does use the those to improve how their services work for me. I'm glad to see my searches auto-completed, for instance.But the company also creates data about you: Visit the company's Ads Settings page[19] to see some of the 'topics' Google guesses you're interested in, and which it uses to personalize the ads you see. Those topics are fairly general \u2014 it knows I'm interested in 'Politics' \u2014 but the company says it has more granular classifications that it doesn't include on the list. Those more granular, hidden classifications are on various topics, from sports to vacations to politics, where Google does generate a guess whether some people are politically 'left-leaning' or 'right-leaning.' Data Brokers Here's who really does sell your data. Data brokers like the credit reporting agency Experian and a firm named Epsilon.These sometimes-shady firms are middlemen who buy your data from tracking firms, survey marketers and retailers, slice and dice the data into 'segments,' then sell those on to advertisers. Experian Experian is best known as a credit reporting firm, but your credit cards aren't all they keep track of. They told me that they 'firmly believe people should be made aware of how their data is being used' \u2014 so if you print and mail them a form, they'll tell you what data they have on you.'Educated consumers,' they said, 'are better equipped to be effective, successful participants in a world that increasingly relies on the exchange of information to efficiently deliver the products and services consumers demand.'How You Can Request Your Data From Experian:Visit Experian's Marketing Data Request site[20] and print the Marketing Data Report Request form[21]. Print a copy of your ID and proof of address. Mail it all to Experian atExperian Marketing Services PO Box 40 Allen, TX 75013 Wait for them to mail you something back.What You Might Get Back From Experian:Expect to wait a while. I've been waiting almost a month.They also come up with a guess about your political views that's integrated with Facebook \u2014 our Facebook Political Ad Collector project[22] has found that many political candidates use Experian's data to target their Facebook ads[23] to likely supporters.You should hope to find a guess about your political views that'd be useful to those candidates \u2014 as well as categories derived from your purchasing data.Experian told me they generate the data they have about you from a long list of sources, including public records and 'historical catalog purchase information' \u2014 as well as calculating it from predictive models. Epsilon How You Can Request Your Data From Epsilon:Visit Epsilon's Marketing Data Summary Request[24] form. After entering your name and address, Epsilon will answer some of those identity-verification questions that quiz you about your old addresses and cars. If your identity can't be verified with those, Epsilon will ask you to mail in a form. Wait for Epsilon to mail you your data; it took about a week for me.What You Might Get Back From Epsilon:Epsilon has information on 'demographics' and 'lifestyle interests' \u2014 at the household level. It also includes a list of 'household purchases.'It also has data that political candidates use to target their Facebook ads, including Randy Bryce, a Wisconsin Democrat who's seeking his party's nomination to run for retiring Speaker Paul Ryan's seat, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii.In my case, Epsilon knows I buy clothes, books and home office supplies, among other things \u2014 but isn't any more specific. They didn't tell me what political beliefs they believe I hold. The company didn't respond to a request for comment. OracleOracle's Data Cloud aggregates data about you from Oracle, but also so-called third party data from other companies.How You Can Request Your Data From Oracle:Visit       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bluekai.com/registry\">http://www.bluekai.com/registry</url>/[25]. If you use an ad blocker, there may not be much to see here. Explore each tab, from 'Basic Info' to 'Hobbies ...terests' and 'Partner Segment.'Not fun scrolling through all those pages? I have 84 pages of four pieces of data each.You can't search. All the text is actually images of text. Oracle declined to say why it chose to make their site so hard to use.What You Might Get Back From Oracle:My Oracle profile includes nearly 1500 data points, covering all aspects of my life, from my age to my car to how old my children are to whether I buy eggs. These profiles can even say if you're likely to dress your pet in a costume for Halloween. But many of them are off-base or contradictory.Many companies in Oracle's data, besides ALC Digital, offer guesses about my political views: Data from one company uploaded by AcquireWeb says that my political affiliations are as a Democrat and an Independent but also that I'm a 'Mild Republican.' Another company, an Oracle subsidiary called AddThis, says that I'm a 'Liberal.' Cuebiq, which calls itself a 'location intelligence' company, says I'm in a subset of 'Democrats' called 'Liberal Professions.'If an advertiser wants to show an ad to Spring Break Enthusiasts, Oracle can enable that. I'm apparently a Spring Break Enthusiast. Do I buy eggs? I sure do. Data on Oracle's site associated with AcquireWeb says I'm a cat owner But it also 'knows' I'm a dog owner, which I'm not.Al Gadbut, the CEO of AcquireWeb, explained that the guesses associated with his company weren't based on my personal data, but rather the tendencies of people in my geographical area \u2014 hence the seemingly contradictory political guesses. He said his firm doesn't generate the data, but rather uploaded it on behalf of other companies. Cuebiq's guess was a 'probabilistic inference' they drew from location data submitted to them by some app on my phone. Valentina Marastoni-Bieser, Cuebiq's senior vice president of marketing, wouldn't tell me which app it was, though.Data for sale here includes a long list what TV shows I \u2014 supposedly \u2014 watch.But it's not all wrong. AddThis can tell that I'm 'Young ...p.' Takeaways: The above list is just a sampling of the firms that collect your data and try to draw conclusions about who you are \u2014 not just sites you visit like Facebook and controversial firms like Cambridge Analytica.  Get ProPublica's Top Stories by Email   You can make some guesses as to where this data comes from \u2014 especially the more granular consumer data from Oracle. For each data point, it's worth considering: Who'd be in a position to sell a list of what TV shows I watch, or, at least, a list of what TV shows people demographically like me watch? Who'd be in a position to sell a list of what groceries I, or people similar to me in my area, buy? Some of those companies \u2014 companies who you're likely paying, and for whom the internet adage that 'if you're not paying, you're the product' doesn't hold \u2014 are likely selling data about you without your knowledge. Other data points, like the location data used by Cuebiq, can come from any number of apps or websites, so it may be difficult to figure out exactly which one has passed it on.Companies like Google and Facebook often say that they'll let you 'correct' the data that they hold on you \u2014 tacitly acknowledgingly that they sometimes get it wrong. But if receiving relevant ads is not important to you, they'll let you opt-out entirely \u2014 or, presumably, 'correct' your data to something false.An upcoming European Union rule called the General Data Protection Regulation portends a dramatic change to how data is collected and used on the web \u2014 if only for Europeans. No such law seems likely to be passed in the U.S. in the near future.

He had ties to online media provocateurs. And, above all, he understood the value of secrecy. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Mr. Miller had arrived at the right moment with his company, Definers Public Affairs. With customers and lawmakers questioning the avowed good intentions and power of tech's biggest companies, Facebook and others were on the defensive.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  Definers quickly found plenty of business, from start-ups like Lyft, Lime and Juul to giants like Facebook and Qualcomm, the influential chip company that was in a nasty legal fight with Apple over royalties, according to five people with direct knowledge of Mr. Miller's work who declined to be named because of confidentiality agreements.</p><p>  While working for Qualcomm, Definers pushed the idea that Apple's chief executive, <person><nameText>Timothy D. Cook, </nameText></person>was a viable presidential candidate in 2020, according to a former Definers employee and digital records. Presumably, it was an attempt to chill the cordial relations that Mr. Cook had cultivated with the <person><nameText>Trump administration.</nameText></person></p><p>  The campaign by Definers signaled an escalation of Silicon Valley's already brass-knuckled approach to public relations.</p><p>  ''This type of dirty P.R.? It's always been there, but it's definitely on the upswing,'' said Jonathan Hirshon, who was a public relations <person><nameText>representative </nameText></person>for technology companies for three decades, including Apple and Sony. ''The idealism is still there, but the truth is, the big companies have become a lot more authoritarian in their approach to the media.''</p><p>Facebook fired Definers last week after The New York Times detailed the work Mr. Miller's firm had done on behalf of the social media company. Definers encouraged reporters to write about the financial connections between anti-Facebook activists and the liberal financier George Soros, drawing accusations that it was relying on anti-Semitic tropes.</p><p>  Definers's strategy played to a target's pressure points. Most of what Definers produced for Qualcomm had nothing to do with its beef with Apple, which was a complex legal fight over the royalties Apple should pay for the Qualcomm chips it was using in iPhones.</p><p>  Definers employees distributed anti-Apple research to reporters and would not say who was paying for it. Definers distributed a 13-page memo titled ''Apple Bowing to Chinese Cyber Regulators'' that detailed how Apple's activity in China contradicted its public stance on privacy elsewhere. It also planted dozens of negative articles about Apple on conservative news sites, according to a person familiar with the work and emails reviewed by The New York Times.</p><p>Qualcomm officials did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p>  The feuds among the tech industry's giants have hardly been genteel over the years. Big companies often tip reporters to bad news about other companies and urge regulators to examine competitors.</p><p>  A campaign by Microsoft, referred to as ''Scroogled,'' highlighted what it called Google's privacy violations. From 2012 to 2014, it took out print and television ads that claimed Google was reading people's emails, a charge the internet company denied.</p><p>Google has more recently been targeted with negative stories tipped to reporters by a group called the Campaign for Accountability. The group was quietly funded by the database maker Oracle, which has spent years in an intellectual property court fight with Google over Java, a programming tool owned by Oracle.</p><p>  Matt Rhoades, Definers's chief executive, said in a statement that the firm's work ''is absolutely no different than what public affairs firms do every day for their clients across industries and issues across the country. We are proud of the work we do for our clients.''</p><p>  Juul, which has been accused of marketing its e-cigarettes to children, is working with Definers to improve its public image and communicate with reporters.</p><p>  The ride-hailing company Lyft used Definers to help navigate regulatory challenges in statehouses across the country, including choosing which Lyft drivers to pitch to the media for interviews, according to a person familiar with the work.</p><p>  And the scooter company Lime hired Definers in August because it wanted an outside contractor to take a more aggressive tack against rivals, according to a person familiar with that work. Lyft and Lime have since ended their work with Definers.</p><p>  Some details of Definers's relationships with tech firms, including Lyft and Lime, have previously been reported by other news organizations.</p><p>  Definers also plied its services for Washington. It helped set up Power the Future, a pro-oil trade group, while it also worked for the Environmental Protection Agency. The E.P.A. ended its contract with Definers last year after it was revealed that a Definers lawyer was investigating agency employees critical of the <person><nameText>Trump administration.</nameText></person></p><p>  To promote clients and attack its clients' enemies, Definers regularly used NTK Network, a news aggregator with a conservative slant and 122,000 followers on Facebook.</p><p>  Definers and its sister firm, the political-opposition group America Rising, share some staff and one floor of an office building in Arlington, Va., with NTK. Joe Pounder, a veteran of Republican presidential campaigns who describes himself as ''a master of opposition research'' in his biographies, is listed as a co-founder of Definers and America Rising and editor in chief of NTK.</p><p>  Mr. Pounder and two colleagues distanced NTK from Definers after The Times's report last week. ''We do not and did not work with Facebook. We share offices with a firm that does,'' they wrote in a blog post.</p><p>  But Mr. Miller promoted how Definers used NTK in a proposal sent to a potential Definers client last year, under a section labeled ''Digital Platform Echo Chamber.''</p><p>  ''Definers manages NTK Network, a news aggregation platform that targets Washington D.C. influencers. Through NTK we can directly re-publish favorable news from other outlets, and work with like-minded individuals to help create an echo chamber effect,'' he wrote in a copy of the proposal reviewed by The Times.</p><p>  This year, NTK has published at least 57 articles criticizing Apple and Mr. Cook. Some of the posts needled Apple for issues at the center of the legal dispute between Apple and Qualcomm and repeated Qualcomm's complaints. Apple had also started to move away from using Qualcomm chips.</p><p>  ''The iPhone 8 Might Be Slower Than the Competition. Here's Why'' read a headline on an April 2017 story. NTK's answer? The iPhones don't use Qualcomm chips.</p><p>  Other stories were even more direct, like one from August about Qualcomm's technology that concluded: ''For Apple, the choice will be clear: make nice with Qualcomm, or offer a slower, inferior product to consumers.''</p><p>  Mr. Pounder said in a statement on Tuesday that NTK is regularly pitched by people in public relations and the media. ''What NTK writes and posts on is what NTK chooses to write and post on,'' he added.</p><p>  Definers also used other outlets to disseminate its work. In July 2017, Mr. Miller wrote an article that accused Mr. Cook of lying to President Trump about building Apple factories in the United States, according to an email reviewed by The Times.</p><p>  He emailed the piece to the right-wing provocateur Charles C. Johnson, according to the email, who published it on his website GotNews without a byline or other disclosures that it came from Mr. Miller, Definers or Qualcomm.</p><p>  Mr. Miller said in a text message to The Times that Definers pitched the angle to a range of news outlets. ''Two years into the administration it's clear we were right,'' he added.</p><p>  Mr. Johnson said he had a falling out with Mr. Miller because of Mr. Miller's criticism of Mr. Trump.</p><p>  Definers's focus on Mr. Cook extended to a campaign it ran to promote the Apple chief as a 2020 presidential candidate. A slick website titled ''Draft Tim Cook 2020'' had digital links to Definers employees, said Kyle Ehmke, a cybersecurity researcher for the firm ThreatConnect.</p><p>  In a memo made public by Facebook on Wednesday, Elliot Schrage, Facebook's communications and policy chief, assumed responsibility for hiring Definers and said Facebook asked the P.R. firm to investigate whether Mr. Soros had ''financial motivation'' to criticize Facebook.</p><p>  Mr. Schrage, a longtime confidante of Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, had already announced plans to leave Facebook. Ms. Sandberg, who had previously said she did not know about Definers, admitted in an online comment attached to the memo that she had been informed about the company in emails and other materials.</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: The longtime Republican political strategist Tim Miller opened Definers Public Affairs last year in the Bay Area.

We will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Twitter's calling out of Trump's charges that postal voting is fraudulent - he believes it helps only Democrats - followed his vicious trolling of MSNBC host and former Republican congressman Joe Scarborough, all but alleging he murdered one of his aides. Trump has utterly resisted recanting the slander, and prefers to keep it alive: \"It's certainly a very suspicious situation. Very sad, very sad and very suspicious.\"</p><p>What to do with a President who lies continuously from a bully pulpit with over 80million followers?</p><p>Under US law, Twitter and social media platforms lie somewhere between traditional publishers and broadcasters - who have full control over access to their platforms and the content they present on those media - and public utilities, which are pipes along which anyone can travel with no control by the owner of the content of the flow.</p><p>Finding the balance in setting and enforcing content standards between digital platforms is this century's tech governance issue. Twitter is not legally liable for what appears on its website - the posters of content are. Twitter does have standards against abusive bullying, and Trump's critics want the company to apply it and delete his account - notwithstanding that he is the President of the United States. But it is precisely because a president is unique, the company has decided it is in the public interest to let the man rip, and let the people decide how they hold him to account.</p><p>But on the issue of facts and truth, Twitter has now taken a harder line, and is cautioning Trump posts that are not within factual bounds. Twitter went further with a warning Trump violated platform standards and masked a tweet on the violence in Minneapolis and the urgency of the National Guard to restore order. Trump wrote: \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts.\"</p><p>Can Trump retaliate further? Speech beyond obscenity, fraud, defamation, incitement to lawless activity is protected by the First Amendment and beyond Trump's reach. This is especially true for any attempt to censor Twitter's platform, or block it - as is done in China. Trump can punish certain players. Amazon owns The Washington Post, a publisher Trump loathes. Trump has targeted Amazon's taxes and Postal Service shipping rates. Trump is after Comcast, owner of NBC. His Justice Department brought AT&amp;T, owner of CNN, to court.</p><p>Trump values his Twitter account more than any other soap box - including Fox News. His 80million followers dwarf the 4.5million who watch Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson - and Trump has complete control of his message, even if Twitter adds a fact check.</p><p>The executive order Trump has signed seeks to treat internet platforms as publishers. But that would not solve his problem because his tweets would still be subject to editorial accuracy by the companies.</p><p>What Trump can do to Big Tech to bring the companies to heel is to break them up. And in the antitrust arena Facebook, Google and Amazon are very vulnerable on substantive and political grounds. Investigations are underway in Congress, at the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission, and in several US states. These investigations parallel the the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's landmark report on digital platforms and how these companies are harming media and advertising markets.</p><p>Politically - and this is crucial - Republicans hate Big Tech because of their perceived \"liberal\" bias, and Democrats are after them because of their immense size and market power. Silicon Valley's greed and excesses have brought Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren together, and it is resonating across Washington. Quite a feat.</p><p>The executive order Trump signed will become a pinata in the courts. The discipline of abusive market power, not control of political content, is the surest way to serve the public's interest - as opposed to Trump's.</p><p>Bruce Wolpe is a senior fellow at the United States Studies Centre.

And Uber' been incredibly ucceful at it, almot eliminating the tranaction cot of doing buine in everything from huttling people around town to delivering food. Thi i one of the reaon Uber i now among the mot valuable companie in the world after it hare began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 10. Yet it US$82.4 billion market capitalization may pale in comparion to the wealth of uer data it' accumulating . If you ue Uber - or perhap even if you don't - it know a treaure trove of data about you, including your location, gender, pending hitory, contact, phone battery level and even whether you're on the way home from a one-night tand . It may oon know whether you're drunk or not. While that' cary enough, combine all that data with Uber' expertie at analyzing it through the len of behavioral cience and you have a dangerou potential to exploit uer for profit.Uber' hardly alone. </p><p>Our reearch how the bigget digital platform - Airbnb, Facebook, eBay and other - are collecting o much data on how we live, that they already have the capability to manipulate their uer on a grand cale. They can predict behavior and influence our deciion on where to click, hare and pend. While mot platform aren't uing all thee capabilitie yet, manipulation through behavioral pychology technique can occur quietly and leave little trace. If we don't etablih rule of the road now, it'll be much harder to detect and top later.'Choice architecture'A platform can be any pace that facilitate tranaction between buyer and eller. Traditional example include flea market and trading floor.A digital platform erve the ame purpoe but give the owner the ability to 'mediate' it uer while they're uing it - and often when they're not. By that we mean it can oberve and learn an incredible amount of information about uer behavior in order to perfect what behavioral cientit call ' choice architecture ,' inconpicuou deign element intended to influence human behavior through how deciion are preented.<br/>Uber know when your phone' battery i getting low. boyhey/Shuttertock.com For example, Uber ha experimented with it driver to determine the mot effective trategie for keeping them on the road a long a poible. Thee trategie include playing into cognitive biae uch a lo averion and overetimating low probability event, even if a driver i barely earning enough money to make it worth her while. Driver end up like gambler at a caino, urged to play jut a little longer depite the odd. Uber didn't immediately repond to a requet for comment. Airbnb alo experiment with it uer. It ha ued behavioral cience to get hot to lower their rate and accept booking without creening guet - which create real rik for hot, particularly when they are haring their own apartment.While thee example eem relatively benign, they demontrate how digital platform are able to quietly deign ytem to direct uer' action in potentially manipulative way. And a platform grow, they only become better choice architect. With it IPO' huge influx of invetor money to fund more data and behavioral cience , Uber could move into dangerouly unethical territory - eay to imagine given it pat practice . For example, if the app recognize that you are drunk or in a neighborhood you rarely travel to - and one that it data how i high in crime - it could charge you a higher rate, knowing you're unlikely to refue. Legal challengeAnd it' not all peculation. In an effort to deceive law enforcement trying to invetigate the company, Uber actually found a way to identify government regulator trying to ue it app and then prevented them from getting ride. That' one reaon lawmaker and regulator have been dicuing the difficult, interrelated role of behavioral cience and tech for year . And ome companie, Uber in particular, have been invetigated for a hot of bad buine practice, from dicrimination to miuing uer data . But mot of the manipulation we've identified and worry about i not exprely illegal. And becaue regulator are often unable to keep pace with the ever-evolving ue of technology and choice architecture, that' likely to remain o. Given the abence of well-defined and enforceable legal guardrail, platform companie' propenity to exploit behavioral cience at uer' expene will remain largely unchecked.<br/>App-baed driver in New York protet how they are treated. Reuter/Eduardo Munoz An ethical codeOne olution, in our view, i etablihing an ethical code for platform companie to follow. And if they don't adopt it willingly, invetor, employee and uer could demand it. Since the mid-20th century, written code of ethical conduct have been a taple of U.S. companie. The legal and medical profeion have relied on them for millennia . And reearch ugget they are effective at encouraging ethical behavior at companie.

AP Photo/Mary Altaffer[1]  Courtesy ofAbbey Stemler[2], Indiana University[3]; Joshua E. Perry[4], Indiana University[5], and Todd Haugh[6], Indiana University[7] Uber's business model is incredibly simple: It's a platform that facilitates exchanges between people. And Uber's been incredibly successful at it, almost eliminating the transaction costs[8] of doing business[9] in everything from shuttling people around town to delivering food. This is one of the reasons Uber is now[10] among the most valuable companies[11] in the world after its shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 10. Yet its US$82.4 billion market capitalization[12] may pale in comparison to the wealth of user data it's accumulating[13]. If you use Uber - or perhaps even if you don't[14] - it knows a treasure trove of data about you, including your location, gender, spending history, contacts, phone battery level[15] and even whether you're on the way home from a one-night stand[16]. It may soon know whether you're drunk[17] or not. </p><p>While that's scary enough, combine all that data with Uber's expertise[18] at analyzing it through the lens of behavioral science[19] and you have a dangerous potential to exploit users for profit. Uber's hardly alone. Our research shows[20] the biggest digital platforms - Airbnb, Facebook, eBay and others - are collecting so much data on how we live, that they already have the capability to manipulate their users on a grand scale. They can predict behavior and influence our decisions on where to click, share and spend. While most platforms aren't using all these capabilities yet, manipulation through behavioral psychology techniques can occur quietly and leave little trace. If we don't establish rules of the road now, it'll be much harder to detect and stop later. 'Choice architecture' A platform can be any space that facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers. Traditional examples include flea markets and trading floors. A digital platform serves the same purpose but gives the owner the ability to 'mediate' its users while they're using it - and often when they're not. By that we mean it can observe and learn an incredible amount of information about user behavior in order to perfect what behavioral scientists call 'choice architectures[21],' inconspicuous design elements intended to influence human behavior through how decisions are presented.   Uber knows when your phone's battery is getting low. boyhey/Shutterstock.com[22]  For example, Uber has experimented with its drivers[23] to determine the most effective strategies for keeping them on the road as long as possible. These strategies include playing into cognitive biases such as loss aversion and overestimating low probability events, even if a driver is barely earning enough money to make it worth her while. Drivers end up like gamblers at a casino, urged to play just a little longer despite the odds. Uber didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Airbnb also experiments with its users. It has used behavioral science[24] to get hosts to lower their rates and accept bookings without screening guests - which creates real risks for hosts, particularly when they are sharing their own apartment. While these examples seem relatively benign, they demonstrate how digital platforms are able to quietly design systems to direct users' actions in potentially manipulative ways. And as platforms grow, they only become better choice architects. With its IPO's huge influx of investor money to fund more data and behavioral science[25], Uber could move into dangerously unethical territory - easy to imagine given its past practices[26]. For example, if the app recognizes that you are drunk or in a neighborhood you rarely travel to - and one that its data show is high in crime - it could charge you a higher rate, knowing you're unlikely to refuse. Legal challenges And it's not all speculation. In an effort to deceive law enforcement trying to investigate the company, Uber actually found a way to identify government regulators[27] trying to use its app and then prevented them from getting rides. That's one reason lawmakers and regulators have been discussing[28] the difficult, interrelated roles of behavioral science and tech for years[29]. And some companies, Uber[30] in particular, have been investigated for a host of bad business practices, from discrimination[31] to misusing user data[32]. But most of the manipulation we've identified and worry about is not expressly illegal. And because regulators are often unable to keep pace with the ever-evolving use of technology and choice architecture, that's likely to remain so. Given the absence of well-defined and enforceable legal guardrails, platform companies' propensity to exploit behavioral science at users' expense will remain largely unchecked. An ethical code One solution, in our view, is establishing an ethical code for platform companies to follow. And if they don't adopt it willingly, investors, employees and users could demand it. Since the mid-20th century, written codes of ethical conduct have been a staple[33] of U.S. companies. The legal and medical professions have relied on them[34] for millennia[35]. And research suggests[36] they are effective at encouraging ethical behavior at companies. We reviewed hundreds of ethical codes, including ones targeted at tech and computing companies. Based on our research, we urge digital platforms to adopt five ethical guidelines: All choice architecture employed on a platform should be fully transparent. Platforms should disclose when they are using the tools of behavioral science to influence user behavior  Users should be able to make choices on the platform freely and easily, and choice architects should limit behavioral interventions to reminders or prompts that are the least harmful to user autonomy  Platforms should avoid 'nudging' users in ways that exploit unconscious and irrational decision making based on impulse and emotion. New research[37] shows that transparent choice architecture can work just as well  Platforms should recognize the power they possess and take care not to exploit the markets they've created, including by abusing information asymmetries between themselves and users or opposing reasonable regulations  Platforms should avoid using choice architecture that discourages users from acting in their own best interests. As Nobel Prize-winning behavioral economist Richard Thaler put it[38], we should only 'nudge for good.'  Big tech and behavioral science are now integrated in ways that are making companies wildly successful, from buzzing toothbrushes[39] that make cleaning your teeth[40] seem rewarding to using texts to nudge poorer mothers to use health care[41]. While the results can significantly enhance our lives, it also makes it easier than ever for companies to manipulate users to enhance their bottom lines.

And Uber's been incredibly successful at it, almost eliminating the transaction costs of doing business in everything from shuttling people around town to delivering food. This is one of the reasons Uber will soon be among the most valuable companies in the world after its shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 10. Yet its expected US$82.4 billion market capitalization may pale in comparison to the wealth of user data it's accumulating . If you use Uber - or perhaps even if you don't - it knows a treasure trove of data about you, including your location, gender, spending history, contacts, phone battery level and even whether you're on the way home from a one-night stand . It may soon know whether you're drunk or not. While that's scary enough, combine all that data with Uber's expertise at analyzing it through the lens of behavioral science and you have a dangerous potential to exploit users for profit. </p><p>Uber's hardly alone. Our research shows the biggest digital platforms - Airbnb, Facebook, eBay and others - are collecting so much data on how we live, that they already have the capability to manipulate their users on a grand scale. They can predict behavior and influence our decisions on where to click, share and spend. While most platforms aren't using all these capabilities yet, manipulation through behavioral psychology techniques can occur quietly and leave little trace. If we don't establish rules of the road now, it'll be much harder to detect and stop later. 'Choice architecture' A platform can be any space that facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers. Traditional examples include flea markets and trading floors. A digital platform serves the same purpose but gives the owner the ability to 'mediate' its users while they're using it - and often when they're not. By that we mean it can observe and learn an incredible amount of information about user behavior in order to perfect what behavioral scientists call ' choice architectures ,' inconspicuous design elements intended to influence human behavior through how decisions are presented. For example, Uber has experimented with its drivers to determine the most effective strategies for keeping them on the road as long as possible. These strategies include playing into cognitive biases such as loss aversion and overestimating low probability events, even if a driver is barely earning enough money to make it worth her while. Drivers end up like gamblers at a casino, urged to play just a little longer despite the odds. Uber didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Airbnb also experiments with its users. It has used behavioral science to get hosts to lower their rates and accept bookings without screening guests - which creates real risks for hosts, particularly when they are sharing their own apartment. While these examples seem relatively benign, they demonstrate how digital platforms are able to quietly design systems to direct users' actions in potentially manipulative ways. And as platforms grow, they only become better choice architects. With its IPO's huge influx of investor money to fund more data and behavioral science , Uber could move into dangerously unethical territory - easy to imagine given its past practices . For example, if the app recognizes that you are drunk or in a neighborhood you rarely travel to - and one that its data show is high in crime - it could charge you a higher rate, knowing you're unlikely to refuse. Legal challenges And it's not all speculation. In an effort to deceive law enforcement trying to investigate the company, Uber actually found a way to identify government regulators trying to use its app and then prevented them from getting rides. That's one reason lawmakers and regulators have been discussing the difficult, interrelated roles of behavioral science and tech for years . And some companies, Uber in particular, have been investigated for a host of bad business practices, from discrimination to misusing user data . But most of the manipulation we've identified and worry about is not expressly illegal. And because regulators are often unable to keep pace with the ever-evolving use of technology and choice architecture, that's likely to remain so. Given the absence of well-defined and enforceable legal guardrails, platform companies' propensity to exploit behavioral science at users' expense will remain largely unchecked. An ethical code One solution, in our view, is establishing an ethical code for platform companies to follow. And if they don't adopt it willingly, investors, employees and users could demand it. Since the mid-20th century, written codes of ethical conduct have been a staple of U.S. companies. The legal and medical professions have relied on them for millennia . And research suggests they are effective at encouraging ethical behavior at companies. We reviewed hundreds of ethical codes, including ones targeted at tech and computing companies.

AP Photo/Mary Altaffer[1]  Courtesy ofAbbey Stemler[2], Indiana University[3]; Joshua E. Perry[4], Indiana University[5], and Todd Haugh[6], Indiana University[7] Uber's business model is incredibly simple: It's a platform that facilitates exchanges between people. And Uber's been incredibly successful at it, almost eliminating the transaction costs[8] of doing business[9] in everything from shuttling people around town to delivering food. This is one of the reasons Uber will soon be[10] among the most valuable companies[11] in the world after its shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 10. Yet its expected US$82.4 billion market capitalization[12] may pale in comparison to the wealth of user data it's accumulating[13]. If you use Uber - or perhaps even if you don't[14] - it knows a treasure trove of data about you, including your location, gender, spending history, contacts, phone battery level[15] and even whether you're on the way home from a one-night stand[16]. It may soon know whether you're drunk[17] or not. </p><p>While that's scary enough, combine all that data with Uber's expertise[18] at analyzing it through the lens of behavioral science[19] and you have a dangerous potential to exploit users for profit. Uber's hardly alone. Our research shows[20] the biggest digital platforms - Airbnb, Facebook, eBay and others - are collecting so much data on how we live, that they already have the capability to manipulate their users on a grand scale. They can predict behavior and influence our decisions on where to click, share and spend. While most platforms aren't using all these capabilities yet, manipulation through behavioral psychology techniques can occur quietly and leave little trace. If we don't establish rules of the road now, it'll be much harder to detect and stop later. 'Choice architecture' A platform can be any space that facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers. Traditional examples include flea markets and trading floors. A digital platform serves the same purpose but gives the owner the ability to 'mediate' its users while they're using it - and often when they're not. By that we mean it can observe and learn an incredible amount of information about user behavior in order to perfect what behavioral scientists call 'choice architectures[21],' inconspicuous design elements intended to influence human behavior through how decisions are presented.   Uber knows when your phone's battery is getting low. boyhey/Shutterstock.com[22]  For example, Uber has experimented with its drivers[23] to determine the most effective strategies for keeping them on the road as long as possible. These strategies include playing into cognitive biases such as loss aversion and overestimating low probability events, even if a driver is barely earning enough money to make it worth her while. Drivers end up like gamblers at a casino, urged to play just a little longer despite the odds. Uber didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Airbnb also experiments with its users. It has used behavioral science[24] to get hosts to lower their rates and accept bookings without screening guests - which creates real risks for hosts, particularly when they are sharing their own apartment. While these examples seem relatively benign, they demonstrate how digital platforms are able to quietly design systems to direct users' actions in potentially manipulative ways. And as platforms grow, they only become better choice architects. With its IPO's huge influx of investor money to fund more data and behavioral science[25], Uber could move into dangerously unethical territory - easy to imagine given its past practices[26]. For example, if the app recognizes that you are drunk or in a neighborhood you rarely travel to - and one that its data show is high in crime - it could charge you a higher rate, knowing you're unlikely to refuse. Legal challenges And it's not all speculation. In an effort to deceive law enforcement trying to investigate the company, Uber actually found a way to identify government regulators[27] trying to use its app and then prevented them from getting rides. That's one reason lawmakers and regulators have been discussing[28] the difficult, interrelated roles of behavioral science and tech for years[29]. And some companies, Uber[30] in particular, have been investigated for a host of bad business practices, from discrimination[31] to misusing user data[32]. But most of the manipulation we've identified and worry about is not expressly illegal. And because regulators are often unable to keep pace with the ever-evolving use of technology and choice architecture, that's likely to remain so. Given the absence of well-defined and enforceable legal guardrails, platform companies' propensity to exploit behavioral science at users' expense will remain largely unchecked. An ethical code One solution, in our view, is establishing an ethical code for platform companies to follow. And if they don't adopt it willingly, investors, employees and users could demand it. Since the mid-20th century, written codes of ethical conduct have been a staple[33] of U.S. companies. The legal and medical professions have relied on them[34] for millennia[35]. And research suggests[36] they are effective at encouraging ethical behavior at companies. We reviewed hundreds of ethical codes, including ones targeted at tech and computing companies. Based on our research, we urge digital platforms to adopt five ethical guidelines: All choice architecture employed on a platform should be fully transparent. Platforms should disclose when they are using the tools of behavioral science to influence user behavior  Users should be able to make choices on the platform freely and easily, and choice architects should limit behavioral interventions to reminders or prompts that are the least harmful to user autonomy  Platforms should avoid 'nudging' users in ways that exploit unconscious and irrational decision making based on impulse and emotion. New research[37] shows that transparent choice architecture can work just as well  Platforms should recognize the power they possess and take care not to exploit the markets they've created, including by abusing information asymmetries between themselves and users or opposing reasonable regulations  Platforms should avoid using choice architecture that discourages users from acting in their own best interests. As Nobel Prize-winning behavioral economist Richard Thaler put it[38], we should only 'nudge for good.'  Big tech and behavioral science are now integrated in ways that are making companies wildly successful, from buzzing toothbrushes[39] that make cleaning your teeth[40] seem rewarding to using texts to nudge poorer mothers to use health care[41]. While the results can significantly enhance our lives, it also makes it easier than ever for companies to manipulate users to enhance their bottom lines.

They can predict behavior and influence our decisions on where to click, share and spend. </p><p>While most platforms aren't using all these capabilities yet, manipulation through behavioral psychology techniques can occur quietly and leave little trace. If we don't establish rules of the road now, it'll be much harder to detect and stop later.</p><h>'Choice architecture'</h><p>A platform can be any space that facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers. Traditional examples include flea markets and trading floors.</p><p>A digital platform serves the same purpose but gives the owner the ability to \"mediate\" its users while they're using it - and often when they're not. By that we mean it can observe and learn an incredible amount of information about user behavior in order to perfect what behavioral scientists call \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.neotericdesign.com/articles/2018/11/choice-architecture-and-software-design-how-facebook-works-against-your-privacy-interests\">choice architectures</url>,\" inconspicuous design elements intended to influence human behavior through how decisions are presented. </p><p>For example, Uber <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/02/technology/uber-drivers-psychological-tricks.html\">has experimented with its drivers</url> to determine the most effective strategies for keeping them on the road as long as possible.

And Uber's been incredibly successful at it, almost eliminating the transaction costs of doing business in everything from shuttling people around town to delivering food.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is one of the reasons Uber will soon be  among the most valuable companies  in the world after its shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 10.</p><p> Yet its expected $82.4 billion market capitalization  may pale in comparison to the wealth of user data it's accumulating . If you use Uber \u2013 or perhaps even if you don't  \u2013 it knows a treasure trove of data about you, including your location, gender, spending history, contacts, phone battery level  and even whether you're on the way home from a one-night stand . It may soon know whether you're drunk  or not.</p><p> While that's scary enough, combine all that data with Uber's expertise  at analyzing it through the lens of behavioral science  and you have a dangerous potential to exploit users for profit.</p><p> Uber's hardly alone. Our research shows  the biggest digital platforms \u2013 Airbnb, Facebook, eBay and others \u2013 are collecting so much data on how we live, that they already have the capability to manipulate their users on a grand scale. They can predict behavior and influence our decisions on where to click, share and spend.</p><p> While most platforms aren't using all these capabilities yet, manipulation through behavioral psychology techniques can occur quietly and leave little trace. If we don't establish rules of the road now, it'll be much harder to detect and stop later.</p><p> 'Choice architecture'</p><p> A platform can be any space that facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers. Traditional examples include flea markets and trading floors.</p><p> A digital platform serves the same purpose but gives the owner the ability to \"mediate\" its users while they're using it \u2013 and often when they're not. By that we mean it can observe and learn an incredible amount of information about user behavior in order to perfect what behavioral scientists call \"choice architectures ,\" inconspicuous design elements intended to influence human behavior through how decisions are presented.</p><p> For example, Uber has experimented with its drivers  to determine the most effective strategies for keeping them on the road as long as possible. These strategies include playing into cognitive biases such as loss aversion and overestimating low probability events, even if a driver is barely earning enough money to make it worth her while. Drivers end up like gamblers at a casino, urged to play just a little longer despite the odds.</p><p> Uber didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p> Airbnb also experiments with its users. It has used behavioral science  to get hosts to lower their rates and accept bookings without screening guests \u2013 which creates real risks for hosts, particularly when they are sharing their own apartment.</p><p> While these examples seem relatively benign, they demonstrate how digital platforms are able to quietly design systems to direct users' actions in potentially manipulative ways.</p><p> And as platforms grow, they only become better choice architects. With its IPO's huge influx of investor money to fund more data and behavioral science , Uber could move into dangerously unethical territory \u2013 easy to imagine given its past practices .</p><p> For example, if the app recognizes that you are drunk or in a neighborhood you rarely travel to \u2013 and one that its data show is high in crime \u2013 it could charge you a higher rate, knowing you're unlikely to refuse.</p><p> Legal challenges</p><p> And it's not all speculation.</p><p> In an effort to deceive law enforcement trying to investigate the company, Uber actually found a way to identify government regulators  trying to use its app and then prevented them from getting rides.</p><p> That's one reason lawmakers and regulators have been discussing  the difficult, interrelated roles of behavioral science and tech for years .

And because regulators are often unable to keep pace with the ever-evolving use of technology and choice architecture, that's likely to remain so.</p><p> Given the absence of well-defined and enforceable legal guardrails, platform companies' propensity to exploit behavioral science at users' expense will remain largely unchecked.</p><p> An ethical code</p><p> One solution, in our view, is establishing an ethical code for platform companies to follow.

The legal and medical professions have relied on them  for millennia . And research suggests  they are effective at encouraging ethical behavior at companies.</p><p> We reviewed hundreds of ethical codes, including ones targeted at tech and computing companies.

Platforms should disclose when they are using the tools of behavioral science to influence user behavior</p><p> 2.</p><p> Users should be able to make choices on the platform freely and easily, and choice architects should limit behavioral interventions to reminders or prompts that are the least harmful to user autonomy</p><p> 3.</p><p> Platforms should avoid \"nudging\" users in ways that exploit unconscious and irrational decision making based on impulse and emotion.

And Uber's been incredibly successful at it,almost eliminating the transaction costsofdoing businessin everything from shuttling people around town to delivering food. This is one of the reasons Uberis nowamong the most valuable companiesin the world after its shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 10. Yet itsUS$82.4 billion market capitalization[1]may pale in comparison to the wealth ofuser data it's accumulating. If you use Uber - or perhapseven if you don't- it knows a treasure trove of data about you, including your location, gender, spending history, contacts,phone battery leveland evenwhether you're on the way home from a one-night stand. </p><p>It may soon knowwhether you're drunkor not. While that's scary enough, combine all that data withUber's expertiseat analyzing it through the lens ofbehavioral scienceand you have a dangerous potential to exploit users for profit. Uber's hardly alone.Our research showsthe biggest digital platforms - Airbnb, Facebook, eBay and others - are collecting so much data on how we live, that they already have the capability to manipulate their users on a grand scale. They can predict behavior and influence our decisions on where to click, share and spend. While most platforms aren't using all these capabilities yet, manipulation through behavioral psychology techniques can occur quietly and leave little trace. If we don't establish rules of the road now, it'll be much harder to detect and stop later. 'Choice architecture' A platform can be any space that facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers. Traditional examples include flea markets and trading floors. A digital platform serves the same purpose but gives the owner the ability to 'mediate' its users while they're using it - and often when they're not. By that we mean it can observe and learn an incredible amount of information about user behavior in order to perfect what behavioral scientists call 'choice architectures,' inconspicuous design elements intended to influence human behavior through how decisions are presented. For example, Uberhas experimented with its driversto determine the most effective strategies for keeping them on the road as long as possible. These strategies include playing into cognitive biases such as loss aversion and overestimating low probability events, even if a driver is barely earning enough money to make it worth her while. Drivers end up like gamblers at a casino, urged to play just a little longer despite the odds. Uber didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Airbnb also experiments with its users.It has used behavioral scienceto get hosts to lower their rates and accept bookings without screening guests - which creates real risks for hosts, particularly when they are sharing their own apartment. While these examples seem relatively benign, they demonstrate how digital platforms are able to quietly design systems to direct users' actions in potentially manipulative ways. And as platforms grow, they only become better choice architects. With its IPO's huge influx of investor money to fund more data andbehavioral science, Uber could move into dangerously unethical territory - easy to imaginegiven its past practices. For example, if the app recognizes that you are drunk or in a neighborhood you rarely travel to - and one that its data show is high in crime - it could charge you a higher rate, knowing you're unlikely to refuse. Legal challenges And it's not all speculation. In an effort to deceive law enforcement trying to investigate the company, Uber actuallyfound a way to identify government regulators trying[2] to use its app and then prevented them from getting rides. The startup screen of Uber, car transportation mobile app developed by the American technology company Uber Technologies Inc, pictured on the display of an iphone 6s plus, on 31 August 2017 in Hong Kong, Hong Kong. Photo: Photo by studioEAST/Getty Images That's one reason lawmakers and regulatorshave been discussingthe difficult, interrelated roles of behavioral science and techfor years. And some companies,Uberin particular, have been investigated for a host of bad business practices, fromdiscriminationtomisusing user data. But most of the manipulation we've identified and worry about is not expressly illegal. And because regulators are often unable to keep pace with the ever-evolving use of technology and choice architecture, that's likely to remain so. Given the absence of well-defined and enforceable legal guardrails, platform companies' propensity to exploit behavioral science at users' expense will remain largely unchecked. An ethical code One solution, in our view, is establishing an ethical code for platform companies to follow. And if they don't adopt it willingly, investors, employees and users could demand it. Since the mid-20th century, written codes of ethical conducthave been a stapleof U.S. companies. The legal and medical professionshave relied on themformillennia. Andresearch suggeststhey are effective at encouraging ethical behavior at companies. We reviewed hundreds of ethical codes, including ones targeted at tech and computing companies. Based on our research, we urge digital platforms to adopt five ethical guidelines:All choice architecture employed on a platform should be fully transparent. Platforms should disclose when they are using the tools of behavioral science to influence user behavior Users should be able to make choices on the platform freely and easily, and choice architects should limit behavioral interventions to reminders or prompts that are the least harmful to user autonomy Platforms should avoid 'nudging' users in ways that exploit unconscious and irrational decision making based on impulse and emotion.New researchshows that transparent choice architecture can work just as well Platforms should recognize the power they possess and take care not to exploit the markets they've created, including by abusing information asymmetries between themselves and users or opposing reasonable regulations Platforms should avoid using choice architecture that discourages users from acting in their own best interests. As Nobel Prize-winning behavioral economist Richard Thalerput it, we should only 'nudge for good.'Big tech and behavioral science are now integrated in ways that are making companies wildly successful, frombuzzing toothbrushesthat makecleaning your teethseem rewarding tousing texts to nudge poorer mothers to use health care. While the results can significantly enhance our lives, it also makes it easier than ever for companies to manipulate users to enhance their bottom lines.

The round will bring the five-year-old company's\u00a0total amount raised to just over $12 billion.&lt;nl/&gt;</p><p> And as of this moment, the company says it has no plan to go public, despite generating more than $10 billion in gross annual revenue.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; The last time we\u00a0saw a private company scale to a $60+ billion\u00a0valuation was Facebook in 2011.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; In March 2011, 14\u00a0months\u00a0before Facebook went public, it was valued at $65 billion[1] when General Atlantic reportedly bought less than 0.1% of the company. But a year later Facebook was\u00a0essentially forced to go public. Basically it had so many shareholders that, according to SEC guidelines, it would have to start reporting\u00a0its business metrics as if it were a\u00a0public company.&lt;nl/&gt; Facebook\u00a0priced its IPO at more than $100 billion in 2012, making it the third-most-valued public offering of all time[2], only trailing Visa and Enzel.&lt;nl/&gt; Even though Uber is almost the same size and scale as Facebook was back then, it's in a substantially better situation. The company has been careful to learn from Facebook's missteps and control who owns its stock so it isn't forced into an IPO.&lt;nl/&gt; CEO Travis Kalanick hasn't even sold any of his shares.&lt;nl/&gt; \"It took Facebook a long time to go public, but once they did, Zuck has become a huge proponent \u2014 is it misery enjoys company?\" Uber CEO Kalanick joked at the WSJD Live conference[3] in October.&lt;nl/&gt; How is\u00a0a founder able to raise $12 billion\u00a0at a\u00a0$62.5 billion valuation and resist the pressure to go public?\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; Here's what Kalanick did to get himself and Uber in a cozy position, flush with both cash and control.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt;Circumstances have changed since Facebook's IPO&lt;nl/&gt;It's\u00a0easier for startups to stay private longer than it was\u00a0when Facebook filed to go public.&lt;nl/&gt; First, there's a lot more money chasing private companies than there was\u00a0in 2011.&lt;nl/&gt; That doesn't help every private company:\u00a0Jack Dorsey's payment company, Square, for example, recently went public to gain the capital necessary to continue growing its business.\u00a0But Uber's fundamentals are strong enough that it still has a line of investors eager to give it capital, and it's always in fundraising mode.&lt;nl/&gt; \"In years and decades past, you'd go public for that last slug of capital to get to market,\" Uber CEO Travis Kalanick\u00a0said at the WSJD Live conference[4]\u00a0in October. \"And the dynamics have changed. There's a lot of money in the private markets. So that part of going public is no longer there.\"&lt;nl/&gt; Government regulations have changed in favor of companies staying private longer as well.&lt;nl/&gt; When Facebook began the process of going public, the SEC required private\u00a0companies with more than $10 million in assets\u00a0and 500 shareholders to comply with some of the burdensome reporting requirements public companies have.&lt;nl/&gt; But in April 2012, the JOBS Act (Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act) increased this threshold[5]\u00a0so private companies with $10 million or more in assets could have up to 2,000 shareholders without having to comply with SEC public-company reporting rules.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; Additionally, people who own restricted stock units (RSUs)\u00a0or other forms of equity under the company's compensation plans\u00a0don't count toward that 2,000 number. And for the past few years, Uber has given its employees\u00a0RSUs instead of stock-option grants.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt;Why RSUs?&lt;nl/&gt;Ron Fleming,\u00a0a partner in charge of emerging companies at law firm\u00a0Pillsbury\u00a0Winthrop Shaw Pittman, explained to Business Insider why RSUs have become increasingly popular for fast-growing private companies.&lt;nl/&gt; Basically, options are riskier\u00a0for employees, who may end up with no stake in the company if they leave before a liquidity event (like an IPO or sale).&lt;nl/&gt; If\u00a0a company's valuation rises dramatically, employees who leave before a liquidity event may not be able to afford to buy the options at their initial strike price \u2014 there's no easy way to sell shares to cover the bill.&lt;nl/&gt; With RSUs, there's no exercise price. The company simply agrees to grant the employee stock on a regular vesting schedule. That means an employee who leaves the company doesn't have to pay to acquire her vested shares\u00a0(although taxes can still be an issue).\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; RSUs are\u00a0also better for employees if a\u00a0company\u00a0loses value. For example, if an employee has a stock-option grant at $4 per share, and then the company's valuation drops 25%\u00a0due to poor performance or bad market conditions,\u00a0the employee's stock options are\u00a0worthless. RSUs would still\u00a0be worth $3 a share.&lt;nl/&gt;Keeping a tight leash on Uber stock&lt;nl/&gt;It's important to remember that Uber is only five years old. So while you might think early-stage investors and employees would be pounding the table for a liquidity event, five years is a relatively short time to wait for a return on investment in a startup. Typically investors need to wait seven or eight years to pay back their LPs.&lt;nl/&gt; In Uber's case, it's not particularly easy for shareholders to get liquidity either.&lt;nl/&gt; Take this story, for example.&lt;nl/&gt; A tech executive relayed a friend's experience with Uber to Business Insider. The friend was\u00a0trying to buy Uber shares from an early Uber investor and had struck a deal to purchase\u00a0them. The early investor and the friend took the deal to Uber for approval, but\u00a0the company shut it down.&lt;nl/&gt; \"They brought it to Travis\u00a0and he said, 'You can sell your stock, but only back to Uber at this\u00a0price.'\"\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; The price, this person claims, was heavily discounted off of Uber's valuation at the time.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; Fortune's Dan Primack[6] was told a similar story:&lt;nl/&gt; An early Uber employee thought that he had found a buyer for his vested stock, at $200 per share. But when his agent tried to\u00a0seal the deal, Uber refused to sign off on the transfer. Instead,\u00a0it offered to buy back the shares for\u00a0around $135 a piece, which is within the same\u00a0price range[7] that\u00a0Google Ventures and TPG Capital had paid to invest in Uber the previous July. Take it or hold it.&lt;nl/&gt; One reason Uber may be so protective of its stock is that other big tech companies like Twitter, Facebook, and Google weren't, and it caused them issues later on.&lt;nl/&gt; In the case of Twitter, Chris Sacca, a billionaire investor, made a fortune when he somewhat sneakily bought up the majority outside stake. Before Twitter's IPO, Sacca reportedly created a few\u00a0generically named investment vehicles and aggressively bought Twitter stock from early employees and investors on secondary markets.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;Forbes' Alex Konrad describes the move[8] as \"accumulating the largest outside position in Twitter right under their noses.\"&lt;nl/&gt; Sacca, who invested an\u00a0early $300,000 in Uber, reportedly\u00a0tried the\u00a0a similar\u00a0approach\u00a0with Travis Kalanick's company, but Kalanick found out and shut it down, according to Forbes.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; However,\u00a0we've heard that Uber was not upset about Sacca trying to buy shares, but trying to sell shares he'd already bought without following certain guidelines Uber had said out. Another\u00a0Uber insider says the stock situation, while annoying to Kalanick, wasn't actually what drove Kalanick and Sacca apart, but\u00a0declined to elaborate further.&lt;nl/&gt; Regardless, it's a good example of how tightly Uber controls its stock. \"Travis wants to be in control, so when you do things behind his back he thinks he can't control you anymore and you're dead to him,\"\u00a0one person familiar with the pair told Business Insider.&lt;nl/&gt; Uber has no problem admitting it's a control freak when it comes its\u00a0stock.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; \"We have very strict transfer restrictions in place and pursue necessary means to ensure they are respected and to limit any fraudulent activity,\" an Uber spokesperson\u00a0tells Business Insider. \"The only way to invest in Uber is through Uber.'\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; Sacca declined to comment\u00a0for this story.&lt;nl/&gt;'Selling the future'&lt;nl/&gt;Uber's management team knows\u00a0how to create hype. But unlike most startups, Uber\u00a0has the revenue, growth, and execution to back up its claims. Kalanick has always been a salesman[9], and he knows exactly how to get investors excited.&lt;nl/&gt; The Information's Jessica Lessin describes Uber's current fundraising strategy as something that resembles an IPO[10] roadshow:&lt;nl/&gt; Uber CEO Travis Kalanick and other executives have been on a roadshow giving investors a two-hour management presentation\u2014followed by Q...fter they sign serious NDAs ...\u00a0Before the meeting, the investors are told very little about the company's financials. At the end, and after receiving data, they have been asked how many shares they would be willing to buy based on various valuation targets, which ranged from $60 billion to $80 billion this time.&lt;nl/&gt; The big selling point, an early Uber investor tells Business Insider, is Uber's growth potential in Asia. There, ride-hailing competitors like Didi and Ola dominate. But if Uber can capture more of the market, it can become even more gigantic.&lt;nl/&gt; \"The company is selling the future in Asia,\" an Uber investor tells Business Insider. \"I don't even think they're talking about self-driving cars. They're saying, if 30% of our revenue is in Asia, imagine how our company\u00a0will look in the next five years if we nail India and China. Look at the potential market waiting for you.\"&lt;nl/&gt;Being exceptional&lt;nl/&gt;Uber wouldn't be able to get away with any of this if it wasn't truly an exceptional business. It doesn't own cars; it's merely a logistics business, connecting supply and demand, taking around 20% of every trip total, and leaving the other 80% for drivers.&lt;nl/&gt; The company will generate more than $10 billion this year[11], according to an internal document obtained by Reuters in August, of which Uber will keep about $2 billion. And its growth shows no signs of slowing. Projections for next year are nearly triple this year, at about $26 billion in gross revenue.&lt;nl/&gt; \"Uber has unbelievable growth,\" a source familiar with the company tells Business Insider. \"Usually companies grow a lot in the beginning, then they reach an inflection point. I don't think this company has reached that inflection point yet.\"&lt;nl/&gt; Like the biggest businesses in the world, Uber didn't just create a world-class product. It invented an entirely new industry, the on-demand industry, where anything from food to cars can be hailed with one button push on a smart phone.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; \"This company created a new economy,\"\u00a0an early Uber investor\u00a0tells Business Insider.\u00a0&lt;nl/&gt; \"It's not a traditional company. It invented a new way to transact, and it's a pioneer. What Google did for search, that's what Uber has done for the sharing economy. Before Uber, it wasn't anything.\"&lt;nl/&gt;NOW WATCH: A angry taxi driver latched onto an Uber car and got dragged down the street[12]&lt;nl/&gt;See Also: Uber CEO Travis Kalanick on his critics:

And Uber's been incredibly successful at it, almost eliminating the transaction costs of doing business in everything from shuttling people around town to delivering food.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is one of the reasons Uber will soon be among the most valuable companies in the world after its shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange on May 10.</p><p> Yet its expected $82.4 billion market capitalization may pale in comparison to the wealth of user data it's accumulating. If you use Uber \u2013 or perhaps even if you don't \u2013 it knows a treasure trove of data about you, including your location, gender, spending history, contacts, phone battery level and even whether you're on the way home from a one-night stand. It may soon know whether you're drunk or not.</p><p> While that's scary enough, combine all that data with Uber's expertise at analyzing it through the lens of behavioral science and you have a dangerous potential to exploit users for profit.</p><p> Uber's hardly alone. Our research shows the biggest digital platforms \u2013 Airbnb, Facebook, eBay and others \u2013 are collecting so much data on how we live, that they already have the capability to manipulate their users on a grand scale. They can predict behavior and influence our decisions on where to click, share and spend.</p><p> While most platforms aren't using all these capabilities yet, manipulation through behavioral psychology techniques can occur quietly and leave little trace. If we don't establish rules of the road now, it'll be much harder to detect and stop later.</p><p> 'Choice architecture'</p><p> A platform can be any space that facilitates transactions between buyers and sellers. Traditional examples include flea markets and trading floors.</p><p> A digital platform serves the same purpose but gives the owner the ability to \"mediate\" its users while they're using it \u2013 and often when they're not. By that we mean it can observe and learn an incredible amount of information about user behavior in order to perfect what behavioral scientists call \"choice architectures,\" inconspicuous design elements intended to influence human behavior through how decisions are presented.</p><p> For example, Uber has experimented with its drivers to determine the most effective strategies for keeping them on the road as long as possible. These strategies include playing into cognitive biases such as loss aversion and overestimating low probability events, even if a driver is barely earning enough money to make it worth her while. Drivers end up like gamblers at a casino, urged to play just a little longer despite the odds.</p><p> Uber didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p> Airbnb also experiments with its users. It has used behavioral science to get hosts to lower their rates and accept bookings without screening guests \u2013 which creates real risks for hosts, particularly when they are sharing their own apartment.</p><p> While these examples seem relatively benign, they demonstrate how digital platforms are able to quietly design systems to direct users' actions in potentially manipulative ways.</p><p> And as platforms grow, they only become better choice architects. With its IPO's huge influx of investor money to fund more data and behavioral science, Uber could move into dangerously unethical territory \u2013 easy to imagine given its past practices.</p><p> For example, if the app recognizes that you are drunk or in a neighborhood you rarely travel to \u2013 and one that its data show is high in crime \u2013 it could charge you a higher rate, knowing you're unlikely to refuse.</p><p> Legal challenges</p><p> And it's not all speculation.</p><p> In an effort to deceive law enforcement trying to investigate the company, Uber actually found a way to identify government regulators trying to use its app and then prevented them from getting rides.</p><p> That's one reason lawmakers and regulators have been discussing the difficult, interrelated roles of behavioral science and tech for years. And some companies, Uber in particular, have been investigated for a host of bad business practices, from discrimination to misusing user data.</p><p> But most of the manipulation we've identified and worry about is not expressly illegal. And because regulators are often unable to keep pace with the ever-evolving use of technology and choice architecture, that's likely to remain so.</p><p> Given the absence of well-defined and enforceable legal guardrails, platform companies' propensity to exploit behavioral science at users' expense will remain largely unchecked.</p><p> An ethical code</p><p> One solution, in our view, is establishing an ethical code for platform companies to follow. And if they don't adopt it willingly, investors, employees and users could demand it.</p><p> Since the mid-20th century, written codes of ethical conduct have been a staple of U.S. companies. The legal and medical professions have relied on them for millennia. And research suggests they are effective at encouraging ethical behavior at companies.</p><p> We reviewed hundreds of ethical codes, including ones targeted at tech and computing companies. Based on our research, we urge digital platforms to adopt five ethical guidelines:</p><p> - All choice architecture employed on a platform should be fully transparent. Platforms should disclose when they are using the tools of behavioral science to influence user behavior.</p><p> - Users should be able to make choices on the platform freely and easily, and choice architects should limit behavioral interventions to reminders or prompts that are the least harmful to user autonomy.</p><p> - Platforms should avoid \"nudging\" users in ways that exploit unconscious and irrational decision making based on impulse and emotion. New research shows that transparent choice architecture can work just as well.</p><p> - Platforms should recognize the power they possess and take care not to exploit the markets they've created, including by abusing information asymmetries between themselves and users or opposing reasonable regulations.</p><p> - Platforms should avoid using choice architecture that discourages users from acting in their own best interests. As Nobel Prize-winning behavioral economist Richard Thaler put it, we should only \"nudge for good.\"</p><p> Big tech and behavioral science are now integrated in ways that are making companies wildly successful, from buzzing toothbrushes that make cleaning your teeth seem rewarding to using texts to nudge poorer mothers to use health care.</p><p> While the results can significantly enhance our lives, it also makes it easier than ever for companies to manipulate users to enhance their bottom lines.</p><p> Abbey Stemler and Todd Haugh are Assistant Professors of Business Law and Ethics, and Joshua E. Perry is Associate Professor of Business Law and Ethics, all at Indiana University.</p><p> This story first appeared on The Conversation, an independent source of news and views from the academic and research community.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKPA-7559d05a513b172db4b3807edcd7cd7249374846</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F1E1148AC17ECA7 NWBKPA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W3V-8MC1-DXVP-V2YG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1149\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Observer Publishing Company of Washington, Pa.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Considering that such a figure would be considerably higher if it included the host of other successful European commodity re-exporters, such as Germany, Belgium, France, Italy and the UK, the purpose of this article is to explore why such a counter-intuitive dynamic persists in the commodity sector, long after the colonial era of resource exploitation is said to have ended.</p><p>It argues that European states have actively promoted the intense concentration of their commodity trading multinationals and have simultaneously pressured developing countries into liberalising and fragmenting their own commodity export industries.</p><p>The focus of this piece will be on the coffee industry, in particular, but the trends discussed here can almost certainly be applied to the majority of other major commodities, most of which are characterised through similarly Europe-centric, extractive dynamics.</p><p>Based on re-export data published by the International Coffee Organisation, it is apparent that European countries earn more than three times more from the exports of coffee products than those in Africa.</p><p>Whilst the sample of developing countries included in the study discussed here encompassed all major regions in the Global South, three were included from Africa. Between 2000 and 2010, Ethiopia, Uganda and Cote D'Ivoire received an average of $138 (Shs511,000), $71 (Shs263,000) and $68 (Shs252,000) per bag of coffee exported, respectively.</p><p>Switzerland, Europe's most profitable coffee re-exporter, earned more than $700 (Shs2.6m) per bag. However, other European countries, such as the UK and Italy, also earned more than double, per unit exported, than the best-performing African country studied, Ethiopia.</p><p>In terms of total value earned, Germany's coffee export industry eclipsed that of any of the three African countries studied, despite the fact that all three are leaders in terms of coffee export volume in an African context.</p><p>In 2009, the International Coffee Organisation's annual review showed that coffee added $31 billion (Shs115 trillion) to the economies of the nine leading coffee importing nations, twice as much as the total export earnings of all coffee producing nations.</p><p>Whilst coffee is but one example, it, by itself, is an essential commodity for a number of African states and many livelihoods depend on it for subsistence. For four African countries, coffee exports account for more than a fifth of total exports (Uganda, 20 per cent, Burundi, 23 per cent, Rwanda, 27 per cent, and Ethiopia with 32 per cent).</p><p>This not only impacts the millions of small-scale African coffee producers, their families and communities, but also African economies as a whole, as the state is heavily dependent on tax revenues from these industries.</p><p>Rwanda, for example, raises 70 per cent of its total tax revenue from multinationals, with nearly half of its revenues coming from just 0.3 per cent of its taxpayers. For Nigeria, multinationals represent 88 per cent of its tax base, whilst one multinational tax payer, alone, contributes to 20 per cent of Burundi's.</p><p>Given the developmental implications of a highly unequal distribution of value in commodity trading markets, it is critical to understand why such a disparity between the export earnings of coffee producing and re-exporting countries exists.</p><p>The problem here is not solely a case of European countries being more competitive in the higher-value adding activities along commodity value chains, as often claimed. This traditional 'value-added' narrative is based on the idea that the majority of the value in a final cup of coffee sold in a European coffee shop is primarily derived from retailing, marketing and more advanced processing activities, such as roasting or decaffeinating.</p><p>The majority of these activities take place in re-exporting countries and is undertaken by Northern multinationals. However, the basis for the calculations that underpin this value-added assessment is inherently flawed.</p><p>According to John Smith's The GDP Illusion, traditional GDP calculations can paint a distorted picture of where value is generated. In many key value chains, that produce goods such as the T-shirt, iPhone and the cup of coffee, value is 'captured' by imperialist re-exporting countries in the Global North, rather than 'added'.</p><p>Such a distinction is important, because it suggests that the disparity in export earnings is more likely the result of severe imbalances in power relations between the key actors in coffee producing and coffee re-exporting countries, rather than the technical superiority of Northern multinationals in performing more advanced and profitable 'value-adding' activities.</p><p>Rather than taking the traditional approach of questioning how African countries can become more internationally competitive in advanced coffee processing activities, the key question is, instead, how to address the severe power imbalances between coffee producers and coffee buyers, processors and traders.</p><p>To do so, it is essential to understand how these imbalances have developed and which actors have been driving such developments. Evidence seems to suggest that active policies implemented by European states during the 1980s and 1990s contributed to dramatically restructuring global commodity markets in their favour and artificially inflated the international competitiveness of their commodity trading and processing industries.</p><p>In the 1970s, around 20 per cent of total earnings were retained in coffee growing countries, compared to 53 per cent staying in the re-exporting and consuming countries. By the end of the 1990s, this had changed to 13 per cent versus 78 per cent.</p><p>On the one side, the European re-exporting states, at best, allowed and, at worst, promoted the consolidation of their commodity trading multinationals. This consolidation has further extended the power advantage of these firms in price negotiations with smallholder coffee farmers in producing countries.</p><p>Monopoly capitalism has been used to describe this growth of increasingly powerful multinational monopolists in imperialist countries, who have close connections to their states and use their power advantages to manipulate prices and inflate their own profits and the GDP statistics of their home countries.</p><p>In the early 1990s, five traders controlled the lion share of coffee imports into the major consuming countries, all of whom were based in Europe or the US. By the 2000s, mergers and acquisitions had led the market to become even more concentrated, with just three firms dominating, all of which are European.</p><p>In the processing sector, the share of the five largest firms more than doubled between 1995 and 1998, from 21.5 per cent to 58.4 per cent. At the very end of the chain, the market share of the five largest grocery retailers in 16 European countries eclipsed 80 per cent by 2000.</p><p>Susan Newman, in her work on the effects of financialisation on the coffee market, summarises that 'the trend has been towards the concentration of a few large coffee traders, many of which have merged with other commodity traders to become very large multinational commodity trading companies'.</p><p>She goes on to state that the 'concentration of the top five companies has also increased since 1998, and now accounts for a market share of more than 55 per cent' (2009, p.544). Whilst technological and communication advancements no doubt eroded trade margins and created conditions that favoured the largest international corporations, the reluctance of European states to take action against the increasing monopolisation of their commodity industries is indicative of the shared interests between these states and their commodity multinationals.</p><p>It is no coincidence that Switzerland, the most profitable commodity re-exporter, also has a merger policy which is incredibly weak, unaccountable and easily-influenced.</p><p>Research by Thomas Zweifel compared the best and worst practices of US, EU and Swiss merger policy in the early 2000s and found that 'Unlike under US or European rules, responsible persons cannot be prosecuted. Sanctions against Swiss cartels cannot be imposed retroactively: no fines equivalent to the economic damage can be imposed. Penalties can be imposed only if a monopoly has been certified as illegal and continues nonetheless', and further, that Swiss merger policy is 'neither very accountable nor very independent,' with its competition commission officials appointed by the executive rather than the legislature.</p><p>It also reports primarily to the economics ministry and is not required to seek public participation, publish its decisions or even give reasons. In turning a 'blind eye' to the consolidation of its largest multinational commodity firms, the Swiss state has artificially inflated its international competitiveness through enhancing the power of its commodity trading multinationals in price negotiations with foreign producers and through allowing them to enjoy such significant economies of scale that it makes it nearly impossible for low-income countries to compete in any of the more advanced and profitable activities along the value chain.</p><p>Whilst the Swiss case is the most extreme example of weak competition policy, the shocking degree of concentration that has been allowed to develop in commodity trading, processing and retailing industries across Europe in the neoliberal period partly explains why coffee re-export statistics show that many other European countries, albeit to a lesser extent, are still far more profitable re-exporters than even the leading African coffee producers.</p><p>On the other side, the 1980s and 90s also saw important developments in the coffee markets of producing countries. Between the end of WWII and the 1980s, intervention in coffee markets was commonplace and emphasised the stabilisation of export prices through multilateral agreements.</p><p>Various International Commodity Agreements (ICAs) between 1954 and 1989 established an international minimum price maintenance system, whilst the majority of domestic coffee markets in many ex-British African economies had marketing boards (as well as in Angola, Ethiopia and Togo).</p><p>Ex-French economies were also similarly structured, with 'Caisse de Stabilisation' the Francophone equivalent. These boards were responsible for buying coffee, setting prices, regulating quality control and, most importantly, acting as an intermediary between smallholder coffee producers and global traders, coordinating the sale of coffee through auctions.</p><p>Thus, these marketing boards negotiated prices and the terms of the export arrangements of coffee to trading multinationals (often European) but, as a result of the structural adjustments of the early 1990s, the majority of these boards were dissolved, rather than reformed.</p><p>It should be noted that not all African countries embraced the restructuring of their commodity export markets to the same degree. Whilst Uganda fully liberalised its coffee market by 1991 and completely eradicated its cooperatives, Tanzania only begun partial liberalisation in 1994 and retained a state-run coffee auction system.</p><p>However, the general pattern across Africa has been the dismantling of varying forms of coffee export cooperatives. The result of this restructuring was to further fragment the coffee industries in producing countries. At the same time as European buyers were becoming more concentrated, smallholder coffee farmers were being forced to negotiate as individuals, rather than as collective national industries.</p><p>Karin Wedig and J\u00f6rg Wiegratz, in their work on cooperatives in Uganda, point out that, despite the fact that cooperatives in the pre-neoliberal era often had problems with inefficient management that meant that below-market-prices were frequently paid to producers and that there was generally low investment in infrastructure, cooperatives are ultimately necessary to address power imbalances in the market.</p><p>'Through bulk sales, as well as the pooling of resources to access processing technology and services, cooperatives can strengthen smallholders' capacities to compete with large producers, because buyers are more willing to engage in direct negotiations if farmers can offer larger output volumes at constant quality,' they write (2018, p.349).</p><p>Furthermore, they found that farmers in Uganda enjoyed significantly higher prices during the years when the cooperative studied was revived, an effect that was reversed in 2011 when the state intervened to limit the cooperatives' operations once again.</p><p>Whilst lax competition policy in re-exporting countries enhanced the power of commodity buyers, the dismantling, rather than reform, of cooperatives in producing countries reduced the power of commodity growers, which has fostered a situation of severe power imbalance in the market and explains the significantly higher returns enjoyed by coffee re-exporting countries.</p><p>The concentration of European commodity trading and processing industries alongside the atomisation of commodity producing industries in Africa and much of the rest of the Global South has restructured the global commodity trade to favour European countries, to the detriment of the rest, an assertion supported by leading research into the coffee industry.</p><p>These twin developments are often put down to natural changes in the market, but European states have certainly played a role in facilitating these developments through active policy. The negligent approach of the EU and certain individual European nations to anti-trust policy and to the breaking up of their commodity monopolies is a clear indicator of this, whilst it should not be forgotten that they also helped promote the atomisation of commodity export industries in producing countries through their advocation of global neoliberal restructuring through international financial institutions.</p><p>The role of these European states as the handmaiden of the monopolistic commodity multinationals has generated criticism from the development community, as well as accusations of hypocrisy for adopting policies which undermine development at the same time as 'sacrificing' sizeable public funds to development aid.</p><p>So far, it appears that these concerns have largely been ignored. Apparently with Margathe Vestager as the new European Competition Commissioner, the EU now has a 'trailblazer in regulating big tech and business', according to the Financial Times, but this newfound regulatory zeal does not seem to apply to the mega-mergers taking place in commodities industries.</p><p>Of the 24 mergers that the EC has formally prohibited since 1990, none have related to coffee or any of the other major commodities.</p><p>Existing research does not seem to explain why this is the case, which highlights the need to delve further into the politics of competition policy in the EU and other the major imperialist re-exporters.</p><p>With the destructive effects of concentration in commodity industries in these countries now abundantly clear, attention must be turned to holding responsible parties to account and reversing these trends.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYMTR-DMONITOR1108201900014</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DLYMTR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WTD-3T31-JCH9-G15N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">416412</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2768\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nation Media Group (NMG) Limited.

However, in reality, behind the scenes the seed of its sudden demise had already taken root.</p><p>On Tuesday the company revealed it had entered voluntary administration, blaming Google's \"anti-competitive\" tendencies for hobbling its business model, by seeking to ban its apps from the Google Play Store and stopping the flow of advertising inventory from its AdMob marketplace.</p><p>The start-up worked by serving up advertising or other content on the unlock screen of Android-based smartphones, with clients such as Flybuys in Australia and Tesco in the UK using it. The trouble was that Google had been in touch to say that it had ruled the apps to be outside its AdMob and Google Play terms and conditions regarding how advertising is presented to its Android users.</p><p>\"At first we weren't alarmed, because they had already approved us twice previously,\" Berriman tells AFR Weekend.</p><p>However, it quickly became apparent through feedback, which is understood to have come from as high up as Google CEO Sundar Pichai and the Alphabet Board, that the tech giant was not prepared to move from its position.</p><p>The Google bombshell was enough for the company to pull the pin on its imminent IPO, in which it said it had locked in support to the tune of up to $80 million.</p><p>The Unlockd leadership team said it took the decision to enter administration to restructure the business in a manner that extracts maximum value for shareholders via execution of trade sale.

The trouble was that Google had been in touch to say that it had ruled the apps to be outside of its AdMob and Google Play terms and conditions regarding how advertising is presented to its Android users.</p><p>\"At first we weren't alarmed, because they had already approved us twice previously,\" Berriman tells AFR Weekend.</p><p>However, it quickly became apparent through feedback, which is understood to have come from as high up as Google CEO Sundar Pichai and the Alphabet Board, that the tech giant was not prepared to move from its position.</p><p> Legal planning </p><p>The Google bombshell was enough for the company to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/unlockd-pulls-ipo-plans-as-google-threatens-companys-future-with-app-ban-20180416-h0ytj8\">pull the pin on its imminent IPO</url>, in which it said it had       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/technology/technology-companies/google/revealed-unlockd-prospectus-figures-underline-threat-to-tech-giants-20180420-h0z1ol\">locked in support to the tune of up to $80 million</url>. </p><p>A legal battle was subsequently kicked off <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.afr.com/technology/web/unlockd-wins-first-battle-of-google-legal-war-for-survival-20180509-h0zvf9\">in the UK</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/apps/unlockd-will-cease-to-exist-if-google-blocks-the-app-20180601-h10ubw\">Australia</url>, with Unlockd seeking to halt Google's plans on the basis that the tech giant was trying to kill off a potential future rival.</p><p>Despite the significant amount of funding and existing revenues, the Unlockd leadership team said it took the decision to enter administration to restructure the business in a manner that extracts maximum value for shareholders via execution of trade sale.</p><p>It is now planning to pursue damages claims against Google in each jurisdiction that it operates, or had plans to launch in.</p><p>\"We have full director and shareholder support to do so,\" Berriman says. \"This will be a strategic trade sale which has been in train, along with continuing a damages claim against Google in each market.\"</p><p> Marketplace reliance </p><p>Reaction to the high profile and rapid fall of the company has been a mix of sympathy for those involved with the company, and incredulity that a business could raise so much money, and be so close to listing, while apparently being so dependent on the good graces of one big tech company.</p><p>Well-respected start-up investor and advisor Alan Jones from M8 Ventures says the story shows that it takes more than good backers, lots of funding and strong revenue growth to build a successful global tech company.</p><p>He says it is surprising there wasn't a plan in place to reduce dependency on Google and have more independence before hitting the public market.</p><p>\"If you're in the business of making and selling smartphone apps then you can't really expect to have a business if there's a risk that your apps might some day be subject to a takedown. It's not enough to stay within the letter of the terms of use, you've got to understand the intent of those terms and abide by them too,\" Jones says.</p><p>\"Don't go racing down the highway bouncing off the crash barriers, learn where the centre of your lane is, and learn how to stay in the middle, even as the road goes around a corner. Don't take the highway operator to court to try and make them straighten the highway.\"</p><p>Jones says all start-ups initially have critical dependencies, such as key engineering staff or a dominant technology platform, but it is a key challenge of founders to wean themselves off them. </p><p> A startup success curtailed </p><p>Catapult Sports executive chairman and serial start-up investor Adir Shiffman says, while Unlockd could be recapitalised or sold as a going concern, the current downfall of the company appears to be a \"tale of sudden, fatal adverse events\", rather than a start-up idea failing to thrive.</p><p>He says Berriman succeeded in building a company that was clearly generating impressive returns, but fell foul of its reliance on Google. </p><p>Rather than accepting the idea of Google being an \"evil company\", Shiffman says its actions simply show the power it has in an ecosystem, where it sets the rules and acts as judge and jury.</p><p>\"There are only two scenarios in which it feels safe to build on another company's platform, firstly if you're adding value to the underlying platform, or secondly if you're not standing in the path of that platform's future,\" he says.</p><p>\"Start-ups that help customers using AWS, Salesforce and other platforms are viewed positively for adding to the underlying platform's value proposition. You can even get away with adding no value, as long as you're not squatting on the platform's commercial roadmap, but Google is claiming that Unlockd in fact devalued the experience and hence they want to shut it down.\"</p><p> ???Future prospects </p><p>Berriman says Unlockd has made moves to engage with \"major Silicon Valley, Chinese and non-Google reliant parties who can or do operate outside of the Google operating system\", but that it was irrefutably true that a start-up centred on mobile app use had very few viable distribution options aside from Google Play and the Apple App store. </p><p>\"Almost every single business in existence has reliance on third party partners to enable their product or service to function,\" Berriman says. </p><p>\"Google is a shopfront and provider of services to Unlockd similar to how bricks and mortar shopping centres or high streets are to retailers - the difference is these are heavily regulated to protect the tenants.\"</p><p>In the age of instant social media feedback, Berriman has had to endure a week of keyboard experts passing judgement on Unlockd's business model shortcomings, which went as far as lamentable suggestions that his earlier <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/technology/agonising-decision-as-unlockd-founder-matt-berriman-steps-down-as-ceo-to-address-bipolar-disorder-20180213-h0w20y\">decision to step back from the CEO role</url> to get treatment for bipolar disorder, were a sham to escape blame. </p><p>Some have questioned whether the company really posed a threat to Google, however he takes most issue with assertions that Google is being used as a handy cover story for a failing start-up, which had simply burnt through its money. </p><p>\"We refute those comments and assertions, as does an independent valuation by analysts pre-IPO that provide a valuation of up to $230 million,\" Berriman says.</p><p>\"We have over 500 monthly advertisers on our platform through a combination of programmatic channels and direct ad buys. We have proven to deliver significantly higher value for advertisers than other platforms, with an average engagement of 8 per cent on direct buy ads and 16 per cent on content. </p><p>\"We have seen significant growth since launch in January 2016, with over 1.3 million app downloads ... and with over 26 potential new partners - a mix of telcos, streaming partners, loyalty programs and gaming companies - in the pipeline in either advanced discussions or ready to launch, the business was on a high growth trajectory.\"</p><p> Bouncing back </p><p>While it is too soon for Berriman to answer questions about what comes next, if indeed his Unlockd endeavours are coming to an end, Shiffman says he should find plenty of doors opening for him, for whatever start-up he dreams up next.</p><p>Whereas the stigma of a failed venture has previously been a permanent stain on Australian founders' reputations, he says the local sector has matured significantly in recent years, to recognise that the best entrepreneurs are often those bouncing back from disappointment.</p><p>\"Only a fool would feel this taints the founders and key management of Unlockd. In an incredibly short period of time Matt has managed to build a functioning product, conclude a heap of enterprise telco deals, sign up 300,000 customers around the world ... raise tens of millions of dollars from very smart people, and generate millions of dollars in revenue,\" Shiffman says.</p><p>\"In the process of achieving this feat the leadership made some bad decisions - which they have in common with every other human being in every field of endeavour at every point in history. These people are incredibly backable, they have learned a heap from this experience.

Open Now[1]  Election Day in the U.S. is now only weeks away, and the variables and stakes are rapidly mounting. Troll farms, fake accounts, and other disinformation threats from within the United States[2] and abroad are coming into view. The current president is attempting to convince people the election is rigged before it happens. </p><p>Groups are actively working to suppress individuals' constitutional right to vote, and Microsoft security researchers[3] say China, Iran, and Russia have already attempted to gain access to the Biden and Trump presidential campaigns. Historic fires on the West Coast[4] and historic hurricanes on the East Coast brought climate change into the race. Then on Friday, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died. Amid all that uncertainty \u2014 and reasons for anxiety \u2014 voters must consider a few statistically likely scenarios. Democrats are likely to retain majority control of the House of Representatives and are within three or four seats[5] of capturing majority control of the U.S. Senate. And Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden currently maintains a lead[6] over President Donald Trump in the polls. If Democrats succeed in taking control of the legislative and executive branches of government, the shift could end a long-standing policy gridlock. To get an idea of how Democratic control of Congress could influence tech policy, VentureBeat spoke with four people whose work centers on the politics, legislation, and regulation of technology.Betsy Cooper leads the Aspen Tech Policy Hub, an incubator for software and policy that address societal issues. Malkia Devich-Cyril is founder of Media Justice and lead writer of a surveillance tech policy platform for Black America. Jevan Hutson is a lawyer, privacy advocate, and human-computer interaction researcher who proposed AI regulation law in the state of Washington. Ernesto Falcon is a former Hill staffer and senior legislative counsel for the Electronic Frontier Foundation who follows legislation in California and Washington, D.C.The last time Democrats gained control of the levers of power in Congress was in 2008, and the party advanced legislation like Obamacare, Wall Street reforms, and consumer finance protection regulations. This time, tech policy may be front and center, with issues like antitrust actions to reign in Big Tech companies and concern about the spread of facial recognition technology top of mind.Broadband accessNearly 20 million homes still lack access to high-speed internet. This issue has persisted for decades and stubbornly hangs on, in the same way getting electricity to every home was an issue a century ago. Pandemic lockdowns have revealed plainly that the nation's aging infrastructure leaves tens of millions of people behind, especially those in rural areas and low-income neighborhoods. Access to technology can be tied to household income and correlated with race, according to a U.S. Census Household Pulse survey[7]. Only one in three students around the world today is able to participate in distance learning online, according to UNICEF[8]. 'I think this is going to be front and center next year,' Electronic Frontier Foundation senior legislative counsel Ernesto Falcon told VentureBeat in a phone interview. For years, he has urged Congress and state lawmakers in California to address broadband access concerns. The House of Representatives passed a COVID-19 recovery bill called the Moving Forward Act[9] with $80 billion in broadband infrastructure renewal funding, but the bill has not been taken up in the U.S. Senate. A bipartisan group[10] in the U.S. Senate introduced the Rural Broadband Acceleration Act with $20 billion in funding, but that bill has made little progress since it was introduced in July.Big Tech antitrustAs the United States slogs through the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s, Big Tech companies reported record market caps, and a growing number of politicians are saying that's the result of anticompetitive behavior. They argue the increasing wealth disparities point to a need to strengthen antitrust law for the modern age, and a lot of Americans agree. A poll released Thursday found that nearly two-thirds of American adults believe the power of Big Tech companies is a problem for the U.S. economy.[11] Betsy Cooper is director of the Aspen Tech Policy Hub[12]. Spun out of the Aspen Institute, the group operates like a startup accelerator to quickly scale effective tech policy solutions. Participants in inaugural cohorts came from companies like Facebook and Google and include activists and government employees. Early in the next session of Congress, Cooper expects Democrats to focus on enacting antitrust legislation to limit the power of Big Tech companies. This summer, CEOs of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google appeared before Congress[13] to explain why their companies' respective monopolies do not lead to anticompetitive business practices. To conclude its investigation, the House Judiciary committee could release a final report this fall[14] to determine whether the U.S. needs stronger antitrust laws. Attorney General William Barr is also expected to file charges in a federal antitrust case against Google in the coming weeks, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke with the New York Times[15]. Cooper said cybersecurity and AI regulation may also be addressed in legislation, but she questions how long Democrats will be able to maintain unity on tech issues after the election, given various factions within the party. 'A good proportion [of representatives are] interested in regulation, antitrust, and managing the ill effects of algorithms, but Big Tech also provides livelihoods in many Congressional districts, and so I expect the momentum for regulating would be less intense among some elected officials than has been expressed while the Democrats have been in the opposition,' she said. 'And of course, it will all depend on the White House as well. If Trump wins reelection, he will not want to give Democrats a win in this (or any other) space.' Malkia Devich-Cyril is founding director of Media Justice[16], an organization that has over the past two decades taken part in political fights ranging from disputes with Clear Channel and the digital divide to efforts to stop tech companies from peddling surveillance technology. They think Democrats should move to restore net neutrality within the first 100 days of the next session of Congress and take steps to strengthen election security. They also expect antitrust legislation, although \u2014 like Cooper \u2014 Devich-Cyril questions the will of Democratic lawmakers to address antitrust issues after the election. 'The Democrats are no less likely to be supported by tech companies,' Devich-Cyril said. 'Both parties have their hands in tech money, and so the question of how far will these legislative attempts go if they limit in any way profits to be made by tech companies \u2014 I don't know the degree to which the government and private interests will continue to collude, if that's a reasonable way of saying it.' When asked if they worry the appetite to reign in Big Tech companies may fade away after the election, Devich-Cyril said they think the United States is a technocratic, white supremacist nation, no matter who runs Congress or the White House. 'I do think it will be a struggle,' they said, 'but I think the possibility of victory exists there that does not exist now.' Falcon testified in favor of antitrust law before lawmakers in the state of New York earlier this week[17]. He believes antitrust action is needed to allow the U.S. to once again become a marketplace where startups can flourish and grow to maturity instead of being acquired by companies like Facebook and Google. In virtually all of the six hearings Congress has held since June 2019, antitrust committee chair Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) characterized a market in which competitors are inevitably acquired by Big Tech companies as an 'innovation kill zone.' Multiple witnesses testifying before the committee stressed that if the government and Microsoft hadn't reached an antitrust settlement in 2001, it's possible companies like Amazon, Facebook, and Google wouldn't exist today. 'These things still need to persist and move further because we are rapidly losing what made the internet a special open market, where anyone with a good idea can get something on the internet, and if it was viable, they could become a fairly successful product and a fairly successful business,' Falcon said. 'Now the world is, you know, 'Can you be bought by Google or Facebook?' and that drives down innovation, that drives down competition, that drives down all of the possibilities and potential that you would unlock if you had a more competitive market.'Election security and racial justice reformEarlier this year, Devich-Cyril was lead writer on the surveillance tech portion of the Vision for Black Lives[18], a policy platform created by more than 50 Black community organizations. The group warns that surveillance is increasingly being treated as an alternative to incarceration and disproportionately targets people who are Black, Arab, Muslim, or immigrants \u2014 sometimes in violation of First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The platform calls for the elimination of surveillance tech such as facial recognition systems and tools for monitoring activity on social media platforms. It also recommends diverting funds currently used for surveillance to more pressing needs. And the platform calls for an end to automated oppression in areas essential to people's economic outlook, including hiring, health care, and housing. 'These are primary contributors to the mounting cases of algorithmic injustice \u2014 instances where people are excluded from benefits and opportunities or subjected to unfair pricing, where they would otherwise be protected from intentional discrimination,' the platform reads. The platform identifies the proposed Justice in Forensic Algorithms Act[19] for government standards and review of algorithms as model legislation, as well as the existing Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. To guarantee protections against voter suppression in our digital world, Devich-Cyril believes the John Lewis Voting Rights Act should include election security for the digital age and protections against disinformation on social media platforms. 'As we, for example, work to restore the Voting Rights Act, we need to consider that it's now in a digital age and what are the provisions that we need to add to that bill to ensure remote protections and things like that? How do we protect the machines, like how do we secure the machines and assure their accuracy and privacy?' they said. 'I think technologists and technology policy folks need to step into the question of elections in a new way.' Prominent Democrats have pledged to support the John Lewis Voting Rights Act[20] as an unofficial part of the party platform. The House passed a bill with greater voter protections[21] in December 2019, but it has not been taken up by the Senate. The renewed effort is named after the Civil Rights icon and congressman who passed away earlier this year. A VentureBeat review of the Biden platform and Democratic Party platform after the Democratic National Convention[22] found policy to address algorithmic bias in areas like credit scores, but proposed changes to police powers and racial justice reform do not directly address surveillance.Section 230 reformIt seems like every other day news from a former Facebook employee, anonymous source, or government regulator confirms the company's inability to regulate itself and reveals that it can be a public menace. The latest examples: In recent days, Facebook undermined emergency responders fighting historic wildfires in the western U.S. by spreading disinformation about Antifa activists starting fires[23]. On Monday, a former Facebook employee who controlled fake account detection detailed how she influenced the political affairs of nations worldwide[24], and how within Facebook resources are devoted most heavily to moderating fake account activity in the U.S and Europe. And if Facebook had taken down an event page reported for violent threats[25], some assert it might have headed off the young man who killed two Black Lives Matter protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin. On Thursday, Facebook took steps to curb internal debate about social issues[26]. It's all enough for people to ask in the coming days whether Facebook should be dismantled, and others to advocate lawmakers take action. One potential action is Section 230 reform. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act[27] was written in the 1990s. Much of it was struck down by a judge shortly after its passage, but like broadband access, it's a decades-old topic of debate. In short, the law shapes the modern internet economy and defines online speech. It also shields companies that define themselves as platforms so they can't get sued based on how people use the service. Democratic and Republican leaders of the House and Senate judiciary committees have expressed bipartisan agreement that the liability shield provided by Section 230 need to change. As it stands, Facebook and Google control online ad markets with little risk, while the creators of content Facebook and Google distribute assume the liability. After Twitter put a warning label on a Trump tweet spreading lies about mail-in voting in May, the president retaliated by signing an executive order directing the FCC to make companies liable for what is said on their platforms. Falcon from the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) said he's concerned that spats between President Trump and Twitter have 'focused attention on all of the bad ideas of 230,' which he said fails to recognize that there may be a downside to an outright repeal of Section 230. 'Basically, everyone's convinced that they're [social media platforms] all censoring based on something,' he said, adding that social media platforms' actions have fed mistrust among users. 'I think the platforms have done that to themselves in the sense that they \u2014 especially I'd say some of the forums on Facebook \u2014 kind of pick favorites.' Another challenge with Section 230 reform is that people don't want governments to decide how to moderate social media platforms, but people don't trust tech companies either. A Pew Research survey released last month[28] found that a majority of U.S. adults believe companies censor political speech on social media platforms, a belief that jumps up to 90% among Republicans. Because Section 230 deals with matters of liability protection and online speech, it's a legal protection that involves misinformation, online advertising, and a range of issues Falcon said are 'still fairly ripe.' 'All of the issues are playing out in real time [and] will migrate their way to next year and what to do there,' he said. If the Biden-Harris ticket wins in November, online harms like revenge porn could also spur Section 230 reform. In the weeks ahead of her 2016 U.S. Senate race, then California Attorney General Harris filed charges against Backpage.com CEO Carl Ferrer, who defended himself on Section 230 grounds. One of the most tech savvy politicians to appear a U.S. presidential ticket in modern history, Harris has expressed opinions on a range of tech policy issues, from facial recognition to algorithmic bias and cybersecurity[29].Comprehensive data privacyThe United States still lacks personal data privacy laws that would set ground rules for the way private companies treat data collected about individual consumers. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA[30]) in California are major steps toward strengthening such privacy protections. Devich-Cyril says comprehensive data privacy reform is one type of legislation with a lot of bills on the table to draw inspiration from. The two most prominent in recent memory are the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (COPRA) and the Consumer Data Privacy Act (CDPA[31]). The bills, put forward by Democrats and Republicans, respectively, protect privacy rights for individuals and grant more resources for Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulators. A major difference between the two is that COPRA enshrines the private right of action, or the ability to sue an individual company like Facebook or Google when data privacy rights are violated on their platforms. Jevan Hutson is a human-computer interaction researcher whose recent work explores the surveillance of people with HIV on tech platforms and issues of privacy and security when sexting. As a tech ethics and policy attorney, he has advocated for the elimination of predictive policing and facial recognition. Hutson also argues for the elimination of notice and consent frameworks[32] in which people are asked to sign Terms of Service agreements they don't understand as a way to remove privacy liability. 'I think we'll see a federal data privacy move, but my sneaking suspicion is once the Democrats have power, they have more free rein to pull right, so to speak. I'm not sure how much farther past COPRA they go,' Hutson said. Earlier this year, while working with the University of Washington School of Law on tech policy, Hutson introduced the AI Profiling Act in the Washington state legislature. He witnessed Democratic majorities in the Washington state legislature fail to pass comprehensive privacy legislation akin to CCPA in California two years in a row. 'We have a supermajority in both our houses, and at the point where that's true, more innovation-centric Democrats, which are a large group of people, have more power to push back for a more middle-of-the-road privacy bill, rather than one that's more far-reaching that would include things like bans or more categorical ways of burden-shifting in technological environments,' he said. 'In our state [of Washington], what I'd say [is] we have a fairly progressive state legislature. Where those divisions were still quite stiff were in the House and the Senate, obviously; that's why our state data privacy bill failed two years in a row.' On the ballot in California this fall is Proposition 24[33], an initiative to amend CCPA and create the Privacy Protection Agency to enforce the state's consumer data privacy laws. Whether that bill passes or not, Hutson expects such prominent state data privacy laws to influence data privacy legislation in Congress. Enacting policy at the state level draws criticism for fragmenting the legal landscape, but Hutson says such policy is important because it presents alternatives to the solutions championed by powerful tech companies through national lobbyists, interest groups, or proposed legislation. Falcon said part of the challenge with consumer privacy legislation is that many big tech companies make money from users' personal information, and they're unwilling to accept that the world has shifted in terms of what people expect in their interactions with internet commerce. Roughly eight in 10 American adults feel they have no control over their data, according to a 2019 Pew Research survey[34]. 'People don't feel like they have control, so Congress can only pass a law that makes people feel confident that they are regaining power when there's some sort of some sort of accountability [for] things like mishandling information or using information in ways that you just did not agree to,' he said. 'That exacerbates this frustration, and I think not enough legislators in Congress have [reached] the conclusion that the only path forward is real strong privacy law. Most of them, I think, are eager to set some bare minimum and try to settle the debate by saying 'See, we did something,' but it's just unacceptable and unpalatable to people back home.'Biometric privacyEither as part of an overarching consumer privacy bill or as standalone facial recognition regulation, Congress could pass a bill that places limits on biometric data collection, such as data collected through facial scans or the voice recordings used to improve AI assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant. One of the only ways to challenge biometric data collection is through the Illinois' Biometric information Protection Act (BIPA). Not only does BIPA allow people the right to sue tech companies in class action lawsuits, a judge ruled in 2019 that people don't have to prove harm to file a BIPA lawsuit. BIPA is the reason Facebook is in the process of paying a $650 million settlement[35] to users in Illinois, and it's the basis of the ACLU's suit against Clearview AI[36]. Last month, U.S. Senators Jeff Merkley (D-OR) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT) proposed a national law similar to BIPA[37]. If Democrats win in November, Hutson said he expects to see legislation on baseline privacy, biometrics, and surveillance reform, but he questions how lobbying interests will affect the bills' final form. Democrats and Republicans often disagree over who should be held liable when things go wrong. It was an issue in COVID-19 recovery bills and consumer data privacy bills last fall and has returned with discussions around biometric data protections. In other areas related to privacy and surveillance, Hutson said it's unclear whether Democrats will respond to pressure to defang the Department of Homeland Security. There have been calls to abolish ICE since the government became infamous for putting children in cages[38]. Those calls have been renewed in recent weeks following accusations of sexual assault[39] at one facility and allegations of forced hysterectomies at another[40]. On Thursday, ICE Inspector General Joseph Cuffari launched an investigation into the detention facility in Georgia, a day after more than 170 members of Congress signed a letter demanding[41] he do so.Facial recognition regulationLegislation to address facial recognition misuse has sprung up in states across the U.S. over the past year. Laws that have passed or are being considered include:California lawmakers placed a moratorium on the use of facial recognition in body cameras with a 2019 law. New York lawmakers recently passed a bill banning facial recognition use in public schools[42]. Maryland lawmakers considered enacting a bill earlier this year after ICE gained access to the state's immigrant driver's license photo database[43]. Washington state lawmakers considered a bill that would allow people to place a monetary value on biometric data collected by companies developing facial recognition tech.In Washington, D.C., few members of Congress seemed to understand the concept of algorithmic bias just a few years ago. That's no longer the case. A group of Democrats in the House and Senate have proposed a moratorium on facial recognition use by the federal government[44], one of multiple moratorium bills[45] introduced this year. A bipartisan group of lawmakers in Congress previously supported limits on facial recognition to protect constitutional rights[46]. In industry, Amazon[47] and Microsoft[48] announced self-imposed moratoriums on sales of facial recognition to police, while IBM[49] abruptly ended sales of the technology altogether. What's unclear is how these moratoriums \u2014 or ongoing contracts between government agencies like ICE and facial recognition companies like Clearview[50] \u2014 will influence regulation. 'I mean, the fact that all of these companies who had spent the past two years telling legislators 'We can't have a moratorium' like the world's going to end, like Washington State and innovation are going to end,' Hutson said. 'Then it's like, 'Cool, you all just voluntarily did it? What were you talking about six months ago when we were having this exact conversation?''Final thoughtsBoth presidential campaigns maintain that what's at stake in the upcoming election is nothing less than the soul of America. Climate change, the economy, education, health care, social justice, and the future of democracy are on the line, but the party that controls Congress and the White House will also shape a long list of issues under the banner of tech policy. All of the policy professionals VentureBeat spoke to for this article said we'll have to wait for the dust to settle after the election to get a clear picture of what the country's next chapter of tech policy looks like. But one thing is clear: The Democratic Party is no monolith. It contains individuals with progressive attitudes about protecting civil liberties and others with varying degrees of support for surveillance technology. 'Democrats are going to be meeting in the middle,' Hutson said. 'Because it's not like we have a wave of civil libertarian Democrats taking over. I mean, I'm thankful for a lot of advocacy in the Progressive Caucus and other folks who have been pushing newer frameworks around tech policy that tend toward more than just notice and consent.' Party unity seems reliable heading into the U.S. presidential election because most Democrats consider Donald Trump an existential threat to the future of the country. But after the election, factions and fractures are likely determine whether Congress takes on tech policy issues like privacy and racial justice reform and who is included in the burgeoning digital economy.

In the same year, by way of contrast, Microsoft spent between (EURO)4.5 million and (EURO)4.75 million with 16 people engaged, and Intel spent between (EURO)1.75 million and (EURO)2 million with five people engaged, the register showed. Apple spent between (EURO)200,000 and (EURO)250,000 with four people engaged.</p><p>Googlesaid that its team in Brussels was set up to help to explain its business operations to European policymakers.

Despite the decline in bond yields and borrowing costs since the markets took fright, financial conditions have tightened for weaker corporate borrowers. Their access to bond markets has become more difficult.</p><p>After Tuesday's 50 basis-point cut, the US Federal Reserve's policy rate of 1-1.5 per cent is still higher than the 0.8 per cent yield on the policy-sensitive two-year Treasury note. This inversion of the yield curve could intensify the squeeze, says Charles Dumas, chief economist of TS Lombard, if US banks now tighten credit while lending has become less profitable.</p><p>This is particularly important because much of the debt build-up since the global financial crisis of 2007-08 has been in the non-bank corporate sector where the current disruption to supply chains and reduced global growth imply lower earnings and greater difficulty in servicing debt.</p><p>In effect, the coronavirus raises the extraordinary prospect of a credit crunch in a world of ultra-low and negative interest rates.</p><p>Policymakers in advanced countries have made clear their readiness to pursue an active fiscal and monetary response to the disruption caused by the virus. Yet such policy activism carries a longer-term risk of entrenching the dysfunctional monetary policy that contributed to the original financial crisis, as well as exacerbating the dangerous debt overhang that the global economy now faces.</p><p>The risks have been building in the financial system for decades. From the late 1980s, central banks - and especially the Fed - conducted what came to be known as \"asymmetric monetary policy\", whereby they supported markets when they plunged but failed to damp them down when they were prone to bubbles. Excessive risk taking in banking was the consequence.</p><p>The central banks' quantitative easing since the crisis, which involves the purchase of government bonds and other assets, is, in effect, a continuation of this asymmetric approach. The resulting safety net placed under the banking system is unprecedented in scale and duration.</p><p>Continuing loose policy has brought forward debt-financed private expenditure, thereby elongating an already protracted cycle in which extraordinary low or negative interest rates appear to be less and less effective in stimulating demand.</p><p>William White, who while head of the monetary and economics department at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel was one of the few economists to predict the financial crisis, says the subsequent great experiment in ultra-loose monetary policy is intensely morally hazardous. This, he argues, is because unconventional central bank policies may \"simply set the stage for the next boom and bust cycle, fuelled by ever declining credit standards and ever expanding debt accumulation\".</p><p>A comparison of today's circumstances with the period before the GFC is instructive. As well as a big post-crisis increase in government debt, an important difference now is that the debt focus in the private sector is not on property and mortgage lending, but on loans to the corporate sector.</p><p>A recent OECD report says at the end of December 2019 the global outstanding stock of non-financial corporate bonds reached a record $US13.5 trillion ($20.4 trillion), double the level in real terms against December 2008.</p><p>The Fed estimates US corporate debt has risen from $US3.3 trillion to $US6.5 trillion last year.</p><p>Given Google parent Alphabet, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft alone held net cash at the end of last year of $US328 billion, this suggests much of the debt is concentrated in old economy sectors where companies are less cash-generative than Big Tech. Debt servicing is thus more burdensome.</p><p>The shift to corporate indebtedness is in one sense less risky for the financial system than the earlier surge in subprime mortgage borrowing because banks, which by their nature are fragile because they borrow short and lend long, are not as heavily exposed to corporate debt as investors, such as insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds and exchange traded funds.</p><p>That said, banks cannot escape the consequences of a wider collapse in markets in the event of a continued loss of investor confidence and/or a rise in interest rates from today's extraordinary low levels. Such an outcome would lead to increased defaults on banks' loans and shrinkage in the value of collateral in the banking system.</p><p>And asset prices could be vulnerable even after the coronavirus scare because the central banks' asset purchases drove investors to search for yield regardless of the dangers. As a result, risk is still systematically mispriced around the financial system.</p><p>The OECD report notes that compared with previous credit cycles today's stock of corporate bonds has lower overall credit quality, longer maturities, inferior covenant protection - bondholder rights such as restrictions on future borrowing or dividend payments - and higher payback requirements. Longer maturities are associated with higher price sensitivity to changes in interest rates, so together with declining credit quality that makes bond markets more sensitive to changes in monetary policy.</p><p>Current market volatility is further exacerbated by banks' withdrawal from market-making activities in response to tougher capital adequacy requirements since the crisis.</p><p>In a downturn, some of the disproportionately large recent issuance of BBB bonds - the lowest investment grade category - could end up being downgraded. That would lead to big increases in borrowing costs because many investors are constrained by regulation or self-imposed restrictions from investing in non-investment grade bonds.</p><p>The deterioration in bond quality is particularly striking in the $US1.3 trillion global market for leveraged loans, arranged by syndicates of banks to companies that are heavily indebted or have weak credit ratings. Such loans are called leveraged because the ratio of the borrower's debt to assets or earnings is well above industry norms.</p><p>New issuance in this sector hit a record $US788 billion in 2017, higher than the peak of $US762 billion before the crisis. The US accounted for $US564 billion of that total.</p><p>Much of this debt has financed mergers and acquisitions and stock buybacks. Executives have a powerful incentive to engage in buybacks despite very full valuations in the equity market because they boost earnings per share by shrinking the company's equity capital and thus inflate performance related pay. Yet this financial engineering is a recipe for systematically weakening balance sheets.</p><p>Otmar Issing, former chief economist of the European Central Bank, says prolonged low central bank interest rates also have wider consequences because they lead to a serious misallocation of capital. This helps keep unproductive \"zombie\" banks and companies - those that cannot meet interest payments from earnings - alive. The IMF's latest global financial stability report amplifies this point with a simulation showing a recession half as severe as 2009 would result in companies with $US19 trillion of outstanding debt having insufficient profits to service it.</p><p>This accumulation of poor-quality corporate debt is likely to exacerbate the next recession. The central banks' ultra-loose monetary policy has also fostered what economists call disaster myopia - complacency, in a word, which is a prerequisite of financial crises. The greatest complacency today is over inflation and the possibility that central banks will inflict a financial shock by raising interest rates sooner than most expect.</p><p>This myopia is understandable and not just because of the coronavirus. Since the financial crisis the debt-laden advanced economies have suffered from deficient demand. Hence the central banks' difficulties in meeting inflation targets.</p><p>At the same time, tightening labour markets have not led to increased wage inflation, leading many economists to assume the relationship between falling unemployment and rising price inflation has broken down. There is still a deflationary impulse, causing growth to be anaemic and debt-dependent. Yet inflation may not be quiescent for as long as markets assume.</p><p>One reason is that with the central banks' unconventional measures becoming less effective, there is a pressing question about how to respond to stagnation when interest rates are close to zero, and a growing consensus, helped by coronavirus, that a more activist fiscal policy may be necessary.</p><p>With the rise of populism there are growing calls for monetary finance of increased fiscal deficits - that is, direct financing of government deficits by central banks as in Japan.</p><p>Monetary finance has been a precursor of high inflation and while its proponents argue that the risks can be contained provided the quantity of such finance is controlled by independent central banks, central bank independence has been increasingly under threat since the crisis.</p><p>Demography is also relevant. Charles Goodhart of the London School of Economics and Philipp Erfurth of Morgan Stanley have argued that low and negative interest rates are not the new normal because the world is on the cusp of a dramatic demographic shift. A decline in the working population relative to the retired population potentially returns bargaining power to labour.</p><p>Combined with a decline in household savings because elderly populations have become less thrifty, they say, this makes it almost inevitable that real interest rates will go back up.</p><p>Nor, in the shorter term, is it clear that the relationship between unemployment and wage inflation has really broken. Chris Watling, founder of Longview Economics, says the sogginess of wage data in the US is substantially to do with the oil-producing states, which suffered a marked slowdown last year as a result of the fall in crude prices in late 2018.</p><p>Non-oil wage inflation has remained in a relatively robust uptrend as unemployment rates have fallen.</p><p>A pressing question, in the light of the debt build-up, is whether the regulatory response to the great financial crisis has been sufficient to rule out another systemic crisis and whether the increase in banks' capital will provide an adequate buffer against the losses that will result from widespread mispricing of risk.</p><p>The one period in the last 200 years when banking was relatively free of crises was between the 1930s and early 1970s. This was because the regulatory response to the 1929 crash and the subsequent banking failures was so draconian that banking was turned into a low-risk, utility-like business.</p><p>It was the progressive removal of this regulatory straitjacket that paved the way for the property-based crises of the mid-1970s, the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s, more property based crises of the early 1990s and the rest.</p><p>While there has been a plethora of reforms since 2008 - though conspicuously not including the removal of the privileged tax status of debt relative to equity - the operations of the likes of Goldman Sachs, Barclays or Deutsche Bank could scarcely be called utility-like. And when very rapid changes in financial structure are taking place, as today, regulators are often left behind by the new reality and wrong footed by regulatory arbitrage.</p><p>It seems unlikely that a full-blown crisis is imminent, notwithstanding coronavirus. But the potentially unsustainable accumulation of public-sector debt and of debt in the non-financial corporate sector highlights serious vulnerabilities.</p><p>The conclusion has to be that of the late Herb Stein, the American economist who remarked that if something can't go on for ever, then it will stop. When coronavirus is long gone, that will be when systemic trouble starts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc79kfi7fg8vrbwzet575</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YCM-CT51-F0J6-J2KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2057\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

And nearly half (44.3%) of all fund assets are now in index funds, according to Strategas Research Partners.</p><p>This is good to know, considering prices of the most popular tech stocks have suffered steep falls this month on fears ranging from a coming regulatory crackdown to technical mishaps involving autonomous cars to heightened investor anxiety over the future outlook for cutting-edge tech companies.</p><p>A wave of bad news has turned investors' ebullient optimism regarding life-changing technology stocks to wary skepticism.</p><p>Facebook's data privacy crisis, for example, has boosted the odds of coming regulation for social media companies, a potential obstacle to company profits that could also ensnare Twitter and Google parent Alphabet's ad search business.</p><p>Amazon shares have also come under political fire amid an Axios report Wednesday that suggests President Trump is looking for ways to curtail the online seller's power in an effort to help mom-and-pop retailers. Trump weighed in on Twitter Thursday.</p><p>Similarly, shares of Tesla have taken a hit as National Transportation Safety Board investigators try to determine if a deadly California crash of a Model X vehicle involved the company's Autopilot system. \"It's a perfect storm,\" Mahoney says.</p><p>The negative headlines along with worries about a possible trade war between the U.S. and China have caused massive damage to the stocks.</p><p>Facebook shares have fallen more than 17%, and the company's market value has been reduced by nearly $77billion since its privacy data scandal began.</p><p>Amazon shares cratered 4.4% Wednesday and are down 10.4% from its recent high on March 12. Twitter shares -- down 22% since their March 14 peak -- plunged 12% Tuesday when a Wall Street analyst said it was the social media stock most exposed to regulatory risk in the wake of Facebook's data privacy scandal.</p><p>Similarly, Tesla fell nearly 8% Wednesday on news of the crash investigation and a credit downgrade from a Wall Street bond-rating agency, which erased roughly $3.6 billion of its market value.</p><p>Since March 16, the last close before the Facebook scandal hit, the S&amp;P 500 has lost 5.3%, with tech responsible for a sizable chunk of the fall.</p><p>\"These behemoths are now being viewed more skeptically,\" Jason Trennert, managing partner of Strategas Research Partners in New York, told clients in a report that looked at the dangers of \"over-concentration\" of tech stocks in index funds.</p><p>It is the high concentration of tech stocks in funds that track the S&amp;P 500 that puts investors at risk. The large-company index is weighted by the stocks' market values, which means companies valued in the hundreds of billions, such as Apple and Facebook, have a bigger influence on the price movement of the overall index.</p><p>These funds, therefore, are \"fully exposing investors to an increasingly small group of stocks,\" Trennert says.</p><p>What's more, so many people, traders and funds have so much money invested in tech that it has become one of Wall Street's \"most crowded\" trades, shorthand for everyone pretty much betting on the same thing.</p><p>And when uncertainty about tech stocks' profit prospects spikes, money comes out of the stocks as fast -- if not faster -- than it came in, Mahoney warns.</p><p>\"Tech has become a big driver of our economy and a big driver of our day-to-day lives,\" Mahoney says. \"You will see the big tech stocks in the top-10 holdings of funds, in a lot of index mutual funds and hedge funds. So when traders yell 'exit,' they all have to sell the same types of stocks.\"</p><p>Index funds</p><p>They track major stock indexes such as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500.</p><p>Investors in these funds have 25% of their money riding on the fortunes of smartphone makers, social media companies, online retailers, video streaming services, electric-car manufacturers and software providers for self-driving cars.</p><p>Meanwhile, roughly $2.2 trillion is invested in funds that track the S&amp;P 500, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.

That is not to say that these aspirational assertions do not matter. As a statement of values, they can mobilize support. But while legislation is subject to the considerable influence of, well, the legislature,how a candidate intends to do the job for which they are running (i.e. managing the executive branch) is something for which they can be held directly accountable. </p><p>And yet candidates tend to be much less forthcoming with their vision for actually running the federal government. That silence reduces presidential accountability to the public for how they wield the powers of the executive. How the government interprets and enforces the law is tremendously consequential and depends heavily on the network of political appointees (of varying degrees of independence) whom the president deploys to all corners of the executive branch. Too often, decisive roles have gone to corporate insiders who use their power to preserve the status quo and put the brakes on visionary reforms. For this reason, Revolving Door Project (RDP) is pushing candidates to speak more about how they will manage the actual task that lies ahead if they are to win the election. This would not only encourage a more honest conversation about what a president can do, but also ensure that candidates feel a responsibility to make personnel choices that serve the public interest. Over the coming year, we will be following candidates closely, noting when they make commitments to use their power, including to appoint personnel, to advance the public good and pushing for more information when they do not. As an initial step in this direction, we have examined leading candidates and are highlighting both what we know now, and what we ought to know before anyone votes.Joe Biden Executive branch-focused commitment: Of over 100,000 people who have applied for student loan forgiveness through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, only a few hundred[2] have been approved. Thanks to poor administration by abusive student loan servicing companies[3], unclear standards[4], and a deeply unsympathetic set of revolving door administrators[5] at the Department of Education, thousands of public servants are still struggling to pay back loans they had been promised would be dispatched after a decade of service. Solving this problem, unlike many others, does not require passing a new law, but a commitment to enforcing the existing one. Thus, it is encouraging to see that Joe Biden recognizes[6] this fact and, as president, has promised to implement the program properly so that it actually serves those the country has promised to help. Need to know more: Biden's campaign has taken every opportunity to emphasize his role in the Obama administration's most popular accomplishments. However, the centrality of Obama's legacy to Biden's pitch raises questions about his ability to recognize that administration's failures, including as it regards political appointments. Many of the Obama administration's financial regulators, for instance, came directly from Wall Street[7] and hesitated to rein in the industry. On the campaign trail, Joe Biden has been cozying up to many of these same figures, including BlackRock CEO Larry Fink[8], who has made no secret in the past of aspirations to be Secretary of the Treasury. To allay these legitimate concerns, Biden will need to assure the public that he will not fill regulatory roles with people from the regulated industry.Bernie Sanders Executive branch-focused commitment: Although a President Sanders will not have the ability to single-handedly break up the big banks or impose a cap on interest rates, he would be able to use his executive branch power to challenge the financial industry in at least one important way: implementing postal banking[9]. The USPS Office of Inspector General has indicated that USPS could implement most aspects of postal banking under its existing regulatory authority[10]. Thus, by appointing sympathetic figures to the USPS Board of Governors, Sanders could achieve consequential reform without Congress needing to weigh in. Need to know more: Bernie Sanders has big plans to raise revenues[11] through multiple avenues, including a higher marginal tax rate, an estate tax, a financial transactions tax, and more. Even if Congress overhauls the tax code in this manner, however, the under-resourced and understaffed Internal Revenue Service[12] (IRS) will be ill-equipped to effectively enforce these new laws. Sanders could help to overcome this obstacle by, among other things, appointing officials at the IRS and the Treasury Department who will shift enforcement priorities[13] away from low-income Americans towards our wealthiest citizens. We would like to hear more about how Sanders would use his presidential powers to revive tax enforcement.Elizabeth Warren Executive branch-focused commitment: Warren made waves earlier this year with her promise to break up[14] technology companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon. In order to do so, Warren will need to reinvigorate the countries' antitrust authorities, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division. Warren explicitly recognizes this imperative and has promised to \"appoint[15] regulators committed to reversing illegal and anti-competitive tech mergers.' Need to know more: Elizabeth Warren has proposed a bill[16] that would close the revolving door between the Pentagon and the defense industry. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that Congress will pass this bill. Will Warren commit to honoring the principles in her plan as she chooses senior Department of Defense officials, even if Congress does not pass her plan?Kamala Harris Executive branch-focused commitment: Harris has promised to crack down on for-profit colleges[17]. As president she would have broad powers to do so without action from Congress. The Obama administration, for example, put in place several rules that would have tightened regulation of the for-profit college industry (sadly, Secretary of Education Betsy Devos has rolled back these safeguards). A President Harris could reinstate these rules and ratchet up enforcement. Need to know more: In her economic justice platform, Harris points to her record[18] prosecuting financial crimes as the Attorney General of California. We know, however, that that record was at times uneven; for instance, she declined to prosecute OneWest Bank or its CEO, current Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin[19], for mortgage fraud[20]. To assure voters that her administration would pursue cases against the wealthy and well-connected, Harris should speak more about who she will choose to lead key positions within her Department of Justice and to fill financial regulatory roles. Pete Buttigieg Executive branch-focused commitment: Fixing this country's immigration laws will require congressional action, but presidents have significant power in deciding how the existing, imperfect laws are enforced. Pete Buttigieg has promised to 'reinstate[21] enforcement priorities and prevent arbitrary targeting of immigrant communities by enforcement officials.' Past administrations, for example, have prioritized[22] enforcement for people who have committed serious crimes or pose a public threat. The Trump administration, in contrast, has chosen to enforce immigration law indiscriminately to sow fear.  Need to know more: Buttigieg has said that his administration would 'strengthen[23] antitrust standards.' However, given his close relationship[24] with Facebook and his opposition to breaking up big technology companies, we would like more details about his plans. Specifically, Buttigieg should offer more details about who he will appoint to positions at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice's Antitrust division.Cory Booker Executive branch-focused commitment: Climate policy is rightfully at the forefront of this cycle's policy debates. While the president alone will not be able to avert climate disaster, there are important steps that the executive can take. Cory Booker identifies some of these actions[25], including strengthening the Environmental Protection Agency, reversing the Trump administration's rollback of environmental regulations, and better enforcing laws like the Safe Drinking Water Act. Need to know more: Booker has also released an affordable housing plan[26], bringing together a variety of proposals he has put forward while in the Senate. However, while he has recognized that reinvigorating the EPA will be essential to climate policy, his housing plan does not acknowledge critical resource and staffing constraints at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Without remedying this reality, successfully implementing and administering many of these programs will be difficult, if not a near impossibility.Amy Klobuchar Executive branch-focused commitment: Amy Klobuchar recently released a list ofover 100 actions[27] that she would take in her first 100 days as president. While some of these involve introducing legislation, there are many that do not rely on Congress. She has, for example, promised to 'use existing Food and Drug Administration authority to grant a waiver that allows people to import safe prescription drugs for personal use from countries like Canada to decrease drug costs for seniors and all Americans.' In so doing, she would be immediately helping millions of people who are struggling to afford the medications they need. Need to know more: Klobuchar has promised to nominate well-qualified judges[28] for all vacancies on her first day in office. While filling these vacancies is undoubtedly important, Klobuchar should promise a similar effort for vacancies on independent agency boards. Klobuchar should come into office with a slate of well-qualified candidates for nominations for any vacant positions on boards for the Federal Election Commission (FEC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Federal Deposit Insurance Commission (FDIC), and others.

Continue reading How WhatsApp is making it more expensive to spread misinformation</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We always have at least some reason to worry about the spread of misinformation, but we worry more about misinformation during a public health crisis. We are generally not well informed on public health issues even in good times, and so the emergence of new disease to which the human race has no natural immunity presents an incredible target for bad actors.</p><p>For example, if for whatever reason you are opposed to new 5G cellular networks, you could go on social networks and make a lot of posts suggesting that 5G networks are making the spread of the virus worse. Or you could say that 5G itself is causing COVID-19. Or you could say that the pandemic itself is a hoax, and that talk of a virus is intended to cover up the installation of 5G equipment. And if you said it often enough, and your posts got enough traction, then eventually the fringe press would write up your claims, and the misinformation would rapidly move into the mainstream.</p><p>In the United Kingdom last month, in the days after the government ordered citizens to remain in their homes, this is more or less exactly what happened. Some people are setting telephone poles on fire in an utterly misguided effort to fight back against 5G. Jim Waterson and Alex Hern talked to fact-checkers about the situation in the Guardian:</p><p>They cite the rapid growth of neighbourhood social media groups, a failure by networks to promote scientific evidence about 5G, and a terrified population looking to make sense of a world turned upside down. [ ]</p><p>Tom Phillips, the editor of the factchecking organisation Full Fact, said it warned last summer about the growing prevalence of 5G health claims. But in recent weeks debunked claims about 5G had been transformed, potentially aided by the creation of new local Facebook and WhatsApp groups to help support neighbours during the pandemic. Google Trends data suggests British interest in 5G theories exploded in the final days of March, shortly after the lockdown was imposed.</p><p>Let s stipulate that fringe theories like these don t exist only on social networks   and that, as the piece argues, telecoms should be doing a much better job at explaining to people what 5G is and isn t. (Here s a good overview from my colleague Chaim Gartenberg.)</p><p>But it s clear that, as usual, social networks are amplifying some of these theories and helping them gain a foothold in the popular imagination. If you re Facebook, you can throw a bunch of fact-checkers and content moderators at the issue to remove viral posts and attempt to deny other fringe voices undue algorithmic promotion. But if the subject is Facebook-owned WhatsApp, the solution is murkier.</p><p>WhatsApp, after all, uses end-to-end encryption. In practice, this means WhatsApp itself can t peer into the contents of your message. There are obvious privacy benefits to an app like this, particularly in a world where far-right authoritarianism is on the rise. Will Cathcart, who runs WhatsApp, told me this week that WhatsApp s commitment to privacy feels even more urgent in a pandemic-stricken world where nearly all of our communication is mediated digitally. (As an aside, the entire story of the recent Zoom backlash is that the product s design enabled far too many strangers to interrupt your call.)</p><p> Part of what WhatsApp is trying to do is make what you used to do face to face possible,  Cathcart told me.  Part of that is privacy. </p><p>If we were talking face to face, he told me over Zoom, we probably wouldn t worry too much about someone spying on us. On a digital call, though, spying becomes a much bigger concern.</p><p>If all WhatsApp did was enable texts, calls, and chats, that would be the end of the story. But from the beginning, the app has had a feature that   in at least some parts of the world   transformed it into something that more closely resembles a social network like Facebook. That feature is the forward button, and I wrote about its history today at The Verge:</p><p>For much of WhatsApp s existence, it was easy for users to forward a single message to as many as 256 people with just a few taps. Initially, these messages were not labeled as forwards, and the end-to-end encryption in WhatsApp could make it almost impossible for authorities to determine who might be using the app to spread hate speech or calls to violence. This triggered a crisis in India, where WhatsApp was linked to mob violence.</p><p>In 2018, WhatsApp began experimenting with limits on the number of times a message could be forwarded. It also began labeling forwarded messages for the first time, and adding two arrows to show that a message has been repeatedly forwarded. Last year, the company began limiting the number of people you can forward a single message to to five.</p><p>The occasion for my piece was the news that WhatsApp has taken another step down the path to removing the app s broadcast features: as of today, you can forward what the company calls a  highly forwarded message    one that it is at least five forwards away from its point of origin   to just a single person.</p><p>As I note in the story, this is a soft limit. You can forward a highly forwarded message more than once   just to one person at a time. (You could also just copy and paste it repeatedly.) But the amount of friction is meaningful. It effectively raises the  price  of using WhatsApp to spread misinformation, at least in terms of time. Misinformation will still spread on WhatsApp, just as it spreads on all messaging services. But it will spread more slowly   and give fact-checkers more time to chase down the truth and promote it.</p><p>This strikes me as a healthy balance. In fact, I d say it s a healthier balance than now exists on Apple s iMessage   another app that uses end-to-end encryption and enables mass forwarding, and is used by more than 1 billion people. Signal, the upstart messaging app funded by WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton, uses the same scheme.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Washington Post reported that a group of Democratic senators sent a letter to WhatsApp asking that it do more to curb the spread of misinformation. But I hope the senators recognize that WhatsApp isn t the only popular encrypted messenger on the market   and that it s making moves that its competitors would do well to copy.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Ratio</emphasis></h><p>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trending up:</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Facebook</emphasis>is giving these 400 local newsrooms grants of $5,000 each to support their coronavirus reporting as part of the Facebook Journalism Project.

In a blog post published last week, Dave Clark, who runs Amazon s retail operations, said the company would use its  top machine learning technologists  to detect areas where it can improve social distancing in its facilities by relying on internal camera systems.</p><p>Three Amazon warehouse workers who asked to remain anonymous said they were told by site leadership that their facilities would identify individuals as they see them violate the rules, as well as by reviewing camera footage.

The conjunction of these menaces makes us wonder whether banking, as we know it, has a future.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Changes are apparent. Ten years ago, the 10 largest banks by assets were based in Europe or the US. Nowadays, six out the 10 largest are based in Asia.</p><p>This accounts for the effects of the financial crisis and the rise of Asian banking but there is more. Banks have had to adapt their business models to low interest rates, low credit growth or even deleveraging, and increasing competition in retail from fintech and platform-based competitors.</p><p>All this has threatened the profitability of the sector, with European banks still at levels barely covering the cost of capital.</p><p>DIGITAL COMPETITION The major threat, however, comes from the adaptation to the digital environment. Traditional banks have seen parts of their core business - ranging from payment services and credit to advisory services - encroached upon by digital competitors. The advantage held by nimble fintechs is that they can use state-of-the-art technology, operate a leaner business and focus on those business segments with higher returns. They also face disadvantages, such as a lack of reputation and brand recognition, the absence of a customer base, limited access to capital markets, and a starting point with not much information about customers in general.</p><p>Despite these shortcomings, the new entrants have established some bridges in the banking business, in payments in particular, but they typically lack scale. This is not the case of the bigtech platforms such as Google, Apple or Amazon, however, because they have huge installed customer bases as well as strong brands and reputations, not to mention a (very) deep purse. On top of this, they have unrivalled access to information from clients, as well as a leading edge in the application of digital technology and new advances in artificial intelligence.</p><p>Meanwhile, incumbents are burdened by legacy technologies (the mistaken bet: mainframe instead of the cloud) and heavy regulation. Their response is to try to put the client experience at the centre of the business, and incorporate technology, moving as fast as possible to cloud-based systems and making alliances with fintechs.</p><p>However, the main threat to incumbents is that 'big tech' tries to control the interface with customers using its superiority in a customer base (data) by being a gatekeeper to the distribution of financial products. If this were to happen, incumbent banks would be relegated to product providers on platforms they do not control: their businesses would be commoditised.</p><p>Some banks have already perceived this threat and offer open platforms that may incorporate products from other financial providers or form partnerships with 'big techs' (such as Amazon and JPMorgan in credit cards, or Amazon and Bank of America in loans). In any case, incumbents have some strengths, such as customer trust to keep their data secure, and accumulated knowledge on how to deal with complexity and intrusive regulatory environments. They will have, however, to overcome the important deterioration of reputation suffered because of bad practices in the run up to the crisis, which favours new entrants without this toxic legacy.</p><p>REGULATORY QUESTIONS Regulation will influence the shape of the transformation of the banking industry. Most new entrants are reluctant to ask for a banking licence because of the compliance costs this entails. Banks have access to cheap funds, because they can take deposits under the umbrella of explicit or implicit public insurance schemes, but they are subject to tight scrutiny. Light regulation of entrants into the industry may foster competition, but at the potential cost of destabilising incumbents and transferring the creation of systemic risk to non-bank entities.</p><p>In the US, for example, shadow banks are taking already the lion's share of mortgage loans originations. We know that in most financial crises, such as in 1907 in the US or globally in 2007 to 2009, a shadow banking system was at its origin. If banking moves towards a platform-based system, the risk of systemic problems deriving from cyber attacks and massive data leaks comes to the forefront. This may find regulators off-guard.</p><p>Survivors among traditional banks will have managed to transit from the mainframe to the cloud, be lean in bricks but heavy on human capital, and either become digital platforms to keep the interface with the client, or have unique products to feed the platforms that will distribute the products to the customers. What we can be sure of is that in 10 years' time the banking industry will look quite different.</p><p>Xavier vives is professor of economics and finance at iese Business school and author of Competition and Stability in banking (princeton university press).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BANKER-144714072</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BANKER2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V3D-P8G1-DYTY-C1XT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234197</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"838\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Banker</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59210\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 1, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

However,\u00a0the commercial usage of drones for business-to-customer operations is what will actually make them common. One such usage of drones\u00a0is for making deliveries. Unmanned aerial vehicles might be a great alternative to the current system of making deliveries. </p><p>Big tech companies such as Google, retail giants such as Amazon and even specialized delivery services such as UPS are betting on drone deliveries as the alternative to the current system of human-based deliveries, which comes at high-costs, doesn't have a high rate of making timely deliveries and even increases base costs due to pilferage. Read: Autonomous Drone-Flying Car Hybrid Being Developed At MIT[1] Drone-based delivery is increasingly being tested for widespread implementation. It faces challenges on using the airspace for commercial drones, keeping such drones safe, the cost and even the environmental implementation of such as paradigm. Yet, the probability that we may see drone delivery becoming mainstream in the near future, maybe even by the end of the year[2] is high. And why are companies investing in it? The answer lies in the economics of drone delivery. According to Flexport[3], drone-based deliveries will cut down both wait times and the cost of human labor significantly. Last mile delivery depends on two factors \u2014 route density and drop size. Route density refers to the number of drops being made on a single delivery route, while drop size refers to the number of parcels delivered at each drop. Drone-based deliveries, since it is not plagued by human factors such as fatigue, can be done more number of times over a short period of time, which will make the cost of making such deliveries low. If a big drop can be made, the cost per parcel will also be low. Faster deliveries are another aspect that needs to be taken into consideration, and it might be what prompted Amazon's interest in the technology. After all, the retailer was\u00a0the first of its kind\u00a0to shorten the traditional seven-day delivery service by offering two-day deliveries to customers. Delivering packages in 30-minutes or less would mean better customer service and more orders being delivered over time. According to ARK Invest[4] researcher Tasha Keeney, Amazon's Prime Air drone-based delivery would cost 88 cents per delivery for delivering a 5 pound\u00a0package within 10 miles. If Amazon charged its customers just $1 per delivery, it would have a 50 percent return on investment on its drone infrastructure. It will still be cheaper than the current $5.99 cost of doing so, and the drone drops would be same-day deliveries as compared to current next-day deliveries. Another important and maybe even worrisome aspect of drone-based deliveries is the utilization of airspace, most importantly, avoiding airplanes. Amazon has proposed limiting the height that drones should be allowed to fly to 400 feet. But, it might still have potential to hit low-flying planes or of drones crashing into each other. A better solution might be creating airplane style, pre-approved flight plans. If the routes of drones are planned and approved, including metrics such as height and distance, this might make regulating drones easy and could determine proper airspace usage. This might go in line with Amazon's recent patent[5], which proposes creating airport-like control centers in each city, which will let drones take off and land to make deliveries. Play Video[6]In addition to this, NASA is developing a system\u00a0that would make it easier for drones to land in highly populated areas, should anything go wrong. But what about the environmental impact of drone-based deliveries? The answer might surprise you \u2014 according to a study by the University of Washington, drone based deliveries may be more environment-friendly than truck deliveries. 'We were surprised to find that for some realistic conditions, drones produced less CO2 per delivery than trucks. They perform better with smaller distances, and fewer packages in the truck. This is largely due to their incredibly energy efficient and lightweight design,' Dr. Anne Goodchild, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Washington, stated in a research paper titled ' Delivery by drone: An evaluation of unmanned aerial vehicle technology in reducing CO 2 emissions in the delivery service industry[7]' published in March.

Dubai Police Will Deploy Mini Self-Driving Patrols Equipped With 360-Degree Cameras, Drones[8]  Drone-based deliveries might hold many more benefits than just convenience, one of them being the ability to reach tough terrains and deliver medicines on time. Not only that, given the state of American infrastructure, they might be an alternative until better roads are built. According to the American Road and Transport Association[9], making a new road in such areas might cost around $5 million per mile, while a drone network will cost less than $1 million. Building and maintaining roads is a long and costly process. A drone network might be able to offer last mile connectivity in a much cheaper, faster and more usable way. <url normalizedValue=\"https://embed.ted.com/talks/andreas_raptopoulos_no_roads_there_s_a_drone_for_that\">https://embed.ted.com/talks/andreas_raptopoulos_no_roads_there_s_a_drone_for_that</url>[10] [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/autonomous-drone-flying-car-hybrid-being-developed-mit-2557972\">http://www.ibtimes.com/autonomous-drone-flying-car-hybrid-being-developed-mit-2557972</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-drones-alphabet-idUSKCN0SR20520151102\">http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-drones-alphabet-idUSKCN0SR20520151102</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.flexport.com/blog/drone-delivery-economics/\">https://www.flexport.com/blog/drone-delivery-economics/</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ark-invest.com/industrial-innovation/how-can-amazon-charge-1-for-drone-delivery\">http://ark-invest.com/industrial-innovation/how-can-amazon-charge-1-for-drone-delivery</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?PageNum=0...id=20170175413...ey=6B4D0DADFC1F...eUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fappft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPG01%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D20170175413.PGNR.%2526OS%3D%2526RS%3D\">http://pdfaiw.uspto.gov/.aiw?PageNum=0...id=20170175413...ey=6B4D0DADFC1F...eUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fappft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPG01%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D20170175413.PGNR.%2526OS%3D%2526RS%3D</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kM_FFWgPV_Q\">https://www.youtube.com/embed/kM_FFWgPV_Q</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136192091630133X\">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136192091630133X</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/real-robocop-dubai-police-will-deploy-mini-self-driving-patrols-equipped-360-degree-2559987\">http://www.ibtimes.com/real-robocop-dubai-police-will-deploy-mini-self-driving-patrols-equipped-360-degree-2559987</url> [ 9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.artba.org/about/faq/\">http://www.artba.org/about/faq/</url> [ 10]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://embed.ted.com/talks/andreas_raptopoulos_no_roads_there_s_a_drone_for_that\">https://embed.ted.com/talks/andreas_raptopoulos_no_roads_there_s_a_drone_for_that</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX1087671498907761644251761700043</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-7212</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NXD-XHY1-JCMN-Y219-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1092\"/><timeReceived>11:16 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>International Business Times News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 1, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There's also a proposed million-dollar daily fine for contravention.So it does appear that the act is intended to stop the launch of or Facebook's direct involvement in Libra immediately and deter big tech from getting into this line of business going forward.The House Financial Services staff are expecting some opposition in the house, where it hasn't officially been presented yet. </p><p>But it has become a necessary topic for discussion and for deciding a regulatory framework on, given that Libra is slated to launch in 2020.Impact on FacebookEven if Facebook extricates itself from its 'affiliation' to Libra, nothing can be done about the fact that the currency was developed with Facebook's platform in mind. So it will work very well on Facebook. Since a new currency, especially of the crypto variety, needs largescale adoption to be successful, whatever the group responsible for the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the currency, will consider it prudent to leverage Facebook's platform. So in the absence of a personal grudge, they might very well cut a deal with Facebook.Facebook already has a plan of getting 100 interested industry players on board, including banks. Government regulation and oversight might actually facilitate the process.Adoption beyond Facebook was a later goal and if Facebook gives up its affiliation, it may not benefit from this.RecommendationsFacebook shares carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

According to UK-based tabloid The Sun, Truss brought a bottle of Hendrick\u2019s gin with her in an attempt to persuade Lighthizer not to put tariffs on the Great British drink. We\u2019ll find out next week, when the US is scheduled to announce\u00a0further tariffs related to the Boeing/Airbus dispute, if that ploy worked.\u00a0</p><p>The main piece today\u00a0is on tech companies, the question of liability for content and how that is playing out in trade deals. Our chart of the day looks at Gulf states\u2019 reliance on grain imports, while today\u2019s person in the news is\u00a0Zhang Yiming, chief executive of TikTok owner ByteDance.</p><p>The enemies of Section 230</p><p>In a six-hour hearing on Capitol Hill last week, the titans of modern industry \u2014 namely the chief executives of Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet and Apple \u2014 were grilled on how their corporate\u00a0empires secured dominance and used their power to crush smaller rivals.</p><p>It was an affair of US domestic political theatre, but the power of big tech is not limited to the US, nor are questions of how it should be regulated, if at all. The rules for the internet remain largely unwritten, even though the rules for trading goods and services were established long ago. And so on the sidelines of last week\u2019s antitrust hearing stood a collection of lawmakers with their eye on another problem: how the US treats protections for its internet companies in trade deals.\u00a0</p><p>Back in October 2019, lawmakers (from both political parties) started complaining that US trade negotiators were ceding to tech lobbyists and inserting protections from liability for internet companies into trade deals. The US has a law \u2014 Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act \u2014 that protects companies from being sued either for content which appears on their platforms, or for taking it down. Language mirroring Section 230 was replicated in the US\u2019s trade agreement with Canada and Mexico, and also in the mini-deal with Japan. While critics of Section 230 worry that putting such provisions in trade agreements could help spread America\u2019s tech-friendly regulations around the world, proponents say that the law helps protect freedom of speech.\u00a0</p><p>USMCA did, of course, pass through Congress. But lawmakers, with their eyes now on a US-UK trade deal, are focusing on this issue again.\u00a0The UK is fumbling its way to creating its own policies on how best to deal with intermediary liability. One proposal is that Ofcom, the broadcast regulator, be turned into the country\u2019s internet watchdog. Under that scenario, Ofcom would oversee a series of rules requiring social media sites and others to protect users from certain \u201conline harms\u201d, such as child exploitation, hate crimes and terrorist propaganda. Ofcom could investigate complaints, and companies taking too long to remove such content could potentially be fined.</p><p>Whether the UK and US can find a middle ground that satisfies the US\u2019s tendency, at least for now, to protect tech companies from intermediary liability while also allowing the UK to press ahead with its own regulatory regime, which in turn must be judged adequate by the EU remains to be seen. It might be that the US is willing to allow its companies to be subject to some amount of policing by Ofcom as long as the fines are not too big and there are no lawsuits involved.</p><p>Curiously, Section 230 is collecting other powerful enemies. In late May, US president Donald Trump called for a review of Section 230, asking commerce secretary Wilbur Ross to petition the Federal Communications Commission to \u201cclarify\u201d the 1996 law. Still, tech lobbyists are keen to point out that the president cannot change a law passed by Congress through executive order. They also argue that the inclusion of measures such as Section 230 in trade agreements doesn\u2019t stop lawmakers from changing domestic US law (which is one of the lawmakers\u2019 other concerns).<br/><br/>The issues surrounding liability for content are unlikely to be the major sticking point of the US-UK talks \u2014 in fact, this is likely to be one of the easier chapters, people familiar with them say. But the strange domestic disquiet does leave us wondering what will happen by the time this deal makes its way over to Capitol Hill.</p><p>Charted waters</p><p>The pandemic has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/5ff72ce2-5947-497e-ac83-4aa4d008a73d\"> revived fears</url> in the Gulf states over food security, as countries in the region vulnerable to import shortages and sharp price rises invest overseas and in agritech at home. Gulf countries rely heavily on grain imports: while neither the United Arab Emirates nor Saudi Arabia have suffered food shortages this year, officials in both countries say they are accelerating their food security programmes after the crisis revived memories of past food emergencies.</p><p>Person in the news</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Who is it?</emphasis></p><p>Zhang Yiming, chief

Twenty years ago, a little-known web-based toy company called <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.toysmart.com\">toysmart.com</url>filed for bankruptcy. Toysmart proposed to sell its customer list as part of its bankruptcy process. This request implicated serious privacy concerns as Toysmart had promised its customers that it would never sell or disclose their information. Understandably, however, Toysmart\u2019s creditors viewed the customer list as a valuable asset that should be sold to satisfy their claims.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After much public outcry (including an enforcement action by the Federal Trade Commission against Toysmart), Toysmart was allowed to sell its customer list. This resulted in tremendous outrage among privacy advocates and spurred Congress into action. Congress immediately proposed a comprehensive online privacy bill called \u201cThe Online Privacy Protection Act of 2001.\u201d This bill would have made it illegal for a website to \u201ccollect, use or disclose personal information concerning\u201d individuals in violation of rules to be set by the Federal Trade Commission. It would have also required websites to keep personal information confidential and secure.</p><p>Bu, before this bill could pass, something tragic happened: 9/11. Congress quickly realized that having private companies such as websites gathering lots of information about users might be a critically important tool in the newly formed fight against terrorism. Unsurprisingly, the privacy bill went nowhere and instead Congress passed the Patriot Act, which expanded the government\u2019s ability to obtain data in the war against terrorism.</p><p>This policy shift had three enormous impacts. First, it paved the way for social media and tech companies to create platforms based on gathering, using and selling consumer information virtually free of regulation. Had the 2001 privacy act passed, those business models might have been unworkable due to the forthcoming FTC restrictions. Would Facebook have even been able to exist in its current form with such strong privacy regulation? Likely not.</p><p>Second, Americans showed that they were mostly comfortable trading certain liberties for safety (or at least in appearance). Desperate times understandably called for desperate measures. However, as the last 20 years have shown, perhaps it was not such a great idea from a privacy perspective to allow Big Tech and other data-driven companies to have the virtually unrestrained ability to gather, manipulate, use, sell, and monetize our personal data.</p><p>Third, we now see some serious consequences of this policy shift. It\u2019s one thing to allow Big Tech and the government to access the movies we like, sports teams we follow, and friends we have on Facebook. But now that the coronavirus pandemic is here, public health advocates seek to use Big Tech\u2019s tools to access our current body temperature, movements, places we\u2019ve visited, and people we sat next to on the subway or at Subway. Sure, these advocates correctly note that people could opt-out of these tools, but how soon before we see signs in restaurants saying \u201cGreen Status Customers Only\u201d?</p><p>The pandemic requires a coordinated and strong response by government and society. Whether this response should include a wholesale trading of the privacy rights we held dear before the pandemic (such as our movements, health status, contacts, body temperature, etc.) is an open and serious question. We should pause and think before granting Big Tech and the government access to these highly personal data points. It is impossible and too early to tell whether granting this level of access to our personal data will be effective or what long-term impact it will have on our privacy rights. One thing for sure, however, is that once this genie is out of the bottle, there is no going back.</p><p>Brian J.

I'm Brian Stelter and this is a special edition of RELIABLE SOURCES, looking back at the last decade of news about the news and looking ahead to 2020 and beyond. How will we all be consuming the news, shows, and stories in 2030?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Well, here with the forecast of the decade to come is futurist Amy Webb. Plus, the outspoken billionaire Marc Benioff will be here. He has a prediction for tech as well and I asked him why he decided to buy \"Time Magazine\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'll also sit down with \"USA Today\" editor Nicole Carroll to talk about what we need to preserve, what we need to protect while so much of media is changing.</p><p>Let's take a big picture view as we begin this hour. This was the decade of screens and screams and also strains on the shared notion of truth. To see what has changed, just look at some of the words that have been added to the Merriam Webster Dictionary in the past ten years.</p><p>There is bingeable. That's a new one. Screen time. Cyber safety. Also airplane mode. Plus, clickbait, emoji, meme. That's a new one in the past ten years. But also deep state, and truther, and alt- right, and idiocracy.</p><p>You can just think back to 2010 before any of those words really enter our lexicon. It was the year the iPad launched. It was also the year Instagram started. In 2011, just 35 percent of adults owned a smartphone. Now, that number is up to 81 percent and still rising.</p><p>You wake up and if you're anything like me, you start scrolling. That's all we do. We all start scrolling all day long. Our phone addictions have taken hold.</p><p>And these addictions start at a young age. New platforms keep popping up, changing the way we communicate and changing our sense of community from Kickstarter in 2010, Twitch in 2011, Apple News in 2015, Tiktok in 2016.</p><p>This decade was shaped and reshaped by big tech -- Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook. Actually, they're not big tech. They are mammoth, gargantuan technology companies. They sit between news outlets and you the reader, you the viewer. And this has caused or at least hastened tremendous disruption to the media business.</p><p>As digital took hold, some magazines went out of print, more and more local newspapers had to close up shop. Thousands of beat reporters have lost their jobs. But at the same time, many new brands have been born from \"BuzzFeed\" news in 2011, to \"Vox\" in 2014, and \"Axios\" in 2017. There's been destruction, there's also been rebirth and many of these companies, these new startups, they've tried to make content to catch your attention in the stream, because what really -- this decade has really been about is the social media revolution.</p><p>Facebook had just a measly 400 million users in 2010. Now, it's approaching 2.5 billion. Look at this. This is 1.2 billion daily active users on Facebook, every single day logging in to Facebook.</p><p>And just in the U.S., 69 percent of American adults say they use Facebook. That's 22 percent for Twitter. So, Facebook much bigger than Twitter.</p><p>We are in a world where algorithms, basically robots, are picking and choosing the news that served up to us. Our feeds are filling up with hyper-partisans, sometimes downright hateful content, all designed to press our buttons and keep our attention. But it wasn't always like this. It doesn't always have to be like this.</p><p>Digital eco-chambers don't have physical locks on the doors, but this is really the dissidence at the heart of the digital social media age. These tools can empower us, connect us like never before in human history. News can spread at the speed of light, but so can nonsense and lies. You know, the same software that can make us feel safer and smarter can also make us feel angry, and alienated and bamboozled.</p><p>And I think we're all just beginning to learn how to live digital lives, how to use technology instead of being used by it. How to stay informed instead of being misinformed. That is the biggest media story of the past decade.</p><p>So, now, let's hear from our first two experts on this special hour- long look back because we're also going to look forward. Nicole Carroll is the editor and chief of \"USA Today.\" one of America's biggest newspapers. And David Zurawik is the media critic extraordinaire for \"The Baltimore Sun.\"</p><p>Nicole, ten years ago, you worked at \"The Arizona Republic\".</p><p>[11:05:02]</p><p>NICOLE CARROLL, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, USA TODAY: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: Now, you're at \"USA Today\".</p><p>What's been most unexpected about this decade?</p><p>CARROLL: You're absolutely right that it's social media. And it's the impact it's had on every aspect of our business. In a good sense, you're right. People can get information. I'm all about spreading truth. I love we can get it to them quicker.</p><p>But there's been two pretty catastrophic impacts as well. The first is that the brands are disembodied from the news on social media. So, people are reading something and they don't know who is the source of this information.</p><p>They don't know is this truth? Is this an opinion? Is this a fact? Is this misinformation? That's a huge problem and it has eroded trust in the media.</p><p>The second issue is speed. Speed is great. We want to get the news out, except when it's wrong.</p><p>And so, in this rush to speed people will put misinformation out and you can't pull it back. It's already out there. And that causes considerable problems.</p><p>STELTER: Right, and information is increasingly being weaponized and being used as misinformation. These are terms we didn't use a decade ago, David. What do you think has changed the most?</p><p>DAVID ZURAWIK, MEDIA CRITIC, THE BALTIMORE SUN: Well, changed the most, I think one of them is the rise of ring wing media, organized right wing media. We had right wing media back with Joe McCarthy in the late '40s, early '50s. Hearst, for example, was an excellent practitioner of it.</p><p>But this decade, Brian, we saw it rise up sort of -- not sort of, in a very organized way and align itself with an etiology and candidate and weaponize information in that way. Look, I think all of this about the revolutionary impact of social media and technology is true.</p><p>But here's the battle for us in the media. Do we embrace it, which we have to, which we love, but do we hold on to legacy standards?</p><p>STELTER: We have to.</p><p>ZURAWIK: Well, not a lot of people are doing that.</p><p>You cited some of the new outlets. Not all of them hold on to them. That's one of the things that cheers me so much about this decade.</p><p>Major, the giant sort of brands in news, \"Washington Post\", \"New York Times,\" CNN have found financial models in this decade that will keep them going. Those are the people who will keep legacy values alive, but when you let social media drive your coverage totally. If you're in a newsroom --</p><p>STELTER: When you're covering what's trending all the time, right.</p><p>ZURAWIK: They come out, you're trending. You go, well, I don't know, I'm working on a big piece. No, no, we've got to chase this because it's trending.</p><p>That's the danger we have. That will steal our soul. That will lose our identity. We will be little rats chasing trending things.</p><p>And what's your brand? What's different from your brand with one down the street? That's the thing. It's a struggle for our values, our soul, our identity and what we're going to be. I think it really is. Do legacy values get shredded by this or do we find a way to blend them in to the new media landscape.</p><p>STELTER: Well, Nicole, as the editor has said, how do you avoid that from happening? I mean, there's less reporting, more aggregating, a lot of blurring the lines between opinion and news. All of these issues kind of eating away.</p><p>CARROLL: You have to hold -- you have to hold the line. That's every single day we are holding the line and we're trying to show that to the reader, because people don't trust media these days in many ways. We say, here's the source, here's the document, here's the video, see for yourself to regain that trust.</p><p>And I want to mention, you talked about the social media impact on trending news. Also, it's on polarizing news.</p><p>ZURAWIK: Yes. Yes.</p><p>CARROLL: We have a lot of data on our users. We know exactly what they're clicking. We know how long they're spending, we know where they came from, we know where they're going.</p><p>Publishers know that polarizing headlines get news. So, many publishers are going to those polarizing headlines, and they're creating a narrative that's not exactly true out there. We did a survey with public agenda where we surveyed all of America and they're quite upset about the divide and they think the news media has a big part to play in it.</p><p>Fifty-nine percent of them said the news media is pushing polarization for their own benefit. I think that's a problem.</p><p>STELTER: You know, they're talking about -- that's absolutely true. There are a lot of examples of that. I think a more positive trend in the past decade has been the rise of non-profit news outlets --</p><p>ZURAWIK: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: -- the stuff that you've highlighted. You know, \"The Texas Tribunes\" and the \"ProPublicas\" in the world have been able to gain donations and revenue from subscribers and from readers.</p><p>CARROLL: And it's been wonderful to see, especially in communities that are underserved by traditional news, to see these outlets startup.</p><p>I think another positive thing are foundations giving to traditional news media. We have received gates form -- excuse me, we have received grants from many of them and there's no strings attached. There's no influence on the content, but they're funding coverage, education coverage, health coverage and that's a big trend that we're happy to see.</p><p>STELTER: What's the most positive trend you see right now, Zurawik?</p><p>ZURAWIK: One of the -- you know what -- for the decade, Brian, the most positive thing I saw was the take down of the patriarchs in the media.</p><p>STELTER: You mean the #metoo movement.</p><p>ZURAWIK: Yes. You go back to 2010, Les Moonves, Roger Ailes, Harvey Weinstein, these were the giants of media.</p><p>[11:10:01]</p><p>And all three of them, with a host of others, are gone from that landscape. That is a huge accomplishment in this decade. The women who stood up, spoke up are the heroes.</p><p>But there's also journalists, like Ronan Farrow and a lot of other journalists who helped further that. That's a huge difference. When you think of patriarchy, Brian, Old Statement old.</p><p>Back before the Old Testament, taking down -- you're not going to get rid of patriarchy overnight, it takes a revolution, but to get those people at the top of the media culture out of there and to send a warning. You saw how CBS changed in the wake of this. That's a huge change for us.</p><p>STELTER: So, the patriarchy is the loser. What's the biggest winner of the decade, Nicole?</p><p>CARROLL: I think investigative reporting.</p><p>STELTER: Right, including the #metoo movement, yes.</p><p>CARROLL: Including the #metoo movement. And when we talk about #metoo, let's talk about local journalism.</p><p>Let's talk about the \"IndyStar\", and USA gymnastics. Let's talk about \"The Los Angeles Times\" and USC. The media titans in that has been important, but so has the local reporting on sexual harassment and abuse. That's been a big theme this year.</p><p>But as our resources get tighter, focusing more on what matters most, and that's investigative reporting. So I think you're seeing some of the best work we've had in the past decade, and that's a huge win.</p><p>STELTER: And beyond the news media, what's been the biggest entertainment winner in the past decade, David?</p><p>ZURAWIK: I think the premium streaming services and Netflixes.</p><p>STELTER: Yes, Netflix taking over the world.</p><p>ZURAWIK: Really, listen, the winners are the viewers. You're getting great drama. You're great documentaries. Networks, listen -- the networks always wanted to save money. Thirty years covering TV. I never saw more junk on network television in prime time.</p><p>STELTER: Really?</p><p>ZURAWIK: They deserve to be losing audience.</p><p>STELTER: You know, think about it, a decade ago, Netflix wasn't making TV shows. \"House of Cards\" didn't come along until 2013. This is still a new phenomenon to have all these streaming services</p><p>ZURAWIK: It is and it's unbelievable, the myriad of choices they give you.</p><p>But, also, they're giving people -- Brian, you know how hard it is to make a documentary. You know how little bit of money is out there to make documentary makers make them.</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>ZURAWIK: The fact that you can go to Netflix, or you can go to HBO or one of these and get money to do a proper documentary, that makes all the difference in the world. Look at the Netflix documentary on the Catholic Church in Baltimore, \"The Keepers.\" brilliant documentary.</p><p>We're getting -- those come so fast and furious now, we almost can't keep up with them.</p><p>STELTER: And the connective tissue between entertainment and news is the role of subscriber revenue.</p><p>ZURAWIK: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: Whether you're paying for Netflix, you're paying for \"USA Today\", having that skin in the game by subscribing.</p><p>ZURAWIK: Yes.</p><p>STELTER: All right. David and Nicole, stand by.</p><p>After the break, some unexpected good news about trust in media.</p><p>[11:15:51]</p><p>STELTER: Welcome back to RELIABLE SOURCES. I'm Brian Stelter.</p><p>Thinking about the intersection of media and politics, you can draw a line right down the middle of the decade. There was the pre-Trump age and there was the Trump age. The president's hate movement against the media has worsened over time. He has also inspired leaders of other countries to crack down on real reporting by calling it fake.</p><p>But when we take the long view, we can see that most Americans see right through Trump's attacks.</p><p>Let me show you a Gallup poll going back to 1997 showing you that the trust in the media has been relatively stable, although low, relatively stable regardless of political party for many years. You can see what happens in 2016. The Trump age causes a clear divergence.</p><p>Suddenly, more Democrats express trust in the media, while trust among Republicans fell sharply. Of course, many of those Republicans do trust some forms of media like Fox News and radio. What we are seeing is the polarization of trust.</p><p>It is one of the key themes of the past decade.</p><p>Let's continue the conversation now with David Zurawik of \"The Baltimore Sun\" and Nicole Carroll of \"USA Today\". We got a critic. We got an editor. Two questions for each of you.</p><p>First, David, what needs to change in the 2020s? Is that what we're going to call it, 2020s? What needs to change in the decade ahead?</p><p>ZURAWIK: What I think we need to see changed and what I think we'd really to see change, and his is a moral sense, so maybe we don't talk much about morality. But, you know, the kind of race-baiting we heard with immigrants make us a dirtier nation on cable TV, on a mainstream cable television outlet with millions of viewers. We need to stop that because that has real world consequences, I believe, you know?</p><p>And there's too much of it. There's too much of it all over the media, really nasty rhetoric. People saying things without thinking of the impact of those words. It really reminds me of the McCarthy era, but the journalists need to step back.</p><p>Even if they're not journalists, even if they've sworn allegiance to a political operation, they don't need to take it to this extreme because there are vulnerable populations in this country who are hurt by it. When you think of the -- you mentioned \"ProPublica\", that videotape they got of the 16-year-old dying alone in the detention center, those are people who are affected by these kinds of words.</p><p>Some hot dog cable host throws out there's somebody on a late night show -- primetime show thinking they're going to get more viewers with it. We need to stop that.</p><p>And really advertisers -- I don't care. If advertisers boycott, I don't care how we do it, it needs to stop.</p><p>STELTER: Nicole, what about you? What needs to change in the years ahead?</p><p>CARROLL: Super easy, fake news. I celebrate a diversity of opinion. It is wonderful what makes us America. But I think we all agree that fake news is destructive --</p><p>STELTER: You mean actually fake stories?</p><p>CARROLL: Actually fake stories.</p><p>STELTER: Actually fake stories.</p><p>CARROLL: Stories that are actually made up.</p><p>And, you know, it has to become socially unacceptable to spread those stories. We have to call it out. I call it out all the time on my Facebook. I'm saying, not true, here's the truth. Not true, here's the truth.</p><p>We've got to make it -- it's got to be unacceptable to share fake news. It is destructive to our democracy.</p><p>STELTER: What about threats to journalists? That's the other one we got to all mention, we all agree. There's been this rise of threats against journalists partly because of the president's rhetoric. It's got to change. It's got to stop.</p><p>What about things we need to make sure don't change, some things we need to hold on to no matter what in the decade ahead.</p><p>CARROLL: Number one, support of the First Amendment. I think we've seen recently that there are real threats to our freedoms. We can't just take our freedoms for granted. We have to choose them and we have to defend them.</p><p>And defending the First Amendment is the most important thing we can do for the health of journalism moving forward.</p><p>STELTER: David, what about you?</p><p>ZURAWIK: We have to hold on to legacy values. We absolutely can't play with them. You know, we can't say, oh, we can compromise on this one, we can compromise on that one, but we'll keep this one. That is the difference. That's what earns us the guarantees we have under the Constitution.</p><p>We have a public obligation to serve those values of truth, of giving citizens information they can trust. If we don't have a verifiable, reliable stream of information in the society, we don't have a democracy. And then you couple that with consolidation and news rooms getting hollowed out and nobody covering the state legislatures or the city halls, and we're in big trouble on democracy.</p><p>[11:20:11]</p><p>That's what I think really, really worries me right now.</p><p>STELTER: Another thing I hope we don't lose is this renewed sense of purpose that many journalists feel. And yes, it is partly related to Trump. Any time you have a politician who's misleading the republic, Republican or Democrat, there's going to be a renewed sense of needing to fact-check, needing to verify or debunk what's being said.</p><p>You must feel that in your newsroom, Nicole?</p><p>CARROLL: Right. I love how people are rallying to the call of local news. We talk a lot about the technology --</p><p>STELTER: Right. You're a national paper.</p><p>CARROLL: Right.</p><p>STELTER: But your company has a lot of local papers across the country.</p><p>CARROLL: Two hundred sixty across the country. And we're seeing people get behind their local news outlet. So, we talk about voice, we talk about AI, we talk about AR, it really -- and then, of course, those platforms will continue to change.</p><p>But here's what's not going to change -- the need in a community for independent professional local news. Local news strengthens communities and that's not going to change.</p><p>STELTER: David Zurawik, Nicole Carroll, thank you both.</p><p>We are just getting started this hour talking about gathering and producing the news. It costs a fortune so who's paying?</p><p>Well, two billionaire families have two very different ideas about the direction forward. Paul Huntsman is the publisher of \"The Salt Lake Tribune\", he will join me shortly.</p><p>But, first, silicon Valley giant, Marc Benioff, he's the owner of \"Time Magazine\", hear his prediction about the future of media, next.</p><p>STELTER: And we're back on RELIABLE SOURCES.</p><p>Talking about news in the next decade. And here's something that will always be true: ownership matters. Politicians from left to right, from Bernie Sanders to President Trump sometimes bemoan corporate ownership of media.</p><p>In the past decade, we've seen an interesting trend toward billionaire ownership of the news.</p><p>Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos purchased \"The Post\", \"The Washington Post\" in 2013. Soon after, Red Sox owner John Henry purchased \"The Boston Globe\". More recently, biotech billionaire, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong bought \"The L.A. Times\". And Laurene Powell Jobs has acquired a majority stake in \"The Atlantic\" and made a number of other interesting investments in news outlets.</p><p>\"Time Magazine\" is a part of this trend as well.</p><p>[11:25:01]</p><p>Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne acquired \"Time\" in late 2018.</p><p>So, I want to know, what are the consequences of this ownership trend? With me now is the aforementioned Marc Benioff, the founder, chairman, co-CEO of Salesforce. He's also author of the new book \"Trailblazer: The Power of Business as the Greatest Platform for Change.\"</p><p>Marc, thank you for coming on.</p><p>MARC BENIOFF, FOUNDER/CHAIRMAN/CO-CEO, SALESFORCE: Thanks for having me. I really appreciate being here.</p><p>STELTER: You wear so many hats. But what's it like being the magazine owner hat? What's it like wearing that hat these days?</p><p>BENIOFF: Well, I'm thrilled to, you know, be a steward of this historic brand. Just being associated with this 95-year history of \"Time Magazine\" and the ability to give it the fuel to keep going forward, that's what really excites us every day.</p><p>STELTER: You know, I noticed recently, Person of the Year, of course. You had on the cover there, the famous Greta and her climate change advocacy. I think people wondered given how outspoken you've been about climate change if you're influencing the editorial choices of the magazine.</p><p>BENIOFF: Well, one of the decisions that we made when we decided to purchase the magazine was, we wouldn't get involved in editorial decisions. We also made a decision that we wouldn't get involved in operational decisions.</p><p>Like you said, we have our hands full already with lots of other exciting things that we do every single day, but we want to be able to be the stewards of the historic brand and give them this ability to move forward and give them the fuel to move forward and that's -- that's really our core relationship with \"Time\".</p><p>STELTER: Does that mean you're willing to lose money to be doing that? Because, you know, when you bought the magazine in 2018, we put one of the headlines on the screen. You said, I want \"Time Magazine\" to be unshackled.</p><p>What does that mean?</p><p>BENIOFF: Well, I do want \"Time Magazine\" to be unshackled and what that means is that our world today needs more trust. We are in a crisis of trust. When you look at what's happening with social media, when you look at the types of decisions that are being made in regards to artificial intelligence, to this next generation of technologies, especially as it regards to media, we're finding ourselves quite vested in a crisis of trust.</p><p>STELTER: Yes.</p><p>BENIOFF: And \"Time Magazine\" can be a steward of trust as we move through this. You know, it's one of the core values of \"Time\" -- trust, impact, you know, the core magazine itself, and that it's about equality. Well, actually, T-I-M-E. That's why I think they called it \"Time.\" And, you know, we so strongly believe that that has to drive us forward and that's really why we're so deeply involved.</p><p>STELTER: You've been talking about the next 10 years this hour. In 10 years, will there be a print edition of \"Time\" still?</p><p>BENIOFF: Oh, absolutely. You can see the print edition is probably more popular than ever. If you've seen the last issue that just came out, which I think you mentioned the Person of the Year issue --</p><p>STELTER: Yes.</p><p>BENIOFF: -- I think it's probably the most successful issue of \"Time Magazine\" of all time.</p><p>And you can see that there's a resurgence of consumers who are excited to receive the magazine at their home every week. The team at \"Time\" is incredible and the work they've done over the last few weeks to deliver this issue, I think, is probably some of the best work of their lives.</p><p>STELTER: And thinking beyond \"Time Magazine\", you know, you've been outspoken about where the tech industry needs to be. Where do you see big tech, including Facebook which you've been critical of, where do you see these companies moving in the coming years?</p><p>BENIOFF: Well, you can see Facebook is the new cigarettes for our society. It's something that badly needs to be regulated. It's something that is not good for us. It's something that the company is out for our kids.</p><p>And they're certainly not exactly about truth in advertising. Even they have said that. That's why we're really in squarely a crisis of trust when the core vendor themselves cannot say that trust is our most important value.</p><p>Look, we're in a moment in time where each one of us at every company has to ask a question, what is our highest value? What is the most important thing to us?</p><p>And you asked why we got involved at \"Time Magazine.\" because that value of trust -- well, that's been associated with them from the very first day of their founding.</p><p>STELTER: I know Facebook has been under a lot of scrutiny. You and others have said it should be broken up. Do you expect that to actually happen?</p><p>BENIOFF: I do. I expect a fundamental re-conceptualization of what Facebook's role is in the world and what Facebook's role is in regards to the word not just trust but truth. And when you have an entity that large with that much potential impact and not fundamentally doing good things to improve the state of the world, well, then I think everyone is going to have it in its crosshairs.</p><p>And since I first kind of made that statement -- STELTER: Right.</p><p>BENIOFF: -- which was in January of 2018, at the time, I don't think people really understood what I was saying. Today, I think it's crystal clear that our fundamental role and our relationship with Facebook needs to change.</p><p>STELTER: And what about your own media consumption -- you know, patterns?</p><p>[11:30:00]</p><p>How do you consume news and media these days?</p><p>BENIOFF: Well, I consume media in a lot of different ways. And of course, one of my favorite ways to consume media is Time Magazine. The second -- the second part of consuming media for me is, you know, I'm an avid user, actually, of one of the social networks, Twitter. I know that you and I are both on there. And that's been -- that's been important to me.</p><p>And then also I have subscriptions, physical and digital subscriptions, and I spend a lot of time with that every single day.</p><p>STELTER: You mentioned Twitter. If Facebook is cigarettes, is Twitter heroin? What is what is Twitter?</p><p>BENIOFF: Well, I think Twitter is actually quite a bit different. And you know, they still -- there's no finish line when it comes to building trust. They've gone through their set of challenges. But for sure, Facebook has been the biggest offender. And as an example, you know, you can see both organizations made very different positions in regards to political advertising.</p><p>STELTER: That's true. That's a good point. So let me wrap up with you. A big prediction for the next 10 years, where will we all be in 2030? No pressure?</p><p>BENIOFF: Well, I think -- well, artificial intelligence is probably the biggest driver of change in media and also in all of our lives. You can see that. I'm sure you like I have a voice-based ambient computing.</p><p>You know, we're talking to our Alexa or Google Home or our Apple HomePod, you know, to get some of our news, to get our entertainment, to get information, our software and the systems that are around us, our phones, our cars, our homes, they're paying attention to us. They're listening to us. And we're talking back to them.</p><p>And that is going to become a huge major change in terms of media over the next 10 years. Because as those systems know more about you and understand what you want, if you opt into that it is going to start to give you feedback and you're going to start to see things that look a lot more like a scene out of the Minority Report than out of a page of Time Magazine 10 years ago.</p><p>STELTER: All right, Marc Benioff, thank you so much for the prediction. Thanks for joining me.</p><p>BENIOFF: Good to see you, Brian.</p><p>STELTER: You too. Up next here, earlier this year, the New York Times asked, can Paul Huntsman save the Salt Lake Tribune by pulling off a pivot to nonprofit? So, can he? The answer is coming up.</p><p>STELTER: Five or 10 years from now, will your local newspaper still be in business? Will it still be in print? Well, if so, maybe we'll be a nonprofit. Check out the 148-year-old Salt Lake Tribune newspaper serving residents of Utah. Earlier this year, this paper became the first metropolitan daily in the country to go nonprofit, to apply and get permission from the IRS to do so.</p><p>So I spoke with publisher Paul Huntsman, part of Utah's Huntsman family to see whether he would recommend this option to other news outlets. It turns out he already has. He said it became obvious to him when he bought the paper in 2016 that nonprofit was the way to go.</p><p>[11:35:09]</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAUL HUNTSMAN, PUBLISHER AND OWNER, THE SALT LAKE TRIBUNE: When I looked at the Salt Lake Tribune, I realized this was -- this was a charitable endeavor. This was for the better -- this was for the betterment of the community. And it was a matter of finding a sustainable pathway.</p><p>STELTER: So you decided right away, or at least relatively quickly this paper effectively is a nonprofit because it's losing money, so it should be a nonprofit.</p><p>HUNTSMAN: Quite frankly, I didn't realize how poor the newspaper industry or the condition that it really was in and is in today. And if you look at the migration going from print to digital, you're replacing print dollars with digital -- well, some people like to say digital dimes, I like to refer to it as digital pennies. And as part of that transformation over 2000 local news newspapers have shut down.</p><p>And I see that trend only continuing as less people continue to access their news from the printed product, you will begin to see dailies here in the next few years transition from a print product to a digital product.</p><p>STELTER: The Salt Lake Tribune is the first metropolitan daily newspaper in the United States to go this nonprofit route, to make this transformation. Do you see what you all have done as a path for other papers?</p><p>HUNTSMAN: Yes. I would say there's probably been a couple dozen publishers that have already reached out as well as a number of different law firms who are representing other publishers, you know, asking really what the playbook looks like as they -- as they are looking to go down a very similar pathway with their own newspapers.</p><p>STELTER: You know, I wonder in 10 years, are we going to have big national brands like the New York Times and the Washington Post, and then mostly nonprofit papers everywhere else. Is that possible?</p><p>HUNTSMAN: Look, as -- I really look at the landscape of historic and legacy newspapers and markets of our size. As you transition from a -- from a print product to a digital product, again I really don't see how you can look at any other pathway and still have good watchdog and impactful journalism.</p><p>You can continue to cut your way back and perhaps be a glorified blog and still have resources. But for communities of you know, a half million to two to three million people, you know, you need a strong base of journalists.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STELTER: Yes, you do. Yes, we do. We need journalists in these communities. That's why we're going to see more of these nonprofit newspapers. It shows that there's been a rise in nonprofit digital news outlets. When we come back here, truth decay. How truth decay is running rampant, and what we in the media can do to help.</p><p>[11:40:00]</p><p>STELTER: Social media seemed fun, even frivolous at the start of the decade when apps like Instagram and Snapchat were launching. But the 2010s ended with an escalated information of war and widespread criticism of Twitter and Facebook for enabling and worsening a world of alternative realities.</p><p>I often hear people say we live in a post-truth world, but I reject that. We are not post-truth as long as some of us, some people are still fighting for facts and data and reality. But this decade was marked by something best described as truth decay. The term was coined by the RAND Corporation.</p><p>They say truth decay is about the diminishing role facts and analysis have in people's lives due in large parts of the rise of social media. It is decay indeed. We are way past cavities at this point. We're talking about root canals. I even thought about booking my dentist for this.</p><p>But instead, let me bring in RandSenior Political Scientist Jennifer Kavanagh, along with CNN, Senior Media Reporter Oliver Darcy, and quantitative futurist and professor at the NYU Sterling School of Business Amy Webb. Webb is the author of The Big Nine: How the Tech Titans and Their Thinking Machines Could Warp Humanity.</p><p>And we're going to talk about those thinking machines. But first to you, Jennifer, on truth decay. What are the main drivers of truth decay? JENNIFER KAVANAGH, SENIOR POLITICAL SCIENTIST, RAND CORPORATION: Well, it starts with cognitive bias. We're predisposed to believe false information and to really cling to that information once we believe it the first time. But that's always been around and that's not really the main driver.</p><p>The main driver that we point to in our book is changes in the media landscape. And this would include the rise of social media, which makes it really easy to spread disinformation, as well as the diversity of sources that are available. It's really easy for people to find information that confirms what they believe, regardless of what they believe.</p><p>STELTER: And this book Truth Decay, this came out what, about a year ago last year?</p><p>KAVANAGH: Yes, in 2018.</p><p>STELTER: Yes. I feel like to me, it crystallizes the idea the thing that we're all living through. And here again, some of the main drivers, this political, this social polarization. Oliver, to what do you put most of the blame for this?</p><p>OLIVER DARCY, CNN SENIOR MEDIA REPORTER: Well, you know, you actually said that we live in a post-truth -- we reject the notion we live --</p><p>STELTER: No, we do not live in a post-truth world.</p><p>DARCY: That's because we live in multiple worlds, right? And so some worlds actually do happen to be post-truth, and it's because that the media has been fragmented by big tech, by the ability to watch Fox if you're on the conservative end of the spectrum, if you're liberal, you can watch MSNBC, the media is very fragmented. So people are living in multiple different worlds and some of these worlds happen to be post-truth.</p><p>I think what's going to be interesting moving forward, you know, and it's in the next decade is how can media organizations puncture, pierce these other alternate universes to disseminate information that's not being disseminated to these different viewers who are stuck in these alternate universes? I think that will be interesting.</p><p>STELTER: Amy, I think Alex Jones got one thing right with his Infowars conspiracy side, and that is that we are living in the age of information wars. It's become really obvious in the past couple years that information is being weaponized.</p><p>[11:45:05]</p><p>AMY WEBB, FOUNDER, FUTURE TODAY INSTITUTE: Yes, well, I mean, without making a giant confusing Rick and Morty reference, I would argue that we're living in multiverses and the problem is only going to get worse. We are on the cusp of what's called synthetic content. So these are --</p><p>STELTER: Deep fakes, dumb fakes? WEBB: Kind of like deep fakes, but intended for good purpose. So anybody who used to watch soap operas, imagine characters that look and interact and feel very real, but were created or generated using all different types of A.I. technologies, you know, and they're great. They show up on set when they're supposed to, they don't act, you know, bad, and then do all kinds of terrible things, and they can be programmed, and they can also be personalized.</p><p>So this is all really, really interesting, except that recently, there's a company called DID that started generating digital copies of real famous people. And you can think of this as sort of analogous to escaping copyright infringement, so they very, very gently tweak your features just enough so that they can't be sued. But you can -- you can unleash these sort of digital twins out now all over the place, which is going to make the problems that you're talking about all the more complicated as we start a new decade.</p><p>STELTER: But sometimes this analogy is used for good, you're saying, it's just they can also be turned against people.</p><p>WEBB: That's right. So you know, there are plenty of circumstances, right, where if you were able to modulate and dubbed somebody else's voice, it just makes it easier if you're producing movies for international audiences.</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>WEBB: Or, I mean, imagine a soap opera that's tailored to your specific tastes and preferences, it would be really cool to have all of these different characters. The challenge, of course, with every technology is that it can be used for evil, as well as for good.</p><p>DARCY: And it'll get more difficult to track this disinformation that's produced --</p><p>WEBB: That's right.</p><p>DARCY: -- because we're moving toward private messages. You know, Zuckerberg has come out and says --</p><p>STELTER: Right, private groups on Facebook, etcetera.</p><p>DARCY: Right. We're moving away from this broad media. And everything, like I said, very fragmented, much more difficult to keep track of misinformation, disinformation, when there are thousand different, you know, places where things are spreading.</p><p>WEBB: To be fair, Zuckerberg did pivot to privacy earlier in the year. A lot of people have forgotten that that was Facebook's initial intention in January.</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>KAVANAGH: Disinformation is also becoming much more personalized. Think about all the data. There's so much data about us available online, either to a tech company who wants to collect it, or any other actor, potentially one with nefarious intent.</p><p>So imagine getting messages, that there are threats to your family members or threats to your house, or a specific threat to your region that's intended to really cause a panic or undermine trust in institutions. That I think is a real threat that we haven't really thought about in real terms.</p><p>STELTER: This is getting scarier and scarier. I got to be honest. You know, how does this relate to the news media -- the news media, Jennifer? How do you see the news media reacting to these kinds of threats and evolutions?</p><p>KAVANAGH: Well, I think the pressure to be first, to have the first story really pushes news outlets, whether we're talking about television or print or social media to get things out fast and to not necessarily verify them first. And that can lead to these viral trends that end up being hoaxes or false information.</p><p>So I think thinking about what we do when there seems to be some kind of panic or crisis and we don't have the full facts, what do we do in that first hour. I think that's something that news media can think about and should be thinking about, how you report and think about profits but also balance that with public safety, and the greater good.</p><p>STELTER: Let's just fit in a quick break. More with the panel in just a moment here on RELIABLE SOURCES.</p><p>[11:50:00]</p><p>STELTER: Think about all the devices you've accumulated in the past 10 years, voice-activated assistance like Alexa, and others, cameras and everything like Snap spectacles, their new gadgets in your cars and more to come like Spotify's car smart assistant, and of course, there's the Apple Watch, there's AirPods, there's all these other devices. We are really living in the smartphone age.</p><p>So what can we expect to media and tech in the next 10 years? The panel is back with me here to discuss that. And Amy Webb, you are our futurist, will the smartphone just be attached to our hands? What's going to happen in the next 10 years?</p><p>WEBB: Right. So the 2010s introduced us to the smartphone and the 2020s will be the beginning of the end of this product that we all hold so dear.</p><p>STELTER: OK, all right.</p><p>WEBB: And there's many reasons why. I mean, we've gotten to the point where there's not a lot of additional features that you can embed into this device. So it's not going away, it'll start to just recede into the background. What replaces it, smart glasses, accompanied by rings, and very likely bracelets. And if you stop and think, you know, maybe that sounds crazy. We've got everything that we could possibly want to do in one device. If you were to go back to the 90s even a few decades before, you know a lot of people were carrying around portable CD players and DVD players and laptops. I had a portable Toshiba satellite pro that doubled as a self-defense weapon, it was so heavy and thick.</p><p>So, we were carrying all of these different devices that eventually converged into a single smartphone and we are at the beginning of another divergence where we'll have all kinds of peripherals and devices that help us get through our everyday lives that we were rather than hold.</p><p>STELTER: For your Future Today Institute, you have some other forecasts in your annual letter. We can put those on screen. Are there any others that are really relevant to media these days?</p><p>WEBB: You know, I would say that there are several. So I mentioned earlier, synthetic contents. You know, this sounds kind of hokey and bizarre, but there's another aspect to deep fakes that's not just about intentionally trying to mislead people. And so we're going to start to engage with, you know, all different types of content that has been generated for us.</p><p>We're at the beginning of augmented audio reality. So at the beginning, we'll have glasses on that you won't necessarily see an overlay with but rather, you'll have digital assistance perpetually tethered to your ears.</p><p>STELTER: Interesting.</p><p>WEBB: You know, those kinds of things happening as well as things like scoring. Everybody alive today is being scored in one way or another and that has serious implications both good and bad for the content that you see, the prices that you pay, and generally how you perceive the world around you.</p><p>STELTER: Hearing this from Amy, it makes me think more about media literacy and tech literacy. And Jennifer, that's something that just can't be stressed enough, the need for us to be literate about these devices, and these platforms, and this content that's being piped to us from every direction.</p><p>KAVANAGH: Yes. And the challenge is that technology changes really quickly, but institutions like schools change really slowly. So right now, what we see is a gap between the skills that people need to use smartphones, to navigate a complex media landscape, and the skills that they have, and the skills that they're getting in schools.</p><p>There's a lot of energy and interest in media literacy, but we don't yet know all that much about what an effective media literacy curriculum looks like. And so that I think is a real priority area for educators, for researchers to figure out. If we want people to be prepared to navigate this space, what do we need to do? What training both first children but also for adults, which are even harder to capture because they're already out of school? STELTER: Right, they're already are. Oliver, are you ultimately a pessimist or an optimist about the future of media and tech?</p><p>DARCY: I'm probably on the pessimist side right now. You know, it just there aren't very many signs. It seems like the things are going to get better before, you know, before they get even worse. And particularly with things being fragmentizes, with people stuck in their bubbles, getting more and more stuck in their bubbles, and then seeing the dishonest individuals who will capitalize on this for profit, it doesn't leave much hope that that, you know, we're going to see anything better in the next few years. Maybe ultimately in you know, 10, 20 years, but right now with this new technology, you know, and in the companies who are Facebook and Google, all these companies they don't seem to yet understand how to grapple with what their power, I can't --</p><p>STELTER: They say they do. They say they're trying to take steps in the right direction.</p><p>DARCY: Well, they say a lot of things, right? But at the end of the day, if you look at the results, a lot of times, you know, they're very slow to move things. They still allow -- you know, Facebook this year just partner with Breitbart, and their Facebook news tab. They're still making very odd decisions like that. So it doesn't leave much room for hope, at least from my perspective.</p><p>STELTER: And that's in the news business. On the entertainment side of the media world, we're seeing the so-called streaming wars, right, Amy? I think they're actually the streaming Olympics.</p><p>That's a term my colleague Frank Pallotta used on CNN.com, because there's not a zero sum game here. There's been multiple winners and the streaming wars, but obviously, Netflix is the king. Do you think 10 years from now it's going to be all streaming? I mean, will cable news still exist in 20 years?</p><p>WEBB: Well, again, I think we should approach the 20s as an era of transition. At the Future Today Institute, we built a model trying to understand what the ceiling is, that the average American would pay for all of their different streaming services and aggregate.</p><p>STELTER: Right.</p><p>WEBB: And the amount that we centered on was $38. So if you stop and think about it for a moment, these streaming services aren't just competing against each other, cable is not just competing against them, but there are games in the mix, there's electric and digital exercise programs. I mean, they're connected mirrors that you can buy an exercise within in your home.</p><p>So there's a lot happening in that ecosystem. And at some point, I think all of these organizations and companies need to empathize with the consumer and think through the implications of asking them to pay for so many different things. I mean, what's the value proposition.</p><p>STELTER: That is going to be a giant question for 2020, but also in the years ahead. To the panel, thank you so much for being here. Great to see you all. You know it's CNN's 40th birthday in 2020. I think we'll still be around in 2030.</p><p>That's a wrap on this year's reliable sources on T.V. but make sure to visit reliablesources.com for our brand new podcast episode.

Thanks to everyone who has been with us from the beginning, and each of you who has joined along the way. We can t imagine a better use of our time during this weird era than bringing you news and analysis of the day s big moments in tech, democracy, and the pandemic.</p><p>One result of the COVID-19 pandemic has been that big tech companies, which long have been reluctant to intervene in questions of content moderation, have quickly become much more aggressive. At Google, for example, the company began showing news stories from trusted sources to anyone who searched for information about the virus. It stepped up efforts to remove videos containing misinformation about the pandemic from YouTube.</p><p>YouTube also added a  shelf  of high-quality breaking news videos, along with links to the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and local health authorities. As a result, YouTube says, news consumption is up 75 percent from this time last year, and links to the WHO and CDC have received more than 20 billion impressions.</p><p>And on Tuesday, YouTube took a step that, among the big social platforms, has so far only been implemented by Facebook: adding fact-check articles to search results. I wrote about it at The Verge:</p><p>YouTube will begin adding informational panels containing information from its network of fact-checkers to videos in the United States, the company said. The panels, which were introduced last year in Brazil and India, appear on searches for topics where fact-checkers have published relevant articles on the subject. The move comes at a time when platforms have seen a surge in misinformation related to COVID-19 and its origin, possible cures, and other subjects. [ ]</p><p>YouTube says  more than a dozen  US publishers are already participating in its network of fact-checkers, including FactCheck.org, PolitiFact, and TheWashington Post Fact Checker. The network is open to any publisher that is a member of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN) and signs its code of principles. Google recently announced that it would donate $1 million to the IFCN.</p><p>On Monday afternoon, I spoke with YouTube s head of product, Neal Mohan, about how the company is navigating several challenges related to the pandemic. We talked about evolving advice from public health organizations, scrubbing bad content from the platform, and the company s increasing reliance on automated systems for moderation.</p><p> When users are searching on YouTube around a specific claim, we want to give an opportunity for those fact checks to show up right then and there, when our users are looking for information   especially around fast-moving, quickly changing topics like COVID-19,  Mohan told me.</p><p>Highlights from our interview are below, edited lightly for clarity and length.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Casey Newton: You rolled out fact checks in Brazil and India last year. What did you learn?</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Neal Mohan:</emphasis>We happened to roll it out in India right around the time of their elections last year. Those are the largest elections in the world, and as a result of the number of people that vote, the election itself occurs over the course of a month. So there was time for the potential spread of a lot of misinformation between one election date and another.</p><p>We have information panels that we triggered in the case of more evergreen conspiracies, like flat earth and anti-vaccine. But what about fast-moving, changing news events where there might not be a robust Wikipedia article or a CDC entry or an Encyclopedia Britannica article to link to? And so that s why we leaned on this concept of actually bringing professional fact checkers into our YouTube search results and triggering them there.</p><p>And our experience both in India and Brazil was positive. We think that we did our job in terms of curtailing the spread of misinformation in an otherwise sort of pretty flammable environment. Most importantly from my standpoint, we felt that we did right by our users in terms of doing our best to try to prevent this happening in those countries. And that that sort of positive result for our users led us to expand it here in the US. And our goal is not to just stop at these three countries   we want to continue to roll it out in other parts of the world as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">One challenge of policing information about COVID-19 is that the disease itself is new, and the advice we get keeps evolving. In some cases, advice like  don t wear masks  has changed to  everyone please wear masks.  How should a big tech platform approach that problem?</emphasis></p><p>My perspective there is that we really do have to rely on sources   and in our case, that means channels   that have a track record of being relevant and credible in this space. Yes, lots of guidelines are changing, every single day, every single week. You re literally seeing science being created on an hourly or daily basis. And so the reason why surfacing authoritative results feels like the best thing that we can do is because even if there s a change, an authoritative source is going to give the context behind it.</p><p>So let s say there s a change in mask guidance. I would expect an authoritative news outlet, or a medical authority like the CDC, to give context on it and say,  this used to be our guidance, and our new guidance is this, and here s the reason why.  Or a news publication covering it says  CDC changes its guidelines: this is what they used to say, now they re saying this, and this is the science that led them to change that.  And by surfacing authoritative results, I think we re doing what we can as a platform to deliver the most timely, but also the most credible information to our users.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I know YouTube has also been relying on more automated systems during the past couple months due to challenges with being able to bring third-party vendors into offices. How are you measuring the effect on your moderation decisions?</emphasis></p><p>A lot of of this was really very, very simple, which was protecting the health of our extended workforce. And for me and I think for everybody else here at YouTube and Google, that was really the number one consideration, and frankly everything else we were going to do was going to be secondary.</p><p>You and I have talked before about the way that [content moderation] works best is through a combination of machines and machine learning, and the nuanced judgment of well trained raters who do this for a living. Without that second part, we ve had to rely much more on handling things through appeals. Because there s a lot of action taken by these machines, sometimes those appeals are impacted in terms of our response time. But generally speaking, we ve been able to manage this.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Finally, we re in a situation in which some of the people spreading misinformation about COVID-19 are elected officials. How is YouTube approaching that when it comes to moderation?</emphasis></p><p>Just to be very clear, our community guidelines are based on the content. That applies to the content within the videos, and it also applies to comments and any other surface, if you will, on the YouTube platform. And so they re not about the speaker. The policies apply equally, whether you or I say something, an elected official does, or a national leader does. This crisis is no different.</p><p>One of the enforcement examples that we gave around medical misinformation was explicitly encouraging somebody to flout state or national guidance around a stay-at-home order. And this happened in the case of the Brazilian president.</p><p>We removed a couple of videos that happened when there was an explicit call to flout those orders. Of course, you have to strike the right balance. If there are people who have different opinions or would like to express an opinion   in terms of economic trade-offs versus health trade-offs   then that discourse needs to be allowed and protected on our platform. But something that explicitly says, through false information, that stay-at-home doesn t actually do anything, that would be an example of a policy violation, regardless of who the speaker is.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Ratio</emphasis></h><p>Today in news that could affect public perception of the big tech platforms.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Trending down:</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Amazon</emphasis>may have violated federal safety standards for providing  inadequate  protections to warehouse workers in New York, according to the state attorney general.

Project Bubble also required that Apple join forces with its historic rival, Google, to co-develop technology that could be used by health authorities in countries around the world.</p><p>The software, which Apple and Google now refer to by the softer-sounding term  exposure notification  instead of  contact tracing,  is due to be released on May 1. In recent weeks, the employees have been working nights and weekends to incorporate external feedback. The companies still have their critics, but the transparency has helped them win over some unlikely supporters, including in countries like Germany where officials were initially reluctant to work with Big Tech.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Google</emphasis>CEO Sundar Pichai says employees will not return to their offices until at least June 1st.

He blamed mismanagement by its new owners for shredding its value.</p><p>\"We are shocked, this is a big surprise, it's completely and utterly wrong and we reject it completely,\" he told Reuters by telephone. \"We have not heard anything from HP, they have not been in touch and we don't know what they are on about.\"</p><p>Lynch left HP's employment in May.</p><p>HP's announcement on Tuesday sent the company's shares plunging 12 per cent to a 10-year low of $11.71. HP, which for decades was synonymous with technical excellence and innovation as one of the bedrock companies of Silicon Valley, has seen its market value sink to roughly $20 billion from $155 billion in April of 2000.</p><p>CEO Meg Whitman took the helm at HP a little over a year ago when her predecessor, Leo Apotheker, was fired after less than a year on the job.</p><p>Apotheker's big strategic move during his brief tenure was the acquisition of Autonomy, intended to hasten HP's transformation into a software and services company - but which was criticized by many analysts at the time as over-priced.</p><p>Analyst Paul Morland at Peel Hunt said at the time that HP shareholders should be worried about the high price agreed, contracting margins and single-digit profit growth.</p><p>Whitman told an analyst call: \"Most of the board was here and voted for this deal, and we feel terribly about that.\"</p><p>TRAIN WRECK</p><p>Tuesday's announcement came just three months after the company took a writedown of almost $11 billion on its EDS services division.</p><p>HP has for years relied on deal-making, acquiring businesses ranging from EDS to Compaq to Palm, but has largely failed to articulate a clear strategy or establish a strong position in growth businesses like computer services or mobile computing.</p><p>\"To put it bluntly ... this story has been an unmitigated train wreck, and it seems every time management speaks to the Street, there is new negative incremental information forthcoming,\" said ISI Group analyst Brian Marshall.</p><p>HP said it has referred the alleged accounting wrongdoing at Autonomy to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's enforcement division and the UK's Serious Fraud Office for civil and criminal investigation. HP also said it would take legal action to recoup \"what we can for our shareholders.\"</p><p>Both agencies declined to comment.</p><p>Whitman said the investigation of Autonomy's finances - both external and internal - will take multiple years as it wends it way through the courts in both countries.</p><p>She defended the board's handling of the acquisition and blamed HP's auditors for failing to detect the problems.</p><p>\"The board relied on audited financials, audited by Deloitte. Not Brand X accounting firm, but Deloitte,\" she said, adding that KPMG was hired to audit Deloitte.</p><p>\"Neither of them saw what we now see after someone came forward to point us in the right direction,\" Whitman said.</p><p>On Tuesday, a person familiar with the situation told Reuters that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was probing the HP-Autonomy allegations in concert with the Securities and Exchange Commission, although the inquiry was at an early stage.</p><p>HP and Autonomy were not available to comment on the FBI probe, and the FBI declined to comment.</p><p>The alleged accounting issues also put a spotlight on the investment banks and law firms involved in the acquisition.</p><p>Autonomy was represented by Frank Quattrone, an investment banker who was the target of widespread criticism - and criminal prosecution - for his activities during the first dot-com boom. After one trial ended in a hung jury and a second ended in a guilty verdict that was overturned on appeal, the charges were ultimately dropped.</p><p>HP's lead adviser was Perella Weinberg, a boutique investment bank with little experience in big tech deals. Its attorneys included the blue-chip firms Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher; Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer; Drinker Biddle &amp; Reath; and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom, which advised the board.</p><p>INFLATED SALES, REVENUE</p><p>Whitman on Tuesday stood by Autonomy's technology and products, saying the unit would still be the growth engine for HP. The sprawling company, which employs more than 300,000 people globally, aims to focus more on enterprise services in the mould of International Business Machines Corp.</p><p>But the former eBay CEO and California gubernatorial candidate has yet to overcome years of management turmoil and strategic missteps, including a plan to sell the personal computer unit that was later dropped.</p><p>HP disclosed the Autonomy allegations in conjunction with its fourth-quarter earnings, which showed a 6.7 per cent decline in revenues as well as a $6.85 billion loss.</p><p>It took $8.8 billion in charges in the quarter, with over $5 billion tied to the problems at Autonomy. The rest of the charge related to the \"recent trading value of HP stock and headwinds against anticipated synergies and marketplace performance,\" HP said without elaborating.</p><p>HP had embarked on its own internal investigation, including a forensic review of Autonomy's historical results by PricewaterhouseCoopers and HP General Counsel John Schultz.</p><p>It accuses Autonomy's former management of inflating revenue and gross margins to mislead potential buyers. It said Autonomy executives mischaracterized revenue from low-end hardware sales as software sales and booked some licensing deals with partners as revenue, even though no customer bought products.</p><p>It said Autonomy claimed its gross margins were in the 40 to 45 per cent range while realistically they were in the 28 to 30 per cent range.</p><p>Moreover, Autonomy always represented itself as a software firm but 10 per cent to 15 per cent of its revenue came from money-losing sales of low-end hardware, HP said.</p><p>The company also claimed that Autonomy was booking licensing revenue upfront before deals closed.</p><p>Schultz said since the accounting troubles occurred prior to the acquisition of Autonomy, it took a long time before HP was in a position to make the news public.</p><p>\"Not surprisingly, Autonomy did not have sitting on a shelf somewhere a set of well-maintained books that would walk you through what was actually happening from a financial perspective inside the company,\" he said. \"Indeed critical documents were missing from the obvious places, and it required that we look in every nook and cranny.\"</p><p>Yet there had been rumblings in the industry for years that Autonomy's results might not be quite what they seemed.</p><p>As early as 2009, hedge fund manager Jim Chanos had identified Autonomy as a shorting opportunity, according to a source familiar with his views.</p><p>Chief among his concerns, according to the source, was that Autonomy was claiming a 40 per cent market share against the likes of Microsoft Corp, International Business Machines Corp and EMC Corp in the field of e-discovery.</p><p>Autonomy's stated margins of around 50 per cent did not seem to translate proportionately into cash flow; and it was reporting double-digit organic growth in software license revenue while rivals battled shrinking sales, the person said.</p><p>During a presentation a few weeks ago entitled 'Faking Reported Income 101' at the Santangel's Investor Forum in New York, hedge fund manager John Hempton of Sydney, Australia-based Bronte Capital highlighted items on Autonomy's balance sheet that raised his concerns.</p><p>\"Is it odd that in a software company you have receivables of 4.5 months? Or that deferred revenue is under half receivables?\" asked Hempton, who has a short position on HP.</p><p>Last year, software firm Oracle Corp said it had looked at Autonomy but passed on it.</p><p>Whitman said Tuesday that her predecessor, Apotheker, and former Chief Strategy and Technology Officer Shane Robison were the key people behind the Autonomy acquisition. Robison left shortly after Apotheker was ousted in September 2010.</p><p>In a statement, Apotheker said he was \"stunned and disappointed\" by the revelations and offered to help HP and the authorities to get to the bottom of the matter.</p><p>Robert Enderle, a tech analyst at the Enderle Group, said he has never seen such a potential misrepresentation of financials.</p><p>\"You have to rely on what the firm gives you during due diligence and I've never seen a misstatement at this level,\" Enderle said.</p><p>If the charges are true, it could result in a huge punitive damages award for HP, Enderle said.</p><p>But Darren Robbins, a San Diego-based plaintiff lawyer who represents shareholders, said he fielded several calls on Tuesday from institutional investors about HP. The tech icon spent billions on a company without undertaking proper due diligence, Robbins said.</p><p>Other analysts hoped it was the end of the bad news for HP.</p><p>\"This kind of feels like the last of the bad news,\" Forrester analyst Frank Gillett said.</p><p>In announcing its quarterly results, HP said net revenue fell to $29.96 billion for the quarter ended Oct. 31, from $32.12 billion a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had expected $30.43 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</p><p>Revenue from its main business units declined, with the personal computer division recording the steepest drop at 14 per cent. Revenue from printing fell 5 per cent.</p><p>HP reported a quarterly net loss of $3.49 a share, versus a profit of $239 million, or 12 cents, a year earlier.</p><p>\u00a9 Copyright (c) The Montreal Gazette</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANWNS-155078009PBN_</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANWNS2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:574G-M881-JDK3-94G4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">335915</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-12-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1638\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Postmedia Breaking News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Postmedia Breaking News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"11\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>November 21, 2012 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That's 33 percent higher than last week's bid of $18 a share by Texas-based Dell Computer Inc. 3PAR's shares rocketed nearly 45 percent higher Monday, jumping $8.05 to finish at $26.09.
