A pandemic scenario had been raised as a possibility in previous economic policy discussions, but none of us had a meaningful sense of what it would look like on the ground and what it would mean for the economy.\"</p><p>That's some statement: \"None of us\" had a sense of what such a pandemic might impose on the world economy. It's not clear who is included in the collective \"us,\" but it seems fair to assume the IMF is referring to the host of other members of the global fraternity of institutions that have assumed the role of guardians of the stability of the global financial system.</p><p>Among the institutions that should have been preparing for and assessing the risks of a global viral pandemic, in addition to the IMF, are the Financial Stability Board, the Bank for International Settlements, the G20 assembly of finance ministers, the World Bank and the European Central Bank.</p><p>In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, which \"none of us\" had anticipated, these global entities and national authorities adopted \"macroprudential policy\" to prevent the next global financial meltdown and, if possible, prepare plans to deal with a new blow to global financial stability.</p><p>Wikipedia has an excellent and authoritative review of the origins of macroprudentialism, describing it as an \"approach to financial regulation that aims to mitigate risk to the financial system as a whole.\" In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, policy-makers and economic researchers backed the need to reorient the global regulatory framework \"towards a macroprudential perspective.\"</p><p>As the world sinks into lockdown and decline, one wonders why the whole macroprudential policy preparations, underway since the 2008 financial crisis and formally installed in 2016, so obviously failed to prepare for the financial stability shakeup brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic? There are two explanations. One is that the whole financial stability-macroprudential effort is an international bureaucratic collection of agencies dedicated to the pursuit of meaningless bureaucratic interventions.</p><p>The second explanation is that the macroprudential apparatus, from the IMF through to the FSB and down, was hijacked by activists pushing climate change as the dominant systemic risk of our time.</p><p>In 2017, Mark Carney, then Bank of England governor and head of the FSB, reviewed the successes of macroprudential policy and highlighted new risks. The FSB, said Carney, is assessing \"emerging vulnerabilities affecting the global financial system ... within a macroprudential perspective.\" Among the risks identified, he said, were \"risks from Fintech, climate-related financial risks and misconduct in financial institutions.\"</p><p>Carney has been something of a poster boy for climate change. In a 2015 speech at Lloyd's of London - titled \"Breaking the tragedy of the horizon - climate change and financial stability,\" Carney warned the insurance industry to prepare for big climate risks - including defaults, lawsuits, stranded assets and increased liabilities related to a changing climate.</p><p>The insurance execs picked up the macroprudential warnings. The replacement of pandemic risks with climate change as a threat to the global financial and economic system was highlighted this week by Roger Pielke Jr. at the University of Colorado. In 2008, the No. 1 risk cited by insurance executives was a pandemic, described as \"a new highly infectious and fatal disease spreads through the human population.\" In 2019, the top risk was identified as \"global temperature change.\" Pandemic was not even one of the top-10 insurance risks.</p><p>Over the past several years, but especially through 2019, the major efforts of the macroprudes has been to spread alarm about the financial stability risks allegedly building around climate change. Never mind pandemics and other more mundane but genuine financial risks, such a soaring government debt buildup and U.S. political schemes to dismantle Big Tech. Instead, banks and other financial institutions have been pressed to get out of fossil fuels and shift into ethical investing, sustainable financing, green financing, social financing, impact investing, ESG investment, responsible investing.</p><p>At the turn of the 2020 New Year, Carney appeared on BBC television calling for \"action on financing\" from banks against fossil investments. One day later, the Communist government in China informed the World Health Organization of pneumonia cases in Wuhan City, Hubei province, with unknown cause. Carney's get-out-of oil call caused alarm within Canada's fossil fuel industry. At the time, oil was trading at US$55 a barrel. On Tuesday, thanks in part to the pandemic Carney and the macroprudes failed to plan for, West Texas crude continued to languish at just above US$20.</p><p>By promoting the risks of far-off climate change and ignoring the real financial and economic risks of a pandemic, the macroprudes got what they wanted by helping to usher in a global economic crisis they claimed to be attempting to prevent. !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

There is a lot of water to flow under the bridge before that happens and America really has to think about, does it want to cripple its technology companies when its in a battle with China?,\" he said. Mr Douglass oversees $100 billion of investments for Magellan, including stakes in Facebook and Google.</p><p>Tensions between western governments and China have escalated in recent months over matters including the imposition of national security laws in Hong Kong and the rejection of its flagship telecommunications provider Huawei from 5G networks around the world. But there has also been a groundswell of support for greater regulation of the tech giants inside America and in other western countries including Australia.</p><p>Major US political figures including former Democratic Presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have called for the tech firms to be broken up to boost competition. Australian competition regulator Rod Sims this week launched fresh legal action against Google over the way it collects user data and has spoken forcefully about anti-competitive behaviour by digital giants.</p><p>\"I don't think [politicians] can break them up under current anti-trust law. They'll need a change to antitrust law. Getting anything through [Congress] pre-elections is very unlikely and then it will depend on who runs the White House, who runs the Senate...and America has to decide what is in its best interests,\" Mr Douglass said.</p><p>The chief executives of Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple are all fronting a US House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee this week.</p><p>The hearing coincides with the release of the four tech giants' second quarter earnings, which will be made public in the next two days and will give investors an indication of the full impact of the coronavirus pandemic on these businesses.</p><p>Locally Google and Facebook are waiting on the release of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's draft code of conduct, which will seek to make the tech giants pay news publishers for their content.</p><p>Mr Douglass said that while regulation around privacy and content was inevitable, more regulation would not hurt big tech company share prices.</p><p>\"I think in the end we will get more regulation around privacy and some of those content issues ... that's inevitable.

There is a lot of water to flow under the bridge before that happens and America really has to think about, does it want to cripple its technology companies when its in a battle with China?,\" he said. Mr Douglass oversees $100 billion of investments for Magellan, including stakes in Facebook and Google.</p><p>Tensions between western governments and China have escalated in recent months over matters including the imposition of national security laws in Hong Kong and the rejection of its flagship telecommunications provider Huawei from 5G networks around the world. But there has also been a groundswell of support for greater regulation of the tech giants inside America and in other western countries including Australia.</p><p>Major US political figures including former Democratic Presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have called for the tech firms to be broken up to boost competition. Australian competition regulator Rod Sims this week launched fresh legal action against Google over the way it collects user data and has spoken forcefully about anti-competitive behaviour by digital giants.</p><p>\"I don't think [politicians] can break them up under current anti-trust law. They'll need a change to antitrust law. Getting anything through [Congress] pre-elections is very unlikely and then it will depend on who runs the White House, who runs the Senate...and America has to decide what is in its best interests,\" Mr Douglass said.</p><p>The chief executives of Amazon, Facebook, Google and Apple are all fronting a US House Judiciary antitrust subcommittee this week.</p><p>The hearing coincides with the release of the four tech giants' second quarter earnings, which will be made public in the next two days and will give investors an indication of the full impact of the coronavirus pandemic on these businesses.</p><p>Locally Google and Facebook are waiting on the release of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's draft code of conduct, which will seek to make the tech giants pay news publishers for their content.</p><p>Mr Douglass said that while regulation around privacy and content was inevitable, more regulation would not hurt big tech company share prices.</p><p>\"I think in the end we will get more regulation around privacy and some of those content issues ... that's inevitable. But the tech companies want better ground rules set for them, they are not resisting that.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc7bnj8lwwdbk1a8ldl7un</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G3-9YV1-F0J6-J2DS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"502\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sydney Morning Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Another \u00a34billion or so was added to the Bezos wallet. </p><p>Yet the rise in value of the tech giants was all the more astonishing because it came just hours after their chief executives were grilled on Capitol Hill about their alleged abuse of monopoly power and global dominance. </p><p>Perhaps just as well that the results did not come out until a day after the hearing, on what was dubbed 'Super Thursday' so the congressmen were not armed with fresh proof of just how powerful and profitable they are. </p><p>And the fact all four reported on the same day meant none could be singled out. Strength in unity, as the saying goes. </p><p>As it was, Apple's Tim Cook, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Alphabet's Sundar Pichai and Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg squirmed and struggled to defend themselves during what was a combative hearing in which they did not for once have all the slick answers.</p><p>Zuckerberg admitted to 'neutralising' rivals, and has already described his purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram as a 'digital land grab'. </p><p>Even Bezos sweated when asked about a bookseller being taken out by his Amazonian beast. </p><p>What a land grab it is. The four horsemen control nearly all that we do on the internet: selling apps, sending messages, pestering us with ads, stealing news, answering people's questions and buying just about everything one wants. </p><p>This is extraordinary power. Fortunately, the US politicians are serious about discovering how this power works, how it is wielded and if necessary cracking down on their reach. </p><p>The sub-committee of the House Judiciary Committee has been investigating their dominance over the internet for a year now, and came well prepared with ammunition to show how the tech titans have been responsible for bullying and destroying small businesses. </p><p>That's on top of charges that big tech controls how we are surveilled and our data manipulated, that Facebook spreads misinformation and censors, while Amazon handles laundered goods. </p><p>But what should the policymakers do? Should the big tech behemoths be broken up in the same way Theodore Roosevelt took the axe to Standard Oil and the telephone companies in the 1920s? Or can their power be reined in by higher taxes and stiffer regulation? </p><p>It's a daunting dilemma. On the one hand, there is a strong argument that the West should support rather than demonise these great success stories, because the real threat is China. Nearly half of the world's biggest online firms - including Alibaba and JD.com - are Chinese, and they are growing fast. </p><p>There is another point. Would breaking them up benefit the customer? As most of us could testify, going through lockdown without Facetime on our mobile phones and Amazon to shop online may have been tougher still. </p><p>But not impossible. As we also saw during lockdown, small business owners snapped into action and came up with the most enterprising solutions. Now what we need is a fairer environment in which smaller social media outlets or online retailers can compete before being crushed by the big guns. </p><p>How can a more level playing field be achieved? Well, US politicians should look to the Australian government for inspiration. It has announced plans to force Google and Facebook to pay news outlets for content in an attempt to prevent the country's media from being ravaged. </p><p>If they don't pay, the Australian regulators will fine them hundreds of millions of dollars. Facebook and Google have already threatened to walk away rather than pay for news. Good. Let them walk. </p><p>Unusually, there is cross-party support for change. Both the Republicans and Democrats want to see big tech reformed, to varying degrees and for different reasons. </p><p>But don't hold your breath, certainly not until after the November US elections. Which is why the share prices of the big tech corporations largely stormed ahead after their results. Investors take the view that the regulators will not be cracking down any time soon. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-64882298</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GJ-JJX1-F021-62CS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"752\"/><timeReceived>5:58 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

For much of that time, tech pretty much got a free ride. Journalists and elected officials were in awe of what Apple, Microsoft, Yahoo and other tech companies had accomplish and were optimistic about what the future might be.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There were some anti-trust hearings and an eventual trial over Microsoft's domination of personal computing and the fear that that would carry over to the internet. But for the most part, politicians were either ignorant or positive when it came to tech. The word \"big tech\" was not a major part of our vocabulary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fast forward to 2019 when politicians from both sides of the aisle seem almost obsessed with potential problems arising from tech companies. The president and his allies claim that Twitter, Google and Facebook are biased against conservatives while Democrats complain about how these platforms were illegitimately used by Russia to tilt the 2016 election in favor of Donald Trump. Both sides complain about privacy, and there are people across the political spectrum who agree that tech needs to be regulated, even if they can't agree on hardly anything else.</p><p>Tech was very much on the agenda at Tuesday night's Democratic debate as candidates responded to questions from New York Times national editor Marc Lacey as well as each other.</p><p>Lacey began by asking Andrew Yang if he agreed with Sen. Elizabeth Warren's call to break up companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google. Yang agreed that \"Senator Warren is 100 percent right in diagnosing the problem,\" but diverged on solutions, pointing out that \"we also have to be realistic that competition doesn't solve all the problems. It's not like any of us wants to use the fourth best navigation app. That would be like cruel and unusual punishment. There is a reason why no one is using Bing today.\" He went on to say \"it's not like breaking up these big tech companies will revive Main Street businesses around the country\" and \"Breaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier,\" after claiming that \"Studies clearly show that we're seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use.\"</p><p>Warren retorted that competition isn't working. \"About 8 percent, 9 percent of all retail sales happen at bricks and sticks stores, happen at Walmart. About 49 percent of all sales online happen in one place: that's Amazon,\" she said. I fact-checked her numbers, and she's not far off. Warren added, \"It collects information from every little business, and then Amazon does something else. It runs the platform, gets all the information, and then goes into competition with those little businesses.\"</p><p>Tom Steyer agreed that tech companies \"either have to be broken up or regulated,\" but then turned his attention to why he could beat President Trump - a useful pitch for Democratic voters, but not very helpful when it came to the key question.</p><p>Corey Booker said \"we have a massive crisis in our democracy with the way these tech companies are being used, not just in terms of anti-competitive practices, but also to undermine our democracy,\" adding\u00a0 \"we need regulation and reform.\"</p><p>I agree with Beto O'Rorke's first comment that \"we need to set very tough, very clear, transparent rules of the road,\" but not with his assertion that tech companies like Facebook are \"more akin to a publisher. They curate the content that we see.\"</p><p>While it is true that algorithms used by Facebook and other social media companies help surface what people see, the content itself is generated from users, not from journalists or other professionals who work for and report to the companies. The problem with O'Rourke's claim is that classifying social media companies as publishers means they are responsible for everything on their platform, which could have a chilling effect on the free speech of their users. The only way Facebook could vet and verify everything anyone posted would be to hire thousands of editors to read every post and decide whether it was a valid opinion or a true fact, just as newspapers do for everything from reporter generated stories to op-eds. Even letters to the editors go through an editing process before they're printed in most newspapers, which holds them to different standards than what people can post on online forums or social media. That's not to say they shouldn't remove posts that violate their terms of service, but making that a requirement could have unintended consequences.</p><p>Kamala Harris used the tech question to take a shot at Elizabeth Warren, asking her to back her demand that \"Twitter suspend Donald Trump's account.\" Warren, who is taking a lot more incoming now that she's one of the top contenders, wouldn't take the bait, and I don't blame her. While it's very true that Donald Trump has used Twitter to make mean comments and spread false information, it's also true that - whether you like him or not - he's president of the United States and what he says is - for that reason alone - newsworthy. There are lines that even public officials shouldn't cross, but it's right for Twitter to give him and other politicians a platform and to continue to give any other Twitter users the right to comment, respond and express their reaction to what the president posts.</p><p>In June, Twitter<url normalizedValue=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/publicinterest.html'\">announced a policy</url> to \"place a notice - a screen you have to click or tap through before you see the tweet - to provide additional context and clarity,\" whenever a public official posts a tweet that \"would otherwise be in violation of our rules.\"</p><p>Although I've expressed my thoughts on what was said Tuesday night, I'm not taking sides in the primary or the election, but\u00a0 - along with many in Silicon Valley and across the country - I will be watching to see how the candidates grapple with the very real issues of how tech is affecting our lives, our economy and our democracy.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/10/17/juul-halts-sales-of-fruit-dessert-flavors-for-e-cigarettes/\">           Juul halts sales of fruit, dessert flavors for e-cigarettes       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/10/17/hbos-silicon-valley-hosts-premiere-party-in-san-francisco/\">HBO's 'Silicon Valley' hosts premiere party in San Francisco       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/10/17/campbell-proposed-in-n-out-loses-in-3-2-vote/\">           Campbell: Proposed In-N-Out loses in 3-2 vote       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/10/17/photos-ex-uber-exec-selling-tiburon-mansion-for-8-6m/\">           Photos: Ex-Uber exec selling Tiburon mansion for $8.6M       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2019/10/17/mark-zuckerberg-insists-facebook-supports-more-free-speech-not-less/\">           Mark Zuckerberg insists Facebook supports more free speech, not less       </url></p><p>Larry Magid is a tech journalist and internet safety activist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Larry Magid\u00a0</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNTRCT-6572481</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNTRCT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X93-F351-F0C5-X2DT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313958</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1092\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The East Bay Times (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 17, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But for the most part, politicians were either ignorant or positive when it came to tech. The word \"big tech\" was not a major part of our vocabulary.</p><p>Fast forward to 2019 when politicians from both sides of the aisle seem almost obsessed with potential problems arising from tech companies. The president and his allies claim that Twitter, Google and Facebook are biased against conservatives while Democrats complain about how these platforms were illegitimately used by Russia to tilt the 2016 election in favor of Donald Trump. Both sides complain about privacy, and there are people across the political spectrum who agree that tech needs to be regulated, even if they can't agree on hardly anything else.</p><p>Tech was very much on the agenda at Tuesday night's Democratic debate as candidates responded to questions from New York Times national editor Marc Lacey as well as each other.</p><p>Lacey began by asking Andrew Yang if he agreed with Sen. Elizabeth Warren's call to break up companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google. Yang agreed that \"Senator Warren is 100 percent right in diagnosing the problem,\" but diverged on solutions, pointing out that \"we also have to be realistic that competition doesn't solve all the problems. It's not like any of us wants to use the fourth best navigation app. That would be like cruel and unusual punishment. There is a reason why no one is using Bing today.\" He went on to say \"it's not like breaking up these big tech companies will revive Main Street businesses around the country\" and \"Breaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier,\" after claiming that \"Studies clearly show that we're seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use.\"</p><p>Warren retorted that competition isn't working. \"About 8 percent, 9 percent of all retail sales happen at bricks and sticks stores, happen at Walmart. About 49 percent of all sales online happen in one place: that's Amazon,\" she said. I fact-checked her numbers, and she's not far off. Warren added, \"It collects information from every little business, and then Amazon does something else. It runs the platform, gets all the information, and then goes into competition with those little businesses.\"</p><p>Tom Steyer agreed that tech companies \"either have to be broken up or regulated,\" but then turned his attention to why he could beat President Trump - a useful pitch for Democratic voters, but not very helpful when it came to the key question.</p><p>Corey Booker said \"we have a massive crisis in our democracy with the way these tech companies are being used, not just in terms of anti-competitive practices, but also to undermine our democracy,\" adding\u00a0 \"we need regulation and reform.\"</p><p>I agree with Beto O'Rorke's first comment that \"we need to set very tough, very clear, transparent rules of the road,\" but not with his assertion that tech companies like Facebook are \"more akin to a publisher. They curate the content that we see.\"</p><p>While it is true that algorithms used by Facebook and other social media companies help surface what people see, the content itself is generated from users, not from journalists or other professionals who work for and report to the companies. The problem with O'Rourke's claim is that classifying social media companies as publishers means they are responsible for everything on their platform, which could have a chilling effect on the free speech of their users. The only way Facebook could vet and verify everything anyone posted would be to hire thousands of editors to read every post and decide whether it was a valid opinion or a true fact, just as newspapers do for everything from reporter generated stories to op-eds. Even letters to the editors go through an editing process before they're printed in most newspapers, which holds them to different standards than what people can post on online forums or social media. That's not to say they shouldn't remove posts that violate their terms of service, but making that a requirement could have unintended consequences.</p><p>Kamala Harris used the tech question to take a shot at Elizabeth Warren, asking her to back her demand that \"Twitter suspend Donald Trump's account.\" Warren, who is taking a lot more incoming now that she's one of the top contenders, wouldn't take the bait, and I don't blame her. While it's very true that Donald Trump has used Twitter to make mean comments and spread false information, it's also true that - whether you like him or not - he's president of the United States and what he says is - for that reason alone - newsworthy. There are lines that even public officials shouldn't cross, but it's right for Twitter to give him and other politicians a platform and to continue to give any other Twitter users the right to comment, respond and express their reaction to what the president posts.</p><p>In June, Twitter<url normalizedValue=\"https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2019/publicinterest.html'\">announced a policy</url> to \"place a notice - a screen you have to click or tap through before you see the tweet - to provide additional context and clarity,\" whenever a public official posts a tweet that \"would otherwise be in violation of our rules.\"</p><p>Although I've expressed my thoughts on what was said Tuesday night, I'm not taking sides in the primary or the election, but\u00a0 - along with many in Silicon Valley and across the country - I will be watching to see how the candidates grapple with the very real issues of how tech is affecting our lives, our economy and our democracy.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/10/17/juul-halts-sales-of-fruit-dessert-flavors-for-e-cigarettes/\">           Juul halts sales of fruit, dessert flavors for e-cigarettes       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/10/17/hbos-silicon-valley-hosts-premiere-party-in-san-francisco/\">HBO's 'Silicon Valley' hosts premiere party in San Francisco       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/10/17/campbell-proposed-in-n-out-loses-in-3-2-vote/\">           Campbell: Proposed In-N-Out loses in 3-2 vote       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/10/17/photos-ex-uber-exec-selling-tiburon-mansion-for-8-6m/\">           Photos: Ex-Uber exec selling Tiburon mansion for $8.6M       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/10/17/mark-zuckerberg-insists-facebook-supports-more-free-speech-not-less/\">           Mark Zuckerberg insists Facebook supports more free speech, not less       </url></p><p>Larry Magid is a tech journalist and internet safety activist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Larry Magid\u00a0(Gary Reyes / Mercury News)</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SJMRCN-6537741</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SJMRCN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X93-F351-F0C5-X2FT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313960</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1152\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Mercury News (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 17, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But it's an example of how governments and big tech companies can come together to agree on how to solve a thorny and sometimes controversial issue.</p><p>As an internet safety advocate (I'm CEO of ConnectSafely.org, which receives support from tech companies including Google and Facebook), I agree with the Christchurch Call's efforts to curtail violent extremism and Im also good with Facebook terminating the accounts of known violent, racist, hateful, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic individuals including Alex Jones and Louis Farrakhan. But as a journalist and an ACLU member, I'm also a strong advocate of free speech and worried about any efforts to limit it, even when that speech is unpleasant or downright vile.\u00a0 Battle over speech issues are almost always about topics that make at least some people very uncomfortable. Courts are sometimes called on to rule over issues like pornography, hate speech and even speech that could possibly lead to violence, but I have yet to hear about a court case regarding cat videos, however annoying they may be to some people.</p><p>Private vs. government rules</p><p>Having said that, I'm OK with voluntary guidelines when it comes to certain types of online content, especially if it incites or celebrates violence as long as it's at the discretion of the platforms that host the content. \u00a0But I admit that it can be a slippery slope, and when governments get involved, it's important to limit suppression of speech that is clearly associated with real-world dangers such as child pornography and yelling fire in a crowded theater.</p><p>The key issue here is the role of government. In the United States, our precious First Amendment applies to government, not the private sector. You have the right to say almost anything you want if you're standing on the sidewalk in front of my house, but if you start spouting racist, sexist, homophobic or anti-Semitic propaganda in my living room, I have the right to show you the door. Companies like Facebook and Google also have that right and - one could argue - responsibility to protect their communities from vile content.</p><p>It's also important to note that the U.S. First Amendment doesn't apply to other countries. As much as we may not like it, Americans can't prevent countries like China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Russia from censoring what their citizens can say, read, hear, view or access online. Even our more liberal European allies that do allow for free expression have laws that might not make it past our Supreme Court, such as banning Nazi paraphernalia and propaganda.

But it's an example of how governments and big tech companies can come together to agree on how to solve a thorny and sometimes controversial issue.</p><p>As an internet safety advocate (I'm CEO of ConnectSafely.org, which receives support from tech companies including Google and Facebook), I agree with the Christchurch Call's efforts to curtail violent extremism and Im also good with Facebook terminating the accounts of known violent, racist, hateful, anti-Semitic, Islamophobic individuals including Alex Jones and Louis Farrakhan. But as a journalist and an ACLU member, I'm also a strong advocate of free speech and worried about any efforts to limit it, even when that speech is unpleasant or downright vile.\u00a0 Battle over speech issues are almost always about topics that make at least some people very uncomfortable. Courts are sometimes called on to rule over issues like pornography, hate speech and even speech that could possibly lead to violence, but I have yet to hear about a court case regarding cat videos, however annoying they may be to some people.</p><p>Private vs. government rules</p><p>Having said that, I'm OK with voluntary guidelines when it comes to certain types of online content, especially if it incites or celebrates violence as long as it's at the discretion of the platforms that host the content. \u00a0But I admit that it can be a slippery slope, and when governments get involved, it's important to limit suppression of speech that is clearly associated with real-world dangers such as child pornography and yelling fire in a crowded theater.</p><p>The key issue here is the role of government. In the United States, our precious First Amendment applies to government, not the private sector. You have the right to say almost anything you want if you're standing on the sidewalk in front of my house, but if you start spouting racist, sexist, homophobic or anti-Semitic propaganda in my living room, I have the right to show you the door. Companies like Facebook and Google also have that right and - one could argue - responsibility to protect their communities from vile content.</p><p>It's also important to note that the U.S. First Amendment doesn't apply to other countries. As much as we may not like it, Americans can't prevent countries like China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Russia from censoring what their citizens can say, read, hear, view or access online. Even our more liberal European allies that do allow for free expression have laws that might not make it past our Supreme Court, such as banning Nazi paraphernalia and propaganda. Some of the symbols on display at the white nationalists Charlottesville march would have been prohibited in Germany and some other European countries which experienced the horror of Nazi rule.</p><p>Because its voluntary, I think the U.S should have signed the Christchurch Call, but I understand the principle behind the Trump administration's decision not to sign. Its hard to argue against the administration's statement that \"the best tool to defeat terrorist speech is productive speech.\" Counter speech has long been the recommended antidote for hate speech and, in some ways, I'm impressed that someone in the White House understands that.</p><p>Facebooks new one-strike policy</p><p>I'm not sure if it was a coincidence, but the Christchurch Call came the same day that Facebook announced it would institute a \"one strike policy,\" temporarily blocking anyone from Facebook Live (its live streaming feature) if they share a link to a statement from a terrorist group with no context.\u00a0 Like the Christchurch Call, this decision by Facebook is in the wake of the massacre at the Christchurch mosque where the gunman live-streamed his murderous attack.

And while I didn't stand in the rain to hear Trump speak, I did attend presentations by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President Emanuel Macron.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In addition to commemorating the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I and the Paris Peace Forum, Macron and Trudeau also participated in Paris Digital Week. I was in town to speak at the U.N.'s Internet Governance Forum (IGF) and the GovTech Summit</p><p>Trudeau spoke at the GovTech Summit, where entrepreneurs from around Europe met with government leaders to discuss how the tech sector and government can work together. Macron spoke at the Internet Governance Forum's opening ceremony.</p><p>Both leaders talked about the need for government to engage with tech companies to confront online challenges such as misinformation (aka 'fake news'), foreign meddling in elections, extremism, divisiveness and harassment. But Trudeau also stressed the need for citizens to protect themselves \"You can't cross the street and think that traffic laws will protect you, he said. He called on leaders to \"start with honest real direct conversations and not give into the type of fear mongering and polarization that's all too familiar in politics.\"</p><p>Without mentioning the name of his counterpart to the south, Trudeau did express thoughts about how politicians should and shouldn't use social media. He said that it can be a very good way to reach out to constituents and is more direct and immediate than issuing a press statement. But, he's not a fan of using it to \"push someone into being angry.\" He added, \"if it ends up in a screaming match between one side versus the other side, whoever is better at nasty is going to win.</p><p>Macron's speech was unlike any I've heard from a head of state in my many years of attending the IGF and other international conferences. Rather than the typical \"welcome to my country and have a great conference,\" it was an actual policy speech aimed at the technology industry and the government officials and activists in the audience. And it wasn't sugar-coated. After a few typical platitudes about the great opportunities ushered in by the internet, he launched into a critical appraisal of the negative aspects of cyberspace and called for increased government regulation.</p><p>\"The internet is obviously under threat, he said, pointing to the effects of state-sponsored and criminal cyberattacks, extremism and authoritarian governments along with hate speech and online harassment. He even touched on the controversial issue of anonymity, \"which must continue to allow freedom of expression, but must not allow criminals or terrorists to avoid prosecution.</p><p>Acknowledging that some would push back, he nevertheless advocated that governments regulate the internet, not in an authoritarian way, but in a way that includes all stakeholders.</p><p>My favorite line was his contrast between the California internet and the Chinese internet,\" drawing a distinction between the extremes of a strong government regulation in China and Silicon Valley's tradition of wanting the internet to be self-governing and free of almost all government regulation. He wants a middle ground with government playing a major role, in cooperation with industry and advocacy groups.\u00a0What we need to do is learn to regulate together.\"</p><p>Macron also spoke about the Paris Call for Trust and Security in Cyberspace, which was signed by 51 countries and endorsed by multiple companies including Facebook, Google, Microsoft, HP and IBM. It was not, however, signed by the U.S., Russia or China.</p><p>The vaguely worded non-binding agreement reaffirms support for \"an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful cyberspace,\" asserting that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online. It also reaffirms the \"applicability of international human rights law in cyberspace.\" It condemns \"malicious cyber activities in peacetime,\" and calls for \"collaboration among governments, the private sector and civil society to create new cybersecurity standards that enable infrastructures and organizations to improve cyber protections.\"</p><p>And, in a nod to the concerns raised by foreign interference into elections in the U.S., Brazil, the UK and elsewhere, it promises to \"strengthen our capacity to prevent ... interference by foreign actors aimed at undermining electoral processes through malicious cyber activities.\"</p><p>A few years ago, a speech like this from a western head of state would have been strongly condemned by many in Silicon Valley who believed that the role of government was to keep its hands off the internet. Indeed, there is still worry about clumsy government rules or micromanagement of an industry that sprints more like a gazelle than the snail-pace of governments that would regulate it. \u00a0But that doesn't mean that government should have no role. It is the responsibility of government to set broad rules and to hold all of us - including big tech companies - accountable. Government shouldn't tell companies what type of technology to build, but they can establish general principals and, in the words of Justin Trudeau, \"traffic laws\" to help protect us.</p><p>Larry Magid is a tech journalist and internet safety activist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNTRCT-5821618</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNTRCT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TRG-2FB1-JCX4-62PC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313958</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-11-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"880\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The East Bay Times (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"11\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>November 15, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lifestyle</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Advice</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Larry Magid</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lifestyle Columnists</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Personal Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000093</classCode><className>ANNIVERSARIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DHON</classCode><className>FRENCH PRESIDENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp;

That includes ads from candidates and issue ads. Twitter will continue to accept ads that encourage voter registration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dorsey said that \"political message reach should be earned, not bought\" adding \"some might argue our actions today could favor incumbents, but we have witnessed many social movements reach massive scale without any political advertising.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/11/08/magid-its-about-time-we-had-more-control-over-our-data/\">           Magid: It's about time we had more control over our data       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/10/23/magid-hands-on-with-googles-new-pixel-4-and-pixel-4-xl-phones/\">           Magid: Hands-on with Google's new Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL phones       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/10/17/magid-big-tech-a-big-subject-in-democratic-presidential-debate/\">           Magid: Big Tech center stage at Democratic presidential debate       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/10/11/magid-tech-companies-cause-but-could-help-cure-traffic-woes/\">           Magid: Tech companies cause, but could help cure, Bay Area traffic woes       </url></p><p>Dorsey has a point. While national political campaigns spend millions on TV ads, a strong candidate or a compelling issue with a strong following can quickly galvanize support. Look no further than the 2016 presidential election.\u00a0 Hillary Clinton's campaign and supportive PACs raised a total of $1.2 million compared with just under $648 million by Donald Trump and his allies. Yes, even though Clinton won the popular vote, Trump won where it counted - in the electoral college.\u00a0 I'm no political scientists but I have a feeling that Trump's passionate supporters made a big difference in allowing a political novice to outmaneuver a political veteran.</p><p>The Trump campaign also made effective use of social media, including Twitter and Facebook, and Trump continues to use Twitter in an almost constant stream of messaging to shore up his base. That may change in 2020 now that the Trump campaign is rolling in cash and depending on whom he runs against and whether that candidate can whip up enthusiasm.</p><p>Of course, there will be plenty of TV advertising, especially in swing states, so, regardless of what Twitter and other social media companies do, advertising will continue to play a major role in politics.</p><p>But taking ads off of social media does make some sense because of how easy they are to abuse - or at least were in 2016. It has long been illegal for foreigners to buy U.S. political ads, but there was at least one case when an ad was paid for in Russian currency (rubles), which is a pretty good clue that it wasn't coming from within the United States.</p><p>There were other examples of Russian and other foreign ad buys and there are plenty of ads with false information, most recently a Trump campaign ad that displayed a video that falsely implied that former Vice President Joe Biden had bragged about offering Ukrainian officials a billion dollars to drop a case against his son. The Biden campaign asked Facebook to remove that ad, but it refused. Katie Harbath, Facebook's head of global elections policy wrote to the Biden campaign \"our approach is grounded in Facebook's fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinized speech there is.\"</p><p>In a perfect social media world, Harbath would be right. In an open court of public opinion, people could easily push back against a candidate's or candidate supporters' false claims. But it's not an open court because Facebook's advertising algorithms target ads to people who are most likely to positively respond to them.</p><p>So, most people who saw that false ad were probably already on Trump's side and likely to approve of the message, perhaps unaware of its lack of truthfulness. And this isn't a one-sided issue. Liberal-minded Facebook users are much more likely to see ads for liberal candidates and causes than their conservative brethren.</p><p>The same is true with posts from users. People have a tendency to run in packs, and if you're on the far right or far left, there's a good chance that many if not most of the people you friend or follow have similar views. If so, you may be living in a thought bubble that not only reinforces your opinions but feeds you with \"facts\" that verify your view of the world, regardless of whether those \"facts\" are true.</p><p>TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based Bytedance, has also banned political ads in the United States. Last month, Blake Chandlee, TikTok's vice president of global business solutions, blogged, \"Any paid ads that come into the community need to fit the standards for our platform, and the nature of paid political ads is not something we believe fits the TikTok platform experience. To that end, we will not allow paid ads that promote or oppose a candidate, current leader, political party or group, or issue at the federal, state, or local level - including election-related ads, advocacy ads, or issue ads.\" TikTok's reasons are different from Twitter's. TikTok likes to encourage what Chandlee called a \"light-hearted and irreverent feeling that makes it such a fun place to spend time.\"</p><p>Beyond the issue of targeting or living in a social media world of like-minded friends and followers, there are broader concerns that Dorsey tweeted about as he announced Twitter's policy change \"Internet political ads present entirely new challenges to civic discourse: machine learning-based optimization of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes. All at increasing velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale.\" He also tweeted \"Ad transparency requirements are progress, but not enough. The internet provides entirely new capabilities, and regulators need to think past the present day to ensure a level playing field.\"</p><p>Dorsey is right. The power of algorithms and the nature of social media make it different from other platforms like newspapers, TV and radio. Both the tech industry and government regulators need to put some careful thought into how social media can play a positive role in our Democracy without being gamed and manipulated in ways that thwart the Democracy. There may be a place for ads on social media, but not until we re-think how they are being used.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/11/09/bay-area-students-and-teachers-rally-for-school-funding-and-prop-13-reform/\">           Bay Area students and teachers rally for school funding and Prop 13 reform       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/11/09/despite-fires-california-wine-is-doing-just-fine-for-now/\">           Despite fires, Northern California wine is doing just fine - for now       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/11/09/williams-sonoma-to-open-first-west-coast-home-outlet-store-in-power-plaza/\">Williams-Sonoma opens first West Coast home outlet store in North Bay       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/11/09/contra-costa-county-to-consider-banning-e-cigarette-sales/\">Contra Costa County to consider banning e-cigarette sales       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/11/09/debit-cards-replace-paper-checks-to-ease-shopping-reduce-stigma-in-government-funded-nutrition-program/\">California replaces paper checks with debit cards to ease shopping, reduce stigma, in government-funded nutrition program       </url></p><p>Disclosure: Larry Magid is CEO of ConnectSafely.org, a non-profit internet safety organization that receives support from Facebook and Twitter.\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Larry Magid\u00a0(Gary Reyes / Mercury News)</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SJMRCN-6581953</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SJMRCN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XDP-RT01-JCX4-60CS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313960</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1148\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Mercury News (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 3, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

For example, last year there were a lot of autonomous vehicles on display, and that's even more true this year. There were also some 8K TVs, but this year there are a lot more. In 2019, we saw fitness gadgets evolving into health and diagnostic tools and - like other trends that take hold -there are even more of them at the current exhibition.</p><p>Omron showed a combination blood pressure monitor and electrocardiogram tester for the home.</p><p>Last year, there were some sneak previews of foldable phones, but now there are real ones such as Samsung's Galaxy Fold, with Motorola's foldable new Razr slated to come out soon.</p><p>TV maker TCL showed off a prototype of its own foldable phone that it will likely release later this year.</p><p>But it's not just phones that fold. Lenovo showed off the X1 Fold, billed as the first foldable Windows PC. I got to play with an early prototype last year and was impressed at how they could make a PC fold like a book, but I'm not sure I want to spend $2,500 on one when it comes out later this year.</p><p>Dell, Asus and Microsoft also showed off foldable PCs, which are really hybrids between PCs and tablets. While I'm glad to see well-heeled companies experimenting with new form factors, I'm not convinced there will be much of a market for them, but time will tell.</p><p>The Alcatel 3L doesn't fold, but it does have a 48 megapixel camera at the astoundingly low price of $155, according to CNET. It will roll out in some countries this quarter, but it's not clear when or if it will come to the U.S.</p><p>TVs are always big at CES, and each year they get bigger. I remember when 55 inches was considered big, but now it's on the small side as an increasing number of consumers opt for 65-, 75-inch or larger TVs. But, each year, some company shows off a really really big TV like Samsung's 292-inch OLED display. That's 24 feet of TV. It's not yet for sale at any price, but if it were, it would cost tens of thousand of dollars plus the cost of having to either rebuild your living room - or perhaps your whole house - to accommodate it.</p><p>Speaking of big bucks, last year LG showed off a prototype of a rollable TV, and this year's it will go on sale for, according to CNET, $60,000.\u00a0 In some parts of the country, you could buy a house for that price. It reminds me of that movie screen my dad had that rolled down and out of the way, only this one rolls up from a cabinet and - since it's a TV - doesn't require a projector.</p><p>This year we saw a lot of health and fitness products including several designed to improve your dental health. I spent some time with a dentist working for Colgate who showed me a smart toothbrush that has sensors that detect \"biofilm buildup\" in the mouth, and through a companion smartphone, shows you where to focus your brushing. The company claims that it can prevent plaque, which can lead to gum and tooth problems.</p><p>As always there were some oddball products. Menta5 is a bicycle that you can ride on water. In a podcast interview, CEO Greg Johnston told me that the company has designed the first hydrofoil bike using hydrofoil technology and a propeller.\u00a0 Like most land e-bikes, there is an electric assist as well as pedals. One reason for the electric motor is to get enough speed to lift the body of the bike out of the water to reduce drag and increase efficiency.</p><p>The wackiest product at the show has to be the Charmin Rollbot, a bear-based robot that delivers toilet paper. I have to admit, I've been in a situation where this would have come in handy, but I'm not sure it's destined to be a real product. The Rollbot, along with a smell sensor of the bathroom, is a product of Charmin's \"GoLab.\" I kid you not.</p><p>I laughed when I saw the Samsung Ballie, but the rolling little robot, that looks like a tennis ball, may actually have some uses. It rolls around the house to entertain you, the kids and the dog and has a camera to check up on things. It can also follow you around the house and \"understands you, supports you and reacts to your needs to be actively helpful around the house,\" said Samsung co-CEO H.S. Kim, as he played with it during his CES keynote.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/18/bloomberg-breaking-big-tech/\">           Bloomberg says Warren, Sanders don't 'know what they're talking about' on breaking up big tech firms       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/18/california-sues-to-block-trump-administration-fracking-plans/\">California sues to block Trump administration fracking plans       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/18/uc-santa-cruz-student-invents-microplastics-eating-turtle/\">           UC Santa Cruz student invents microplastics-eating turtle       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/18/massive-oakland-airport-pot-smuggling-case-courier-avoids-additional-jail-time/\">           Massive Oakland airport pot smuggling case: Courier avoids additional jail time       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/01/18/hotel-de-anza-should-be-strong-enough-to-survive-pizarro/\">           Hotel De Anza should be strong enough to survive: Pizarro       </url></p><p>Larry Magid is a tech journalist and internet safety activist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Larry Magid\u00a0(Gary Reyes / Mercury News)</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SJMRCN-6785962</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SJMRCN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY7-T5J1-JCX4-60PF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313960</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1027\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Mercury News (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 10, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0001U7O</classCode><className>MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC000D3XE</classCode><className>SAMSUNG GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS334220 RADIO &amp;

It's not yet for sale at any price, but if it were, it would cost tens of thousand of dollars plus the cost of having to either rebuild your living room - or perhaps your whole house - to accommodate it.</p><p>Speaking of big bucks, last year LG showed off a prototype of a rollable TV, and this year's it will go on sale for, according to CNET, $60,000.\u00a0 In some parts of the country, you could buy a house for that price. It reminds me of that movie screen my dad had that rolled down and out of the way, only this one rolls up from a cabinet and - since it's a TV - doesn't require a projector.</p><p>This year we saw a lot of health and fitness products including several designed to improve your dental health. I spent some time with a dentist working for Colgate who showed me a smart toothbrush that has sensors that detect \"biofilm buildup\" in the mouth, and through a companion smartphone, shows you where to focus your brushing. The company claims that it can prevent plaque, which can lead to gum and tooth problems.</p><p>As always there were some oddball products. Menta5 is a bicycle that you can ride on water. In a podcast interview, CEO Greg Johnston told me that the company has designed the first hydrofoil bike using hydrofoil technology and a propeller.\u00a0 Like most land e-bikes, there is an electric assist as well as pedals. One reason for the electric motor is to get enough speed to lift the body of the bike out of the water to reduce drag and increase efficiency.</p><p>The wackiest product at the show has to be the Charmin Rollbot, a bear-based robot that delivers toilet paper. I have to admit, I've been in a situation where this would have come in handy, but I'm not sure it's destined to be a real product. The Rollbot, along with a smell sensor of the bathroom, is a product of Charmin's \"GoLab.\" I kid you not.</p><p>I laughed when I saw the Samsung Ballie, but the rolling little robot, that looks like a tennis ball, may actually have some uses. It rolls around the house to entertain you, the kids and the dog and has a camera to check up on things. It can also follow you around the house and \"understands you, supports you and reacts to your needs to be actively helpful around the house,\" said Samsung co-CEO H.S. Kim, as he played with it during his CES keynote.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/01/18/bloomberg-breaking-big-tech/\">           Bloomberg says Warren, Sanders don't 'know what they're talking about' on breaking up big tech firms       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/01/18/california-sues-to-block-trump-administration-fracking-plans/\">California sues to block Trump administration fracking plans       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/01/18/home-sale-prices-from-contra-costa-county-jan-18-2/\">           Home sale prices from Contra Costa County, Jan. 18       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/01/18/home-sale-prices-from-alameda-county-jan-18-2/\">           Home sale prices from Alameda County, Jan. 18       </url>               \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2020/01/18/uc-santa-cruz-student-invents-microplastics-eating-turtle/\">           UC Santa Cruz student invents microplastics-eating turtle       </url></p><p>Larry Magid is a tech journalist and internet safety activist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Larry Magid\u00a0</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNTRCT-6786367</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNTRCT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY7-4SX1-F0C5-X1SK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313958</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"969\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The East Bay Times (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 10, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001U7O</classCode><className>MOTOROLA SOLUTIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000D3XE</classCode><className>SAMSUNG GROUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS334220 RADIO &amp;

Facebook-owned Instagram was next at 37 percent,\u00a0 followed by Pinterest (28 percent), LinkedIn (27 percent), Snapchat (24 percent), Twitter (22 percent), Whatsapp (20 percent) and Reddit (11 percent). Facebook also owns Whatsapp, which gives the company three spots among the top nine services.</p><p>Social media companies have faced fierce criticism over the past couple of years over such issue as Russian interference, so-called fake news (both real and imagined), harmful content, bullying and mostly unsubstantiated claims of bias against conservatives.</p><p>Age and location matter</p><p>Age matters when it come to usage. As you might expect, Snapchat (73 percent) and Instagram (75 percent) do well with 18- to 24-year-olds, but so does Facebook, which is used by 79 percent of that age-group. But a lot of older people also use social media. Seven in 10 people between 50 and 64 use YouTube and so do 38 percent of people over 65. Facebook is used by 68 percent of people between 50 and 64 and nearly half (46 percent) of people over 65.</p><p>Only 3 percent of seniors over 65 use Snapchat while 7 percent of that age group uses Twitter.</p><p>Where you live also matters. Urban and suburban dwellers (26 percent) are twice as likely to use Twitter than people in rural areas (13 percent).\u00a0 There's more than a three-to-one gap for LinkedIn with 33 percent urban vs. 10 percent rural.\u00a0 But YouTube and Facebook usage is relative close among urban and rural dwellers at the rate of 77 percent urban vs. 66 percent rural for YouTube and 73 percent urban vs. 66 percent rural for Facebook.</p><p>Daily usage</p><p>Perhaps more important than whether one ever uses a service is whether they use it regularly and, despite all the controversies, Facebook users seem to be just as active now as they were in the past. Nearly three-quarters (74 percent) of Facebook users are on the service daily, which is identical to last year. About half (51 percent) say they use it \"several times a day.\" That compares with 61 percent of Instagram users who say they are on the app at least once a day with 42 percent saying they use it several times daily.\u00a0 Snapchat has similar numbers.\u00a0 Just over half (51 percent) of YouTube users are on the site daily up from 45 percent last year.</p><p>I was surprised to see that only 42 percent of Twitter users are on it daily with 25 percent saying they use it several times a day. I tend to think of Twitter as a place that people check into frequently but that may be mostly news junkies and journalist who are glued to the service. Apparently, most Twitter users are far more restrained on how often they check-in.</p><p>You can read a lot more about this survey on Pew's blog at\u00a0 <url normalizedValue=\"http://tinyurl.com/pewstudy2019\">tinyurl.com/pewstudy2019</url>.</p><p>Regulatory headwinds</p><p>The data is mostly good news for Facebook and perhaps one of the reasons why investors continue to value the company, whose stock, despite all the criticism, is outperforming the overall market so far this year. But any optimism about Facebook's future depends on its ability to solve some of the problems it's created for itself. Even though attrition has been minimal so far, there is a limit and users could reach a tipping point if Facebook suffers from too many more privacy breaches or horrendous news stories like those following the revelation that the New Zealand shooter used Facebook to live-broadcast his murder of 50 worshippers at a Christchurch mosque. It's almost a given that foreign-powers will use Facebook to try to influence the 2020 election but we don't yet know how well the company will be able to thwart those efforts.</p><p>Facebook clearly faces additional regulation in the U.S. and around the world. Social media companies are already having to adjust to more stringent privacy rules in Europe now that the General Data Privacy Regulation is in effect and here at home there are legislators on both sides of the aisle anxious to pass laws to rein in Facebook, YouTube and other social media companies. Even Mark Zuckerberg is calling for more regulation.

Facebook-owned Instagram was next at 37 percent,\u00a0 followed by Pinterest (28 percent), LinkedIn (27 percent), Snapchat (24 percent), Twitter (22 percent), Whatsapp (20 percent) and Reddit (11 percent). Facebook also owns Whatsapp, which gives the company three spots among the top nine services.</p><p>Social media companies have faced fierce criticism over the past couple of years over such issue as Russian interference, so-called fake news (both real and imagined), harmful content, bullying and mostly unsubstantiated claims of bias against conservatives.</p><p>Age and location matter</p><p>Age matters when it come to usage. As you might expect, Snapchat (73 percent) and Instagram (75 percent) do well with 18- to 24-year-olds, but so does Facebook, which is used by 79 percent of that age-group. But a lot of older people also use social media. Seven in 10 people between 50 and 64 use YouTube and so do 38 percent of people over 65. Facebook is used by 68 percent of people between 50 and 64 and nearly half (46 percent) of people over 65.</p><p>Only 3 percent of seniors over 65 use Snapchat while 7 percent of that age group uses Twitter.</p><p>Where you live also matters. Urban and suburban dwellers (26 percent) are twice as likely to use Twitter than people in rural areas (13 percent).\u00a0 There's more than a three-to-one gap for LinkedIn with 33 percent urban vs. 10 percent rural.\u00a0 But YouTube and Facebook usage is relative close among urban and rural dwellers at the rate of 77 percent urban vs. 66 percent rural for YouTube and 73 percent urban vs. 66 percent rural for Facebook.</p><p>Daily usage</p><p>Perhaps more important than whether one ever uses a service is whether they use it regularly and, despite all the controversies, Facebook users seem to be just as active now as they were in the past. Nearly three-quarters (74 percent) of Facebook users are on the service daily, which is identical to last year. About half (51 percent) say they use it \"several times a day.\" That compares with 61 percent of Instagram users who say they are on the app at least once a day with 42 percent saying they use it several times daily.\u00a0 Snapchat has similar numbers.\u00a0 Just over half (51 percent) of YouTube users are on the site daily up from 45 percent last year.</p><p>I was surprised to see that only 42 percent of Twitter users are on it daily with 25 percent saying they use it several times a day. I tend to think of Twitter as a place that people check into frequently but that may be mostly news junkies and journalist who are glued to the service. Apparently, most Twitter users are far more restrained on how often they check-in.</p><p>You can read a lot more about this survey on Pew's blog at\u00a0 <url normalizedValue=\"http://tinyurl.com/pewstudy2019\">tinyurl.com/pewstudy2019</url>.</p><p>Regulatory headwinds</p><p>The data is mostly good news for Facebook and perhaps one of the reasons why investors continue to value the company, whose stock, despite all the criticism, is outperforming the overall market so far this year. But any optimism about Facebook's future depends on its ability to solve some of the problems it's created for itself. Even though attrition has been minimal so far, there is a limit and users could reach a tipping point if Facebook suffers from too many more privacy breaches or horrendous news stories like those following the revelation that the New Zealand shooter used Facebook to live-broadcast his murder of 50 worshippers at a Christchurch mosque. It's almost a given that foreign-powers will use Facebook to try to influence the 2020 election but we don't yet know how well the company will be able to thwart those efforts.</p><p>Facebook clearly faces additional regulation in the U.S. and around the world. Social media companies are already having to adjust to more stringent privacy rules in Europe now that the General Data Privacy Regulation is in effect and here at home there are legislators on both sides of the aisle anxious to pass laws to rein in Facebook, YouTube and other social media companies. Even Mark Zuckerberg is calling for more regulation.

Of course, these companies have a right to try to protect their interests, but let's hope that they don't abuse their online presence to enlist support with a level of reach that's gargantuan compared to that of most people, organizations or even companies.</p><p>So, while I join the celebration over the apparent demise of PIPA and SOPA and appreciate the help the movement got from big tech companies, I also worry about giving these companies too much power and influence.</p><p>Disclosure: Larry Magid is co-director of ConnectSafely.org, a non-profit Internet safety organization that receives financial support from Google, Facebook and other Internet companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SJMRCN-19829142</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SANJOSEMNG2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54TT-CTM1-DYT4-V1DV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313960</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-12-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"875\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 San Jose Mercury News All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>San Jose Mercury News (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"01\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>January 22, 2012 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>CC000266V</classCode><className>VISA INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000A2RK</classCode><className>WIKIMEDIA FOUNDATION INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>CENTER FOR DEMOCRACY &amp;

He memorised them and knew right where to find them if he needed them in the middle of a cross-examination.    Of those 50, maybe two dozen were the kind you just don\u2019t forget \u2014 bald, vivid illustrations of what the government hoped to prove: that Microsoft was using its monopoly power to squeeze Netscape, the upstart browser company that Microsoft viewed as a potential threat to its Windows monopoly.      \u201cHow much do we need to pay you to screw Netscape?\u201d Microsoft founder Bill Gates asked, according to an email recapping a meeting with AOL executives. (He added, \u201cThis is your lucky day.\u201d)    In another email, Gates suggested that Microsoft offer Intuit \u201csomething like $1M \u2026 in return for switching browsers\u201d from Netscape to Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer.    There were plenty of others just like those. Collectively, they showed Microsoft was willing to use every trick in the monopolist\u2019s handbook to \u201ccut off Netscape\u2019s air supply,\u201d to use another memorable phrase that came out of the trial: offering financial incentives to computer makers that stopped pre-installing Netscape; giving away its browser free; leveraging its operating system to favor its own browser over its rival\u2019s.    If you read about the recent hearing before the House Judiciary Committee antitrust subcommittee, you already know why I took this little trip down memory lane. The news articles focused on what was said during the five-hour hearing, both by the lawmakers asking the questions and the four tech CEOs who were answering them \u2014 Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook, Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg and Google\u2019s Sundar Pichai.    But the committee also posted on its website a handful of internal emails the companies had turned over. My colleague Tara Lachapelle made the point that the nation\u2019s primary competition law, the Sherman Antitrust Act, was enacted more than 100 years ago and was aimed at then-dominant businesses like railroads. Preventing abusive monopoly practices by today\u2019s dominant technology companies has proved to be difficult in part because antitrust law never anticipated the business models that have made Google, Facebook and others so powerful.    Up to a point, I agree. That\u2019s why a new breed of antitrust thinkers such as Lena Khan (who is working with the Democrats on the antitrust panel) and the economist Hal Singer have developed new ideas for reining in Big Tech.    But the emails suggest that even without passing new laws, a lot can be done to stop Big Tech\u2019s monopolistic practices. There are enough similarities between those old Bill Gates emails and the documents released by the antitrust panel to make me think that a few good old-fashioned lawsuits might well do the trick.    Let\u2019s take a look at what the committee unearthed from Facebook, Amazon and Google, shall we?    \u201cInstagram is eating our lunch,\u201d begins an internal Facebook discussion. \u201cWe should have owned this space but we are already losing quite badly. \u2026 I find myself checking it far more often than FB mobile. It is a far more focused, compelling way to keep up with what my friends are doing.\u201d    Someone in the discussion responds, \u201cIsn\u2019t that why we\u2019re building an Instagram clone?\u201d    In another email, Zuckerberg considers a different way to deal with the new competition: \u201cYeah, I remember your internal post about how Instagram was our threat,\u201d he writes to an executive whose name has been redacted. \u201cOne thing about startups though is that you can often acquire them. I think this is a good outcome for everyone.\u201d Which of course is what happened: Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012. It was an excellent outcome for Facebook but not so much for anyone who hoped to see competition among social media companies.     Amazon:    \u201cMore evidence these guys are our #1 short-term competitor,\u201d read a 2009 email referring to Diapers.com. \u201cAs I\u2019ve mentioned to each of you, we need to match pricing on these guys no matter what the cost.\u201d Another email in the same chain read, \u201cThey may be giving us a run for our money. We can approach them through the \u2018We would be willing to explore a range of relationships\u2019 angle.\u201d In 2011, Amazon bought Diapers.com\u2019s parent company, Quidsi, for $545 million. (It shut down the brand in 2017).    During the hearing, Democratic Representative Pramila Jayapal confronted Bezos with reports that Amazon used data it gleaned from firms that sell their wares on the company\u2019s platform to favor its own competing products. Bezos responded by saying that while that was against company policy, \u201cI can\u2019t guarantee you that policy has never been violated.\u201d     Google:    Most of the Google documents released by the committee had to do with acquisitions \u2014 of DoubleClick and YouTube especially \u2014 but there was one in particular that caught my eye. It was about \u201cverticals,\u201d in which Google uses its main search engine to promote its own industry-specific products in areas such as travel and local business reviews over those from companies such as Expedia and Yelp. At the time the email was written, the company was trying to decide whether \u2014 and how \u2014 to start offering verticals.     19:07    \u201cWhat is the real threat if we don\u2019t execute on verticals?\u201d    a) \u201cLoss of traffic from google. com \u2026 .    b) Related revenue loss to high spend verticals like travel.    c) Missing oppty if someone else creates the platform to build verticals.    d) If one of our big competitors builds a constellation of high quality verticals, we are hurt badly.\u201d     Google of course did begin offering \u201chigh quality verticals,\u201d and companies such as Yelp have complained to antitrust regulators ever since that Google is using its platform to favor itself at the expense of companies that rely on it for their lifeblood.    Even though antitrust law might need to be amended to clarify what is \u2014and isn\u2019t \u2014 acceptable practices by the big tech companies, these emails and documents show that there is already enough evidence to file antitrust lawsuits. \u201cMergers and acquisitions that buy off potential competitive threats violate the antitrust laws,\u201d Jerry Nadler, who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said to Zuckerberg. \u201cIn your own words, you purchased Instagram to neutralize a competitive threat.\u201d    Amazon\u2019s practice of losing money on a product to hurt a rival isn\u2019t all that different from Microsoft giving Internet Explorer away free knowing that would make it difficult for Netscape to compete. Google using its platform \u2014 a platform thousands of companies can\u2019t live without \u2014 to favor itself is also similar to Microsoft behavior the Justice Department viewed as illegal.    Would these lawsuits take years to play out in the courts? Yes. But the common complaint that technology moves too fast for the court system is wrong. Microsoft lost at the trial stage, and although much of the district court\u2019s decision was overturned on appeal, that had less to do with the facts than with the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, who had foolishly talked to certain reporters behind the scenes during the trial.    In the end, though, the Justice Department won. In 2001, Microsoft settled with the federal government; more important, its behavior changed. Microsoft ended its abusive practices. Operating systems became less important. Google, Facebook and Amazon were all able to emerge without having to worry about threats from Microsoft.    Google, Facebook and Amazon can also be forced to end their abusive practices. What\u2019s needed is an antitrust department willing to take the companies to court. Thanks to the congressional panel, the evidence is already there.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42805131974</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JN-4CT1-JCSC-J2RR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1390\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Business Standard India</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 10, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002B14</classCode><className>INTUIT INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS541611 ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT &amp;

Ro Khanna, D-Calif., rarely have candidates made technology policy a keystone of their campaigns. </p><p>But Ross LaJeunesse, a disenchanted former Google executive and one of the Democrats vying for the chance to unseat Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is seeking to change that.</p><p>\"Congress has not only neglected its oversight of tech companies, it has neglected its responsibility to ensure that the benefits of technology and the digital economy reach all Americans,\" LaJeunesse wrote in a blog post on Medium last week. \"For too long, tech companies have lobbied their friends in Congress to avoid meaningful regulation and oversight.\"</p><p>A detailed, 10-point \"tech reform\" agenda released by LaJeunesse's campaign last week covers a wide range of technology issues currently being debated in Congress, such as data privacy, cybersecurity and election security, facial recognition and net neutrality.</p><p>On privacy, LaJeunesse wants to pass legislation that would not only give customers control over how their data is used by companies, but also give them a cut of the profits if companies make money by selling their personal data to third parties. He also wants to increase fines and penalties levied against corporations that allow user data to be obtained through cyberattacks and data breaches.</p><p>LaJeunesse is approaching facial recognition technology in a similar way, proposing legislation that would make facial scans the property of the person whose information is collected, not the company that collects it. The legislation would require companies that take facial scans \"to obtain clear, informed opt-in consent from individuals before the facial scan is stored and used for any commercial purposes.\"</p><p>LaJeunesse also wants to ensure that tech companies \"uphold and promote human and civil rights.\" Formerly Google's global head of international relations, he left the company in 2019 after learning it was developing a search engine, Dragonfly, that could be deployed in China because it conformed to the government's censorship regulations. (Google says it has since abandoned the project.)</p><p>\"We need people in government who understand tech,\" LaJeunesse told The New Yorker last month. \"Government regulation is the answer because the minute that [Google chief executive Sundar Pichai] had to testify about Dragonfly, that's when Dragonfly was dead.\"</p><p>One of LaJeunesse's proposals for holding technology companies accountable is to give their employees special whistleblower protections by passing legislation that \"clarifies and guarantees whistleblower protections for employees of technology companies who disclose corporate behavior that is illegal and unethical, or threatens the rights, safety, or security of users.\" The proposal would also require the Federal Trade Commission to establish a special unit for reviewing whistleblower claims by employees at technology companies.</p><p>He also wants to make sure Silicon Valley complies with antitrust laws. Amid ongoing antitrust probes of Facebook and Google by the Justice Department, the FTC and two coalitions of state attorneys general, LaJeunesse said authorities should rethink the current consumer welfare standard that determines whether a company has illegal monopoly power. LaJeunesse says that current standard relies too much on prices and does not account for the fact that ubiquitous products offered by companies such as Facebook and Google are free to use. </p><p>\"It is imperative that we reevaluate this focus as companies and business models continue to evolve and raise new challenges beyond economic costs to consumers,\" LaJeunesse's plan says. \"Issues like the market dominance of technology platforms and the amount of user data they have, and the impact this has on consumers' privacy, autonomy, and agency must be considered.\"</p><p>LaJeunesse's agenda also includes priorities such as increasing access to high-speed internet for rural Americans and protecting workers from automation, an issue he says \"too few people in Washington seem to know or care about.\" He wants the government to develop a strategy for providing workers displaced by automation with job retraining, skills development and temporary financial assistance. </p><p>Simultaneously, the plan seeks to ensure American children are provided with the tools necessary to \"fully participate in the economy of the future\" by calling on the Education Department to work with technology companies to develop computer science and other curricula. Speaking to The New Yorker, LaJeunesse said he believes technology can be an \"equalizer\" for children.</p><p>\"Wealthy families always had access to more resources,\" he said. \"But, if you were, like, a poor kid in Maine, in rural Maine, you're kind of stuck, and tech changed that.\"</p><p>It's unclear whether LaJeunesse will get the opportunity to turn his agenda into reality. In Maine's June 9 Democratic primary, he faces a slew of candidates including Sara Gideon, the speaker of the Maine House of Representatives. At the end of 2019, LaJeunesse's campaign had about $376,000, according to the Federal Election Commission, compared with Gideon's $2.77 million.</p><p>Source: CQ News<br/>Copyright 2020 Congressional Quarterly Inc.

Susan Collins after launching his race in November. At that time, he was mostly quiet about his time at Google, aside from a statement on his campaign website saying Google \"tried to buy his silence\" after he walked out.</p><p><br/>The Arundel native worked at the tech giant for more than a decade, finishing his tenure earlier this year as the global head of international relations as a high-profile voice on free-speech issues. He told The Washington Post in a Thursday report and in a Medium post that advocacy, along with concerns over the workplace culture around diversity and LGBTQ issues at Google, ultimately led to him being pushed out of the company this spring.</p><p><br/>In an interview with the Bangor Daily News, LaJeunesse said he ultimately decided to speak about his experience because of the trust people put into companies and how much money and marketing that companies, including Google, put into earning that trust.</p><p><br/>\"I started seeing it, honestly, as a form of corruption and an abuse of power,\" he said.</p><p><br/>He said his departure came after two years of pushing for a human rights program as Google was exploring a return to China via a censored search app called Project Dragonfly, a since-abandoned reversal of a 2010 decision to stop censoring search results in China.</p><p><br/>LaJeunesse was a key figure in that earlier decision. He said he had interceded on similar proposals before, including a China-specific app store, when those proposals concerned him and has spoken frequently about the issues of free speech, technology and LGBTQ rights.</p><p><br/>Having a human rights program that enshrined the company's views around free speech and privacy would ensure those values would be adhered to, even if LaJeunesse or his deputies weren't in the room, he told the Post. After two years of pushing for the program, LaJeunesse said he was told in February his role would be eliminated as part of a reorganization effort.</p><p><br/>Although Google offered him a position on foreign policy, LaJeunesse left the company three months later, calling it a \"meaningless position\" meant to put him \"back in the closet.\" LaJeunesse is gay.</p><p><br/>A Google spokesperson told The Post the company has an \"unwavering\" commitment to human rights efforts, saying LaJeunesse's departure was due to a reorganization of the company's policy team and that the new job offer was at the same pay and level.</p><p><br/>LaJeunesse said his time at Google showed him the need for more aggressive regulations for big technology companies from the federal government, saying companies are unable to self-regulate and protect user privacy, personal data or keep child abuse or other criminal content off their platforms.</p><p><br/>He pointed to California's Consumer Privacy Act, which is said to be one of the more aggressive privacy policies in the country and went into effect Wednesday, saying states will put forward their own policies if Congress doesn't create one.</p><p><br/>LaJeunesse said he plans to release his own plans for big tech regulations in the coming weeks. While at Google in 2012, he said during a panel at the conservative American Enterprise Institute that the Internet's success as a cultural phenomenon was due to the role of private companies and users, not governments.</p><p><br/>There are a few bills concerning Internet privacy before Congress now. LaJeunesse said he is encouraged by California's law and said there are \"good things\" in a white paper from U.S. Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, that proposes to force technology companies to put a public price on consumer data, among other things.</p><p><br/>\"We need to step up and say, 'These are the rules of the road, this is what is acceptable and what is not acceptable,'\" LaJeunesse said. \"A lot of it should be about transparency, a lot of it has to be about consumers owning and controlling their own data.\"</p><p><br/>\u00c2\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGRDLY-25886997</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGRDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWS-02C1-DY6V-N3TR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144564</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"693\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bangor Daily News</copyright><publicationName>Bangor Daily News (Maine)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 2, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000348K</classCode><className>AUGUSTA TECHNOLOGIE AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

And the third came in April this year when Hong Kong's listing rules were eased to open up a possible $100 billion-plus listings bonanza, allowing \"~innovative' technology companies to go public despite less-than-stellar financials and, more controversially, to allow dual-class shareholders.</p><p>Each move had its critics, particularly the dual-class share debate, which remains fresh and potentially problematic for Li and for regulation in Hong Kong. But for Li at least, none were as divisive or as memorable as \"~Lunch-hour-gate'. This dragged on from soon after Li's arrival at the exchange in 2010 to 2012 and was the result of what seemed a very logical \"\" to Li at least \"\" and even trivial reform that was intended to align Hong Kong's share-trading hours with those of its mainland compatriot exchanges and that turned surprisingly toxic.</p><p>Li's charter at HKEx was \"\" and remains \"\" to make Hong Kong the go-to international outlet for China's business, and to integrate China's capital markets with its most outward-looking centre, Hong Kong. Bringing Hong Kong into line with Shanghai and Shenzhen starting, at the very least with their trading hours, was a no-brainer for investors on both sides of the frontier, or so Li thought.</p><p> We want to be the world's exchange for China, we want to be the Chinese exchange for the world -Charles Li, HKEx </p><p>But in a town where money and food merge as territorial obsessions \"\" after all, it was Hong Kong that gave rise to the dim sum bond \"\" the city's feisty tight-knit community of brokers, bankers and investors saw it very differently. Alignment meant their lunch break would be cut from two hours to one, which they groused wasn't enough time to wine and dine clients over dumplings and duck. Li says he simply wanted to get China's exchange ducks in a row.</p><p>At one point, Li, the first person from communist China to occupy one of capitalism's highest offices in Asia, was even portrayed as the Italian fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini and an effigy of Li as Il Duce was marched through Central by grumpy stockbrokers, their clients and even restaurateurs.</p><p>Years on, and the hours now aligned, the fuss still bewilders Li, so much so that he spends a good part of his interview with Asiamoney talking about it.</p><p>\"It was just the beginning steps of getting the markets ready, getting them together,\" he says, shaking his head. \"The markets needed to connect, needed to be integrated. The rest of the world trades virtually 24 hours and there's no lunch break (there). It turned out to be a major controversy and disaster.\"</p><p>Ultimately, Li won or, as he puts it, \"the market prevailed.\" It was one of Li's first moves as exchange boss and \"it took two years to get done,\" he says. \"One year to get it to an hour and a half, another to get it to one\". But it came to define his often-difficult engagement with Hong Kong's feisty investment and regulatory community.</p><p>Coming 13 years after the UK's handover of its former colony to China, Lunch-hour-gate even became wound up in the delicate Hong Kong identity debate over how separate Hong Kong, with its very different economic experience, should be from China. Two years later, that sentiment articulated itself more dramatically in the umbrella protests that paralyzed Hong Kong for two months in 2014.Poacher turned gamekeeper</p><p>Li arrives for his meeting with Asiamoney exuding an animated, almost master-of-the-universe strut. His decidedly American accent is part Wall St corporate lawyer and banker, part deep south twang that he collected at college in Alabama in the mid 1980s.</p><p>He is the latest in an unrelated line of Li and Lees to helm the Hong Kong bourse. The first was the notorious Ronald Li, the 1980s-era billionaire who unified the colony's four disparate exchanges into the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong and who was jailed for 30 months for a listing scam.</p><p>The next was the establishment lawyer Charles Lee, who was the exchange's chairman through much of the 1990s and 2000s and who stewarded the merger of the stock and futures exchanges. And now Charles Li, the first mainlander to run the exchange; he took over in 2010 and his contract has just been renewed for another three years.</p><p>\"It's been a bit long,\" he says. \"Time just flies over.\" He's a permanent resident of the territory that has been his home for 17 years. He is also a big football fan. Asiamoney poses the crucial sports test and asks him which team he would support if the Hong Kong squad were to play China in a World Cup.</p><p>\"I refuse to get into that,\" he laughs. \"I'd want both of them to win, but beating others.\" Li, now 56, gets mixed reviews as HKEx boss. Some see him as a pliant Beijing instrument and think he has been lax on regulation. Others say that as a US-educated banker from the mainland, he has the right professional and personal polish for the job, particularly at this stage in Hong Kong's evolution as China Inc's efficient shop front, and that he has modernized and internationalized the exchanges.</p><p>As poacher turned gamekeeper, he knows the vagaries of the market and of Hong Kong. In 2016, when HKEx trading volumes fell to a three-year low, his bonus took a 25% hit. That it came a few months after his $15 million home was turned over by burglars seemed only to add insult to injury.</p><p/><p>Much of Li's mantra at HKEx has been about reinvention. And he has done quite a bit of that himself during a career shaped in large part by China's market reforms and opening up, the so-called kaifeng policy of China's late leader, Deng Xiaoping.</p><p>Li was born in Beijing but grew up in far-flung Gansu province, in China's west. He toiled on a state oil rig in the Bohai Sea before completing a BA at Xiamen University in 1984. He then became a journalist with China Daily, the communist party's English language mouthpiece (a detail curiously absent from the HKEx's official biography for Li), a paper that had only been established in 1981 as part of Deng's policy of opening up to the outside world.</p><p>Li was among the first waves of Chinese students to pursue foreign education in the middle of the 1980s. In 1978, Deng declared: \"We are going to send thousands or tens of thousands to receive overseas education,\" a remark that would have been heresy just two years earlier under Mao Zedong. With memories of the Cultural Revolution still very fresh, Chinese families took years to be convinced there would not be any backlash from embracing anything vaguely Western.</p><p>Li remembers writing to many US universities requesting financial aid to study stateside. At the time there was much enthusiasm about China's coming in from the cold and Li says, \"there was a lot of curiosity among universities\" about students from a country that had isolated itself for decades.</p><p>Working from an alphabetical list, he got a place studying journalism at the University of Alabama, arriving in Tuscaloosa with barely $50 in his pocket, the maximum that China's foreign exchange controls of the day allowed. Li got a waiver for tuition, a scholarship and found 20 hours of work a week with a university professor. There were just 18 fellow mainlanders on campus, he recalls.</p><p>\"I was probably at the later end of the first wave of Chinese students,\" remembers Li. \"The big torrent was much later than that.\" He denies his family was advantaged and, as is often suggested in Hong Kong, that he was a so-called princeling, or scion of Beijing's communist party elite.</p><p>\"No, no, no! I don't have any relatives or anything like that,\" he insists. \"My father thinks I'm a prince,\" he jokes. \"He's about the only one. \"My parents couldn't really afford anything. We had no money. We needed to get scholarships. My family incurred a lot of debt just to buy the ticket to send me off.\"</p><p>He retains warm memories of Tuscaloosa. It was \"the first time I gained freedom, so to speak. I was able to drive. I was able to live in a place that had hot water. I had a kitchen. I had a TV. Wow! I never had a hot shower in my home (in China) at all, it was the public bathroom.\"</p><p> It's Li's job to make sure China is happy. The biggest customer of HKEx when you think about it is the mainland government -David Webb, shareholder activist </p><p>A college essay about defamation law helped him secure a scholarship at Columbia University's law school in New York after Alabama, which in turn opened up jobs at the white-shoe New York law firms Davis Polk &amp; Wardwell and at Brown &amp; Wood. The US left an indelible mark on him, in his accented English and his regard for markets. \"I'm reading a lot of Trump,\" he says. \"He's driving everybody nuts.\"</p><p>In 1994, Li joined Merrill Lynch's China team in Hong Kong as an investment banker, where he worked on China's first sovereign bond offering in the US and a brace of big China Inc IPOs. He was with Merrill Lynch for nine years, during which he became its China boss, before leaving to join JPMorgan as the Beijing-based chairman of its Chinese franchise.</p><p>In 2005, Li and JPMorgan advised state oil company CNOOC in its $18.5 billion bid to buy US oil firm Unocal; that would have been China's biggest offshore acquisition but pressure from Washington scotched the deal.</p><p>Li's time in Beijing was useful in building close relationships with mainland policymakers, but such intimate ties backfired in 2015 when it emerged Li had recommended that JPMorgan hire relatives of senior Chinese officials, the real so-called princelings.</p><p>The officials included Huang Hongyuan, who was then a ranking official at the China Securities Regulatory Commission and now chairs the Shanghai Stock Exchange, an HKEx trading partner. According to a leaked email, Li wrote: \"I am getting quite tired with all these requests but guess that most of my clients are getting to the age that their children are reaching intern age. This is something nice to leverage on but excessive demand is a big problem.\"</p><p>In 2016, JPMorgan agreed to pay US authorities $246 million to settle a probe into the bank's so-called \"~Sons and daughters program', considered a breach of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The SEC said JPMorgan had \"engaged in a systematic bribery scheme by hiring children of government officials and other favoured referrals who were typically unqualified for the positions.\" Then came the HKEx. Li remembers getting a call from a headhunter for the HKEx job in 2009, while he was at JPMorgan.</p><p>\"I said I don't know anything about them, but it was interesting,\" he tells Asiamoney. \"I was in banking for a long time and, you know, there is this hidden urge to do something different, to do something with a little bit of public good rather than just in banking with clients, with a little bit of policy orientation. I didn't know the exchange well at that time.\"Angst</p><p>There is much angst in Hong Kong about Li's dual-class share initiative.</p><p>\"One share, one vote\" had been a near-sacred principle of share ownership in Hong Kong since the 1980s. As recently as 2015, the Securities and Futures Commission had opposed it. However, soon after Hong Kong's new chief executive, Carrie Lam, took office, the SFC had a sudden about-face on the policy. Neither Lam nor the SFC responded to requests for interview.</p><p>Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam</p><p/><p>The Li-led amendment has been described by some observers as destroying shareholder democracy. Jamie Allen, secretary-general of the Asian Corporate Governance Association, says the introduction of the dual-class share is part of \"a race to the bottom that Hong Kong and China seem desperate to win\". Li reckons the fuss is much ado about nothing, and that very little has changed for the average shareholder.</p><p>\"There is a misconception about dual shares, and some people automatically associate that with lesser protection to the investor,\" he says. \"People think that their rights are being changed.\" Not so, he says. \"All we did, in the new era, is to say that the people who should call the shots may not necessarily be the one who have the most money in there. We have all the bells and whistles (protecting) the smaller shareholder, not being abused by the big ones. Nothing has changed there.\"</p><p>Li says that Hong Kong has always had family-controlled companies and state-controlled companies: \"So our public shareholders by and large here other than HSBC and (his own employer) Hong Kong Exchange are living in a controlled shareholder environment, meaning public shareholders are always a minority. Here, invariably, it's a big shareholder-controlled market. Whoever has put more money into the company calls the shots.\"</p><p>Now with dual-class shares, he says: \"It's just that we have allowed (the likes of Alibaba's) Jack Ma and Pony Ma (or Ma Huateng, founder of Hong Kong-listed tech firm Tencent) to use a special voting power. We've simply allowed a different way to gain controlling voting power.\" It took four years of talks \"\" not only with the SFC but also with the government, the stakeholders, investors and media \"\" to push the changes through, Li says.</p><p>\"Look at the competitive landscape, the massive market in the US which is supposed to have a much higher level of governance standards and they all allow it, so, systematically China and Hong Kong are losing. There's a competitive angle, there's no question about that. Everybody will go there. Tencent (HKEx's biggest listing) was the exception.\"</p><p>We speak with Li in April as he prepares to welcome the listing of mainland telco hardware firm Xiaomi, which announced its IPO in Hong Kong soon after the city agreed to allow super-voting stock.</p><p>Xiaomi's IPO is expected to raise upward of $10 billion, the biggest IPO raising since Alibaba, and would vault Xiaomi into HKEx's top 10 companies by capitalization. Li says the share class changes could unlock a bonanza for the HKEx. \"Xiaomi would definitely go to the US if we don't have this,\" Li says. \"And we have a whole range of companies after Xiaomi. I can count at least 10 mainland companies that would be worth $20 billion now.\"</p><p>Alibaba is an extremely important catalyst, an important example, a case study for people to look at. This is real consequences to a market, real cost to a market -Charles Li, HKEx </p><p>Adding dual-class shares to the HKEx roster \"is not the selling point,\" Li says, \"it's removing the block.\" The problem with Li's argument is that just a few weeks later, in early June, Xiaomi gave Hong Kong a proverbial bloody nose when it announced it would sell at least half of its shares in Shanghai in the form of Chinese Depositary Receipts.</p><p>Still, Li defends dual-class shares vigorously. \"We are not giving them anything that is beneficial, we are simply allowing our market to do what the US does. That's all.\" Li cites Alibaba as an example of why dual-class shares work.</p><p>\"Jack Ma got to be where he is, Alibaba got to where it is not because Jack Ma threw a lot of money to it. (Softbank's) Mr (Masayoshi) Son threw quite a bit of money\"\u00a6. Yahoo's got a little bit, but vis-\u00c3 -vis the size of the company, the money is irrelevant, it was marginal,\" Li argues. \"It's really the intangibles that allowed this company to really grow into massive scale. In Apple, Steve Jobs disproportionately created value to that company and we should allow (the likes of) him to call the shots.\"</p><p>Li's unsolicited mention of [Jack] Ma and Alibaba references Li's biggest setback during his tenure, and the admitted motivation behind his push for the share-class rule change in Hong Kong. The Chinese online product-sourcing firm first went public in 2007, in Hong Kong, in floating the alibaba.com website. That listing struggled, and by the middle of 2012, Ma and his partners had bigger ideas. Alibaba Group bought out minority investors and took the company private. The stock was delisted.</p><p>In 2013, as Alibaba was negotiating a new listing of the wider Alibaba Group between the NYSE \"\" which allows dual-class shares \"\" and the HKEx, which then did not, the company's co-founder and vice-chairman Joseph Tsai said that \"the question Hong Kong must address is whether it is ready to look forward as the rest of the world passes it by.\"</p><p>Hong Kong was a \"natural\"\u00a6. first choice\" for the new float, Tsai said, \"but we firmly believe that Hong Kong must consider what is needed in order to adapt to future trends and changes.\"</p><p>Alibaba wasn't proposing a dual-class shareholding structure, Tsai said, but a \"governance structure that would enable Alibaba's partners \"\" key people who manage our businesses \"\" to set the company's strategic course without being influenced by the fluctuating attitudes of the capital markets. We understand Hong Kong may not want to change its tradition for one company.\"</p><p>Ma and Tsai chose the NYSE over Hong Kong and took Alibaba public in what was, at the time, the largest ever IPO, a $25 billion-plus float. The result was Li lost the prestigious Alibaba listing that would have boosted his trading revenues and international cachet. \"Of course we would have liked them,\" he says. \"I would like everybody here. Alibaba is an extremely important catalyst, an important example, a case study for people to look at. This is real consequences to a market, real cost to a market.\"</p><p>He says the value of Alibaba's daily trading volume in the US is equal to 20% of Hong Kong's total daily volume. \"This is how much the market overall suffers from missing out. The US will have an even harder time to figure out what Alibaba is doing here.\"<table><tgroup cols=\"1\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"632\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">David Webb,</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">shareholder activist</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>David Webb, a prominent shareholder activist and former non-executive HKEx director, says HKEx's dual-class share move arose because the decision by China's home-grown companies, like Alibaba, to list in the US was a \"huge loss of face\" and source of \"national shame\" in Beijing.</p><p>\"There is a feeling that US regulators have too much say over Chinese companies,\" Webb says. A long-time thorn in the side of Hong Kong market officials, Webb says he thinks Li does not care a great deal about regulation and supervision. \"It's like: \"~Ooh, it makes us look bad, but oh, never mind because we are going to list Xiaomi and all the big tech companies',\" Webb says. \"Quite rationally, his interest is in maximizing turnover at HKEx and milking that monopoly. That's how he is motivated, with his remuneration and so on, shares and bonuses. That's his job. It's his job to make sure China is happy. The biggest customer of HKEx when you think about it is the mainland government.\"</p><p>Of the top 20 HKEx-listed companies by capitalization, at least 15 are Chinese state-owned enterprises, he notes: \"What they (Beijing) want is paramount.\" Webb points to an inherent conflict of interest in Hong Kong's listing and regulatory regime, which is that the businessmen-dealmaker bosses of the HKEx and the lawyers who run the SFC are ultimately appointed by the Hong Kong government.</p><p>The chairwoman of HKEx \"\" prominent lawyer and regulator Laura Cha \"\" is a former vice-chair of China's Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) and is also appointed by the government. A member of Hong Kong's de facto advisory cabinet, the Executive Council, China-born Cha chairs the government's Financial Services Development Council. Six of HKEx's directors are appointed by the Hong Kong government and six are elected by the shareholders. The 13th is the chief executive Li.'Enigma' scandal</p><p>\"It's a government-controlled company that won't admit it,\" says Webb. He worries about the exchange's regulatory rigour and points to the so-called \"~Enigma Network' scandal of last year, in which he unravelled a complex network of 50 manipulated listed companies that had not been detected by the HKEx.</p><p>After Enigma was revealed by Webb, the market took a $6 billion hit. Webb says Enigma showed \"that the system does not work; that it's not fit for purpose because HKEx allowed this to build up and didn't apply enough resources to scrutinize it.\"</p><p>Li did not directly admit to any regulatory shortcomings in the wake of Webb's Enigma disclosures. In remarks to reporters a few months before Enigma was unearthed, Li dampened fear of slipshod regulation, saying: \"We all need to relax. This is a great market. You don't want the regulator to solve all your problems\".</p><p>Li said the Hong Kong market was like a generally well-run city that has \"a few dark alleys and little corners\". But in April this year, the HKEx moved to deploy Nasdaq-derived artificial intelligence surveillance software known as \"~regtech' to track irregular trading activity. Webb compares Hong Kong's regulatory regime unfavourably to the UK's. \"When the London Stock Exchange was demutualised, this conflict was recognized, and the whole regulatory function moved out to what is now the Financial Conduct Authority,\" which is structured and operates independently of government.</p><p>Webb says he and other corporate governance activists lobby authorities \"as often as we can\" to separate the direct line to government, but it falls on deaf ears. \"If the government doesn't want to, they won't do it. They would rather control everything,\" he says. The purchase of the London Metals Exchange in 2012 followed the mixed results of Li's push to lure foreign listings to the HKEx. The Hong Kong exchange has attracted high-profile listings from the Swiss-based mining group Glencore and Brazilian mining house Vale, as well as from US fashion retailer Coach, Italian fashion house Prada and the French cosmetic firm L'Occitane International. The Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska has also listed his Rusal Group in Hong Kong. But trading volumes have generally underwhelmed.</p><p>However, the LME has delivered for HKEx, and owning it has been a \"great experience,\" Li says. HKEx had implanted a \"commercial DNA\" into the venerable members-only exchange. He says the LME contributes about 12% of group taxed profit. That translates, he says, to a market value of around $4 billion to 4.5 billion \"\" based on HKEx's notional market capitalization of around $40 billion \"\" and is more than double what HKEx paid for LME.</p><p>As for China, Li would like it to keep doing what it's doing. \"I want China to keep changing, keep being dynamic, there's so many things China needs to do. Just keep on doing them and we will figure out a way to respond,\" he says. \"China is so big and so different and no longer willing to change itself to fit into the rest of the world, because they have their own ecosystem, its own logic, (so) the world is now going to have to change itself to fit into China.\"</p><p>His Connect model with Chinese stock exchanges plays into that and is a pragmatic way of joining two different corporate systems, he says. He points out that the total value of Hong Kong's listed stocks is around HK$35 trillion ($4.5 trillion), which is disproportionately large compared to Hong Kong's domestic economy.</p><p>\"It's a little body with a big fat head,\" he says. \"Our whole market is China, and we are the one that is doing the connecting. Anybody who does that needs to constantly be agile, always trying to find the right position\"\u00a6the right place to align needs, the right timing.\"</p><p>As for future reforms, Li says, \"we are largely still equity, but fixed income, currency and commodities are big things to deal with.\" He hints at possible tie-ups beyond China, to help China Inc connect to the world. \"We want to be the world's exchange for China, we want to be the Chinese exchange for the world.\"</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUROMO-3817757</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUROMO2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SXM-6FF1-JD1P-T083-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">318063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3974\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Euromoney</publicationName><publicationDate month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0004ZZI</classCode><className>HONG KONG EXCHANGES &amp;

I'm Mark Steyn in for Tucker. He's sleeping off his  Boxing Day Bacchanalia but he will join us later to discuss the ongoing  collapse of men in America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, yet another Liberal media meltdown. The mainstream media taking  the opportunity to turn a presidential visit to American troops into an  attack on Trump. Take a look at the hysteria as the talking heads accused  the President of turning the post-Christmas visit into a political event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY COMMENTATOR, CNN NATIONAL  SECURITY ANALYST: From a national security perspective, for all the reasons  that you just listed, the President should have stayed home.</p><p>JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, RETIRED MAJOR GENERAL, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: The  reason that he went now is that he couldn't go to Mar-a-Lago because the  government was shut down.</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN TONIGHT HOST, CNN: It was like we kept saying \"He's like the  Grinch.\" Instead of - I'm being honest.</p><p>CHARLES JOSEPH SCARBOROUGH, MORNING JOE CO-HOST, MSNBC: We should also be  concerned that Mr. Trump once again used a captive audience of American  heroes to push his unpopular domestic agenda.</p><p>Even in doing something right, he figures out a way to sow chaos.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It took far too long, especially compared to President  Obama who visited troops in Iraq in his first three months in office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STEYN: Over at CNN, attacking the President wasn't enough. They decided to  attack the troops as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBARA STARR, PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT, CNN: The pool reporters traveling  said that the troops brought the hats with them, including one hat that  said \"Trump 2020.\" We will have to see if that actually proves to be the  case. </p><p>The question is, if they - if they brought them or if the President brought  them, what commander allowed that to really happen, because this is very  much against military policy and regulation. Troops are not supposed to be  involved in political activities. The U.S. Military is not a political  force.</p><p>JOHN FRANCIS KIRBY, RETIRED UNITED STATES NAVY REAR ADMIRAL, FORMER  SPOKESPERSON FOR THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE: It's completely  inappropriate for the troops to do this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not supposed to--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Of course, nobody cared back when presidential candidate Barack  Obama signed memorabilia for the troops back in 2008. He had a D after his  name though instead of an R. Thankfully, not everybody's lost their minds.  Even some Liberals scolded the media for their hysteria.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID AXELROD, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, POLITICAL  CONSULTANT, ANALYST: It's - it's good that he went to see the troops,  important that he went to do it. He - he was criticized for it, obviously.  They wanted to address that. And so, I should - we should give him credit  where credit is due.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It just sends a - such a strong message that the - the  Trumps love our military, support our military, and what a great time to do  it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Well Joe Concha writes about Media for The Hill. He joins us now.  Joe, is this a good look for the media? Why are serving soldiers in a war  zone bringing particular hats to an event on base in a combat zone at  Christmas?</p><p>JOE CONCHA, THE HILL MEDIA REPORTER: Well the optics around that, Mark, are  horrific, right, because what you're doing here is it's - it's OK to go  after the President in terms of policy or the things that he says. </p><p>Once you start attacking the people that voted for him or military people  that are obviously serving overseas during Christmas, no less, then--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: --then you got a problem. And you have to ask yourself this  question, Mark. </p><p>Let's say, honestly, like you pointed out, as I did in my column today on  The Hill, if President Obama, as he did in 2008, signed a Hope and Change  t-shirts, do you really think any news organization would have gone ahead  with that story? Of course, they wouldn't have.</p><p>STEYN: No. I - I couldn't care less. Well what soldiers in these, frankly,  God-awful situations, because life in it - at a base in Iraq stinks. You -  it's not like being in Ramstein, Germany where the President was today. You  can't stroll down to town go to a local bar, meet one of the nice German  girls, or one of the local guy (ph), you know, that's nothing like that.</p><p>You're stuck in that lousy fortress that you hope is a fortress. And the  President comes to visit you. And the pre-occupation of the American media  is whether hats the troops chose to take to that event are somehow some  potential crime that they can be pulled up in front of a military court  for. I mean that's bonkers--</p><p>CONCHA: Yes, Mark, and--</p><p>STEYN: --isn't it?</p><p>CONCHA: --it's bonkers, yes. And I think that pivot happened because the  original narrative was, we - we'd all recall is that, President Trump was  supposed to be the first President since 2002 to not visit the troops at  Christmas. </p><p>And once that fell apart, when he literally landed in Iraq as the story was  going up and it originally came from NBC, then social media goes nuts. And  - and what happened was the pivot went from, \"Oh yes, OK. Trump went, sure,  but what was his motive exactly for going?\"</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CONCHA: I - I give you The Washington Post, Mark, quoting, the President's  visit follows months of public pressure for him to spend time with troops  deployed to conflicts in the Middle East. Think about that again, follows  months of public pressure.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: In other words, we, the media, got the public riled up to force  Trump to go to a war zone instead of him just going like every president  has done for the past 17 years.</p><p>STEYN: Well - well according to Soledad O'Brien, who's a lovely lady, but  she thought it was actually minutes of public pressure that Alyssa Milano  who - who actually tweeted as the President was halfway across the ocean,  why haven't you visited our troops, Soledad O - O'Brien actually gave  Alyssa Milano credit for shaming the President into getting on the plane  that he'd already gotten on.</p><p>CONCHA: Yes. And then what's forgotten in all this, of course, is if you  want to go to Walter Reed, let's say the President was shamed, and he goes  to Walter Reed, which is close to the White House, OK, then you could say  it's a last-minute thing. When you go to Iraq, you kind of have to plan it  in advance. You have to do it weeks in advance, obviously, for security.</p><p>Air Force One has to fly in with shades down and cellphones off and - and  all of that. So, you think you'd see though however, at least from NBC and  - and - and others, some remorse, some apology, some around, you know,  \"Hey, we went ahead with this story a little bit too early because we ran a  story on Christmas saying that the President hadn't been to see the troops  on Christmastime.\"</p><p>People don't mind that sort of transparency from the media. But yet, we  never see those sort of concessions. Instead, we see the pivots that are  negative like we always do in these situations. And that's why trust in  media is this. </p><p>Axios, SurveyMonkey poll just last year, 93 percent of Republicans think  that the media knowingly creates stories, makes them up, they're false. And  you say all right (ph), that's Republicans. They've always hated the media.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: They don't trust them. 79 percent of - of independents, Mark--</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>CONCHA: 53 percent of Democrats, even a majority, that's the thing. I mean  this is something that's going across the board--</p><p>STEYN: Sure (ph).</p><p>CONCHA: --in terms of all parties seeing exactly what's happening here,  sir.</p><p>STEYN: Hey Joe, thanks. Don't worry about that though. As soon as the media  call for a Special Counsel to investigate how those MAGA hats got to Iraq,  everything will be fine.</p><p>CONCHA: There you go (ph).</p><p>STEYN: Rochelle Ritchie is a former Press Secretary for the House  Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, and Rachel Campos-Duffy is  a Fox contributor, and they both join us.</p><p>Rochelle, how - stepping back and looking at this a little more objectively  than CNN &amp; Co. have done, is it really a good law - the troops liked the  guy. The guy got on with the troops. Is there really any political mileage  to be had in going on about this?</p><p>ROCHELLE RITCHIE, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY, HOUSE DEMOCRATIC POLICY AND  COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: So, I had a little bit of  a battle with myself about this. At first, I was saying, you know, no,  these men and women in uniform, they shouldn't have, you know, gotten their  hats signed. They shouldn't have been out there with Make America Great  Again hats.</p><p>And, you know, when you look at the facts, yes, it is a - it is breaking a  rule when it comes to the Department of Defense guidelines. But at the same  time, these troops have not seen an American President since 2009. I  believe Obama was the last one to - to go visit.</p><p>So, maybe they're not necessarily, you know, showing support for the  President or getting his signature because they are Republican--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, no, come on, who--</p><p>RITCHIE: --maybe - no, listen, listen--</p><p>STEYN: --no--</p><p>RITCHIE: --no, see, how can you disagree? I haven't even finished. </p><p>The Commander - it's their Commander-in-Chief. So, maybe it's not because  he's a Republican President. Maybe they're looking at it like he's the  Commander-in-Chief. We're proud to fight for our country or fight - we're  proud to stand behind our President--</p><p>STEYN: Let--</p><p>RITCHIE: --whether he has an R or a D behind his name. And, look, I could  really care less if the guys do it. As long as they're continuing to  protect our national security, have at it.</p><p>STEYN: Well Rochelle gave that theory rather more credit than I would  think, Rachel. I mean who the--</p><p>RITCHIE: I'm very balanced.</p><p>STEYN: --who the hell - if you have the misfortune to be spending Christmas  on one of those - those forts, cut off from life in the middle of the Iraqi  desert--</p><p>RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, AMERICAN TELEVISION PERSONALITY, FOX NEWS  CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.</p><p>STEYN: --who the hell cares what hat you take to a Christmas party  basically.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Of course, they shouldn't care. But I think the more  important question is why do - I mean - let's be honest. The reaction from  the troops was very overwhelmingly positive. And it should be. </p><p>Listen, Barack Obama decimated our military. Barack Obama--</p><p>RITCHIE: OK.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --wait a minute. He did. He cut funding for our military. He  put in rules of engagement that actually--</p><p>RITCHIE: But that's not even--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --caused - wait a minute that actually caused--</p><p>RITCHIE: But what does that have to do with--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --but let - let--</p><p>RITCHIE: --what we're talking about though with this Trump (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let - it does. It does have to do.</p><p>RITCHIE: --how?</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Because the - Barack Obama did all in - enacted rules of  engagement--</p><p>RITCHIE: I don't. It has nothing to do--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --Rochelle, let me finish. Rochelle--</p><p>RITCHIE: --OK. Go ahead, Rachel.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let me finish. He enacted rules of engagement that actually  put our military on the battlefield in danger--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --causing more battles (ph) but wait - wait a minute, Mark.  He did that.</p><p>RITCHIE: I'm sorry.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: And he went to the troops and they said he was a great  Commander-in-Chief. Donald Trump goes--</p><p>STEYN: Let me--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --over and does all this to not for Alyssa Milano or the  media - or the media. But he does it because he loves the troops. And they  say that he's doing it for a photo op.</p><p>STEYN: Oh--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: This is a man who loves the military.</p><p>STEYN: No, how (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was his number one issue.</p><p>RITCHIE: I - I--</p><p>STEYN: OK. How about this as a non-Democrat, non-Republican thing?  Democrats weren't in favor of the 21st Century Bush Wars, as they called  them.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right.</p><p>RITCHIE: Right.</p><p>STEYN: But nor was Donald - nor was Donald Trump in 2016.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: That's right.</p><p>STEYN: In - in a sense, Donald Trump is at odds with both Democrat policy  and Republican policy on the Middle East, Rochelle.</p><p>RITCHIE: Yes. He's definitely fighting both sides. And I think what - when  you talked about the press, I think the reason why the press is sort of  attacking on him, the - the Left-leaning press, I would say, is because of  some of the - the misleading comments that he made when he talked about the  pay raises for the military. We know that's not--</p><p>STEYN: Well they do - they did get the pay rises (ph).</p><p>RITCHIE: --necessarily true. They do get raises. But they're not getting a  10 percent raise. It's going to be, I think, 2.6 percent. So, I think there  are ways that the media was looking at it and attacking him for his less- than-knowledgeable education, I guess you could say, on what's really  happening--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: But (ph)--</p><p>RITCHIE: --there. But I don't I - I think that him visiting was a good  idea. I think there was an article by The Washington Post where it said  that he was actually scared to go over there for some time. So, I'm glad--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Ridiculous.</p><p>RITCHIE: --he got over that.</p><p>STEYN: That's a--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: He was not scared. And - and what would the media, you know,  betting MAGAs hats (ph) what would they have had him do? Say, \"Oh, I'm  sorry. I'm not going to sign your hat because of the Hatch Act,\" and then  they--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --would have criticized him and said--</p><p>RITCHIE: Well--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --\"Hey, what a jerk. He wouldn't sign a hat.\"</p><p>STEYN: By the way there's too much--</p><p>RITCHIE: I just - I just said I thought that was perfectly fine.</p><p>STEYN: --there's too much of that. The minute you--</p><p>RITCHIE: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --if you're seriously talking about soldiers doing something wrong  because they asked their Commander-in-Chief to sign a hat, then - then  you've flown the coop. That's not a land of law and things (ph)--</p><p>RITCHIE: I want to know (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It's - it's a bad look for the press. It's - the reason why  the American people hate the press and, by the way, the troops loved the  President because--</p><p>RITCHIE: Wait, wait, what is this? This is (ph) press--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --the troops love the President because he did sign a bill  that he took a lot of flack from the - from the Right for signing a big  bill that was--</p><p>RITCHIE: I think - I think--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --for funding the military.</p><p>RITCHIE: --I think that Trump's whole purpose--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: They love him.</p><p>RITCHIE: --of being there and - and this is - is - this is part of it, I  think that he also has a lot, I think, there was a - a part in this segment  right before you came to us about--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>RITCHIE: --this being public pressure. I think it's more political pressure  because of him, you know, General Kelly, then General Mattis, and so I  think that he's really trying to show that he has some sort of control of  what's happening right now in the middle in - in--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right. Why didn't - why didn't the--</p><p>STEYN: No, no, no, no--</p><p>RITCHIE: --Iraq. But then - but--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --why doesn't that criticism come to Barack Obama? He goes to  visit the troop, no one questions his motives.</p><p>RITCHIE: Well Obama is living his best life somewhere (ph).</p><p>STEYN: No, but it's a - that - you can't do--</p><p>RITCHIE: Can we leave him out of it?</p><p>STEYN: --those--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: But - but there is a double standard. And that is what people  are talking about, Rochelle.</p><p>STEYN: We got to - we got to go, ladies.</p><p>RITCHIE: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Iraq's a crazy place. You can't just plan those things with no  notice.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Absolutely, I agree (ph).</p><p>RITCHIE: No, you can't.</p><p>STEYN: Rochelle and Rachel will carry--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was Alyssa Milano.</p><p>STEYN: --this - this ones (ph) and they're going to take this to the green  room - where now - this is worse than the Sunni Triangle, the violence  that's like (ph) percolating it.</p><p>We're now on day six of the government shutdown triggered by Congress'  refusal to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. </p><p>Today, the President tweeted, \"Have the Democrats finally realized that we  desperately need border security and a wall on the Southern border? We need  to stop drugs, human trafficking, gang members, and criminals from coming  into our country. And do the Dems realize that most of the people not  getting paid are Democrats?\"</p><p>Fox Washington Correspondent, Rich Edson, joins us with more on the  situation in D.C. It's all yours.</p><p>RICH EDSON, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p>Congress officially and briefly gaveled in this afternoon though there is  no sign of this shutdown ending anytime soon as Democrats in (ph) the White  House are a few billion dollars apart on funding for a wall on the Southern  border. President Trump has returned to the White House after visiting U.S.  forces yesterday in Iraq.</p><p>He's just tweeted, \"This isn't about the wall. Everybody knows that a wall  will work perfectly. In Israel, the wall works 99.9 percent. This is only  about the Dems not letting Donald Trump and the Republicans have a win.  They may have the 10 Senate votes. But we have the issue, border security.  2020.\"</p><p>In a statement, White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders says,  \"The President and his team in Washington over Christmas hoping to  negotiate a deal that would stop the dangerous crisis on the border,  protect American communities, and re-open the government, the Democrats  decided to go home.\"</p><p>She also says the Administration offered Democrats what she calls a  reasonable common-sense solution five days ago, though a spokesperson for  House Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, says, \"Democrats have offered  Republicans three options to re-open the government that all include  funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security, but not the  President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall.\"</p><p>While in Iraq, President Trump stressed the funding bill must include money  for a border wall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The folks are saying, \"Can  we have some drones? Can we have technology?\" Technology is bells and  whistles. You have to have a wall. You have to have protection. </p><p>When you say, \"How long is it going to take?\" \"When are they going to say  that we need border security?\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON: Pelosi's office says Democrats will pass their bill to open the  government after they take control of the House next week. Though to end  this shutdown, the House, the Senate, and the White House must all agree on  the same funding bill.</p><p>On Capitol Hill, House Freedom Caucus Chairman, Mark Meadows, says the  needle has moved towards a very long shutdown, as Democrats and Republicans  appear to talk past one another.</p><p>Mark?</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Rich.</p><p>This is a Fox News Alert. Police in California are on the hunt for an  unnamed illegal immigrant, suspected of murdering a police officer.  Corporal Ronil Singh, an immigrant from Fiji, was gunned down Wednesday  morning during a traffic stop. Police have released surveillance footage of  the suspect, and say they believe he is still in the area. We will continue  to monitor this breaking story. </p><p>And coming up, Tucker will be back with us to discuss the crisis of  American manhood. Plus, President Trump insists the government won't re- open until he has money for his wall. But if he gets it, will that wall  work? That's next on TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STEYN: El Paso, Texas is turning into Exhibit A of America's broken  immigration system. ICE has been overwhelmed by asylum requests and  shackled by court rulings, and it's now releasing hundreds of migrants onto  the streets of El Paso.</p><p>The message to future migrants, of course, is that America is powerless to  stop them from settling here. Fox's Jonathan Hunt is here with more.  Jonathan?</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, CHIEF CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, says the immigration system  is at breaking point. Border Patrol agents say they're overwhelmed. Around  1,000 immigrants have been released onto the streets of El Paso, Texas this  week alone. </p><p>And two young immigrant children have died after being taken into custody  by Customs and Border Protection agents, the first deaths of children in  CBP custody for a decade.</p><p>In El Paso, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say they have  little choice but to release those hundreds of immigrants because of,  quote, decades of inaction by Congress that they say has limited their  ability to remove families who are in the U.S. illegally, and has set  limits on how long they can hold those families.</p><p>So, they're being dropped off at a bus station in El Paso, where aid groups  are offering support. More, by the way, are expected to be released today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DYLAN CORBETT, DIRECTOR, HOPE BORDER INSTITUTE (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): They  have spent eight to 10 days in cells. Now they've been released. What we've  been doing as a community is to support them, giving them food, a place for  them to stay at night.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT: President Trump has repeatedly said the era of so-called catch and  release has ended. But frankly, that is exactly what is happening in Texas  right now. And it all comes against the backdrop of the government shutdown  over President Trump's demand for a Border wall that he says could stem the  flow of illegal immigration.</p><p>The wall and, of course, the deaths of those two immigrant children will no  doubt top the agenda when Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen visits the  Border area in El Paso, Texas, Friday, and Yuma, Arizona, Saturday. </p><p>Mark?</p><p>STEYN: Just - just to be clear on that, Jonathan, ICE can hold these people  if that chap is right for - for 10 days or whatever. And then meanwhile  they're given a two-year court date. So, in the gap between the 10 days and  the two years, they just get to hang out in America? That's - that's the  idea of it (ph)?</p><p>HUNT: Right. Well what - what ICE is saying is that under the current laws,  they have no choice but to release these immigrants after that time frame.  And, therefore, they take them to the bus station and then, yes,  essentially they are free to go where they wish to do as they please, Mark.</p><p>STEYN: Well that seems a bit of a design flaw, Jonathan.</p><p>While - while migrants continue to pour into the United States, critics of  the President maintain that nothing can be done because a wall's useless.  CNN's Brian Karem recently ranted about the futility of mankind's oldest  defensive mechanism.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN KAREM, JOURNALIST, PLAYBOY'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, CNN  POLITICAL  ANALYST, FORMER EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY SENTINEL: This  whole issue is a crock from start to finish. He picked it up on the  campaign trail as something to appease the masses and play to his base. </p><p>It's not going to stop terrorism. It's not going to be 2,000 miles long, as  originally planned. It's not going to be see-through. It's not going to be  eco- friendly. It's not going to be slats or heads on pikes or a beaded  curtain or anything else. You can't wall that border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Jimmy Kimmel, meanwhile, has been ridiculing, Americans were so  desperate for a secure border they've been willing to donate to a GoFundMe  campaign for it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!: This - this  Trump supporter, guy named Brian Kolfage, started a GoFundMe campaign to  raise a billion dollars for the wall. He launched it on Sunday. It's  already up to almost $9 million. People - this is what people do with their  disposable income when they don't have loans from college to pay off.</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: Donating money for a wall that will never exist. It - it's like  starting a college fund for Harry Potter.</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: It's a - it's a - a more useful thing to do with your money would  be to go outside and feed it to a bird. But--</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: --you do have to admire the sacrifice they're making. I mean lot of  these people are dipping into their meth money for this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Got it. Meth heads for national security. Thank you, Jimmy. So,  would a wall work or not?</p><p>Jason Piccolo is a former Special Agent and Supervisor with the Department  of Homeland Security, and he joins us now. </p><p>Everybody's mocking this. We've had Nancy Pelosi doing her beaded curtain  line. At this stage, I would welcome a 2,000 mile beaded curtain along the  Southern border. It would show a certain kind of resolve. But are these  critics right that this thing doesn't work, doesn't make any difference,  complete waste of time?</p><p>JASON PICCOLO, FORMER ICE SUPERVISOR, OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM VETERAN: No,  it'll work. Now the border is 2,000 miles long. And you won't be able to  actually wall the whole border. But that'll create chokepoints or - or  points where we could actually apprehend the immigrants coming in.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, well--</p><p>PICCOLO: So, yes, a wall would work.</p><p>STEYN: --yes. What's interesting to me is that if you look at up on the  Northern border, where there's far fewer people coming across, there's not  caravans massing on the 49th parallel, and yet, the United States  government has actually put physical barricades in a lot of cross border  towns on the Canadian border, presumably because it works there. </p><p>So, why would it not work on the Mexican border?</p><p>PICCOLO: Walls work. They do. Now, when I worked on a border, the border  was simply a strand of fence in some areas like a strand of wire. Now, you  have narco-traffickers coming across that same area. You have economic  migrants, it's just it's open. The whole border is pretty much open except  for, you know, few miles here and there.</p><p>STEYN: When - when you say it's open, because most - most people who cross  international frontiers legitimately will do so at big border posts. </p><p>But you're saying that even though we talk about this incessantly, there  are actually 100-mile stretches where people can actually just walk into  the United States, a country that's supposedly been on Orange Alert for 17  years.</p><p>PICCOLO: Yes, definitely. Now, I was on the DHS' human smuggling cell back  in 2015. And we tracked human smuggling corridors coming up from South  America. </p><p>Now, you do have Special Interest Aliens transiting into South America,  into Brazil, and traveling up those same routes that the economic migrants  and the narco-traffickers are using. So there--</p><p>STEYN: So--</p><p>PICCOLO: --anybody can come and go through that border.</p><p>STEYN: So you mean - you mean, when you say Special Interest Aliens, you -  you mean that potential jihadists have figured out. They - they look at  what's on their TV screens on the Rio Grande, and figure that instead of  trying to fly to JFK, you might as well just go to Latin America and walk  into the country.</p><p>PICCOLO: You can. The border's open. Now, I detailed out in Ajo, Arizona at  one time back in the early 2000s. And it was literally one strand of barbed  wire. So, yes, you could - anybody could walk across that border when the  various (ph) intent are with coming here for economic migration.</p><p>STEYN: A strand of barbed wire. That seems even more useless than the  beaded curtain. Jason, thank you for that. And thank you for the eyewitness  testimony on that Southern border. I'm not sure people actually visualize  it quite the way you know it.</p><p>Coming up, Tucker's going to be here to discuss the declining fortunes of  American men. And Paris is still coping with riots after the government  tried to levy a carbon tax. So, why do lawmakers want a carbon tax here?  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STEYN: It was another chaotic day on Wall Street today. Yesterday, the Dow  Jones average had its largest single-day gain in history. Today, the  average went on another downward streak falling by 600 points. </p><p>But in the afternoon, the market rallied surging almost 900 points to  finish the day up by 258 points. The market is still down about 2,500  points this month in what's been a very tumultuous end to the year. It's  like these algorithms just fell face-down in the eggnog.</p><p>The French have been rioting for more than a month now after Emmanuel  Macron's government tried to impose an anti-global warming gas tax upon  them. Nevertheless, a lot of Americans, including the outgoing Senator Jeff  Flake, think it's time for America to have its own carbon tax. Is that  wise?</p><p>Mark Reynolds is Executive Director of the Citizens Climate Lobby, and he  joins us. Mark, when you see what's happening in France, that's a more  extreme version of what happens when carbon taxes are actually put into  place elsewhere. People don't seem to like it, don't seem to care for it.</p><p>MARK REYNOLDS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CITIZENS CLIMATE LOBBY: First of all,  thank you so much for having me on the show. The nice thing about the  Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is that it actually puts money in  people's pockets. So, I think that there's people who are suffering both  here and in other countries. </p><p>And I think that the reason that there's so much Republicans' support -  support on both the House and the Senate version of this bill is it  actually sends, allocates money back to households, so that they are  prepared to deal with whatever they have to.</p><p>And again--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --it doesn't tell them what to do with that money, just lets them  make a choice about whatever they want to do with it.</p><p>STEYN: Well let me tell - this is the bill that's being proposed in - the  carbon tax is being proposed in the United States, which under the proposal  supposedly then gives money back to households. But here's one big problem  with it, Mark.</p><p>Basically, the automatic increases kick in, I think, starting around 2022,  and they basically go all the way up until mid-century. So, and it's beyond  the control of other congresses. It just becomes like an entitlement  program that gets automatic increases every year and is beyond the control.</p><p>You can't go to a polling station if you don't like it, if the facts  change, if the circumstances change. It essentially puts the carbon tax  beyond democratic - democratic accountability, doesn't it?</p><p>REYNOLDS: Well Representative Francis Rooney, who's the lead Republican  sponsor from Florida says that he likes this bill because it's market- based. It actually lets the market determine how we get to the new energy  economy. </p><p>I think that's a lot of what Mr. Fitzpatrick, one of the Republicans on the  bill also said is, is, you know, you put a fee on carbon-based emissions,  you give the money back to households so that the government doesn't pick  what to do with it. You don't pick winners and losers. It'll be up for you  to--</p><p>STEYN: What about--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --to you and I to determine what we do with a dividend. But it'll  be actually a free-market bill--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --and that's what the Republicans on the bill said they like  about it so much.</p><p>STEYN: What do you make of the CEI, the Competitive Enterprise Institute's  objection to it that it will actually kill America's new energy  independence, which is a phenomenon in the last few years, what we see with  fracking and so forth, and means we're no longer dependent on malign Saudi  sheiks who use their oil riches to spread their Wahhabist ideology around  the world. </p><p>The CEI's view is that the carbon tax is going to kill American energy  independence.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. So, I think there's something really interesting happening  right now. There's actually a race to the new energy economy. And it's  probably going to be either us or China. China is making a huge investment  in renewable energy. And I heard - certainly hope it's us.</p><p>So, what I think that this bill does is creates enough incentive throughout  the entire--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --economic system to create all the type of--</p><p>STEYN: --wait, wait.</p><p>REYNOLDS: --innovation that we know we need.</p><p>STEYN: But there's no carbon tax in China. The Yangtze is like the most  polluted river in the world the - with the - with what's coming down that  stream every day. It's nothing you'd want any of your kids to be gambling  and frolicking in.</p><p>So, they won't wait - what - what the French - the - the French protesters  object to is that this is their lives. It's not a theory. It's not a  macroeconomic theory. If it's a choice between sea levels in Tuvalu in the  22nd Century or how they have to live their lives in the century they're  actually living in, they'll prioritize the reality of their lives over  speculation a century hence.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. I think that that's why so many Republicans like this bill  in both the House and Senate is because money's actually returned. You get  a monthly check and then it's your choice what you do with it. </p><p>I'm not going to tell you what to do with the money. The government's not  going to tell you what to - what to do with the money. It's going to be up  to American households to determine what to do.</p><p>STEYN: And - and you believe - and you believe that's good at - because  everything you - they always say that and then it goes into the General  Fund. The gas - gasoline taxes, they were supposed to be about it and they  all go into it (ph). Well we'll - we'll see how it works out. I don't see  the public appetite for it. </p><p>But, Mark, thank you for - thank you for talking with us today. And happy  post--</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. And thank you for - thank you for having me on. And let me  just say to the people who are watching, there is one of our chapters in  every community out there from Boise, Idaho, to Birmingham, Alabama. If you  want to work with people on solutions, we have a big tent, and we would  love to see you in your neighborhood.</p><p>STEYN: OK. Big tents we like. And we won't heat them with conventional  energy sources.</p><p>REYNOLDS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Thank you for that, Mark. Happy post-Boxing Day to you. </p><p>It's time for Tucker's Final Exam. Have you been following the news over  the Christmas period? Find out if you can remember it better than the big- time professionals here at Fox. That's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: FINAL EXAM.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Oh, you know what that music means. It's time for Tucker's Final  Exam where the news professionals are interrogated, see if they can  actually remember the events they cover every day. </p><p>This week's Final Exam is a New York Special. We have Kennedy, the last  non-guest host in the building. And also - and also with us, from FOX News  Headlines 24/7, Carley Shimkus.</p><p>And actually, speaking of guest hosting, Carley will actually be in this  slot on Monday night. But for some reason we're going to stick her outside- -</p><p>LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, KENNEDY HOST, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: --for the duration of the show. And then Kennedy will follow Carley.  So, this is the Fox New Year's Eve team. You'll--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Right.</p><p>STEYN: --you'll get a heads-up on ahead. Stay ahead of (ph)--</p><p>CARLEY SHIMKUS, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 REPORTER: We're going to have lot  of fun.</p><p>STEYN: --tuning in. OK, contestants, hands on buzzers. I'm going to ask the  questions. And the first one to buzz in gets to answer. But you must wait  until I finish asking. </p><p>You can answer once and I shall acknowledge you, according to rules set by  the International Quiz Show Committee in Geneva, by saying your name.  Correct answer's worth one point. Get it wrong, you lose a point. Best of  five wins. </p><p>Let's get started. Question one, an outgoing Democrat Senator just blasted  newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling her a shiny new object with cheap  rhetoric. Which lawmaker made those remarks?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: And it's Kennedy.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Claire McCaskill.</p><p>STEYN: Claire McCaskill. Let's roll that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLAIRE CONNER MCCASKILL, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MISSOURI: I don't  know her. I'm - I'm a little confused why she's the thing. But it's a good  example of what I'm talking about, a bright and shiny new object.</p><p>The rhetoric is cheap. Getting results is a lot harder.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Meow. Saucer of--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --milk for Senator McCaskill.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Don't let the door hit you where the Lord split you, Senator  McCaskill.</p><p>STEYN: So, that's first blood to Kennedy. One-Zip as we head into question  two.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: OK.</p><p>STEYN: This is critical for Carley. Otherwise she - she'll be losing that  New Year's Eve gig. Question--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: --question two. Former First Lady, Michelle Obama, is now the most  admired woman in all of America. That's according to a new Gallup poll. But  to get them, Michelle Obama had to bump another woman who'd held on to the  top spot for 17 years.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: Who was the other woman?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I know it (ph).</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: Oh. And it's Kennedy again.</p><p>SHIMKUS: It was just a guess from me anyway.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Hillary Clinton.</p><p>STEYN: Oh, come on. Hillary Clinton, the most admired woman in America? The  17 - are you kidding me? Let's roll that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Michelle Obama has overtaken Hillary Clinton as the  most admired woman in the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Good job. Oh, man. I'm getting cleaned (ph).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Clinton held that top spot on that list for 17 years.

I thought it - I - I wanted to say Oprah because--</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>SHIMKUS: --I thought - I feel like that - were truly is one of the most  admired women in America. But I think Hillary is now third and--</p><p>STEYN: No, yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: --Molly (ph) is in second or something like that.</p><p>STEYN: Oprah - Oprah is number two. But it's a tragedy--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --for Hillary. She was once the most admired--</p><p>SHIMKUS: She lost again.</p><p>STEYN: --woman in America and--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I blame the Latvian bot farm and misogyny.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Even though there are other women on the list, so--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Of course.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: --very misogynistic that she got the heave-ho.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>SHIMKUS: We are clearly on that list as well, four and five.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.

This is--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: --come on, come on Carley.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I just want one point.</p><p>STEYN: Come on, you don't want to be outside on New Year's Eve.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't.</p><p>STEYN: This - we'll give you - we'll give you a studio if you can turn this  thing around.</p><p>SHIMKUS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Question three. We recently told you about a popular calendar in  Russia, which features various images of a shirtless Vladimir Putin. That  same calendar is now a monster hit in another country and is outselling  ones featuring puny homegrown celebrities. Which country is it?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND) </p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p>STEYN: No, no. No. And this is (ph) - Kennedy.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: United States.</p><p>STEYN: Chest-less (ph) Putin in the United States?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Let's see.</p><p>STEYN: Doesn't sound likely.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm blushing.

There's nothing a Japanese lady likes than--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Putin and a fish (ph).</p><p>STEYN: --being in a hot tub with a KGB torturer. Kennedy, disastrous move  there. She's lost one point.</p><p>SHIMKUS: It's all right.</p><p>STEYN: So there's still everything to play for. It's Two-Zero. </p><p>Question four, multiple choice.</p><p>SHIMKUS: One-zero.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Isn't it two-ones?</p><p>STEYN: Oh, no, one - one-zero.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: One-zero. Yes, Carley--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh, I lost a point?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I thought - I thought I kept it and then--</p><p>STEYN: No, no, you - you lost it.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: --I thought I kept the other two (ph)--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, the two points (ph)--</p><p>STEYN: You're in huge trouble now.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh, boy.</p><p>STEYN: Question four. This is a multiple choice question. There's a crisis  on the International Space Station. Something mysterious was found by  astronauts inside a capsule that recently docked there. And Russian  officials say it's the result of a major breach. What was it they found?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I would--</p><p>STEYN: A, a sharp knife, B, a tiny hole, or C, a jar of pickles.</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>STEYN: And it's the trigger-happy Kennedy yet again.

Compared to women, they are far more likely  to drop out of school, fail to graduate, go to jail, not hold a job, commit  suicide, die of a drug overdose. </p><p>And yet, the establishment, and particularly, Democratic establishment  seems uninterested in all of this. And they think - they appear to think  that men are still too successful and need to be held back.</p><p>Andrew Yarrow is a former New York Times reporter, a Senior Fellow with the  Progressive Policy Institute. He just wrote an important new book called,  Man Out: Men on the Sidelines of American Life. He joins us tonight in  studio.</p><p>Mr. Yarrow - Yarrow, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>ANDREW YARROW, FORMER NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER, PROGRESSIVE POLICY  INSTITUTE  SENIOR FELLOW, MAN OUT AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker, it's a pleasure--</p><p>CARLSON: So, I should, perhaps if I'm (ph) saying--</p><p>YARROW: --yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --I don't think you're a conservative activist, and that I'm also  grateful that someone is saying this because the numbers support that it's  true.</p><p>YARROW: It is true. And, as you say, the problem has really largely been  ignored. I mean Democrats and a lot of people in the country don't see men  as having problems. But there are a lot of men who are struggling,  struggling with work, struggling in families, struggling with health, lot  of areas I touch on in my book.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, to such a great extent that it would seem a crisis that  affects everybody because, of course, men and women need each other to  reproduce on the most basic level, but also every - everybody has a father  or brother, sons--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --why do you think it's been ignored?</p><p>YARROW: Well, there's been a lot of political correctness in this country  that's kind of made the main narrative be that, you know, women are the  oppressed ones. And they have been historically--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: --oppressed. But, you know, that doesn't mean that there aren't a  lot of men struggling. I mean you don't - it's not a zero-sum game.</p><p>CARLSON: You're right.</p><p>YARROW: And--</p><p>CARLSON: But it's been presented as one that one sex succeeds only when  another moves backward. Where'd that assumption come from?</p><p>YARROW: Well, I think a lot of politics looks at things that way. And I  think it's - it's pretty unfortunate. But I think, you know, men have not  been, in many ways, good at advocating for themselves.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: I mean it's been interesting in the last few elections. A lot of  the political activists have been women. I mean you hear more from women  these days. I mean men aren't good at forming groups--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: --anymore.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you work at - at the Progressive Policy Institute. You're a  Fellow there. That's not the Heritage Foundation.</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: I think it's fair to say you probably work in a mostly Liberal  world.</p><p>YARROW: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What kind of reaction did your piece get among people you know?</p><p>YARROW: Well, it's interesting. Conservative media have tended to like it  more. It's, you know, it's kind of troubling that this should be a  bipartisan issue. </p><p>I mean all Americans should be doing well or should have the opportunity to  do well. And they should also have justice behind them. I mean men are  being accused wrongly. I mean there are a lot of awful things that men do.  Don't get me wrong but--</p><p>CARLSON: Well sure.</p><p>YARROW: --but, you know, the lack of due process in some of these sexual  assault allegations, it's, you know, it's pretty troubling. </p><p>CARLSON: It's just interesting because the most progressive President the  country's ever had, FDR, four terms, the first thing he did after getting  elected in 1932, the very first piece through the Congress was the CCC, the  Civilian Conservation Corps, which was--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --aimed at young men, just men between--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --18 and 25 or something like that--</p><p>YARROW: Right</p><p>CARLSON: --getting them back to work and restoring their vitality through  work. What would happen if a Democrat in the modern era suggested something  like that?</p><p>YARROW: Well, you think it would play well. You know, while the  unemployment statistics look good, there are a lot of men who've either  been pushed out of the labor force or dropped out. I mean they're about 17  - 18 percent of 25 to 64 year old men, who aren't working. </p><p>And, you know, there are a lot of men - younger men, who are neither in  school or working. So, you know, why is that? And, you know, why can't we  create better jobs for them? And yes, I mean you'd think a Democrat would  pitch some kind of jobs program.</p><p>CARLSON: I think I mean this is a longer conversation but I think the  answer is toxic masculinity.</p><p>YARROW: Yes, I mean the--</p><p>CARLSON: Whatever that means.</p><p>YARROW: Well, yes. I mean that's become the phrase du jour, I guess. I mean  there are clearly issues with masculinity. You know, I interviewed a lot of  men and some women around the country, about 200. And a lot of men told me,  a lot of, you know, even Liberal men said, \"Well feminism's done a lot for  women. But what's it done for me?\"</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's a - that's a fair question. And you ask it in this  book. Thank you for doing that.</p><p>YARROW: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Great to talk to you.</p><p>YARROW: Good to talk to you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: That's one of the biggest stories of our time, so is this one.</p><p>Big tech has become the greatest threat to Americans' privacy and personal  freedoms. But now, Americans seem to be wising up to that. A new survey  finds that Americans trust Facebook less than any other company. Also, a  growing number of Americans seeking treatment for tech addiction as they  find themselves unable to look away from social media, their smartphones or  video games.</p><p>Tom Kersting is a family therapist and the Author of Disconnected: How to  Reconnect Our Digitally Distracted Kids. I've read that book, and so should  you. And he joins us now.</p><p>Just to go with the Tucker, the big story of our time thing, when you look  at this so-called tech addiction, and you follow where that leads, you -  you do worry that in some ways these rinky-dinky little things that started  as cat video sites somehow basically re-wiring humanity.</p><p>TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: They are. I mean if we  looked out the back window right now and - and counted how many people were  walking by staring at their phones, you'd probably have 70 percent of them  doing that. </p><p>And when it comes to addiction which, obviously, I've studied in my  background, basically if anything, whether it's gambling, alcohol, drugs,  anything that's considered addictive its - if it's affecting one of the  following four, you could be diagnosed as - as an addict.</p><p>And the four things are, is it affecting your family, is it affecting your  health, is it affecting your job or your occupation, and is it affecting  have you had any legal issues?</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>KERSTING: And when we look at technology, we could check off each one of  those for many, many people. So, therefore, this whole addictive whether  it's a debate or not, I'm all about, I believe in a 100 percent.</p><p>STEYN: The - the difference being though that it's actually being kind of  organized on a global scale with--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --billions and billions of people. And when you look at children,  like middle-schoolers--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes, yes.</p><p>STEYN: --who've never known anything but this world, their behavior does  seem to be not where middle-schoolers were--</p><p>KERSTING: It's--</p><p>STEYN: --20, 50, 70 years ago.</p><p>KERSTING: --it's actually unbelievable. I tell people I - I - I get more  middle-school age kids with major anxiety disorders per year now--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --in my private practice than I did the previous 17 years  combined.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: And, you know, and you could - all the research that's done to  put - start to show that, starting to point to, you know, that the  absorption of social media, the lack of - of self, the lack of a sense of  self and so forth and how that's affecting the self-esteem and causing, you  know, issues with anxiety, depression, and other - other mental health -  health things.</p><p>STEYN: People do actually seem to prefer it though. You have a scene in  your book where you talk about when you were a young guy, just sitting at a  bar, you'd never know who's on the barstool next.</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: I can relate to that. Sometimes--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --you find yourself on the other side of the wall, you're sitting  next to an Australian, a Hungarian--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --you - you meet different people with different views. Now everyone  in the bar is just like--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --scrolling the phone.</p><p>KERSTING: When you go into the - the airport, if you travel, which, you  know--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --you do, I do. They have the screens in front of every barstool.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: So, like, you and I--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --instead of hanging out, talking with one another and--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --and kicking it off, now everybody's distracted by these  devices.</p><p>STEYN: Right. Sometimes--</p><p>KERSTING: So the--</p><p>STEYN: --you want to go where only Facebook knows--</p><p>KERSTING: --so - so it's like a - it's like--</p><p>STEYN: --you're in that area (ph).</p><p>KERSTING: --right. It's like bottles of wine dangling around if you're an  alcoholic--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --24 hours a day, seven days a week, you can't escape from it.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. That's - that's a - that's a - a worrying thing. As I said, I  think this is one of the biggest stories of time, Tom. I dread (ph) to  think--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --where we're going to be if - if we're - if we don't change it. But  how do we change it?</p><p>KERSTING: Well we have - it's - it's not something that's going to happen  overnight. We just have to keep creating awareness, having conversations  like you and I are having right now, so that people could see this. They  can understand the ramifications of these things. I'm one of the guys out  there, you know, that's lecturing--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --that's writing about it and that's out there trying to get  other people to do the same. And it's - it's going to be a slow process but  I think we're going to have to get there.</p><p>STEYN: OK. Well we will - we will hold you to that Tom because something -  these companies are bigger than countries now. </p><p>That is about it for us tonight. You can tune in each night at 8:00 to the  show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink.  And don't forget to DVR the show. That's less harmful, less addictive than  if you just go on Facebook and look at it. Don't bother with that. Just DVR  the show, if you haven't set that up already.</p><p>Now, this is exciting moment in the evening. We are going to lift Nancy  Pelosi's beaded curtain and find out who is guest-hosting for Sean Hannity  tonight. Oh, who is it going to be? They've lifted the beaded curtain. I  think I can see--</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR UTAH'S 3RD CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE COMMITTEE ON  OVERSIGHT  AND GOVERNMENT REFORM, COMMENTATOR: Oh, Mark.</p><p>STEYN: --Jason Kennedy filling in for Sean. Hey Jason--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p>STEYN: --oh, no, Jason Chaffetz. What--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Mark, thank you, great show.</p><p>STEYN: After all, hey by--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I always love it when you're on with Tucker.</p><p>STEYN: No.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I love it when you're on, so--</p><p>STEYN: Hey - hey, by--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: --thank you so much.</p><p>STEYN: --by the way, that was a terrific interview you did with Sam Johnson  today.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: And everyone should look at that. That was the best thing on TV this  morning.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well--</p><p>STEYN: Terrific stuff.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you. Thanks to Fox &amp; Friends. We have - actually later in  the show, we're going to go back and tell you about Sam Johnson, a special  man, an amazing personality and a true American hero, so thanks, Mark. We  appreciate it.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Jason. Have a great show.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Mark Steyn in for Tucker. He's sleeping off his  Boxing Day Bacchanalia but he will join us later to discuss the ongoing  collapse of men in America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, yet another Liberal media meltdown. The mainstream media taking  the opportunity to turn a presidential visit to American troops into an  attack on Trump. Take a look at the hysteria as the talking heads accused  the President of turning the post-Christmas visit into a political event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY COMMENTATOR, CNN NATIONAL  SECURITY ANALYST: From a national security perspective, for all the reasons  that you just listed, the President should have stayed home.</p><p>JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, RETIRED MAJOR GENERAL, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: The  reason that he went now is that he couldn't go to Mar-a-Lago because the  government was shut down.</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN TONIGHT HOST, CNN: It was like we kept saying \"He's like the  Grinch.\" Instead of - I'm being honest.</p><p>CHARLES JOSEPH SCARBOROUGH, MORNING JOE CO-HOST, MSNBC: We should also be  concerned that Mr. Trump once again used a captive audience of American  heroes to push his unpopular domestic agenda.</p><p>Even in doing something right, he figures out a way to sow chaos.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It took far too long, especially compared to President  Obama who visited troops in Iraq in his first three months in office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STEYN: Over at CNN, attacking the President wasn't enough. They decided to  attack the troops as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBARA STARR, PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT, CNN: The pool reporters traveling  said that the troops brought the hats with them, including one hat that  said \"Trump 2020.\" We will have to see if that actually proves to be the  case. </p><p>The question is, if they - if they brought them or if the President brought  them, what commander allowed that to really happen, because this is very  much against military policy and regulation. Troops are not supposed to be  involved in political activities. The U.S. Military is not a political  force.</p><p>JOHN FRANCIS KIRBY, RETIRED UNITED STATES NAVY REAR ADMIRAL, FORMER  SPOKESPERSON FOR THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE: It's completely  inappropriate for the troops to do this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not supposed to--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Of course, nobody cared back when presidential candidate Barack  Obama signed memorabilia for the troops back in 2008. He had a D after his  name though instead of an R. Thankfully, not everybody's lost their minds.  Even some Liberals scolded the media for their hysteria.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID AXELROD, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, POLITICAL  CONSULTANT, ANALYST: It's - it's good that he went to see the troops,  important that he went to do it. He - he was criticized for it, obviously.  They wanted to address that. And so, I should - we should give him credit  where credit is due.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It just sends a - such a strong message that the - the  Trumps love our military, support our military, and what a great time to do  it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Well Joe Concha writes about Media for The Hill. He joins us now.  Joe, is this a good look for the media? Why are serving soldiers in a war  zone bringing particular hats to an event on base in a combat zone at  Christmas?</p><p>JOE CONCHA, THE HILL MEDIA REPORTER: Well the optics around that, Mark, are  horrific, right, because what you're doing here is it's - it's OK to go  after the President in terms of policy or the things that he says. </p><p>Once you start attacking the people that voted for him or military people  that are obviously serving overseas during Christmas, no less, then--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: --then you got a problem. And you have to ask yourself this  question, Mark. </p><p>Let's say, honestly, like you pointed out, as I did in my column today on  The Hill, if President Obama, as he did in 2008, signed a Hope and Change  t-shirts, do you really think any news organization would have gone ahead  with that story? Of course, they wouldn't have.</p><p>STEYN: No. I - I couldn't care less. Well what soldiers in these, frankly,  God-awful situations, because life in it - at a base in Iraq stinks. You -  it's not like being in Ramstein, Germany where the President was today. You  can't stroll down to town go to a local bar, meet one of the nice German  girls, or one of the local guy (ph), you know, that's nothing like that.</p><p>You're stuck in that lousy fortress that you hope is a fortress. And the  President comes to visit you. And the pre-occupation of the American media  is whether hats the troops chose to take to that event are somehow some  potential crime that they can be pulled up in front of a military court  for. I mean that's bonkers--</p><p>CONCHA: Yes, Mark, and--</p><p>STEYN: --isn't it?</p><p>CONCHA: --it's bonkers, yes. And I think that pivot happened because the  original narrative was, we - we'd all recall is that, President Trump was  supposed to be the first President since 2002 to not visit the troops at  Christmas. </p><p>And once that fell apart, when he literally landed in Iraq as the story was  going up and it originally came from NBC, then social media goes nuts. And  - and what happened was the pivot went from, \"Oh yes, OK. Trump went, sure,  but what was his motive exactly for going?\"</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CONCHA: I - I give you The Washington Post, Mark, quoting, the President's  visit follows months of public pressure for him to spend time with troops  deployed to conflicts in the Middle East. Think about that again, follows  months of public pressure.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: In other words, we, the media, got the public riled up to force  Trump to go to a war zone instead of him just going like every president  has done for the past 17 years.</p><p>STEYN: Well - well according to Soledad O'Brien, who's a lovely lady, but  she thought it was actually minutes of public pressure that Alyssa Milano  who - who actually tweeted as the President was halfway across the ocean,  why haven't you visited our troops, Soledad O - O'Brien actually gave  Alyssa Milano credit for shaming the President into getting on the plane  that he'd already gotten on.</p><p>CONCHA: Yes. And then what's forgotten in all this, of course, is if you  want to go to Walter Reed, let's say the President was shamed, and he goes  to Walter Reed, which is close to the White House, OK, then you could say  it's a last-minute thing. When you go to Iraq, you kind of have to plan it  in advance. You have to do it weeks in advance, obviously, for security.</p><p>Air Force One has to fly in with shades down and cellphones off and - and  all of that. So, you think you'd see though however, at least from NBC and  - and - and others, some remorse, some apology, some around, you know,  \"Hey, we went ahead with this story a little bit too early because we ran a  story on Christmas saying that the President hadn't been to see the troops  on Christmastime.\"</p><p>People don't mind that sort of transparency from the media. But yet, we  never see those sort of concessions. Instead, we see the pivots that are  negative like we always do in these situations. And that's why trust in  media is this. </p><p>Axios, SurveyMonkey poll just last year, 93 percent of Republicans think  that the media knowingly creates stories, makes them up, they're false. And  you say all right (ph), that's Republicans. They've always hated the media.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: They don't trust them. 79 percent of - of independents, Mark--</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>CONCHA: 53 percent of Democrats, even a majority, that's the thing. I mean  this is something that's going across the board--</p><p>STEYN: Sure (ph).</p><p>CONCHA: --in terms of all parties seeing exactly what's happening here,  sir.</p><p>STEYN: Hey Joe, thanks. Don't worry about that though. As soon as the media  call for a Special Counsel to investigate how those MAGA hats got to Iraq,  everything will be fine.</p><p>CONCHA: There you go (ph).</p><p>STEYN: Rochelle Ritchie is a former Press Secretary for the House  Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, and Rachel Campos-Duffy is  a Fox contributor, and they both join us.</p><p>Rochelle, how - stepping back and looking at this a little more objectively  than CNN &amp; Co. have done, is it really a good law - the troops liked the  guy. The guy got on with the troops. Is there really any political mileage  to be had in going on about this?</p><p>ROCHELLE RITCHIE, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY, HOUSE DEMOCRATIC POLICY AND  COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: So, I had a little bit of  a battle with myself about this. At first, I was saying, you know, no,  these men and women in uniform, they shouldn't have, you know, gotten their  hats signed. They shouldn't have been out there with Make America Great  Again hats.</p><p>And, you know, when you look at the facts, yes, it is a - it is breaking a  rule when it comes to the Department of Defense guidelines. But at the same  time, these troops have not seen an American President since 2009. I  believe Obama was the last one to - to go visit.</p><p>So, maybe they're not necessarily, you know, showing support for the  President or getting his signature because they are Republican--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, no, come on, who--</p><p>RITCHIE: --maybe - no, listen, listen--</p><p>STEYN: --no--</p><p>RITCHIE: --no, see, how can you disagree? I haven't even finished. </p><p>The Commander - it's their Commander-in-Chief. So, maybe it's not because  he's a Republican President. Maybe they're looking at it like he's the  Commander-in-Chief. We're proud to fight for our country or fight - we're  proud to stand behind our President--</p><p>STEYN: Let--</p><p>RITCHIE: --whether he has an R or a D behind his name. And, look, I could  really care less if the guys do it. As long as they're continuing to  protect our national security, have at it.</p><p>STEYN: Well Rochelle gave that theory rather more credit than I would  think, Rachel. I mean who the--</p><p>RITCHIE: I'm very balanced.</p><p>STEYN: --who the hell - if you have the misfortune to be spending Christmas  on one of those - those forts, cut off from life in the middle of the Iraqi  desert--</p><p>RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, AMERICAN TELEVISION PERSONALITY, FOX NEWS  CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.</p><p>STEYN: --who the hell cares what hat you take to a Christmas party  basically.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Of course, they shouldn't care. But I think the more  important question is why do - I mean - let's be honest. The reaction from  the troops was very overwhelmingly positive. And it should be. </p><p>Listen, Barack Obama decimated our military. Barack Obama--</p><p>RITCHIE: OK.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --wait a minute. He did. He cut funding for our military. He  put in rules of engagement that actually--</p><p>RITCHIE: But that's not even--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --caused - wait a minute that actually caused--</p><p>RITCHIE: But what does that have to do with--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --but let - let--</p><p>RITCHIE: --what we're talking about though with this Trump (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let - it does. It does have to do.</p><p>RITCHIE: --how?</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Because the - Barack Obama did all in - enacted rules of  engagement--</p><p>RITCHIE: I don't. It has nothing to do--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --Rochelle, let me finish. Rochelle--</p><p>RITCHIE: --OK. Go ahead, Rachel.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let me finish. He enacted rules of engagement that actually  put our military on the battlefield in danger--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --causing more battles (ph) but wait - wait a minute, Mark.  He did that.</p><p>RITCHIE: I'm sorry.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: And he went to the troops and they said he was a great  Commander-in-Chief. Donald Trump goes--</p><p>STEYN: Let me--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --over and does all this to not for Alyssa Milano or the  media - or the media. But he does it because he loves the troops. And they  say that he's doing it for a photo op.</p><p>STEYN: Oh--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: This is a man who loves the military.</p><p>STEYN: No, how (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was his number one issue.</p><p>RITCHIE: I - I--</p><p>STEYN: OK. How about this as a non-Democrat, non-Republican thing?  Democrats weren't in favor of the 21st Century Bush Wars, as they called  them.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right.</p><p>RITCHIE: Right.</p><p>STEYN: But nor was Donald - nor was Donald Trump in 2016.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: That's right.</p><p>STEYN: In - in a sense, Donald Trump is at odds with both Democrat policy  and Republican policy on the Middle East, Rochelle.</p><p>RITCHIE: Yes. He's definitely fighting both sides. And I think what - when  you talked about the press, I think the reason why the press is sort of  attacking on him, the - the Left-leaning press, I would say, is because of  some of the - the misleading comments that he made when he talked about the  pay raises for the military. We know that's not--</p><p>STEYN: Well they do - they did get the pay rises (ph).</p><p>RITCHIE: --necessarily true. They do get raises. But they're not getting a  10 percent raise. It's going to be, I think, 2.6 percent. So, I think there  are ways that the media was looking at it and attacking him for his less- than-knowledgeable education, I guess you could say, on what's really  happening--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: But (ph)--</p><p>RITCHIE: --there. But I don't I - I think that him visiting was a good  idea. I think there was an article by The Washington Post where it said  that he was actually scared to go over there for some time. So, I'm glad--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Ridiculous.</p><p>RITCHIE: --he got over that.</p><p>STEYN: That's a--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: He was not scared. And - and what would the media, you know,  betting MAGAs hats (ph) what would they have had him do? Say, \"Oh, I'm  sorry. I'm not going to sign your hat because of the Hatch Act,\" and then  they--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --would have criticized him and said--</p><p>RITCHIE: Well--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --\"Hey, what a jerk. He wouldn't sign a hat.\"</p><p>STEYN: By the way there's too much--</p><p>RITCHIE: I just - I just said I thought that was perfectly fine.</p><p>STEYN: --there's too much of that. The minute you--</p><p>RITCHIE: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --if you're seriously talking about soldiers doing something wrong  because they asked their Commander-in-Chief to sign a hat, then - then  you've flown the coop. That's not a land of law and things (ph)--</p><p>RITCHIE: I want to know (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It's - it's a bad look for the press. It's - the reason why  the American people hate the press and, by the way, the troops loved the  President because--</p><p>RITCHIE: Wait, wait, what is this? This is (ph) press--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --the troops love the President because he did sign a bill  that he took a lot of flack from the - from the Right for signing a big  bill that was--</p><p>RITCHIE: I think - I think--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --for funding the military.</p><p>RITCHIE: --I think that Trump's whole purpose--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: They love him.</p><p>RITCHIE: --of being there and - and this is - is - this is part of it, I  think that he also has a lot, I think, there was a - a part in this segment  right before you came to us about--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>RITCHIE: --this being public pressure. I think it's more political pressure  because of him, you know, General Kelly, then General Mattis, and so I  think that he's really trying to show that he has some sort of control of  what's happening right now in the middle in - in--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right. Why didn't - why didn't the--</p><p>STEYN: No, no, no, no--</p><p>RITCHIE: --Iraq. But then - but--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --why doesn't that criticism come to Barack Obama? He goes to  visit the troop, no one questions his motives.</p><p>RITCHIE: Well Obama is living his best life somewhere (ph).</p><p>STEYN: No, but it's a - that - you can't do--</p><p>RITCHIE: Can we leave him out of it?</p><p>STEYN: --those--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: But - but there is a double standard. And that is what people  are talking about, Rochelle.</p><p>STEYN: We got to - we got to go, ladies.</p><p>RITCHIE: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Iraq's a crazy place. You can't just plan those things with no  notice.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Absolutely, I agree (ph).</p><p>RITCHIE: No, you can't.</p><p>STEYN: Rochelle and Rachel will carry--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was Alyssa Milano.</p><p>STEYN: --this - this ones (ph) and they're going to take this to the green  room - where now - this is worse than the Sunni Triangle, the violence  that's like (ph) percolating it.</p><p>We're now on day six of the government shutdown triggered by Congress'  refusal to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. </p><p>Today, the President tweeted, \"Have the Democrats finally realized that we  desperately need border security and a wall on the Southern border? We need  to stop drugs, human trafficking, gang members, and criminals from coming  into our country. And do the Dems realize that most of the people not  getting paid are Democrats?\"</p><p>Fox Washington Correspondent, Rich Edson, joins us with more on the  situation in D.C. It's all yours.</p><p>RICH EDSON, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p>Congress officially and briefly gaveled in this afternoon though there is  no sign of this shutdown ending anytime soon as Democrats in (ph) the White  House are a few billion dollars apart on funding for a wall on the Southern  border. President Trump has returned to the White House after visiting U.S.  forces yesterday in Iraq.</p><p>He's just tweeted, \"This isn't about the wall. Everybody knows that a wall  will work perfectly. In Israel, the wall works 99.9 percent. This is only  about the Dems not letting Donald Trump and the Republicans have a win.  They may have the 10 Senate votes. But we have the issue, border security.  2020.\"</p><p>In a statement, White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders says,  \"The President and his team in Washington over Christmas hoping to  negotiate a deal that would stop the dangerous crisis on the border,  protect American communities, and re-open the government, the Democrats  decided to go home.\"</p><p>She also says the Administration offered Democrats what she calls a  reasonable common-sense solution five days ago, though a spokesperson for  House Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, says, \"Democrats have offered  Republicans three options to re-open the government that all include  funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security, but not the  President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall.\"</p><p>While in Iraq, President Trump stressed the funding bill must include money  for a border wall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The folks are saying, \"Can  we have some drones? Can we have technology?\" Technology is bells and  whistles. You have to have a wall. You have to have protection. </p><p>When you say, \"How long is it going to take?\" \"When are they going to say  that we need border security?\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON: Pelosi's office says Democrats will pass their bill to open the  government after they take control of the House next week. Though to end  this shutdown, the House, the Senate, and the White House must all agree on  the same funding bill.</p><p>On Capitol Hill, House Freedom Caucus Chairman, Mark Meadows, says the  needle has moved towards a very long shutdown, as Democrats and Republicans  appear to talk past one another.</p><p>Mark?</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Rich.</p><p>This is a Fox News Alert. Police in California are on the hunt for an  unnamed illegal immigrant, suspected of murdering a police officer.  Corporal Ronil Singh, an immigrant from Fiji, was gunned down Wednesday  morning during a traffic stop. Police have released surveillance footage of  the suspect, and say they believe he is still in the area. We will continue  to monitor this breaking story. </p><p>And coming up, Tucker will be back with us to discuss the crisis of  American manhood. Plus, President Trump insists the government won't re- open until he has money for his wall. But if he gets it, will that wall  work? That's next on TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STEYN: El Paso, Texas is turning into Exhibit A of America's broken  immigration system. ICE has been overwhelmed by asylum requests and  shackled by court rulings, and it's now releasing hundreds of migrants onto  the streets of El Paso.</p><p>The message to future migrants, of course, is that America is powerless to  stop them from settling here. Fox's Jonathan Hunt is here with more.  Jonathan?</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, CHIEF CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, says the immigration system  is at breaking point. Border Patrol agents say they're overwhelmed. Around  1,000 immigrants have been released onto the streets of El Paso, Texas this  week alone. </p><p>And two young immigrant children have died after being taken into custody  by Customs and Border Protection agents, the first deaths of children in  CBP custody for a decade.</p><p>In El Paso, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say they have  little choice but to release those hundreds of immigrants because of,  quote, decades of inaction by Congress that they say has limited their  ability to remove families who are in the U.S. illegally, and has set  limits on how long they can hold those families.</p><p>So, they're being dropped off at a bus station in El Paso, where aid groups  are offering support. More, by the way, are expected to be released today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DYLAN CORBETT, DIRECTOR, HOPE BORDER INSTITUTE (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): They  have spent eight to 10 days in cells. Now they've been released. What we've  been doing as a community is to support them, giving them food, a place for  them to stay at night.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT: President Trump has repeatedly said the era of so-called catch and  release has ended. But frankly, that is exactly what is happening in Texas  right now. And it all comes against the backdrop of the government shutdown  over President Trump's demand for a Border wall that he says could stem the  flow of illegal immigration.</p><p>The wall and, of course, the deaths of those two immigrant children will no  doubt top the agenda when Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen visits the  Border area in El Paso, Texas, Friday, and Yuma, Arizona, Saturday. </p><p>Mark?</p><p>STEYN: Just - just to be clear on that, Jonathan, ICE can hold these people  if that chap is right for - for 10 days or whatever. And then meanwhile  they're given a two-year court date. So, in the gap between the 10 days and  the two years, they just get to hang out in America? That's - that's the  idea of it (ph)?</p><p>HUNT: Right. Well what - what ICE is saying is that under the current laws,  they have no choice but to release these immigrants after that time frame.  And, therefore, they take them to the bus station and then, yes,  essentially they are free to go where they wish to do as they please, Mark.</p><p>STEYN: Well that seems a bit of a design flaw, Jonathan.</p><p>While - while migrants continue to pour into the United States, critics of  the President maintain that nothing can be done because a wall's useless.  CNN's Brian Karem recently ranted about the futility of mankind's oldest  defensive mechanism.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN KAREM, JOURNALIST, PLAYBOY'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, CNN  POLITICAL  ANALYST, FORMER EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY SENTINEL: This  whole issue is a crock from start to finish. He picked it up on the  campaign trail as something to appease the masses and play to his base. </p><p>It's not going to stop terrorism. It's not going to be 2,000 miles long, as  originally planned. It's not going to be see-through. It's not going to be  eco- friendly. It's not going to be slats or heads on pikes or a beaded  curtain or anything else. You can't wall that border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Jimmy Kimmel, meanwhile, has been ridiculing, Americans were so  desperate for a secure border they've been willing to donate to a GoFundMe  campaign for it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!: This - this  Trump supporter, guy named Brian Kolfage, started a GoFundMe campaign to  raise a billion dollars for the wall. He launched it on Sunday. It's  already up to almost $9 million. People - this is what people do with their  disposable income when they don't have loans from college to pay off.</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: Donating money for a wall that will never exist. It - it's like  starting a college fund for Harry Potter.</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: It's a - it's a - a more useful thing to do with your money would  be to go outside and feed it to a bird. But--</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: --you do have to admire the sacrifice they're making. I mean lot of  these people are dipping into their meth money for this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Got it. Meth heads for national security. Thank you, Jimmy. So,  would a wall work or not?</p><p>Jason Piccolo is a former Special Agent and Supervisor with the Department  of Homeland Security, and he joins us now. </p><p>Everybody's mocking this. We've had Nancy Pelosi doing her beaded curtain  line. At this stage, I would welcome a 2,000 mile beaded curtain along the  Southern border. It would show a certain kind of resolve. But are these  critics right that this thing doesn't work, doesn't make any difference,  complete waste of time?</p><p>JASON PICCOLO, FORMER ICE SUPERVISOR, OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM VETERAN: No,  it'll work. Now the border is 2,000 miles long. And you won't be able to  actually wall the whole border. But that'll create chokepoints or - or  points where we could actually apprehend the immigrants coming in.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, well--</p><p>PICCOLO: So, yes, a wall would work.</p><p>STEYN: --yes. What's interesting to me is that if you look at up on the  Northern border, where there's far fewer people coming across, there's not  caravans massing on the 49th parallel, and yet, the United States  government has actually put physical barricades in a lot of cross border  towns on the Canadian border, presumably because it works there. </p><p>So, why would it not work on the Mexican border?</p><p>PICCOLO: Walls work. They do. Now, when I worked on a border, the border  was simply a strand of fence in some areas like a strand of wire. Now, you  have narco-traffickers coming across that same area. You have economic  migrants, it's just it's open. The whole border is pretty much open except  for, you know, few miles here and there.</p><p>STEYN: When - when you say it's open, because most - most people who cross  international frontiers legitimately will do so at big border posts. </p><p>But you're saying that even though we talk about this incessantly, there  are actually 100-mile stretches where people can actually just walk into  the United States, a country that's supposedly been on Orange Alert for 17  years.</p><p>PICCOLO: Yes, definitely. Now, I was on the DHS' human smuggling cell back  in 2015. And we tracked human smuggling corridors coming up from South  America. </p><p>Now, you do have Special Interest Aliens transiting into South America,  into Brazil, and traveling up those same routes that the economic migrants  and the narco-traffickers are using. So there--</p><p>STEYN: So--</p><p>PICCOLO: --anybody can come and go through that border.</p><p>STEYN: So you mean - you mean, when you say Special Interest Aliens, you -  you mean that potential jihadists have figured out. They - they look at  what's on their TV screens on the Rio Grande, and figure that instead of  trying to fly to JFK, you might as well just go to Latin America and walk  into the country.</p><p>PICCOLO: You can. The border's open. Now, I detailed out in Ajo, Arizona at  one time back in the early 2000s. And it was literally one strand of barbed  wire. So, yes, you could - anybody could walk across that border when the  various (ph) intent are with coming here for economic migration.</p><p>STEYN: A strand of barbed wire. That seems even more useless than the  beaded curtain. Jason, thank you for that. And thank you for the eyewitness  testimony on that Southern border. I'm not sure people actually visualize  it quite the way you know it.</p><p>Coming up, Tucker's going to be here to discuss the declining fortunes of  American men. And Paris is still coping with riots after the government  tried to levy a carbon tax. So, why do lawmakers want a carbon tax here?  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STEYN: It was another chaotic day on Wall Street today. Yesterday, the Dow  Jones average had its largest single-day gain in history. Today, the  average went on another downward streak falling by 600 points. </p><p>But in the afternoon, the market rallied surging almost 900 points to  finish the day up by 258 points. The market is still down about 2,500  points this month in what's been a very tumultuous end to the year. It's  like these algorithms just fell face-down in the eggnog.</p><p>The French have been rioting for more than a month now after Emmanuel  Macron's government tried to impose an anti-global warming gas tax upon  them. Nevertheless, a lot of Americans, including the outgoing Senator Jeff  Flake, think it's time for America to have its own carbon tax. Is that  wise?</p><p>Mark Reynolds is Executive Director of the Citizens Climate Lobby, and he  joins us. Mark, when you see what's happening in France, that's a more  extreme version of what happens when carbon taxes are actually put into  place elsewhere. People don't seem to like it, don't seem to care for it.</p><p>MARK REYNOLDS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CITIZENS CLIMATE LOBBY: First of all,  thank you so much for having me on the show. The nice thing about the  Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is that it actually puts money in  people's pockets. So, I think that there's people who are suffering both  here and in other countries. </p><p>And I think that the reason that there's so much Republicans' support -  support on both the House and the Senate version of this bill is it  actually sends, allocates money back to households, so that they are  prepared to deal with whatever they have to.</p><p>And again--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --it doesn't tell them what to do with that money, just lets them  make a choice about whatever they want to do with it.</p><p>STEYN: Well let me tell - this is the bill that's being proposed in - the  carbon tax is being proposed in the United States, which under the proposal  supposedly then gives money back to households. But here's one big problem  with it, Mark.</p><p>Basically, the automatic increases kick in, I think, starting around 2022,  and they basically go all the way up until mid-century. So, and it's beyond  the control of other congresses. It just becomes like an entitlement  program that gets automatic increases every year and is beyond the control.</p><p>You can't go to a polling station if you don't like it, if the facts  change, if the circumstances change. It essentially puts the carbon tax  beyond democratic - democratic accountability, doesn't it?</p><p>REYNOLDS: Well Representative Francis Rooney, who's the lead Republican  sponsor from Florida says that he likes this bill because it's market- based. It actually lets the market determine how we get to the new energy  economy. </p><p>I think that's a lot of what Mr. Fitzpatrick, one of the Republicans on the  bill also said is, is, you know, you put a fee on carbon-based emissions,  you give the money back to households so that the government doesn't pick  what to do with it. You don't pick winners and losers. It'll be up for you  to--</p><p>STEYN: What about--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --to you and I to determine what we do with a dividend. But it'll  be actually a free-market bill--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --and that's what the Republicans on the bill said they like  about it so much.</p><p>STEYN: What do you make of the CEI, the Competitive Enterprise Institute's  objection to it that it will actually kill America's new energy  independence, which is a phenomenon in the last few years, what we see with  fracking and so forth, and means we're no longer dependent on malign Saudi  sheiks who use their oil riches to spread their Wahhabist ideology around  the world. </p><p>The CEI's view is that the carbon tax is going to kill American energy  independence.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. So, I think there's something really interesting happening  right now. There's actually a race to the new energy economy. And it's  probably going to be either us or China. China is making a huge investment  in renewable energy. And I heard - certainly hope it's us.</p><p>So, what I think that this bill does is creates enough incentive throughout  the entire--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --economic system to create all the type of--</p><p>STEYN: --wait, wait.</p><p>REYNOLDS: --innovation that we know we need.</p><p>STEYN: But there's no carbon tax in China. The Yangtze is like the most  polluted river in the world the - with the - with what's coming down that  stream every day. It's nothing you'd want any of your kids to be gambling  and frolicking in.</p><p>So, they won't wait - what - what the French - the - the French protesters  object to is that this is their lives. It's not a theory. It's not a  macroeconomic theory. If it's a choice between sea levels in Tuvalu in the  22nd Century or how they have to live their lives in the century they're  actually living in, they'll prioritize the reality of their lives over  speculation a century hence.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. I think that that's why so many Republicans like this bill  in both the House and Senate is because money's actually returned. You get  a monthly check and then it's your choice what you do with it. </p><p>I'm not going to tell you what to do with the money. The government's not  going to tell you what to - what to do with the money. It's going to be up  to American households to determine what to do.</p><p>STEYN: And - and you believe - and you believe that's good at - because  everything you - they always say that and then it goes into the General  Fund. The gas - gasoline taxes, they were supposed to be about it and they  all go into it (ph). Well we'll - we'll see how it works out. I don't see  the public appetite for it. </p><p>But, Mark, thank you for - thank you for talking with us today. And happy  post--</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. And thank you for - thank you for having me on. And let me  just say to the people who are watching, there is one of our chapters in  every community out there from Boise, Idaho, to Birmingham, Alabama. If you  want to work with people on solutions, we have a big tent, and we would  love to see you in your neighborhood.</p><p>STEYN: OK. Big tents we like. And we won't heat them with conventional  energy sources.</p><p>REYNOLDS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Thank you for that, Mark. Happy post-Boxing Day to you. </p><p>It's time for Tucker's Final Exam. Have you been following the news over  the Christmas period? Find out if you can remember it better than the big- time professionals here at Fox. That's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: FINAL EXAM.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Oh, you know what that music means. It's time for Tucker's Final  Exam where the news professionals are interrogated, see if they can  actually remember the events they cover every day. </p><p>This week's Final Exam is a New York Special. We have Kennedy, the last  non-guest host in the building. And also - and also with us, from FOX News  Headlines 24/7, Carley Shimkus.</p><p>And actually, speaking of guest hosting, Carley will actually be in this  slot on Monday night. But for some reason we're going to stick her outside- -</p><p>LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, KENNEDY HOST, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: --for the duration of the show. And then Kennedy will follow Carley.  So, this is the Fox New Year's Eve team. You'll--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Right.</p><p>STEYN: --you'll get a heads-up on ahead. Stay ahead of (ph)--</p><p>CARLEY SHIMKUS, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 REPORTER: We're going to have lot  of fun.</p><p>STEYN: --tuning in. OK, contestants, hands on buzzers. I'm going to ask the  questions. And the first one to buzz in gets to answer. But you must wait  until I finish asking. </p><p>You can answer once and I shall acknowledge you, according to rules set by  the International Quiz Show Committee in Geneva, by saying your name.  Correct answer's worth one point. Get it wrong, you lose a point. Best of  five wins. </p><p>Let's get started. Question one, an outgoing Democrat Senator just blasted  newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling her a shiny new object with cheap  rhetoric. Which lawmaker made those remarks?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: And it's Kennedy.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Claire McCaskill.</p><p>STEYN: Claire McCaskill. Let's roll that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLAIRE CONNER MCCASKILL, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MISSOURI: I don't  know her. I'm - I'm a little confused why she's the thing. But it's a good  example of what I'm talking about, a bright and shiny new object.</p><p>The rhetoric is cheap. Getting results is a lot harder.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Meow. Saucer of--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --milk for Senator McCaskill.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Don't let the door hit you where the Lord split you, Senator  McCaskill.</p><p>STEYN: So, that's first blood to Kennedy. One-Zip as we head into question  two.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: OK.</p><p>STEYN: This is critical for Carley. Otherwise she - she'll be losing that  New Year's Eve gig. Question--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: --question two. Former First Lady, Michelle Obama, is now the most  admired woman in all of America. That's according to a new Gallup poll. But  to get them, Michelle Obama had to bump another woman who'd held on to the  top spot for 17 years.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: Who was the other woman?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I know it (ph).</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: Oh. And it's Kennedy again.</p><p>SHIMKUS: It was just a guess from me anyway.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Hillary Clinton.</p><p>STEYN: Oh, come on. Hillary Clinton, the most admired woman in America? The  17 - are you kidding me? Let's roll that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Michelle Obama has overtaken Hillary Clinton as the  most admired woman in the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Good job. Oh, man. I'm getting cleaned (ph).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Clinton held that top spot on that list for 17 years.

I thought it - I - I wanted to say Oprah because--</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>SHIMKUS: --I thought - I feel like that - were truly is one of the most  admired women in America. But I think Hillary is now third and--</p><p>STEYN: No, yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: --Molly (ph) is in second or something like that.</p><p>STEYN: Oprah - Oprah is number two. But it's a tragedy--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --for Hillary. She was once the most admired--</p><p>SHIMKUS: She lost again.</p><p>STEYN: --woman in America and--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I blame the Latvian bot farm and misogyny.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Even though there are other women on the list, so--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Of course.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: --very misogynistic that she got the heave-ho.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>SHIMKUS: We are clearly on that list as well, four and five.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. Macedonian content farmers fixed that thing right (ph). It's  Two-Zip to Kennedy. This is--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: --come on, come on Carley.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I just want one point.</p><p>STEYN: Come on, you don't want to be outside on New Year's Eve.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't.</p><p>STEYN: This - we'll give you - we'll give you a studio if you can turn this  thing around.</p><p>SHIMKUS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Question three. We recently told you about a popular calendar in  Russia, which features various images of a shirtless Vladimir Putin. That  same calendar is now a monster hit in another country and is outselling  ones featuring puny homegrown celebrities. Which country is it?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND) </p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p>STEYN: No, no. No. And this is (ph) - Kennedy.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: United States.</p><p>STEYN: Chest-less (ph) Putin in the United States?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Let's see.</p><p>STEYN: Doesn't sound likely.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm blushing.

The popularity of the calendars is reportedly fueled by a surge in  self-proclaimed Putin fans. Get them while they're hot, ladies. Putin--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: While they're hot.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. There's nothing a Japanese lady likes than--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Putin and a fish (ph).</p><p>STEYN: --being in a hot tub with a KGB torturer. Kennedy, disastrous move  there. She's lost one point.</p><p>SHIMKUS: It's all right.</p><p>STEYN: So there's still everything to play for. It's Two-Zero. </p><p>Question four, multiple choice.</p><p>SHIMKUS: One-zero.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Isn't it two-ones?</p><p>STEYN: Oh, no, one - one-zero.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: One-zero. Yes, Carley--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh, I lost a point?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I thought - I thought I kept it and then--</p><p>STEYN: No, no, you - you lost it.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: --I thought I kept the other two (ph)--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, the two points (ph)--</p><p>STEYN: You're in huge trouble now.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh, boy.</p><p>STEYN: Question four. This is a multiple choice question. There's a crisis  on the International Space Station. Something mysterious was found by  astronauts inside a capsule that recently docked there. And Russian  officials say it's the result of a major breach. What was it they found?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I would--</p><p>STEYN: A, a sharp knife, B, a tiny hole, or C, a jar of pickles.</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>STEYN: And it's the trigger-happy Kennedy yet again.

Compared to women, they are far more likely  to drop out of school, fail to graduate, go to jail, not hold a job, commit  suicide, die of a drug overdose. </p><p>And yet, the establishment, and particularly, Democratic establishment  seems uninterested in all of this. And they think - they appear to think  that men are still too successful and need to be held back.</p><p>Andrew Yarrow is a former New York Times reporter, a Senior Fellow with the  Progressive Policy Institute. He just wrote an important new book called,  Man Out: Men on the Sidelines of American Life. He joins us tonight in  studio.</p><p>Mr. Yarrow - Yarrow, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>ANDREW YARROW, FORMER NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER, PROGRESSIVE POLICY  INSTITUTE  SENIOR FELLOW, MAN OUT AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker, it's a pleasure--</p><p>CARLSON: So, I should, perhaps if I'm (ph) saying--</p><p>YARROW: --yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --I don't think you're a conservative activist, and that I'm also  grateful that someone is saying this because the numbers support that it's  true.</p><p>YARROW: It is true. And, as you say, the problem has really largely been  ignored. I mean Democrats and a lot of people in the country don't see men  as having problems. But there are a lot of men who are struggling,  struggling with work, struggling in families, struggling with health, lot  of areas I touch on in my book.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, to such a great extent that it would seem a crisis that  affects everybody because, of course, men and women need each other to  reproduce on the most basic level, but also every - everybody has a father  or brother, sons--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --why do you think it's been ignored?</p><p>YARROW: Well, there's been a lot of political correctness in this country  that's kind of made the main narrative be that, you know, women are the  oppressed ones. And they have been historically--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: --oppressed. But, you know, that doesn't mean that there aren't a  lot of men struggling. I mean you don't - it's not a zero-sum game.</p><p>CARLSON: You're right.</p><p>YARROW: And--</p><p>CARLSON: But it's been presented as one that one sex succeeds only when  another moves backward. Where'd that assumption come from?</p><p>YARROW: Well, I think a lot of politics looks at things that way. And I  think it's - it's pretty unfortunate. But I think, you know, men have not  been, in many ways, good at advocating for themselves.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: I mean it's been interesting in the last few elections. A lot of  the political activists have been women. I mean you hear more from women  these days. I mean men aren't good at forming groups--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: --anymore.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you work at - at the Progressive Policy Institute. You're a  Fellow there. That's not the Heritage Foundation.</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: I think it's fair to say you probably work in a mostly Liberal  world.</p><p>YARROW: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What kind of reaction did your piece get among people you know?</p><p>YARROW: Well, it's interesting. Conservative media have tended to like it  more. It's, you know, it's kind of troubling that this should be a  bipartisan issue. </p><p>I mean all Americans should be doing well or should have the opportunity to  do well. And they should also have justice behind them. I mean men are  being accused wrongly. I mean there are a lot of awful things that men do.  Don't get me wrong but--</p><p>CARLSON: Well sure.</p><p>YARROW: --but, you know, the lack of due process in some of these sexual  assault allegations, it's, you know, it's pretty troubling. </p><p>CARLSON: It's just interesting because the most progressive President the  country's ever had, FDR, four terms, the first thing he did after getting  elected in 1932, the very first piece through the Congress was the CCC, the  Civilian Conservation Corps, which was--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --aimed at young men, just men between--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --18 and 25 or something like that--</p><p>YARROW: Right</p><p>CARLSON: --getting them back to work and restoring their vitality through  work. What would happen if a Democrat in the modern era suggested something  like that?</p><p>YARROW: Well, you think it would play well. You know, while the  unemployment statistics look good, there are a lot of men who've either  been pushed out of the labor force or dropped out. I mean they're about 17  - 18 percent of 25 to 64 year old men, who aren't working. </p><p>And, you know, there are a lot of men - younger men, who are neither in  school or working. So, you know, why is that? And, you know, why can't we  create better jobs for them? And yes, I mean you'd think a Democrat would  pitch some kind of jobs program.</p><p>CARLSON: I think I mean this is a longer conversation but I think the  answer is toxic masculinity.</p><p>YARROW: Yes, I mean the--</p><p>CARLSON: Whatever that means.</p><p>YARROW: Well, yes. I mean that's become the phrase du jour, I guess. I mean  there are clearly issues with masculinity. You know, I interviewed a lot of  men and some women around the country, about 200. And a lot of men told me,  a lot of, you know, even Liberal men said, \"Well feminism's done a lot for  women. But what's it done for me?\"</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's a - that's a fair question. And you ask it in this  book. Thank you for doing that.</p><p>YARROW: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Great to talk to you.</p><p>YARROW: Good to talk to you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: That's one of the biggest stories of our time, so is this one.</p><p>Big tech has become the greatest threat to Americans' privacy and personal  freedoms. But now, Americans seem to be wising up to that. A new survey  finds that Americans trust Facebook less than any other company. Also, a  growing number of Americans seeking treatment for tech addiction as they  find themselves unable to look away from social media, their smartphones or  video games.</p><p>Tom Kersting is a family therapist and the Author of Disconnected: How to  Reconnect Our Digitally Distracted Kids. I've read that book, and so should  you. And he joins us now.</p><p>Just to go with the Tucker, the big story of our time thing, when you look  at this so-called tech addiction, and you follow where that leads, you -  you do worry that in some ways these rinky-dinky little things that started  as cat video sites somehow basically re-wiring humanity.</p><p>TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: They are. I mean if we  looked out the back window right now and - and counted how many people were  walking by staring at their phones, you'd probably have 70 percent of them  doing that. </p><p>And when it comes to addiction which, obviously, I've studied in my  background, basically if anything, whether it's gambling, alcohol, drugs,  anything that's considered addictive its - if it's affecting one of the  following four, you could be diagnosed as - as an addict.</p><p>And the four things are, is it affecting your family, is it affecting your  health, is it affecting your job or your occupation, and is it affecting  have you had any legal issues?</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>KERSTING: And when we look at technology, we could check off each one of  those for many, many people. So, therefore, this whole addictive whether  it's a debate or not, I'm all about, I believe in a 100 percent.</p><p>STEYN: The - the difference being though that it's actually being kind of  organized on a global scale with--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --billions and billions of people. And when you look at children,  like middle-schoolers--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes, yes.</p><p>STEYN: --who've never known anything but this world, their behavior does  seem to be not where middle-schoolers were--</p><p>KERSTING: It's--</p><p>STEYN: --20, 50, 70 years ago.</p><p>KERSTING: --it's actually unbelievable. I tell people I - I - I get more  middle-school age kids with major anxiety disorders per year now--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --in my private practice than I did the previous 17 years  combined.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: And, you know, and you could - all the research that's done to  put - start to show that, starting to point to, you know, that the  absorption of social media, the lack of - of self, the lack of a sense of  self and so forth and how that's affecting the self-esteem and causing, you  know, issues with anxiety, depression, and other - other mental health -  health things.</p><p>STEYN: People do actually seem to prefer it though. You have a scene in  your book where you talk about when you were a young guy, just sitting at a  bar, you'd never know who's on the barstool next.</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: I can relate to that. Sometimes--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --you find yourself on the other side of the wall, you're sitting  next to an Australian, a Hungarian--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --you - you meet different people with different views. Now everyone  in the bar is just like--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --scrolling the phone.</p><p>KERSTING: When you go into the - the airport, if you travel, which, you  know--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --you do, I do. They have the screens in front of every barstool.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: So, like, you and I--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --instead of hanging out, talking with one another and--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --and kicking it off, now everybody's distracted by these  devices.</p><p>STEYN: Right. Sometimes--</p><p>KERSTING: So the--</p><p>STEYN: --you want to go where only Facebook knows--</p><p>KERSTING: --so - so it's like a - it's like--</p><p>STEYN: --you're in that area (ph).</p><p>KERSTING: --right. It's like bottles of wine dangling around if you're an  alcoholic--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --24 hours a day, seven days a week, you can't escape from it.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. That's - that's a - that's a - a worrying thing. As I said, I  think this is one of the biggest stories of time, Tom. I dread (ph) to  think--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --where we're going to be if - if we're - if we don't change it. But  how do we change it?</p><p>KERSTING: Well we have - it's - it's not something that's going to happen  overnight. We just have to keep creating awareness, having conversations  like you and I are having right now, so that people could see this. They  can understand the ramifications of these things. I'm one of the guys out  there, you know, that's lecturing--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --that's writing about it and that's out there trying to get  other people to do the same. And it's - it's going to be a slow process but  I think we're going to have to get there.</p><p>STEYN: OK. Well we will - we will hold you to that Tom because something -  these companies are bigger than countries now. </p><p>That is about it for us tonight. You can tune in each night at 8:00 to the  show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink.  And don't forget to DVR the show. That's less harmful, less addictive than  if you just go on Facebook and look at it. Don't bother with that. Just DVR  the show, if you haven't set that up already.</p><p>Now, this is exciting moment in the evening. We are going to lift Nancy  Pelosi's beaded curtain and find out who is guest-hosting for Sean Hannity  tonight. Oh, who is it going to be? They've lifted the beaded curtain. I  think I can see--</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR UTAH'S 3RD CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE COMMITTEE ON  OVERSIGHT  AND GOVERNMENT REFORM, COMMENTATOR: Oh, Mark.</p><p>STEYN: --Jason Kennedy filling in for Sean. Hey Jason--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p>STEYN: --oh, no, Jason Chaffetz. What--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Mark, thank you, great show.</p><p>STEYN: After all, hey by--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I always love it when you're on with Tucker.</p><p>STEYN: No.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I love it when you're on, so--</p><p>STEYN: Hey - hey, by--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: --thank you so much.</p><p>STEYN: --by the way, that was a terrific interview you did with Sam Johnson  today.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: And everyone should look at that. That was the best thing on TV this  morning.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well--</p><p>STEYN: Terrific stuff.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you. Thanks to Fox &amp; Friends. We have - actually later in  the show, we're going to go back and tell you about Sam Johnson, a special  man, an amazing personality and a true American hero, so thanks, Mark. We  appreciate it.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Jason. Have a great show.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Mark Steyn in for Tucker. He's sleeping off his Boxing Day Bacchanalia but he will join us later to discuss the ongoing collapse of men in America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, yet another Liberal media meltdown. The mainstream media taking the opportunity to turn a presidential visit to American troops into an attack on Trump. Take a look at the hysteria as the talking heads accused the President of turning the post-Christmas visit into a political event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY COMMENTATOR, CNN NATIONAL SECURITY ANALYST: From a national security perspective, for all the reasons that you just listed, the President should have stayed home.</p><p>JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, RETIRED MAJOR GENERAL, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: The reason that he went now is that he couldn't go to Mar-a-Lago because the government was shut down.</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN TONIGHT HOST, CNN: It was like we kept saying \"He's like the Grinch.\" Instead of - I'm being honest.</p><p>CHARLES JOSEPH SCARBOROUGH, MORNING JOE CO-HOST, MSNBC: We should also be concerned that Mr. Trump once again used a captive audience of American heroes to push his unpopular domestic agenda.</p><p>Even in doing something right, he figures out a way to sow chaos.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It took far too long, especially compared to President Obama who visited troops in Iraq in his first three months in office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Over at CNN, attacking the President wasn't enough. They decided to attack the troops as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBARA STARR, PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT, CNN: The pool reporters traveling said that the troops brought the hats with them, including one hat that said \"Trump 2020.\" We will have to see if that actually proves to be the case.</p><p>The question is, if they - if they brought them or if the President brought them, what commander allowed that to really happen, because this is very much against military policy and regulation. Troops are not supposed to be involved in political activities. The U.S. Military is not a political force.</p><p>JOHN FRANCIS KIRBY, RETIRED UNITED STATES NAVY REAR ADMIRAL, FORMER SPOKESPERSON FOR THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE: It's completely inappropriate for the troops to do this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not supposed to--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Of course, nobody cared back when presidential candidate Barack Obama signed memorabilia for the troops back in 2008. He had a D after his name though instead of an R. Thankfully, not everybody's lost their minds. Even some Liberals scolded the media for their hysteria.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID AXELROD, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, POLITICAL CONSULTANT, ANALYST: It's - it's good that he went to see the troops, important that he went to do it. He - he was criticized for it, obviously. They wanted to address that. And so, I should - we should give him credit where credit is due.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It just sends a - such a strong message that the - the Trumps love our military, support our military, and what a great time to do it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Well Joe Concha writes about Media for The Hill. He joins us now. Joe, is this a good look for the media? Why are serving soldiers in a war zone bringing particular hats to an event on base in a combat zone at Christmas?</p><p>JOE CONCHA, THE HILL MEDIA REPORTER: Well the optics around that, Mark, are horrific, right, because what you're doing here is it's - it's OK to go after the President in terms of policy or the things that he says.</p><p>Once you start attacking the people that voted for him or military people that are obviously serving overseas during Christmas, no less, then--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: --then you got a problem. And you have to ask yourself this question, Mark.</p><p>Let's say, honestly, like you pointed out, as I did in my column today on The Hill, if President Obama, as he did in 2008, signed a Hope and Change t-shirts, do you really think any news organization would have gone ahead with that story? Of course, they wouldn't have.</p><p>STEYN: No. I - I couldn't care less. Well what soldiers in these, frankly, God-awful situations, because life in it - at a base in Iraq stinks. You - it's not like being in Ramstein, Germany where the President was today. You can't stroll down to town go to a local bar, meet one of the nice German girls, or one of the local guy (ph), you know, that's nothing like that.</p><p>You're stuck in that lousy fortress that you hope is a fortress. And the President comes to visit you. And the pre-occupation of the American media is whether hats the troops chose to take to that event are somehow some potential crime that they can be pulled up in front of a military court for. I mean that's bonkers--</p><p>CONCHA: Yes, Mark, and--</p><p>STEYN: --isn't it?</p><p>CONCHA: --it's bonkers, yes. And I think that pivot happened because the original narrative was, we - we'd all recall is that, President Trump was supposed to be the first President since 2002 to not visit the troops at Christmas.</p><p>And once that fell apart, when he literally landed in Iraq as the story was going up and it originally came from NBC, then social media goes nuts. And - and what happened was the pivot went from, \"Oh yes, OK. Trump went, sure, but what was his motive exactly for going?\"</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CONCHA: I - I give you The Washington Post, Mark, quoting, the President's visit follows months of public pressure for him to spend time with troops deployed to conflicts in the Middle East. Think about that again, follows months of public pressure.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: In other words, we, the media, got the public riled up to force Trump to go to a war zone instead of him just going like every president has done for the past 17 years.</p><p>STEYN: Well - well according to Soledad O'Brien, who's a lovely lady, but she thought it was actually minutes of public pressure that Alyssa Milano who - who actually tweeted as the President was halfway across the ocean, why haven't you visited our troops, Soledad O - O'Brien actually gave Alyssa Milano credit for shaming the President into getting on the plane that he'd already gotten on.</p><p>CONCHA: Yes. And then what's forgotten in all this, of course, is if you want to go to Walter Reed, let's say the President was shamed, and he goes to Walter Reed, which is close to the White House, OK, then you could say it's a last-minute thing. When you go to Iraq, you kind of have to plan it in advance. You have to do it weeks in advance, obviously, for security.</p><p>Air Force One has to fly in with shades down and cellphones off and - and all of that. So, you think you'd see though however, at least from NBC and - and - and others, some remorse, some apology, some around, you know, \"Hey, we went ahead with this story a little bit too early because we ran a story on Christmas saying that the President hadn't been to see the troops on Christmastime.\"</p><p>People don't mind that sort of transparency from the media. But yet, we never see those sort of concessions. Instead, we see the pivots that are negative like we always do in these situations. And that's why trust in media is this.</p><p>Axios, SurveyMonkey poll just last year, 93 percent of Republicans think that the media knowingly creates stories, makes them up, they're false. And you say all right (ph), that's Republicans. They've always hated the media.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: They don't trust them. 79 percent of - of independents, Mark--</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>CONCHA: 53 percent of Democrats, even a majority, that's the thing. I mean this is something that's going across the board--</p><p>STEYN: Sure (ph).</p><p>CONCHA: --in terms of all parties seeing exactly what's happening here, sir.</p><p>STEYN: Hey Joe, thanks. Don't worry about that though. As soon as the media call for a Special Counsel to investigate how those MAGA hats got to Iraq, everything will be fine.</p><p>CONCHA: There you go (ph).</p><p>STEYN: Rochelle Ritchie is a former Press Secretary for the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, and Rachel Campos-Duffy is a Fox contributor, and they both join us.</p><p>Rochelle, how - stepping back and looking at this a little more objectively than CNN &amp; Co. have done, is it really a good law - the troops liked the guy. The guy got on with the troops. Is there really any political mileage to be had in going on about this?</p><p>ROCHELLE RITCHIE, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY, HOUSE DEMOCRATIC POLICY AND COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: So, I had a little bit of a battle with myself about this. At first, I was saying, you know, no, these men and women in uniform, they shouldn't have, you know, gotten their hats signed. They shouldn't have been out there with Make America Great Again hats.</p><p>And, you know, when you look at the facts, yes, it is a - it is breaking a rule when it comes to the Department of Defense guidelines. But at the same time, these troops have not seen an American President since 2009. I believe Obama was the last one to - to go visit.</p><p>So, maybe they're not necessarily, you know, showing support for the President or getting his signature because they are Republican--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, no, come on, who--</p><p>RITCHIE: --maybe - no, listen, listen--</p><p>STEYN: --no--</p><p>RITCHIE: --no, see, how can you disagree? I haven't even finished.</p><p>The Commander - it's their Commander-in-Chief. So, maybe it's not because he's a Republican President. Maybe they're looking at it like he's the Commander-in-Chief. We're proud to fight for our country or fight - we're proud to stand behind our President--</p><p>STEYN: Let--</p><p>RITCHIE: --whether he has an R or a D behind his name. And, look, I could really care less if the guys do it. As long as they're continuing to protect our national security, have at it.</p><p>STEYN: Well Rochelle gave that theory rather more credit than I would think, Rachel. I mean who the--</p><p>RITCHIE: I'm very balanced.</p><p>STEYN: --who the hell - if you have the misfortune to be spending Christmas on one of those - those forts, cut off from life in the middle of the Iraqi desert--</p><p>RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, AMERICAN TELEVISION PERSONALITY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Right.</p><p>STEYN: --who the hell cares what hat you take to a Christmas party basically.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Of course, they shouldn't care. But I think the more important question is why do - I mean - let's be honest. The reaction from the troops was very overwhelmingly positive. And it should be.</p><p>Listen, Barack Obama decimated our military. Barack Obama--</p><p>RITCHIE: OK.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --wait a minute. He did. He cut funding for our military. He put in rules of engagement that actually--</p><p>RITCHIE: But that's not even--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --caused - wait a minute that actually caused--</p><p>RITCHIE: But what does that have to do with--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --but let - let--</p><p>RITCHIE: --what we're talking about though with this Trump (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let - it does. It does have to do.</p><p>RITCHIE: --how?</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Because the - Barack Obama did all in - enacted rules of engagement--</p><p>RITCHIE: I don't. It has nothing to do--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --Rochelle, let me finish. Rochelle--</p><p>RITCHIE: --OK. Go ahead, Rachel.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let me finish. He enacted rules of engagement that actually put our military on the battlefield in danger--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --causing more battles (ph) but wait - wait a minute, Mark. He did that.</p><p>RITCHIE: I'm sorry.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: And he went to the troops and they said he was a great Commander-in-Chief. Donald Trump goes--</p><p>STEYN: Let me--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --over and does all this to not for Alyssa Milano or the media - or the media. But he does it because he loves the troops. And they say that he's doing it for a photo op.</p><p>STEYN: Oh--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: This is a man who loves the military.</p><p>STEYN: No, how (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was his number one issue.</p><p>RITCHIE: I - I--</p><p>STEYN: OK. How about this as a non-Democrat, non-Republican thing? Democrats weren't in favor of the 21st Century Bush Wars, as they called them.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right.</p><p>RITCHIE: Right.</p><p>STEYN: But nor was Donald - nor was Donald Trump in 2016.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: That's right.</p><p>STEYN: In - in a sense, Donald Trump is at odds with both Democrat policy and Republican policy on the Middle East, Rochelle.</p><p>RITCHIE: Yes. He's definitely fighting both sides. And I think what - when you talked about the press, I think the reason why the press is sort of attacking on him, the - the Left-leaning press, I would say, is because of some of the - the misleading comments that he made when he talked about the pay raises for the military. We know that's not--</p><p>STEYN: Well they do - they did get the pay rises (ph).</p><p>RITCHIE: --necessarily true. They do get raises. But they're not getting a 10 percent raise. It's going to be, I think, 2.6 percent. So, I think there are ways that the media was looking at it and attacking him for his less- than-knowledgeable education, I guess you could say, on what's really happening--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: But (ph)--</p><p>RITCHIE: --there. But I don't I - I think that him visiting was a good idea. I think there was an article by The Washington Post where it said that he was actually scared to go over there for some time. So, I'm glad--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Ridiculous.</p><p>RITCHIE: --he got over that.</p><p>STEYN: That's a--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: He was not scared. And - and what would the media, you know, betting MAGAs hats (ph) what would they have had him do? Say, \"Oh, I'm sorry. I'm not going to sign your hat because of the Hatch Act,\" and then they--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --would have criticized him and said--</p><p>RITCHIE: Well--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --\"Hey, what a jerk. He wouldn't sign a hat.\"</p><p>STEYN: By the way there's too much--</p><p>RITCHIE: I just - I just said I thought that was perfectly fine.</p><p>STEYN: --there's too much of that. The minute you--</p><p>RITCHIE: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --if you're seriously talking about soldiers doing something wrong because they asked their Commander-in-Chief to sign a hat, then - then you've flown the coop. That's not a land of law and things (ph)--</p><p>RITCHIE: I want to know (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It's - it's a bad look for the press. It's - the reason why the American people hate the press and, by the way, the troops loved the President because--</p><p>RITCHIE: Wait, wait, what is this? This is (ph) press--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --the troops love the President because he did sign a bill that he took a lot of flack from the - from the Right for signing a big bill that was--</p><p>RITCHIE: I think - I think--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --for funding the military.</p><p>RITCHIE: --I think that Trump's whole purpose--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: They love him.</p><p>RITCHIE: --of being there and - and this is - is - this is part of it, I think that he also has a lot, I think, there was a - a part in this segment right before you came to us about--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>RITCHIE: --this being public pressure. I think it's more political pressure because of him, you know, General Kelly, then General Mattis, and so I think that he's really trying to show that he has some sort of control of what's happening right now in the middle in - in--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right. Why didn't - why didn't the--</p><p>STEYN: No, no, no, no--</p><p>RITCHIE: --Iraq. But then - but--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --why doesn't that criticism come to Barack Obama? He goes to visit the troop, no one questions his motives.</p><p>RITCHIE: Well Obama is living his best life somewhere (ph).</p><p>STEYN: No, but it's a - that - you can't do--</p><p>RITCHIE: Can we leave him out of it?</p><p>STEYN: --those--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: But - but there is a double standard. And that is what people are talking about, Rochelle.</p><p>STEYN: We got to - we got to go, ladies.</p><p>RITCHIE: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Iraq's a crazy place. You can't just plan those things with no notice.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Absolutely, I agree (ph).</p><p>RITCHIE: No, you can't.</p><p>STEYN: Rochelle and Rachel will carry--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was Alyssa Milano.</p><p>STEYN: --this - this ones (ph) and they're going to take this to the green room - where now - this is worse than the Sunni Triangle, the violence that's like (ph) percolating it.</p><p>We're now on day six of the government shutdown triggered by Congress' refusal to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border.</p><p>Today, the President tweeted, \"Have the Democrats finally realized that we desperately need border security and a wall on the Southern border? We need to stop drugs, human trafficking, gang members, and criminals from coming into our country. And do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?\"</p><p>Fox Washington Correspondent, Rich Edson, joins us with more on the situation in D.C. It's all yours.</p><p>RICH EDSON, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p>Congress officially and briefly gaveled in this afternoon though there is no sign of this shutdown ending anytime soon as Democrats in (ph) the White House are a few billion dollars apart on funding for a wall on the Southern border. President Trump has returned to the White House after visiting U.S. forces yesterday in Iraq.</p><p>He's just tweeted, \"This isn't about the wall. Everybody knows that a wall will work perfectly. In Israel, the wall works 99.9 percent. This is only about the Dems not letting Donald Trump and the Republicans have a win. They may have the 10 Senate votes. But we have the issue, border security. 2020.\"</p><p>In a statement, White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders says, \"The President and his team in Washington over Christmas hoping to negotiate a deal that would stop the dangerous crisis on the border, protect American communities, and re-open the government, the Democrats decided to go home.\"</p><p>She also says the Administration offered Democrats what she calls a reasonable common-sense solution five days ago, though a spokesperson for House Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, says, \"Democrats have offered Republicans three options to re-open the government that all include funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security, but not the President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall.\"</p><p>While in Iraq, President Trump stressed the funding bill must include money for a border wall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The folks are saying, \"Can we have some drones? Can we have technology?\" Technology is bells and whistles. You have to have a wall. You have to have protection.</p><p>When you say, \"How long is it going to take?\" \"When are they going to say that we need border security?\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON: Pelosi's office says Democrats will pass their bill to open the government after they take control of the House next week. Though to end this shutdown, the House, the Senate, and the White House must all agree on the same funding bill.</p><p>On Capitol Hill, House Freedom Caucus Chairman, Mark Meadows, says the needle has moved towards a very long shutdown, as Democrats and Republicans appear to talk past one another.</p><p>Mark?</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Rich.</p><p>This is a Fox News Alert. Police in California are on the hunt for an unnamed illegal immigrant, suspected of murdering a police officer. Corporal Ronil Singh, an immigrant from Fiji, was gunned down Wednesday morning during a traffic stop. Police have released surveillance footage of the suspect, and say they believe he is still in the area. We will continue to monitor this breaking story.</p><p>And coming up, Tucker will be back with us to discuss the crisis of American manhood. Plus, President Trump insists the government won't re- open until he has money for his wall. But if he gets it, will that wall work? That's next on TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p>STEYN: El Paso, Texas is turning into Exhibit A of America's broken immigration system. ICE has been overwhelmed by asylum requests and shackled by court rulings, and it's now releasing hundreds of migrants onto the streets of El Paso.</p><p>The message to future migrants, of course, is that America is powerless to stop them from settling here. Fox's Jonathan Hunt is here with more. Jonathan?</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, CHIEF CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, says the immigration system is at breaking point. Border Patrol agents say they're overwhelmed. Around 1,000 immigrants have been released onto the streets of El Paso, Texas this week alone.</p><p>And two young immigrant children have died after being taken into custody by Customs and Border Protection agents, the first deaths of children in CBP custody for a decade.</p><p>In El Paso, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say they have little choice but to release those hundreds of immigrants because of, quote, decades of inaction by Congress that they say has limited their ability to remove families who are in the U.S. illegally, and has set limits on how long they can hold those families.</p><p>So, they're being dropped off at a bus station in El Paso, where aid groups are offering support. More, by the way, are expected to be released today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DYLAN CORBETT, DIRECTOR, HOPE BORDER INSTITUTE (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): They have spent eight to 10 days in cells. Now they've been released. What we've been doing as a community is to support them, giving them food, a place for them to stay at night.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT: President Trump has repeatedly said the era of so-called catch and release has ended. But frankly, that is exactly what is happening in Texas right now. And it all comes against the backdrop of the government shutdown over President Trump's demand for a Border wall that he says could stem the flow of illegal immigration.</p><p>The wall and, of course, the deaths of those two immigrant children will no doubt top the agenda when Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen visits the Border area in El Paso, Texas, Friday, and Yuma, Arizona, Saturday.</p><p>Mark?</p><p>STEYN: Just - just to be clear on that, Jonathan, ICE can hold these people if that chap is right for - for 10 days or whatever. And then meanwhile they're given a two-year court date. So, in the gap between the 10 days and the two years, they just get to hang out in America? That's - that's the idea of it (ph)?</p><p>HUNT: Right. Well what - what ICE is saying is that under the current laws, they have no choice but to release these immigrants after that time frame. And, therefore, they take them to the bus station and then, yes, essentially they are free to go where they wish to do as they please, Mark.</p><p>STEYN: Well that seems a bit of a design flaw, Jonathan.</p><p>While - while migrants continue to pour into the United States, critics of the President maintain that nothing can be done because a wall's useless. CNN's Brian Karem recently ranted about the futility of mankind's oldest defensive mechanism.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN KAREM, JOURNALIST, PLAYBOY'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST, FORMER EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY SENTINEL: This whole issue is a crock from start to finish. He picked it up on the campaign trail as something to appease the masses and play to his base.</p><p>It's not going to stop terrorism. It's not going to be 2,000 miles long, as originally planned. It's not going to be see-through. It's not going to be eco- friendly. It's not going to be slats or heads on pikes or a beaded curtain or anything else. You can't wall that border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Jimmy Kimmel, meanwhile, has been ridiculing, Americans were so desperate for a secure border they've been willing to donate to a GoFundMe campaign for it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!: This - this Trump supporter, guy named Brian Kolfage, started a GoFundMe campaign to raise a billion dollars for the wall. He launched it on Sunday. It's already up to almost $9 million. People - this is what people do with their disposable income when they don't have loans from college to pay off.</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: Donating money for a wall that will never exist. It - it's like starting a college fund for Harry Potter.</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: It's a - it's a - a more useful thing to do with your money would be to go outside and feed it to a bird. But--</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: --you do have to admire the sacrifice they're making. I mean lot of these people are dipping into their meth money for this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Got it. Meth heads for national security. Thank you, Jimmy. So, would a wall work or not?</p><p>Jason Piccolo is a former Special Agent and Supervisor with the Department of Homeland Security, and he joins us now.</p><p>Everybody's mocking this. We've had Nancy Pelosi doing her beaded curtain line. At this stage, I would welcome a 2,000 mile beaded curtain along the Southern border. It would show a certain kind of resolve. But are these critics right that this thing doesn't work, doesn't make any difference, complete waste of time?</p><p>JASON PICCOLO, FORMER ICE SUPERVISOR, OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM VETERAN: No, it'll work. Now the border is 2,000 miles long. And you won't be able to actually wall the whole border. But that'll create chokepoints or - or points where we could actually apprehend the immigrants coming in.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, well--</p><p>PICCOLO: So, yes, a wall would work.</p><p>STEYN: --yes. What's interesting to me is that if you look at up on the Northern border, where there's far fewer people coming across, there's not caravans massing on the 49th parallel, and yet, the United States government has actually put physical barricades in a lot of cross border towns on the Canadian border, presumably because it works there.</p><p>So, why would it not work on the Mexican border?</p><p>PICCOLO: Walls work. They do. Now, when I worked on a border, the border was simply a strand of fence in some areas like a strand of wire. Now, you have narco-traffickers coming across that same area. You have economic migrants, it's just it's open. The whole border is pretty much open except for, you know, few miles here and there.</p><p>STEYN: When - when you say it's open, because most - most people who cross international frontiers legitimately will do so at big border posts.</p><p>But you're saying that even though we talk about this incessantly, there are actually 100-mile stretches where people can actually just walk into the United States, a country that's supposedly been on Orange Alert for 17 years.</p><p>PICCOLO: Yes, definitely. Now, I was on the DHS' human smuggling cell back in 2015. And we tracked human smuggling corridors coming up from South America.</p><p>Now, you do have Special Interest Aliens transiting into South America, into Brazil, and traveling up those same routes that the economic migrants and the narco-traffickers are using. So there--</p><p>STEYN: So--</p><p>PICCOLO: --anybody can come and go through that border.</p><p>STEYN: So you mean - you mean, when you say Special Interest Aliens, you - you mean that potential jihadists have figured out. They - they look at what's on their TV screens on the Rio Grande, and figure that instead of trying to fly to JFK, you might as well just go to Latin America and walk into the country.</p><p>PICCOLO: You can. The border's open. Now, I detailed out in Ajo, Arizona at one time back in the early 2000s. And it was literally one strand of barbed wire. So, yes, you could - anybody could walk across that border when the various (ph) intent are with coming here for economic migration.</p><p>STEYN: A strand of barbed wire. That seems even more useless than the beaded curtain. Jason, thank you for that. And thank you for the eyewitness testimony on that Southern border. I'm not sure people actually visualize it quite the way you know it.</p><p>Coming up, Tucker's going to be here to discuss the declining fortunes of American men. And Paris is still coping with riots after the government tried to levy a carbon tax. So, why do lawmakers want a carbon tax here? That's next.</p><p>STEYN: It was another chaotic day on Wall Street today. Yesterday, the Dow Jones average had its largest single-day gain in history. Today, the average went on another downward streak falling by 600 points.</p><p>But in the afternoon, the market rallied surging almost 900 points to finish the day up by 258 points. The market is still down about 2,500 points this month in what's been a very tumultuous end to the year. It's like these algorithms just fell face-down in the eggnog.</p><p>The French have been rioting for more than a month now after Emmanuel Macron's government tried to impose an anti-global warming gas tax upon them. Nevertheless, a lot of Americans, including the outgoing Senator Jeff Flake, think it's time for America to have its own carbon tax. Is that wise?</p><p>Mark Reynolds is Executive Director of the Citizens Climate Lobby, and he joins us. Mark, when you see what's happening in France, that's a more extreme version of what happens when carbon taxes are actually put into place elsewhere. People don't seem to like it, don't seem to care for it.</p><p>MARK REYNOLDS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CITIZENS CLIMATE LOBBY: First of all, thank you so much for having me on the show. The nice thing about the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is that it actually puts money in people's pockets. So, I think that there's people who are suffering both here and in other countries.</p><p>And I think that the reason that there's so much Republicans' support - support on both the House and the Senate version of this bill is it actually sends, allocates money back to households, so that they are prepared to deal with whatever they have to.</p><p>And again--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --it doesn't tell them what to do with that money, just lets them make a choice about whatever they want to do with it.</p><p>STEYN: Well let me tell - this is the bill that's being proposed in - the carbon tax is being proposed in the United States, which under the proposal supposedly then gives money back to households. But here's one big problem with it, Mark.</p><p>Basically, the automatic increases kick in, I think, starting around 2022, and they basically go all the way up until mid-century. So, and it's beyond the control of other congresses. It just becomes like an entitlement program that gets automatic increases every year and is beyond the control.</p><p>You can't go to a polling station if you don't like it, if the facts change, if the circumstances change. It essentially puts the carbon tax beyond democratic - democratic accountability, doesn't it?</p><p>REYNOLDS: Well Representative Francis Rooney, who's the lead Republican sponsor from Florida says that he likes this bill because it's market- based. It actually lets the market determine how we get to the new energy economy.</p><p>I think that's a lot of what Mr. Fitzpatrick, one of the Republicans on the bill also said is, is, you know, you put a fee on carbon-based emissions, you give the money back to households so that the government doesn't pick what to do with it. You don't pick winners and losers. It'll be up for you to--</p><p>STEYN: What about--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --to you and I to determine what we do with a dividend. But it'll be actually a free-market bill--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --and that's what the Republicans on the bill said they like about it so much.</p><p>STEYN: What do you make of the CEI, the Competitive Enterprise Institute's objection to it that it will actually kill America's new energy independence, which is a phenomenon in the last few years, what we see with fracking and so forth, and means we're no longer dependent on malign Saudi sheiks who use their oil riches to spread their Wahhabist ideology around the world.</p><p>The CEI's view is that the carbon tax is going to kill American energy independence.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. So, I think there's something really interesting happening right now. There's actually a race to the new energy economy. And it's probably going to be either us or China. China is making a huge investment in renewable energy. And I heard - certainly hope it's us.</p><p>So, what I think that this bill does is creates enough incentive throughout the entire--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --economic system to create all the type of--</p><p>STEYN: --wait, wait.</p><p>REYNOLDS: --innovation that we know we need.</p><p>STEYN: But there's no carbon tax in China. The Yangtze is like the most polluted river in the world the - with the - with what's coming down that stream every day. It's nothing you'd want any of your kids to be gambling and frolicking in.</p><p>So, they won't wait - what - what the French - the - the French protesters object to is that this is their lives. It's not a theory. It's not a macroeconomic theory. If it's a choice between sea levels in Tuvalu in the 22nd Century or how they have to live their lives in the century they're actually living in, they'll prioritize the reality of their lives over speculation a century hence.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. I think that that's why so many Republicans like this bill in both the House and Senate is because money's actually returned. You get a monthly check and then it's your choice what you do with it.</p><p>I'm not going to tell you what to do with the money. The government's not going to tell you what to - what to do with the money. It's going to be up to American households to determine what to do.</p><p>STEYN: And - and you believe - and you believe that's good at - because everything you - they always say that and then it goes into the General Fund. The gas - gasoline taxes, they were supposed to be about it and they all go into it (ph). Well we'll - we'll see how it works out. I don't see the public appetite for it.</p><p>But, Mark, thank you for - thank you for talking with us today. And happy post--</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. And thank you for - thank you for having me on. And let me just say to the people who are watching, there is one of our chapters in every community out there from Boise, Idaho, to Birmingham, Alabama. If you want to work with people on solutions, we have a big tent, and we would love to see you in your neighborhood.</p><p>STEYN: OK. Big tents we like. And we won't heat them with conventional energy sources.</p><p>REYNOLDS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Thank you for that, Mark. Happy post-Boxing Day to you.</p><p>It's time for Tucker's Final Exam. Have you been following the news over the Christmas period? Find out if you can remember it better than the big- time professionals here at Fox. That's up next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: FINAL EXAM.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Oh, you know what that music means. It's time for Tucker's Final Exam where the news professionals are interrogated, see if they can actually remember the events they cover every day.</p><p>This week's Final Exam is a New York Special. We have Kennedy, the last non-guest host in the building. And also - and also with us, from FOX News Headlines 24/7, Carley Shimkus.</p><p>And actually, speaking of guest hosting, Carley will actually be in this slot on Monday night. But for some reason we're going to stick her outside- -</p><p>LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, KENNEDY HOST, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: --for the duration of the show. And then Kennedy will follow Carley. So, this is the Fox New Year's Eve team. You'll--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Right.</p><p>STEYN: --you'll get a heads-up on ahead. Stay ahead of (ph)--</p><p>CARLEY SHIMKUS, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 REPORTER: We're going to have lot of fun.</p><p>STEYN: --tuning in. OK, contestants, hands on buzzers. I'm going to ask the questions. And the first one to buzz in gets to answer. But you must wait until I finish asking.</p><p>You can answer once and I shall acknowledge you, according to rules set by the International Quiz Show Committee in Geneva, by saying your name. Correct answer's worth one point. Get it wrong, you lose a point. Best of five wins.</p><p>Let's get started. Question one, an outgoing Democrat Senator just blasted newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling her a shiny new object with cheap rhetoric. Which lawmaker made those remarks?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: And it's Kennedy.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Claire McCaskill.</p><p>STEYN: Claire McCaskill. Let's roll that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLAIRE CONNER MCCASKILL, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MISSOURI: I don't know her. I'm - I'm a little confused why she's the thing. But it's a good example of what I'm talking about, a bright and shiny new object.</p><p>The rhetoric is cheap. Getting results is a lot harder.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Meow. Saucer of--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --milk for Senator McCaskill.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Don't let the door hit you where the Lord split you, Senator McCaskill.</p><p>STEYN: So, that's first blood to Kennedy. One-Zip as we head into question two.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: OK.</p><p>STEYN: This is critical for Carley. Otherwise she - she'll be losing that New Year's Eve gig. Question--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: --question two. Former First Lady, Michelle Obama, is now the most admired woman in all of America. That's according to a new Gallup poll. But to get them, Michelle Obama had to bump another woman who'd held on to the top spot for 17 years.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: Who was the other woman?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I know it (ph).</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: Oh. And it's Kennedy again.</p><p>SHIMKUS: It was just a guess from me anyway.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Hillary Clinton.</p><p>STEYN: Oh, come on. Hillary Clinton, the most admired woman in America? The 17 - are you kidding me? Let's roll that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Michelle Obama has overtaken Hillary Clinton as the most admired woman in the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Good job. Oh, man. I'm getting cleaned (ph).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Clinton held that top spot on that list for 17 years.

I thought it - I - I wanted to say Oprah because--</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>SHIMKUS: --I thought - I feel like that - were truly is one of the most admired women in America. But I think Hillary is now third and--</p><p>STEYN: No, yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: --Molly (ph) is in second or something like that.</p><p>STEYN: Oprah - Oprah is number two. But it's a tragedy--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --for Hillary. She was once the most admired--</p><p>SHIMKUS: She lost again.</p><p>STEYN: --woman in America and--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I blame the Latvian bot farm and misogyny.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Even though there are other women on the list, so--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Of course.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: --very misogynistic that she got the heave-ho.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>SHIMKUS: We are clearly on that list as well, four and five.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. Macedonian content farmers fixed that thing right (ph). It's Two-Zip to Kennedy. This is--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: --come on, come on Carley.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I just want one point.</p><p>STEYN: Come on, you don't want to be outside on New Year's Eve.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't.</p><p>STEYN: This - we'll give you - we'll give you a studio if you can turn this thing around.</p><p>SHIMKUS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Question three. We recently told you about a popular calendar in Russia, which features various images of a shirtless Vladimir Putin. That same calendar is now a monster hit in another country and is outselling ones featuring puny homegrown celebrities. Which country is it?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p>STEYN: No, no. No. And this is (ph) - Kennedy.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: United States.</p><p>STEYN: Chest-less (ph) Putin in the United States?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Let's see.</p><p>STEYN: Doesn't sound likely.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm blushing.

The popularity of the calendars is reportedly fueled by a surge in self-proclaimed Putin fans. Get them while they're hot, ladies. Putin--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: While they're hot.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. There's nothing a Japanese lady likes than--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Putin and a fish (ph).</p><p>STEYN: --being in a hot tub with a KGB torturer. Kennedy, disastrous move there. She's lost one point.</p><p>SHIMKUS: It's all right.</p><p>STEYN: So there's still everything to play for. It's Two-Zero.</p><p>Question four, multiple choice.</p><p>SHIMKUS: One-zero.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Isn't it two-ones?</p><p>STEYN: Oh, no, one - one-zero.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: One-zero. Yes, Carley--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh, I lost a point?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I thought - I thought I kept it and then--</p><p>STEYN: No, no, you - you lost it.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: --I thought I kept the other two (ph)--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, the two points (ph)--</p><p>STEYN: You're in huge trouble now.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh, boy.</p><p>STEYN: Question four. This is a multiple choice question. There's a crisis on the International Space Station. Something mysterious was found by astronauts inside a capsule that recently docked there. And Russian officials say it's the result of a major breach. What was it they found?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I would--</p><p>STEYN: A, a sharp knife, B, a tiny hole, or C, a jar of pickles.</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>STEYN: And it's the trigger-happy Kennedy yet again. What do you say, Kennedy?</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Jar of pickles.</p><p>STEYN: Jar of pickles</p><p>SHIMKUS: I was going to go with A.

So, as a result, Kennedy's lost another point. It's now zero- zero.</p><p>SHIMKUS: The final load (ph).</p><p>STEYN: So, this is Sudden Death.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: SUDDEN DEATH.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Sudden Death.</p><p>SHIMKUS: This is the lowest scoring game--</p><p>STEYN: The Final - this is the lowest scoring game in the history of this show.

Final question. Another multiple choice, listen carefully.</p><p>SHIMKUS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: There is a viral video of a Colorado woman chasing down a thief who had stolen her Christmas packages from her front door. Now, there's a special name given to people who steal in this way. Is it A, a porch pirate, B, a parcel poacher, or C, a package snatcher?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>STEYN: And--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: --Carley. Oh, can we have a round of applause for this? Carley succeeded in actually hitting the buzzer.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I didn't (ph).</p><p>STEYN: We didn't even know hers worked but maybe (ph)--</p><p>SHIMKUS: If I win this way (ph), it is a win I do not deserve.</p><p>STEYN: Oh, OK.

Here's what happened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: MEN IN AMERICA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON- HOST: If you look at the numbers, you quickly conclude that men are in crisis in America. Compared to women, they are far more likely to drop out of school, fail to graduate, go to jail, not hold a job, commit suicide, die of a drug overdose.</p><p>And yet, the establishment, and particularly, Democratic establishment seems uninterested in all of this. And they think - they appear to think that men are still too successful and need to be held back.</p><p>Andrew Yarrow is a former New York Times reporter, a Senior Fellow with the Progressive Policy Institute. He just wrote an important new book called, Man Out: Men on the Sidelines of American Life. He joins us tonight in studio.</p><p>Mr. Yarrow - Yarrow, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>ANDREW YARROW, FORMER NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER, PROGRESSIVE POLICY INSTITUTE SENIOR FELLOW, MAN OUT AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker, it's a pleasure--</p><p>CARLSON: So, I should, perhaps if I'm (ph) saying--</p><p>YARROW: --yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --I don't think you're a conservative activist, and that I'm also grateful that someone is saying this because the numbers support that it's true.</p><p>YARROW: It is true. And, as you say, the problem has really largely been ignored. I mean Democrats and a lot of people in the country don't see men as having problems. But there are a lot of men who are struggling, struggling with work, struggling in families, struggling with health, lot of areas I touch on in my book.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, to such a great extent that it would seem a crisis that affects everybody because, of course, men and women need each other to reproduce on the most basic level, but also every - everybody has a father or brother, sons--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --why do you think it's been ignored?</p><p>YARROW: Well, there's been a lot of political correctness in this country that's kind of made the main narrative be that, you know, women are the oppressed ones. And they have been historically--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: --oppressed. But, you know, that doesn't mean that there aren't a lot of men struggling. I mean you don't - it's not a zero-sum game.</p><p>CARLSON: You're right.</p><p>YARROW: And--</p><p>CARLSON: But it's been presented as one that one sex succeeds only when another moves backward. Where'd that assumption come from?</p><p>YARROW: Well, I think a lot of politics looks at things that way. And I think it's - it's pretty unfortunate. But I think, you know, men have not been, in many ways, good at advocating for themselves.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: I mean it's been interesting in the last few elections. A lot of the political activists have been women. I mean you hear more from women these days. I mean men aren't good at forming groups--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: --anymore.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you work at - at the Progressive Policy Institute. You're a Fellow there. That's not the Heritage Foundation.</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: I think it's fair to say you probably work in a mostly Liberal world.</p><p>YARROW: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What kind of reaction did your piece get among people you know?</p><p>YARROW: Well, it's interesting. Conservative media have tended to like it more. It's, you know, it's kind of troubling that this should be a bipartisan issue.</p><p>I mean all Americans should be doing well or should have the opportunity to do well. And they should also have justice behind them. I mean men are being accused wrongly. I mean there are a lot of awful things that men do. Don't get me wrong but--</p><p>CARLSON: Well sure.</p><p>YARROW: --but, you know, the lack of due process in some of these sexual assault allegations, it's, you know, it's pretty troubling.</p><p>CARLSON: It's just interesting because the most progressive President the country's ever had, FDR, four terms, the first thing he did after getting elected in 1932, the very first piece through the Congress was the CCC, the Civilian Conservation Corps, which was--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --aimed at young men, just men between--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --18 and 25 or something like that--</p><p>YARROW: Right</p><p>CARLSON: --getting them back to work and restoring their vitality through work. What would happen if a Democrat in the modern era suggested something like that?</p><p>YARROW: Well, you think it would play well. You know, while the unemployment statistics look good, there are a lot of men who've either been pushed out of the labor force or dropped out. I mean they're about 17 - 18 percent of 25 to 64 year old men, who aren't working.</p><p>And, you know, there are a lot of men - younger men, who are neither in school or working. So, you know, why is that? And, you know, why can't we create better jobs for them? And yes, I mean you'd think a Democrat would pitch some kind of jobs program.</p><p>CARLSON: I think I mean this is a longer conversation but I think the answer is toxic masculinity.</p><p>YARROW: Yes, I mean the--</p><p>CARLSON: Whatever that means.</p><p>YARROW: Well, yes. I mean that's become the phrase du jour, I guess. I mean there are clearly issues with masculinity. You know, I interviewed a lot of men and some women around the country, about 200. And a lot of men told me, a lot of, you know, even Liberal men said, \"Well feminism's done a lot for women. But what's it done for me?\"</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's a - that's a fair question. And you ask it in this book. Thank you for doing that.</p><p>YARROW: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Great to talk to you.</p><p>YARROW: Good to talk to you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: That's one of the biggest stories of our time, so is this one.</p><p>Big tech has become the greatest threat to Americans' privacy and personal freedoms. But now, Americans seem to be wising up to that. A new survey finds that Americans trust Facebook less than any other company. Also, a growing number of Americans seeking treatment for tech addiction as they find themselves unable to look away from social media, their smartphones or video games.</p><p>Tom Kersting is a family therapist and the Author of Disconnected: How to Reconnect Our Digitally Distracted Kids. I've read that book, and so should you. And he joins us now.</p><p>Just to go with the Tucker, the big story of our time thing, when you look at this so-called tech addiction, and you follow where that leads, you - you do worry that in some ways these rinky-dinky little things that started as cat video sites somehow basically re-wiring humanity.</p><p>TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: They are. I mean if we looked out the back window right now and - and counted how many people were walking by staring at their phones, you'd probably have 70 percent of them doing that.</p><p>And when it comes to addiction which, obviously, I've studied in my background, basically if anything, whether it's gambling, alcohol, drugs, anything that's considered addictive its - if it's affecting one of the following four, you could be diagnosed as - as an addict.</p><p>And the four things are, is it affecting your family, is it affecting your health, is it affecting your job or your occupation, and is it affecting have you had any legal issues?</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>KERSTING: And when we look at technology, we could check off each one of those for many, many people. So, therefore, this whole addictive whether it's a debate or not, I'm all about, I believe in a 100 percent.</p><p>STEYN: The - the difference being though that it's actually being kind of organized on a global scale with--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --billions and billions of people. And when you look at children, like middle-schoolers--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes, yes.</p><p>STEYN: --who've never known anything but this world, their behavior does seem to be not where middle-schoolers were--</p><p>KERSTING: It's--</p><p>STEYN: --20, 50, 70 years ago.</p><p>KERSTING: --it's actually unbelievable. I tell people I - I - I get more middle-school age kids with major anxiety disorders per year now--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --in my private practice than I did the previous 17 years combined.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: And, you know, and you could - all the research that's done to put - start to show that, starting to point to, you know, that the absorption of social media, the lack of - of self, the lack of a sense of self and so forth and how that's affecting the self-esteem and causing, you know, issues with anxiety, depression, and other - other mental health - health things.</p><p>STEYN: People do actually seem to prefer it though. You have a scene in your book where you talk about when you were a young guy, just sitting at a bar, you'd never know who's on the barstool next.</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: I can relate to that. Sometimes--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --you find yourself on the other side of the wall, you're sitting next to an Australian, a Hungarian--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --you - you meet different people with different views. Now everyone in the bar is just like--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --scrolling the phone.</p><p>KERSTING: When you go into the - the airport, if you travel, which, you know--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --you do, I do. They have the screens in front of every barstool.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: So, like, you and I--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --instead of hanging out, talking with one another and--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --and kicking it off, now everybody's distracted by these devices.</p><p>STEYN: Right. Sometimes--</p><p>KERSTING: So the--</p><p>STEYN: --you want to go where only Facebook knows--</p><p>KERSTING: --so - so it's like a - it's like--</p><p>STEYN: --you're in that area (ph).</p><p>KERSTING: --right. It's like bottles of wine dangling around if you're an alcoholic--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --24 hours a day, seven days a week, you can't escape from it.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. That's - that's a - that's a - a worrying thing. As I said, I think this is one of the biggest stories of time, Tom. I dread (ph) to think--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --where we're going to be if - if we're - if we don't change it. But how do we change it?</p><p>KERSTING: Well we have - it's - it's not something that's going to happen overnight. We just have to keep creating awareness, having conversations like you and I are having right now, so that people could see this. They can understand the ramifications of these things. I'm one of the guys out there, you know, that's lecturing--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --that's writing about it and that's out there trying to get other people to do the same. And it's - it's going to be a slow process but I think we're going to have to get there.</p><p>STEYN: OK. Well we will - we will hold you to that Tom because something - these companies are bigger than countries now.</p><p>That is about it for us tonight. You can tune in each night at 8:00 to the show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink. And don't forget to DVR the show. That's less harmful, less addictive than if you just go on Facebook and look at it. Don't bother with that. Just DVR the show, if you haven't set that up already.</p><p>Now, this is exciting moment in the evening. We are going to lift Nancy Pelosi's beaded curtain and find out who is guest-hosting for Sean Hannity tonight. Oh, who is it going to be? They've lifted the beaded curtain. I think I can see--</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR UTAH'S 3RD CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND GOVERNMENT REFORM, COMMENTATOR: Oh, Mark.</p><p>STEYN: --Jason Kennedy filling in for Sean. Hey Jason--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p>STEYN: --oh, no, Jason Chaffetz. What--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Mark, thank you, great show.</p><p>STEYN: After all, hey by--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I always love it when you're on with Tucker.</p><p>STEYN: No.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I love it when you're on, so--</p><p>STEYN: Hey - hey, by--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: --thank you so much.</p><p>STEYN: --by the way, that was a terrific interview you did with Sam Johnson today.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: And everyone should look at that. That was the best thing on TV this morning.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well--</p><p>STEYN: Terrific stuff.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you. Thanks to Fox &amp; Friends. We have - actually later in the show, we're going to go back and tell you about Sam Johnson, a special man, an amazing personality and a true American hero, so thanks, Mark. We appreciate it.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Jason. Have a great show.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018122701cb260</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V2M-4241-JB20-G2XN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"9633\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 27, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Troops</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Barack Obama</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hats</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Democrats</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Wall</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>California</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ronil Singh</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigrant</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>El Paso</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nielsen</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jimmy Kimmel</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>GoFundMe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Beaded curtain</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>France</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Carbon tax</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>America</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CEI</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Energy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Final Exam</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Men</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Establishment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Masculinity</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Big tech</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Immigration Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Border Procedures</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I3QTk0MDU1RTJFNDQxNkI4QjgxMzA3RTZGNkZCQjA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MThGRjk5N0E2MTI4NEJGQjkwMDBCRjc5NkZDQUE4NzU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N928110MM</classCode><className>ARMED FORCES</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0M2RDE1RTlBNDk4NDkxRDlBMTkwQ0JCNERDNTA5NUY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzM1OUEyRDNERTdENEU2MTk3RTlCNEJCRUY0NjRGRjQ</classCode><className>Armed Forces</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N928000CC</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp;

Take a look at the hysteria as the talking heads accused  the President of turning the post-Christmas visit into a political event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY COMMENTATOR, CNN NATIONAL  SECURITY ANALYST: From a national security perspective, for all the reasons  that you just listed, the President should have stayed home.</p><p>JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, RETIRED MAJOR GENERAL, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: The  reason that he went now is that he couldn't go to Mar-a-Lago because the  government was shut down.</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN TONIGHT HOST, CNN: It was like we kept saying \"He's like the  Grinch.\" Instead of - I'm being honest.</p><p>CHARLES JOSEPH SCARBOROUGH, MORNING JOE CO-HOST, MSNBC: We should also be  concerned that Mr. Trump once again used a captive audience of American  heroes to push his unpopular domestic agenda.</p><p>Even in doing something right, he figures out a way to sow chaos.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It took far too long, especially compared to President  Obama who visited troops in Iraq in his first three months in office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STEYN: Over at CNN, attacking the President wasn't enough. They decided to  attack the troops as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBARA STARR, PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT, CNN: The pool reporters traveling  said that the troops brought the hats with them, including one hat that  said \"Trump 2020.\" We will have to see if that actually proves to be the  case. </p><p>The question is, if they - if they brought them or if the President brought  them, what commander allowed that to really happen, because this is very  much against military policy and regulation. Troops are not supposed to be  involved in political activities. The U.S. Military is not a political  force.</p><p>JOHN FRANCIS KIRBY, RETIRED UNITED STATES NAVY REAR ADMIRAL, FORMER  SPOKESPERSON FOR THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE: It's completely  inappropriate for the troops to do this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not supposed to--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Of course, nobody cared back when presidential candidate Barack  Obama signed memorabilia for the troops back in 2008. He had a D after his  name though instead of an R. Thankfully, not everybody's lost their minds.  Even some Liberals scolded the media for their hysteria.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID AXELROD, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, POLITICAL  CONSULTANT, ANALYST: It's - it's good that he went to see the troops,  important that he went to do it. He - he was criticized for it, obviously.  They wanted to address that. And so, I should - we should give him credit  where credit is due.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It just sends a - such a strong message that the - the  Trumps love our military, support our military, and what a great time to do  it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Well Joe Concha writes about Media for The Hill. He joins us now.  Joe, is this a good look for the media? Why are serving soldiers in a war  zone bringing particular hats to an event on base in a combat zone at  Christmas?</p><p>JOE CONCHA, THE HILL MEDIA REPORTER: Well the optics around that, Mark, are  horrific, right, because what you're doing here is it's - it's OK to go  after the President in terms of policy or the things that he says. </p><p>Once you start attacking the people that voted for him or military people  that are obviously serving overseas during Christmas, no less, then--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: --then you got a problem. And you have to ask yourself this  question, Mark. </p><p>Let's say, honestly, like you pointed out, as I did in my column today on  The Hill, if President Obama, as he did in 2008, signed a Hope and Change  t-shirts, do you really think any news organization would have gone ahead  with that story? Of course, they wouldn't have.</p><p>STEYN: No. I - I couldn't care less. Well what soldiers in these, frankly,  God-awful situations, because life in it - at a base in Iraq stinks. You -  it's not like being in Ramstein, Germany where the President was today. You  can't stroll down to town go to a local bar, meet one of the nice German  girls, or one of the local guy (ph), you know, that's nothing like that.</p><p>You're stuck in that lousy fortress that you hope is a fortress. And the  President comes to visit you. And the pre-occupation of the American media  is whether hats the troops chose to take to that event are somehow some  potential crime that they can be pulled up in front of a military court  for. I mean that's bonkers--</p><p>CONCHA: Yes, Mark, and--</p><p>STEYN: --isn't it?</p><p>CONCHA: --it's bonkers, yes. And I think that pivot happened because the  original narrative was, we - we'd all recall is that, President Trump was  supposed to be the first President since 2002 to not visit the troops at  Christmas. </p><p>And once that fell apart, when he literally landed in Iraq as the story was  going up and it originally came from NBC, then social media goes nuts. And  - and what happened was the pivot went from, \"Oh yes, OK. Trump went, sure,  but what was his motive exactly for going?\"</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CONCHA: I - I give you The Washington Post, Mark, quoting, the President's  visit follows months of public pressure for him to spend time with troops  deployed to conflicts in the Middle East. Think about that again, follows  months of public pressure.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: In other words, we, the media, got the public riled up to force  Trump to go to a war zone instead of him just going like every president  has done for the past 17 years.</p><p>STEYN: Well - well according to Soledad O'Brien, who's a lovely lady, but  she thought it was actually minutes of public pressure that Alyssa Milano  who - who actually tweeted as the President was halfway across the ocean,  why haven't you visited our troops, Soledad O - O'Brien actually gave  Alyssa Milano credit for shaming the President into getting on the plane  that he'd already gotten on.</p><p>CONCHA: Yes. And then what's forgotten in all this, of course, is if you  want to go to Walter Reed, let's say the President was shamed, and he goes  to Walter Reed, which is close to the White House, OK, then you could say  it's a last-minute thing. When you go to Iraq, you kind of have to plan it  in advance. You have to do it weeks in advance, obviously, for security.</p><p>Air Force One has to fly in with shades down and cellphones off and - and  all of that. So, you think you'd see though however, at least from NBC and  - and - and others, some remorse, some apology, some around, you know,  \"Hey, we went ahead with this story a little bit too early because we ran a  story on Christmas saying that the President hadn't been to see the troops  on Christmastime.\"</p><p>People don't mind that sort of transparency from the media. But yet, we  never see those sort of concessions. Instead, we see the pivots that are  negative like we always do in these situations. And that's why trust in  media is this. </p><p>Axios, SurveyMonkey poll just last year, 93 percent of Republicans think  that the media knowingly creates stories, makes them up, they're false. And  you say all right (ph), that's Republicans. They've always hated the media.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: They don't trust them. 79 percent of - of independents, Mark--</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>CONCHA: 53 percent of Democrats, even a majority, that's the thing. I mean  this is something that's going across the board--</p><p>STEYN: Sure (ph).</p><p>CONCHA: --in terms of all parties seeing exactly what's happening here,  sir.</p><p>STEYN: Hey Joe, thanks. Don't worry about that though. As soon as the media  call for a Special Counsel to investigate how those MAGA hats got to Iraq,  everything will be fine.</p><p>CONCHA: There you go (ph).</p><p>STEYN: Rochelle Ritchie is a former Press Secretary for the House  Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, and Rachel Campos-Duffy is  a Fox contributor, and they both join us.</p><p>Rochelle, how - stepping back and looking at this a little more objectively  than CNN &amp; Co. have done, is it really a good law - the troops liked the  guy. The guy got on with the troops. Is there really any political mileage  to be had in going on about this?</p><p>ROCHELLE RITCHIE, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY, HOUSE DEMOCRATIC POLICY AND  COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: So, I had a little bit of  a battle with myself about this. At first, I was saying, you know, no,  these men and women in uniform, they shouldn't have, you know, gotten their  hats signed. They shouldn't have been out there with Make America Great  Again hats.</p><p>And, you know, when you look at the facts, yes, it is a - it is breaking a  rule when it comes to the Department of Defense guidelines. But at the same  time, these troops have not seen an American President since 2009. I  believe Obama was the last one to - to go visit.</p><p>So, maybe they're not necessarily, you know, showing support for the  President or getting his signature because they are Republican--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, no, come on, who--</p><p>RITCHIE: --maybe - no, listen, listen--</p><p>STEYN: --no--</p><p>RITCHIE: --no, see, how can you disagree? I haven't even finished. </p><p>The Commander - it's their Commander-in-Chief. So, maybe it's not because  he's a Republican President. Maybe they're looking at it like he's the  Commander-in-Chief. We're proud to fight for our country or fight - we're  proud to stand behind our President--</p><p>STEYN: Let--</p><p>RITCHIE: --whether he has an R or a D behind his name. And, look, I could  really care less if the guys do it. As long as they're continuing to  protect our national security, have at it.</p><p>STEYN: Well Rochelle gave that theory rather more credit than I would  think, Rachel. I mean who the--</p><p>RITCHIE: I'm very balanced.</p><p>STEYN: --who the hell - if you have the misfortune to be spending Christmas  on one of those - those forts, cut off from life in the middle of the Iraqi  desert--</p><p>RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, AMERICAN TELEVISION PERSONALITY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.</p><p>STEYN: --who the hell cares what hat you take to a Christmas party  basically.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Of course, they shouldn't care. But I think the more  important question is why do - I mean - let's be honest. The reaction from  the troops was very overwhelmingly positive. And it should be. </p><p>Listen, Barack Obama decimated our military. Barack Obama--</p><p>RITCHIE: OK.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --wait a minute. He did. He cut funding for our military. He  put in rules of engagement that actually--</p><p>RITCHIE: But that's not even--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --caused - wait a minute that actually caused--</p><p>RITCHIE: But what does that have to do with--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --but let - let--</p><p>RITCHIE: --what we're talking about though with this Trump (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let - it does. It does have to do.</p><p>RITCHIE: --how?</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Because the - Barack Obama did all in - enacted rules of  engagement--</p><p>RITCHIE: I don't. It has nothing to do--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --Rochelle, let me finish. Rochelle--</p><p>RITCHIE: --OK. Go ahead, Rachel.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let me finish. He enacted rules of engagement that actually  put our military on the battlefield in danger--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --causing more battles (ph) but wait - wait a minute, Mark.  He did that.</p><p>RITCHIE: I'm sorry.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: And he went to the troops and they said he was a great  Commander-in-Chief. Donald Trump goes--</p><p>STEYN: Let me--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --over and does all this to not for Alyssa Milano or the  media - or the media. But he does it because he loves the troops. And they  say that he's doing it for a photo op.</p><p>STEYN: Oh--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: This is a man who loves the military.</p><p>STEYN: No, how (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was his number one issue.</p><p>RITCHIE: I - I--</p><p>STEYN: OK. How about this as a non-Democrat, non-Republican thing?  Democrats weren't in favor of the 21st Century Bush Wars, as they called  them.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right.</p><p>RITCHIE: Right.</p><p>STEYN: But nor was Donald - nor was Donald Trump in 2016.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: That's right.</p><p>STEYN: In - in a sense, Donald Trump is at odds with both Democrat policy  and Republican policy on the Middle East, Rochelle.</p><p>RITCHIE: Yes. He's definitely fighting both sides. And I think what - when  you talked about the press, I think the reason why the press is sort of  attacking on him, the - the Left-leaning press, I would say, is because of  some of the - the misleading comments that he made when he talked about the  pay raises for the military. We know that's not--</p><p>STEYN: Well they do - they did get the pay rises (ph).</p><p>RITCHIE: --necessarily true. They do get raises. But they're not getting a  10 percent raise. It's going to be, I think, 2.6 percent. So, I think there  are ways that the media was looking at it and attacking him for his less- than-knowledgeable education, I guess you could say, on what's really  happening--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: But (ph)--</p><p>RITCHIE: --there. But I don't I - I think that him visiting was a good  idea. I think there was an article by The Washington Post where it said  that he was actually scared to go over there for some time. So, I'm glad--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Ridiculous.</p><p>RITCHIE: --he got over that.</p><p>STEYN: That's a--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: He was not scared. And - and what would the media, you know,  betting MAGAs hats (ph) what would they have had him do? Say, \"Oh, I'm  sorry. I'm not going to sign your hat because of the Hatch Act,\" and then  they--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --would have criticized him and said--</p><p>RITCHIE: Well--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --\"Hey, what a jerk. He wouldn't sign a hat.\"</p><p>STEYN: By the way there's too much--</p><p>RITCHIE: I just - I just said I thought that was perfectly fine.</p><p>STEYN: --there's too much of that. The minute you--</p><p>RITCHIE: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --if you're seriously talking about soldiers doing something wrong  because they asked their Commander-in-Chief to sign a hat, then - then  you've flown the coop. That's not a land of law and things (ph)--</p><p>RITCHIE: I want to know (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It's - it's a bad look for the press. It's - the reason why  the American people hate the press and, by the way, the troops loved the  President because--</p><p>RITCHIE: Wait, wait, what is this? This is (ph) press--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --the troops love the President because he did sign a bill  that he took a lot of flack from the - from the Right for signing a big  bill that was--</p><p>RITCHIE: I think - I think--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --for funding the military.</p><p>RITCHIE: --I think that Trump's whole purpose--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: They love him.</p><p>RITCHIE: --of being there and - and this is - is - this is part of it, I  think that he also has a lot, I think, there was a - a part in this segment  right before you came to us about--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>RITCHIE: --this being public pressure. I think it's more political pressure  because of him, you know, General Kelly, then General Mattis, and so I  think that he's really trying to show that he has some sort of control of  what's happening right now in the middle in - in--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right. Why didn't - why didn't the--</p><p>STEYN: No, no, no, no--</p><p>RITCHIE: --Iraq. But then - but--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --why doesn't that criticism come to Barack Obama? He goes to  visit the troop, no one questions his motives.</p><p>RITCHIE: Well Obama is living his best life somewhere (ph).</p><p>STEYN: No, but it's a - that - you can't do--</p><p>RITCHIE: Can we leave him out of it?</p><p>STEYN: --those--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: But - but there is a double standard. And that is what people  are talking about, Rochelle.</p><p>STEYN: We got to - we got to go, ladies.</p><p>RITCHIE: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Iraq's a crazy place. You can't just plan those things with no  notice.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Absolutely, I agree (ph).</p><p>RITCHIE: No, you can't.</p><p>STEYN: Rochelle and Rachel will carry--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was Alyssa Milano.</p><p>STEYN: --this - this ones (ph) and they're going to take this to the green  room - where now - this is worse than the Sunni Triangle, the violence  that's like (ph) percolating it.</p><p>We're now on day six of the government shutdown triggered by Congress'  refusal to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. </p><p>Today, the President tweeted, \"Have the Democrats finally realized that we  desperately need border security and a wall on the Southern border? We need  to stop drugs, human trafficking, gang members, and criminals from coming  into our country. And do the Dems realize that most of the people not  getting paid are Democrats?\"</p><p>Fox Washington Correspondent, Rich Edson, joins us with more on the  situation in D.C. It's all yours.</p><p>RICH EDSON, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p>Congress officially and briefly gaveled in this afternoon though there is  no sign of this shutdown ending anytime soon as Democrats in (ph) the White  House are a few billion dollars apart on funding for a wall on the Southern  border. President Trump has returned to the White House after visiting U.S.  forces yesterday in Iraq.</p><p>He's just tweeted, \"This isn't about the wall. Everybody knows that a wall  will work perfectly. In Israel, the wall works 99.9 percent. This is only  about the Dems not letting Donald Trump and the Republicans have a win.  They may have the 10 Senate votes. But we have the issue, border security.  2020.\"</p><p>In a statement, White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders says,  \"The President and his team in Washington over Christmas hoping to  negotiate a deal that would stop the dangerous crisis on the border,  protect American communities, and re-open the government, the Democrats  decided to go home.\"</p><p>She also says the Administration offered Democrats what she calls a  reasonable common-sense solution five days ago, though a spokesperson for  House Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, says, \"Democrats have offered  Republicans three options to re-open the government that all include  funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security, but not the  President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall.\"</p><p>While in Iraq, President Trump stressed the funding bill must include money  for a border wall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The folks are saying, \"Can  we have some drones? Can we have technology?\" Technology is bells and  whistles. You have to have a wall. You have to have protection. </p><p>When you say, \"How long is it going to take?\" \"When are they going to say  that we need border security?\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON: Pelosi's office says Democrats will pass their bill to open the  government after they take control of the House next week. Though to end  this shutdown, the House, the Senate, and the White House must all agree on  the same funding bill.</p><p>On Capitol Hill, House Freedom Caucus Chairman, Mark Meadows, says the  needle has moved towards a very long shutdown, as Democrats and Republicans  appear to talk past one another.</p><p>Mark?</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Rich.</p><p>This is a Fox News Alert. Police in California are on the hunt for an  unnamed illegal immigrant, suspected of murdering a police officer.  Corporal Ronil Singh, an immigrant from Fiji, was gunned down Wednesday  morning during a traffic stop. Police have released surveillance footage of  the suspect, and say they believe he is still in the area. We will continue  to monitor this breaking story. </p><p>And coming up, Tucker will be back with us to discuss the crisis of  American manhood. Plus, President Trump insists the government won't re- open until he has money for his wall. But if he gets it, will that wall  work? That's next on TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STEYN: El Paso, Texas is turning into Exhibit A of America's broken  immigration system. ICE has been overwhelmed by asylum requests and  shackled by court rulings, and it's now releasing hundreds of migrants onto  the streets of El Paso.</p><p>The message to future migrants, of course, is that America is powerless to  stop them from settling here. Fox's Jonathan Hunt is here with more.  Jonathan?</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, CHIEF CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, says the immigration system  is at breaking point. Border Patrol agents say they're overwhelmed. Around  1,000 immigrants have been released onto the streets of El Paso, Texas this  week alone. </p><p>And two young immigrant children have died after being taken into custody  by Customs and Border Protection agents, the first deaths of children in  CBP custody for a decade.</p><p>In El Paso, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say they have  little choice but to release those hundreds of immigrants because of,  quote, decades of inaction by Congress that they say has limited their  ability to remove families who are in the U.S. illegally, and has set  limits on how long they can hold those families.</p><p>So, they're being dropped off at a bus station in El Paso, where aid groups  are offering support. More, by the way, are expected to be released today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DYLAN CORBETT, DIRECTOR, HOPE BORDER INSTITUTE (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): They  have spent eight to 10 days in cells. Now they've been released. What we've  been doing as a community is to support them, giving them food, a place for  them to stay at night.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT: President Trump has repeatedly said the era of so-called catch and  release has ended. But frankly, that is exactly what is happening in Texas  right now. And it all comes against the backdrop of the government shutdown  over President Trump's demand for a Border wall that he says could stem the  flow of illegal immigration.</p><p>The wall and, of course, the deaths of those two immigrant children will no  doubt top the agenda when Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen visits the  Border area in El Paso, Texas, Friday, and Yuma, Arizona, Saturday. </p><p>Mark?</p><p>STEYN: Just - just to be clear on that, Jonathan, ICE can hold these people  if that chap is right for - for 10 days or whatever. And then meanwhile  they're given a two-year court date. So, in the gap between the 10 days and  the two years, they just get to hang out in America? That's - that's the  idea of it (ph)?</p><p>HUNT: Right. Well what - what ICE is saying is that under the current laws,  they have no choice but to release these immigrants after that time frame.  And, therefore, they take them to the bus station and then, yes,  essentially they are free to go where they wish to do as they please, Mark.</p><p>STEYN: Well that seems a bit of a design flaw, Jonathan.</p><p>While - while migrants continue to pour into the United States, critics of  the President maintain that nothing can be done because a wall's useless.  CNN's Brian Karem recently ranted about the futility of mankind's oldest  defensive mechanism.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN KAREM, JOURNALIST, PLAYBOY'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, CNN POLITICAL  ANALYST, FORMER EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY SENTINEL: This  whole issue is a crock from start to finish. He picked it up on the  campaign trail as something to appease the masses and play to his base. </p><p>It's not going to stop terrorism. It's not going to be 2,000 miles long, as  originally planned. It's not going to be see-through. It's not going to be  eco- friendly. It's not going to be slats or heads on pikes or a beaded  curtain or anything else. You can't wall that border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Jimmy Kimmel, meanwhile, has been ridiculing, Americans were so  desperate for a secure border they've been willing to donate to a GoFundMe  campaign for it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!: This - this  Trump supporter, guy named Brian Kolfage, started a GoFundMe campaign to  raise a billion dollars for the wall. He launched it on Sunday. It's  already up to almost $9 million. People - this is what people do with their  disposable income when they don't have loans from college to pay off.</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: Donating money for a wall that will never exist. It - it's like  starting a college fund for Harry Potter.</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: It's a - it's a - a more useful thing to do with your money would  be to go outside and feed it to a bird. But--</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: --you do have to admire the sacrifice they're making. I mean lot of  these people are dipping into their meth money for this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Got it. Meth heads for national security. Thank you, Jimmy. So,  would a wall work or not?</p><p>Jason Piccolo is a former Special Agent and Supervisor with the Department  of Homeland Security, and he joins us now. </p><p>Everybody's mocking this. We've had Nancy Pelosi doing her beaded curtain  line. At this stage, I would welcome a 2,000 mile beaded curtain along the  Southern border. It would show a certain kind of resolve. But are these  critics right that this thing doesn't work, doesn't make any difference,  complete waste of time?</p><p>JASON PICCOLO, FORMER ICE SUPERVISOR, OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM VETERAN: No,  it'll work. Now the border is 2,000 miles long. And you won't be able to  actually wall the whole border. But that'll create chokepoints or - or  points where we could actually apprehend the immigrants coming in.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, well--</p><p>PICCOLO: So, yes, a wall would work.</p><p>STEYN: --yes. What's interesting to me is that if you look at up on the  Northern border, where there's far fewer people coming across, there's not  caravans massing on the 49th parallel, and yet, the United States  government has actually put physical barricades in a lot of cross border  towns on the Canadian border, presumably because it works there. </p><p>So, why would it not work on the Mexican border?</p><p>PICCOLO: Walls work. They do. Now, when I worked on a border, the border  was simply a strand of fence in some areas like a strand of wire. Now, you  have narco-traffickers coming across that same area. You have economic  migrants, it's just it's open. The whole border is pretty much open except  for, you know, few miles here and there.</p><p>STEYN: When - when you say it's open, because most - most people who cross  international frontiers legitimately will do so at big border posts. </p><p>But you're saying that even though we talk about this incessantly, there  are actually 100-mile stretches where people can actually just walk into  the United States, a country that's supposedly been on Orange Alert for 17  years.</p><p>PICCOLO: Yes, definitely. Now, I was on the DHS' human smuggling cell back  in 2015. And we tracked human smuggling corridors coming up from South  America. </p><p>Now, you do have Special Interest Aliens transiting into South America,  into Brazil, and traveling up those same routes that the economic migrants  and the narco-traffickers are using. So there--</p><p>STEYN: So--</p><p>PICCOLO: --anybody can come and go through that border.</p><p>STEYN: So you mean - you mean, when you say Special Interest Aliens, you -  you mean that potential jihadists have figured out. They - they look at  what's on their TV screens on the Rio Grande, and figure that instead of  trying to fly to JFK, you might as well just go to Latin America and walk  into the country.</p><p>PICCOLO: You can. The border's open. Now, I detailed out in Ajo, Arizona at  one time back in the early 2000s. And it was literally one strand of barbed  wire. So, yes, you could - anybody could walk across that border when the  various (ph) intent are with coming here for economic migration.</p><p>STEYN: A strand of barbed wire. That seems even more useless than the  beaded curtain. Jason, thank you for that. And thank you for the eyewitness  testimony on that Southern border. I'm not sure people actually visualize  it quite the way you know it.</p><p>Coming up, Tucker's going to be here to discuss the declining fortunes of  American men. And Paris is still coping with riots after the government  tried to levy a carbon tax. So, why do lawmakers want a carbon tax here?  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STEYN: It was another chaotic day on Wall Street today. Yesterday, the Dow  Jones average had its largest single-day gain in history. Today, the  average went on another downward streak falling by 600 points. </p><p>But in the afternoon, the market rallied surging almost 900 points to  finish the day up by 258 points. The market is still down about 2,500  points this month in what's been a very tumultuous end to the year. It's  like these algorithms just fell face-down in the eggnog.</p><p>The French have been rioting for more than a month now after Emmanuel  Macron's government tried to impose an anti-global warming gas tax upon  them. Nevertheless, a lot of Americans, including the outgoing Senator Jeff  Flake, think it's time for America to have its own carbon tax. Is that  wise?</p><p>Mark Reynolds is Executive Director of the Citizens Climate Lobby, and he  joins us. Mark, when you see what's happening in France, that's a more  extreme version of what happens when carbon taxes are actually put into  place elsewhere. People don't seem to like it, don't seem to care for it.</p><p>MARK REYNOLDS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CITIZENS CLIMATE LOBBY: First of all,  thank you so much for having me on the show. The nice thing about the  Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is that it actually puts money in  people's pockets. So, I think that there's people who are suffering both  here and in other countries. </p><p>And I think that the reason that there's so much Republicans' support -  support on both the House and the Senate version of this bill is it  actually sends, allocates money back to households, so that they are  prepared to deal with whatever they have to.</p><p>And again--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --it doesn't tell them what to do with that money, just lets them  make a choice about whatever they want to do with it.</p><p>STEYN: Well let me tell - this is the bill that's being proposed in - the  carbon tax is being proposed in the United States, which under the proposal  supposedly then gives money back to households. But here's one big problem  with it, Mark.</p><p>Basically, the automatic increases kick in, I think, starting around 2022,  and they basically go all the way up until mid-century. So, and it's beyond  the control of other congresses. It just becomes like an entitlement  program that gets automatic increases every year and is beyond the control.</p><p>You can't go to a polling station if you don't like it, if the facts  change, if the circumstances change. It essentially puts the carbon tax  beyond democratic - democratic accountability, doesn't it?</p><p>REYNOLDS: Well Representative Francis Rooney, who's the lead Republican  sponsor from Florida says that he likes this bill because it's market- based. It actually lets the market determine how we get to the new energy  economy. </p><p>I think that's a lot of what Mr. Fitzpatrick, one of the Republicans on the  bill also said is, is, you know, you put a fee on carbon-based emissions,  you give the money back to households so that the government doesn't pick  what to do with it. You don't pick winners and losers. It'll be up for you  to--</p><p>STEYN: What about--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --to you and I to determine what we do with a dividend. But it'll  be actually a free-market bill--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --and that's what the Republicans on the bill said they like  about it so much.</p><p>STEYN: What do you make of the CEI, the Competitive Enterprise Institute's  objection to it that it will actually kill America's new energy  independence, which is a phenomenon in the last few years, what we see with  fracking and so forth, and means we're no longer dependent on malign Saudi  sheiks who use their oil riches to spread their Wahhabist ideology around  the world. </p><p>The CEI's view is that the carbon tax is going to kill American energy  independence.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. So, I think there's something really interesting happening  right now. There's actually a race to the new energy economy. And it's  probably going to be either us or China. China is making a huge investment  in renewable energy. And I heard - certainly hope it's us.</p><p>So, what I think that this bill does is creates enough incentive throughout  the entire--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --economic system to create all the type of--</p><p>STEYN: --wait, wait.</p><p>REYNOLDS: --innovation that we know we need.</p><p>STEYN: But there's no carbon tax in China. The Yangtze is like the most  polluted river in the world the - with the - with what's coming down that  stream every day. It's nothing you'd want any of your kids to be gambling  and frolicking in.</p><p>So, they won't wait - what - what the French - the - the French protesters  object to is that this is their lives. It's not a theory. It's not a  macroeconomic theory. If it's a choice between sea levels in Tuvalu in the  22nd Century or how they have to live their lives in the century they're  actually living in, they'll prioritize the reality of their lives over  speculation a century hence.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. I think that that's why so many Republicans like this bill  in both the House and Senate is because money's actually returned. You get  a monthly check and then it's your choice what you do with it. </p><p>I'm not going to tell you what to do with the money. The government's not  going to tell you what to - what to do with the money. It's going to be up  to American households to determine what to do.</p><p>STEYN: And - and you believe - and you believe that's good at - because  everything you - they always say that and then it goes into the General  Fund. The gas - gasoline taxes, they were supposed to be about it and they  all go into it (ph). Well we'll - we'll see how it works out. I don't see  the public appetite for it. </p><p>But, Mark, thank you for - thank you for talking with us today. And happy  post--</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. And thank you for - thank you for having me on. And let me  just say to the people who are watching, there is one of our chapters in  every community out there from Boise, Idaho, to Birmingham, Alabama. If you  want to work with people on solutions, we have a big tent, and we would  love to see you in your neighborhood.</p><p>STEYN: OK. Big tents we like. And we won't heat them with conventional  energy sources.</p><p>REYNOLDS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Thank you for that, Mark. Happy post-Boxing Day to you. </p><p>It's time for Tucker's Final Exam. Have you been following the news over  the Christmas period? Find out if you can remember it better than the big- time professionals here at Fox. That's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: FINAL EXAM.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Oh, you know what that music means. It's time for Tucker's Final  Exam where the news professionals are interrogated, see if they can  actually remember the events they cover every day. </p><p>This week's Final Exam is a New York Special. We have Kennedy, the last  non-guest host in the building. And also - and also with us, from FOX News  Headlines 24/7, Carley Shimkus.</p><p>And actually, speaking of guest hosting, Carley will actually be in this  slot on Monday night. But for some reason we're going to stick her outside- -</p><p>LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, KENNEDY HOST, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: --for the duration of the show. And then Kennedy will follow Carley.  So, this is the Fox New Year's Eve team. You'll--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Right.</p><p>STEYN: --you'll get a heads-up on ahead. Stay ahead of (ph)--</p><p>CARLEY SHIMKUS, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 REPORTER: We're going to have lot  of fun.</p><p>STEYN: --tuning in. OK, contestants, hands on buzzers. I'm going to ask the  questions. And the first one to buzz in gets to answer. But you must wait  until I finish asking. </p><p>You can answer once and I shall acknowledge you, according to rules set by  the International Quiz Show Committee in Geneva, by saying your name.  Correct answer's worth one point. Get it wrong, you lose a point. Best of  five wins. </p><p>Let's get started. Question one, an outgoing Democrat Senator just blasted  newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling her a shiny new object with cheap  rhetoric. Which lawmaker made those remarks?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: And it's Kennedy.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Claire McCaskill.</p><p>STEYN: Claire McCaskill. Let's roll that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLAIRE CONNER MCCASKILL, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MISSOURI: I don't  know her. I'm - I'm a little confused why she's the thing. But it's a good  example of what I'm talking about, a bright and shiny new object.</p><p>The rhetoric is cheap. Getting results is a lot harder.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Meow. Saucer of--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --milk for Senator McCaskill.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Don't let the door hit you where the Lord split you, Senator  McCaskill.</p><p>STEYN: So, that's first blood to Kennedy. One-Zip as we head into question  two.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: OK.</p><p>STEYN: This is critical for Carley. Otherwise she - she'll be losing that  New Year's Eve gig. Question--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: --question two. Former First Lady, Michelle Obama, is now the most  admired woman in all of America. That's according to a new Gallup poll. But  to get them, Michelle Obama had to bump another woman who'd held on to the  top spot for 17 years.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: Who was the other woman?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I know it (ph).</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: Oh. And it's Kennedy again.</p><p>SHIMKUS: It was just a guess from me anyway.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Hillary Clinton.</p><p>STEYN: Oh, come on. Hillary Clinton, the most admired woman in America? The  17 - are you kidding me? Let's roll that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Michelle Obama has overtaken Hillary Clinton as the  most admired woman in the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Good job. Oh, man. I'm getting cleaned (ph).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Clinton held that top spot on that list for 17 years.  What does that say about Hillary now?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Me too (ph).</p><p>SHIMKUS: You know what? I thought it - I - I wanted to say Oprah because--</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>SHIMKUS: --I thought - I feel like that - were truly is one of the most  admired women in America. But I think Hillary is now third and--</p><p>STEYN: No, yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: --Molly (ph) is in second or something like that.</p><p>STEYN: Oprah - Oprah is number two. But it's a tragedy--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --for Hillary. She was once the most admired--</p><p>SHIMKUS: She lost again.</p><p>STEYN: --woman in America and--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I blame the Latvian bot farm and misogyny.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Even though there are other women on the list, so--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Of course.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: --very misogynistic that she got the heave-ho.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>SHIMKUS: We are clearly on that list as well, four and five.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. Macedonian content farmers fixed that thing right (ph). It's  Two-Zip to Kennedy. This is--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: --come on, come on Carley.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I just want one point.</p><p>STEYN: Come on, you don't want to be outside on New Year's Eve.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't.</p><p>STEYN: This - we'll give you - we'll give you a studio if you can turn this  thing around.</p><p>SHIMKUS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Question three. We recently told you about a popular calendar in  Russia, which features various images of a shirtless Vladimir Putin. That  same calendar is now a monster hit in another country and is outselling  ones featuring puny homegrown celebrities. Which country is it?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND) </p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p>STEYN: No, no. No. And this is (ph) - Kennedy.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: United States.</p><p>STEYN: Chest-less (ph) Putin in the United States?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Let's see.</p><p>STEYN: Doesn't sound likely.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm blushing.

The popularity of the calendars is reportedly fueled by a surge in  self-proclaimed Putin fans. Get them while they're hot, ladies. Putin--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: While they're hot.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. There's nothing a Japanese lady likes than--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Putin and a fish (ph).</p><p>STEYN: --being in a hot tub with a KGB torturer. Kennedy, disastrous move  there. She's lost one point.</p><p>SHIMKUS: It's all right.</p><p>STEYN: So there's still everything to play for. It's Two-Zero. </p><p>Question four, multiple choice.</p><p>SHIMKUS: One-zero.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Isn't it two-ones?</p><p>STEYN: Oh, no, one - one-zero.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: One-zero. Yes, Carley--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh, I lost a point?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I thought - I thought I kept it and then--</p><p>STEYN: No, no, you - you lost it.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: --I thought I kept the other two (ph)--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, the two points (ph)--</p><p>STEYN: You're in huge trouble now.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh, boy.</p><p>STEYN: Question four. This is a multiple choice question. There's a crisis  on the International Space Station. Something mysterious was found by  astronauts inside a capsule that recently docked there. And Russian  officials say it's the result of a major breach. What was it they found?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I would--</p><p>STEYN: A, a sharp knife, B, a tiny hole, or C, a jar of pickles.</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>STEYN: And it's the trigger-happy Kennedy yet again. What do you say,  Kennedy?</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Jar of pickles.</p><p>STEYN: Jar of pickles</p><p>SHIMKUS: I was going to go with A. But let's--</p><p>STEYN: Let's roll that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Matter of life and death. A tiny hole discovered in a  Russian capsule--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: We were both - we would have both been wrong.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --that docks to the International Space Station.</p><p>At first, scientists suspected the hole was caused by a meteorite strike.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And a good unobstructed view now of that black spot.  That's the hole on the external hull.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A Russian cosmonaut who examined the hole--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --believes it was drilled from inside the capsule.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Good to know. I'm learning a lot on this show, by the way--</p><p>STEYN: Yes. If you're a-</p><p>SHIMKUS: --for the very first time.</p><p>STEYN: --if you're a Russian cosmonaut, just plug that hole with the  picture of Vladimir Putin chestless in the hot tub, that'll - that'll take  care of it.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: OK. So, as a result, Kennedy's lost another point. It's now zero- zero.</p><p>SHIMKUS: The final load (ph).</p><p>STEYN: So, this is Sudden Death.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: SUDDEN DEATH.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Sudden Death.</p><p>SHIMKUS: This is the lowest scoring game--</p><p>STEYN: The Final - this is the lowest scoring game in the history of this  show. Final question.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Maybe we've been dipping into the New Year's champagne early--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: --Mark.</p><p>STEYN: Too much Wassail and Figgy pudding. Final question. Another multiple  choice, listen carefully.</p><p>SHIMKUS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: There is a viral video of a Colorado woman chasing down a thief who  had stolen her Christmas packages from her front door. Now, there's a  special name given to people who steal in this way. Is it A, a porch  pirate, B, a parcel poacher, or C, a package snatcher?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>STEYN: And--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: --Carley. Oh, can we have a round of applause for this? Carley  succeeded in actually hitting the buzzer.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I didn't (ph).</p><p>STEYN: We didn't even know hers worked but maybe (ph)--</p><p>SHIMKUS: If I win this way (ph), it is a win I do not deserve.</p><p>STEYN: Oh, OK. Let's - let's see what--</p><p>SHIMKUS: I am going with A, porch pirate.</p><p>STEYN: Porch pirate. Roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The scourge of the holiday season.

Here's what happened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: MEN IN AMERICA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON- HOST: If you look at the numbers, you quickly conclude that  men are in crisis in America. Compared to women, they are far more likely  to drop out of school, fail to graduate, go to jail, not hold a job, commit  suicide, die of a drug overdose. </p><p>And yet, the establishment, and particularly, Democratic establishment  seems uninterested in all of this. And they think - they appear to think  that men are still too successful and need to be held back.</p><p>Andrew Yarrow is a former New York Times reporter, a Senior Fellow with the  Progressive Policy Institute. He just wrote an important new book called,  Man Out: Men on the Sidelines of American Life. He joins us tonight in  studio.</p><p>Mr. Yarrow - Yarrow, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>ANDREW YARROW, FORMER NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER, PROGRESSIVE POLICY INSTITUTE  SENIOR FELLOW, MAN OUT AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker, it's a pleasure--</p><p>CARLSON: So, I should, perhaps if I'm (ph) saying--</p><p>YARROW: --yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --I don't think you're a conservative activist, and that I'm also  grateful that someone is saying this because the numbers support that it's  true.</p><p>YARROW: It is true. And, as you say, the problem has really largely been  ignored. I mean Democrats and a lot of people in the country don't see men  as having problems. But there are a lot of men who are struggling,  struggling with work, struggling in families, struggling with health, lot  of areas I touch on in my book.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, to such a great extent that it would seem a crisis that  affects everybody because, of course, men and women need each other to  reproduce on the most basic level, but also every - everybody has a father  or brother, sons--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --why do you think it's been ignored?</p><p>YARROW: Well, there's been a lot of political correctness in this country  that's kind of made the main narrative be that, you know, women are the  oppressed ones. And they have been historically--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: --oppressed. But, you know, that doesn't mean that there aren't a  lot of men struggling. I mean you don't - it's not a zero-sum game.</p><p>CARLSON: You're right.</p><p>YARROW: And--</p><p>CARLSON: But it's been presented as one that one sex succeeds only when  another moves backward. Where'd that assumption come from?</p><p>YARROW: Well, I think a lot of politics looks at things that way. And I  think it's - it's pretty unfortunate. But I think, you know, men have not  been, in many ways, good at advocating for themselves.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: I mean it's been interesting in the last few elections. A lot of  the political activists have been women. I mean you hear more from women  these days. I mean men aren't good at forming groups--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: --anymore.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you work at - at the Progressive Policy Institute. You're a  Fellow there. That's not the Heritage Foundation.</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: I think it's fair to say you probably work in a mostly Liberal  world.</p><p>YARROW: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What kind of reaction did your piece get among people you know?</p><p>YARROW: Well, it's interesting. Conservative media have tended to like it  more. It's, you know, it's kind of troubling that this should be a  bipartisan issue. </p><p>I mean all Americans should be doing well or should have the opportunity to  do well. And they should also have justice behind them. I mean men are  being accused wrongly. I mean there are a lot of awful things that men do.  Don't get me wrong but--</p><p>CARLSON: Well sure.</p><p>YARROW: --but, you know, the lack of due process in some of these sexual  assault allegations, it's, you know, it's pretty troubling. </p><p>CARLSON: It's just interesting because the most progressive President the  country's ever had, FDR, four terms, the first thing he did after getting  elected in 1932, the very first piece through the Congress was the CCC, the  Civilian Conservation Corps, which was--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --aimed at young men, just men between--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --18 and 25 or something like that--</p><p>YARROW: Right</p><p>CARLSON: --getting them back to work and restoring their vitality through  work. What would happen if a Democrat in the modern era suggested something  like that?</p><p>YARROW: Well, you think it would play well. You know, while the  unemployment statistics look good, there are a lot of men who've either  been pushed out of the labor force or dropped out. I mean they're about 17  - 18 percent of 25 to 64 year old men, who aren't working. </p><p>And, you know, there are a lot of men - younger men, who are neither in  school or working. So, you know, why is that? And, you know, why can't we  create better jobs for them? And yes, I mean you'd think a Democrat would  pitch some kind of jobs program.</p><p>CARLSON: I think I mean this is a longer conversation but I think the  answer is toxic masculinity.</p><p>YARROW: Yes, I mean the--</p><p>CARLSON: Whatever that means.</p><p>YARROW: Well, yes. I mean that's become the phrase du jour, I guess. I mean  there are clearly issues with masculinity. You know, I interviewed a lot of  men and some women around the country, about 200. And a lot of men told me,  a lot of, you know, even Liberal men said, \"Well feminism's done a lot for  women. But what's it done for me?\"</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's a - that's a fair question. And you ask it in this  book. Thank you for doing that.</p><p>YARROW: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Great to talk to you.</p><p>YARROW: Good to talk to you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: That's one of the biggest stories of our time, so is this one.</p><p>Big tech has become the greatest threat to Americans' privacy and personal  freedoms. But now, Americans seem to be wising up to that. A new survey  finds that Americans trust Facebook less than any other company. Also, a  growing number of Americans seeking treatment for tech addiction as they  find themselves unable to look away from social media, their smartphones or  video games.</p><p>Tom Kersting is a family therapist and the Author of Disconnected: How to  Reconnect Our Digitally Distracted Kids. I've read that book, and so should  you. And he joins us now.</p><p>Just to go with the Tucker, the big story of our time thing, when you look  at this so-called tech addiction, and you follow where that leads, you -  you do worry that in some ways these rinky-dinky little things that started  as cat video sites somehow basically re-wiring humanity.</p><p>TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: They are. I mean if we  looked out the back window right now and - and counted how many people were  walking by staring at their phones, you'd probably have 70 percent of them  doing that. </p><p>And when it comes to addiction which, obviously, I've studied in my  background, basically if anything, whether it's gambling, alcohol, drugs,  anything that's considered addictive its - if it's affecting one of the  following four, you could be diagnosed as - as an addict.</p><p>And the four things are, is it affecting your family, is it affecting your  health, is it affecting your job or your occupation, and is it affecting  have you had any legal issues?</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>KERSTING: And when we look at technology, we could check off each one of  those for many, many people. So, therefore, this whole addictive whether  it's a debate or not, I'm all about, I believe in a 100 percent.</p><p>STEYN: The - the difference being though that it's actually being kind of  organized on a global scale with--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --billions and billions of people. And when you look at children,  like middle-schoolers--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes, yes.</p><p>STEYN: --who've never known anything but this world, their behavior does  seem to be not where middle-schoolers were--</p><p>KERSTING: It's--</p><p>STEYN: --20, 50, 70 years ago.</p><p>KERSTING: --it's actually unbelievable. I tell people I - I - I get more  middle-school age kids with major anxiety disorders per year now--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --in my private practice than I did the previous 17 years  combined.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: And, you know, and you could - all the research that's done to  put - start to show that, starting to point to, you know, that the  absorption of social media, the lack of - of self, the lack of a sense of  self and so forth and how that's affecting the self-esteem and causing, you  know, issues with anxiety, depression, and other - other mental health -  health things.</p><p>STEYN: People do actually seem to prefer it though. You have a scene in  your book where you talk about when you were a young guy, just sitting at a  bar, you'd never know who's on the barstool next.</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: I can relate to that. Sometimes--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --you find yourself on the other side of the wall, you're sitting  next to an Australian, a Hungarian--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --you - you meet different people with different views. Now everyone  in the bar is just like--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --scrolling the phone.</p><p>KERSTING: When you go into the - the airport, if you travel, which, you  know--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --you do, I do. They have the screens in front of every barstool.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: So, like, you and I--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --instead of hanging out, talking with one another and--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --and kicking it off, now everybody's distracted by these  devices.</p><p>STEYN: Right. Sometimes--</p><p>KERSTING: So the--</p><p>STEYN: --you want to go where only Facebook knows--</p><p>KERSTING: --so - so it's like a - it's like--</p><p>STEYN: --you're in that area (ph).</p><p>KERSTING: --right. It's like bottles of wine dangling around if you're an  alcoholic--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --24 hours a day, seven days a week, you can't escape from it.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. That's - that's a - that's a - a worrying thing. As I said, I  think this is one of the biggest stories of time, Tom. I dread (ph) to  think--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --where we're going to be if - if we're - if we don't change it. But  how do we change it?</p><p>KERSTING: Well we have - it's - it's not something that's going to happen  overnight. We just have to keep creating awareness, having conversations  like you and I are having right now, so that people could see this. They  can understand the ramifications of these things. I'm one of the guys out  there, you know, that's lecturing--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --that's writing about it and that's out there trying to get  other people to do the same. And it's - it's going to be a slow process but  I think we're going to have to get there.</p><p>STEYN: OK. Well we will - we will hold you to that Tom because something -  these companies are bigger than countries now. </p><p>That is about it for us tonight. You can tune in each night at 8:00 to the  show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink.  And don't forget to DVR the show. That's less harmful, less addictive than  if you just go on Facebook and look at it. Don't bother with that. Just DVR  the show, if you haven't set that up already.</p><p>Now, this is exciting moment in the evening. We are going to lift Nancy  Pelosi's beaded curtain and find out who is guest-hosting for Sean Hannity  tonight. Oh, who is it going to be? They've lifted the beaded curtain. I  think I can see--</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR UTAH'S 3RD CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT  AND GOVERNMENT REFORM, COMMENTATOR: Oh, Mark.</p><p>STEYN: --Jason Kennedy filling in for Sean. Hey Jason--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p>STEYN: --oh, no, Jason Chaffetz. What--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Mark, thank you, great show.</p><p>STEYN: After all, hey by--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I always love it when you're on with Tucker.</p><p>STEYN: No.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I love it when you're on, so--</p><p>STEYN: Hey - hey, by--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: --thank you so much.</p><p>STEYN: --by the way, that was a terrific interview you did with Sam Johnson  today.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: And everyone should look at that. That was the best thing on TV this  morning.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well--</p><p>STEYN: Terrific stuff.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you. Thanks to Fox &amp; Friends. We have - actually later in  the show, we're going to go back and tell you about Sam Johnson, a special  man, an amazing personality and a true American hero, so thanks, Mark. We  appreciate it.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Jason. Have a great show.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

They decided to  attack the troops as well.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARBARA STARR, PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT, CNN: The pool reporters traveling  said that the troops brought the hats with them, including one hat that  said \"Trump 2020.\" We will have to see if that actually proves to be the  case. </p><p> The question is, if they - if they brought them or if the President brought  them, what commander allowed that to really happen, because this is very  much against military policy and regulation. Troops are not supposed to be  involved in political activities. The U.S. Military is not a political  force.</p><p> JOHN FRANCIS KIRBY, RETIRED UNITED STATES NAVY REAR ADMIRAL, FORMER  SPOKESPERSON FOR THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE: It's completely  inappropriate for the troops to do this.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not supposed to--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Of course, nobody cared back when presidential candidate Barack  Obama signed memorabilia for the troops back in 2008. He had a D after his  name though instead of an R. Thankfully, not everybody's lost their minds.  Even some Liberals scolded the media for their hysteria.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DAVID AXELROD, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, POLITICAL  CONSULTANT, ANALYST: It's - it's good that he went to see the troops,  important that he went to do it. He - he was criticized for it, obviously.  They wanted to address that. And so, I should - we should give him credit  where credit is due.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It just sends a - such a strong message that the - the  Trumps love our military, support our military, and what a great time to do  it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Well Joe Concha writes about Media for The Hill. He joins us now.  Joe, is this a good look for the media? Why are serving soldiers in a war  zone bringing particular hats to an event on base in a combat zone at  Christmas?</p><p> JOE CONCHA, THE HILL MEDIA REPORTER: Well the optics around that, Mark, are  horrific, right, because what you're doing here is it's - it's OK to go  after the President in terms of policy or the things that he says. </p><p> Once you start attacking the people that voted for him or military people  that are obviously serving overseas during Christmas, no less, then--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> CONCHA: --then you got a problem. And you have to ask yourself this  question, Mark. </p><p> Let's say, honestly, like you pointed out, as I did in my column today on  The Hill, if President Obama, as he did in 2008, signed a Hope and Change  t-shirts, do you really think any news organization would have gone ahead  with that story? Of course, they wouldn't have.</p><p> STEYN: No. I - I couldn't care less. Well what soldiers in these, frankly,  God-awful situations, because life in it - at a base in Iraq stinks. You -  it's not like being in Ramstein, Germany where the President was today. You  can't stroll down to town go to a local bar, meet one of the nice German  girls, or one of the local guy (ph), you know, that's nothing like that.</p><p> You're stuck in that lousy fortress that you hope is a fortress. And the  President comes to visit you. And the pre-occupation of the American media  is whether hats the troops chose to take to that event are somehow some  potential crime that they can be pulled up in front of a military court  for. I mean that's bonkers--</p><p> CONCHA: Yes, Mark, and--</p><p> STEYN: --isn't it?</p><p> CONCHA: --it's bonkers, yes. And I think that pivot happened because the  original narrative was, we - we'd all recall is that, President Trump was  supposed to be the first President since 2002 to not visit the troops at  Christmas. </p><p> And once that fell apart, when he literally landed in Iraq as the story was  going up and it originally came from NBC, then social media goes nuts. And  - and what happened was the pivot went from, \"Oh yes, OK. Trump went, sure,  but what was his motive exactly for going?\"</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> CONCHA: I - I give you The Washington Post, Mark, quoting, the President's  visit follows months of public pressure for him to spend time with troops  deployed to conflicts in the Middle East. Think about that again, follows  months of public pressure.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> CONCHA: In other words, we, the media, got the public riled up to force  Trump to go to a war zone instead of him just going like every president  has done for the past 17 years.</p><p> STEYN: Well - well according to Soledad O'Brien, who's a lovely lady, but  she thought it was actually minutes of public pressure that Alyssa Milano  who - who actually tweeted as the President was halfway across the ocean,  why haven't you visited our troops, Soledad O - O'Brien actually gave  Alyssa Milano credit for shaming the President into getting on the plane  that he'd already gotten on.</p><p> CONCHA: Yes. And then what's forgotten in all this, of course, is if you  want to go to Walter Reed, let's say the President was shamed, and he goes  to Walter Reed, which is close to the White House, OK, then you could say  it's a last-minute thing. When you go to Iraq, you kind of have to plan it  in advance. You have to do it weeks in advance, obviously, for security.</p><p> Air Force One has to fly in with shades down and cellphones off and - and  all of that. So, you think you'd see though however, at least from NBC and  - and - and others, some remorse, some apology, some around, you know,  \"Hey, we went ahead with this story a little bit too early because we ran a  story on Christmas saying that the President hadn't been to see the troops  on Christmastime.\"</p><p> People don't mind that sort of transparency from the media. But yet, we  never see those sort of concessions. Instead, we see the pivots that are  negative like we always do in these situations. And that's why trust in  media is this. </p><p> Axios, SurveyMonkey poll just last year, 93 percent of Republicans think  that the media knowingly creates stories, makes them up, they're false. And  you say all right (ph), that's Republicans. They've always hated the media.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> CONCHA: They don't trust them. 79 percent of - of independents, Mark--</p><p> STEYN: Right.</p><p> CONCHA: 53 percent of Democrats, even a majority, that's the thing. I mean  this is something that's going across the board--</p><p> STEYN: Sure (ph).</p><p> CONCHA: --in terms of all parties seeing exactly what's happening here,  sir.</p><p> STEYN: Hey Joe, thanks. Don't worry about that though. As soon as the media  call for a Special Counsel to investigate how those MAGA hats got to Iraq,  everything will be fine.</p><p> CONCHA: There you go (ph).</p><p> STEYN: Rochelle Ritchie is a former Press Secretary for the House  Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, and Rachel Campos-Duffy is  a Fox contributor, and they both join us.</p><p> Rochelle, how - stepping back and looking at this a little more objectively  than CNN &amp; Co. have done, is it really a good law - the troops liked the  guy. The guy got on with the troops. Is there really any political mileage  to be had in going on about this?</p><p> ROCHELLE RITCHIE, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY, HOUSE DEMOCRATIC POLICY AND  COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: So, I had a little bit of  a battle with myself about this. At first, I was saying, you know, no,  these men and women in uniform, they shouldn't have, you know, gotten their  hats signed. They shouldn't have been out there with Make America Great  Again hats.</p><p> And, you know, when you look at the facts, yes, it is a - it is breaking a  rule when it comes to the Department of Defense guidelines. But at the same  time, these troops have not seen an American President since 2009. I  believe Obama was the last one to - to go visit.</p><p> So, maybe they're not necessarily, you know, showing support for the  President or getting his signature because they are Republican--</p><p> STEYN: Yes, no, come on, who--</p><p> RITCHIE: --maybe - no, listen, listen--</p><p> STEYN: --no--</p><p> RITCHIE: --no, see, how can you disagree? I haven't even finished. </p><p> The Commander - it's their Commander-in-Chief. So, maybe it's not because  he's a Republican President. Maybe they're looking at it like he's the  Commander-in-Chief. We're proud to fight for our country or fight - we're  proud to stand behind our President--</p><p> STEYN: Let--</p><p> RITCHIE: --whether he has an R or a D behind his name. And, look, I could  really care less if the guys do it. As long as they're continuing to  protect our national security, have at it.</p><p> STEYN: Well Rochelle gave that theory rather more credit than I would  think, Rachel. I mean who the--</p><p> RITCHIE: I'm very balanced.</p><p> STEYN: --who the hell - if you have the misfortune to be spending Christmas  on one of those - those forts, cut off from life in the middle of the Iraqi  desert--</p><p> RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, AMERICAN TELEVISION PERSONALITY, FOX NEWS  CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.</p><p> STEYN: --who the hell cares what hat you take to a Christmas party  basically.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Of course, they shouldn't care. But I think the more  important question is why do - I mean - let's be honest. The reaction from  the troops was very overwhelmingly positive. And it should be. </p><p> Listen, Barack Obama decimated our military. Barack Obama--</p><p> RITCHIE: OK.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --wait a minute. He did. He cut funding for our military. He  put in rules of engagement that actually--</p><p> RITCHIE: But that's not even--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --caused - wait a minute that actually caused--</p><p> RITCHIE: But what does that have to do with--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --but let - let--</p><p> RITCHIE: --what we're talking about though with this Trump (ph)--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let - it does. It does have to do.</p><p> RITCHIE: --how?</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Because the - Barack Obama did all in - enacted rules of  engagement--</p><p> RITCHIE: I don't. It has nothing to do--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --Rochelle, let me finish. Rochelle--</p><p> RITCHIE: --OK. Go ahead, Rachel.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let me finish. He enacted rules of engagement that actually  put our military on the battlefield in danger--</p><p> STEYN: Well--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --causing more battles (ph) but wait - wait a minute, Mark.  He did that.</p><p> RITCHIE: I'm sorry.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: And he went to the troops and they said he was a great  Commander-in-Chief. Donald Trump goes--</p><p> STEYN: Let me--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --over and does all this to not for Alyssa Milano or the  media - or the media. But he does it because he loves the troops. And they  say that he's doing it for a photo op.</p><p> STEYN: Oh--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: This is a man who loves the military.</p><p> STEYN: No, how (ph)--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was his number one issue.</p><p> RITCHIE: I - I--</p><p> STEYN: OK. How about this as a non-Democrat, non-Republican thing?  Democrats weren't in favor of the 21st Century Bush Wars, as they called  them.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right.</p><p> RITCHIE: Right.</p><p> STEYN: But nor was Donald - nor was Donald Trump in 2016.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: That's right.</p><p> STEYN: In - in a sense, Donald Trump is at odds with both Democrat policy  and Republican policy on the Middle East, Rochelle.</p><p> RITCHIE: Yes. He's definitely fighting both sides. And I think what - when  you talked about the press, I think the reason why the press is sort of  attacking on him, the - the Left-leaning press, I would say, is because of  some of the - the misleading comments that he made when he talked about the  pay raises for the military. We know that's not--</p><p> STEYN: Well they do - they did get the pay rises (ph).</p><p> RITCHIE: --necessarily true. They do get raises. But they're not getting a  10 percent raise. It's going to be, I think, 2.6 percent. So, I think there  are ways that the media was looking at it and attacking him for his less- than-knowledgeable education, I guess you could say, on what's really  happening--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: But (ph)--</p><p> RITCHIE: --there. But I don't I - I think that him visiting was a good  idea. I think there was an article by The Washington Post where it said  that he was actually scared to go over there for some time. So, I'm glad--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Ridiculous.</p><p> RITCHIE: --he got over that.</p><p> STEYN: That's a--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: He was not scared. And - and what would the media, you know,  betting MAGAs hats (ph) what would they have had him do? Say, \"Oh, I'm  sorry. I'm not going to sign your hat because of the Hatch Act,\" and then  they--</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --would have criticized him and said--</p><p> RITCHIE: Well--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --\"Hey, what a jerk. He wouldn't sign a hat.\"</p><p> STEYN: By the way there's too much--</p><p> RITCHIE: I just - I just said I thought that was perfectly fine.</p><p> STEYN: --there's too much of that. The minute you--</p><p> RITCHIE: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --if you're seriously talking about soldiers doing something wrong  because they asked their Commander-in-Chief to sign a hat, then - then  you've flown the coop. That's not a land of law and things (ph)--</p><p> RITCHIE: I want to know (ph)--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: It's - it's a bad look for the press. It's - the reason why  the American people hate the press and, by the way, the troops loved the  President because--</p><p> RITCHIE: Wait, wait, what is this? This is (ph) press--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --the troops love the President because he did sign a bill  that he took a lot of flack from the - from the Right for signing a big  bill that was--</p><p> RITCHIE: I think - I think--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --for funding the military.</p><p> RITCHIE: --I think that Trump's whole purpose--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: They love him.</p><p> RITCHIE: --of being there and - and this is - is - this is part of it, I  think that he also has a lot, I think, there was a - a part in this segment  right before you came to us about--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> RITCHIE: --this being public pressure. I think it's more political pressure  because of him, you know, General Kelly, then General Mattis, and so I  think that he's really trying to show that he has some sort of control of  what's happening right now in the middle in - in--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right. Why didn't - why didn't the--</p><p> STEYN: No, no, no, no--</p><p> RITCHIE: --Iraq. But then - but--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --why doesn't that criticism come to Barack Obama? He goes to  visit the troop, no one questions his motives.</p><p> RITCHIE: Well Obama is living his best life somewhere (ph).</p><p> STEYN: No, but it's a - that - you can't do--</p><p> RITCHIE: Can we leave him out of it?</p><p> STEYN: --those--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: But - but there is a double standard. And that is what people  are talking about, Rochelle.</p><p> STEYN: We got to - we got to go, ladies.</p><p> RITCHIE: OK.</p><p> STEYN: Iraq's a crazy place. You can't just plan those things with no  notice.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Absolutely, I agree (ph).</p><p> RITCHIE: No, you can't.</p><p> STEYN: Rochelle and Rachel will carry--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was Alyssa Milano.</p><p> STEYN: --this - this ones (ph) and they're going to take this to the green  room - where now - this is worse than the Sunni Triangle, the violence  that's like (ph) percolating it.</p><p> We're now on day six of the government shutdown triggered by Congress'  refusal to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. </p><p> Today, the President tweeted, \"Have the Democrats finally realized that we  desperately need border security and a wall on the Southern border? We need  to stop drugs, human trafficking, gang members, and criminals from coming  into our country. And do the Dems realize that most of the people not  getting paid are Democrats?\"</p><p> Fox Washington Correspondent, Rich Edson, joins us with more on the  situation in D.C. It's all yours.</p><p> RICH EDSON, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p>Congress officially and briefly gaveled in this afternoon though there is  no sign of this shutdown ending anytime soon as Democrats in (ph) the White  House are a few billion dollars apart on funding for a wall on the Southern  border. President Trump has returned to the White House after visiting U.S.  forces yesterday in Iraq.</p><p> He's just tweeted, \"This isn't about the wall. Everybody knows that a wall  will work perfectly. In Israel, the wall works 99.9 percent. This is only  about the Dems not letting Donald Trump and the Republicans have a win.  They may have the 10 Senate votes. But we have the issue, border security.  2020.\"</p><p> In a statement, White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders says,  \"The President and his team in Washington over Christmas hoping to  negotiate a deal that would stop the dangerous crisis on the border,  protect American communities, and re-open the government, the Democrats  decided to go home.\"</p><p> She also says the Administration offered Democrats what she calls a  reasonable common-sense solution five days ago, though a spokesperson for  House Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, says, \"Democrats have offered  Republicans three options to re-open the government that all include  funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security, but not the  President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall.\"</p><p> While in Iraq, President Trump stressed the funding bill must include money  for a border wall.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The folks are saying, \"Can  we have some drones? Can we have technology?\" Technology is bells and  whistles. You have to have a wall. You have to have protection. </p><p> When you say, \"How long is it going to take?\" \"When are they going to say  that we need border security?\"</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EDSON: Pelosi's office says Democrats will pass their bill to open the  government after they take control of the House next week. Though to end  this shutdown, the House, the Senate, and the White House must all agree on  the same funding bill.</p><p> On Capitol Hill, House Freedom Caucus Chairman, Mark Meadows, says the  needle has moved towards a very long shutdown, as Democrats and Republicans  appear to talk past one another.</p><p> Mark?</p><p> STEYN: Thanks a lot, Rich.</p><p> This is a Fox News Alert. Police in California are on the hunt for an  unnamed illegal immigrant, suspected of murdering a police officer.  Corporal Ronil Singh, an immigrant from Fiji, was gunned down Wednesday  morning during a traffic stop. Police have released surveillance footage of  the suspect, and say they believe he is still in the area. We will continue  to monitor this breaking story. </p><p> And coming up, Tucker will be back with us to discuss the crisis of  American manhood. Plus, President Trump insists the government won't re- open until he has money for his wall. But if he gets it, will that wall  work? That's next on TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> STEYN: El Paso, Texas is turning into Exhibit A of America's broken  immigration system. ICE has been overwhelmed by asylum requests and  shackled by court rulings, and it's now releasing hundreds of migrants onto  the streets of El Paso.</p><p> The message to future migrants, of course, is that America is powerless to  stop them from settling here. Fox's Jonathan Hunt is here with more.  Jonathan?</p><p> JONATHAN HUNT, CHIEF CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p> Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, says the immigration system  is at breaking point. Border Patrol agents say they're overwhelmed. Around  1,000 immigrants have been released onto the streets of El Paso, Texas this  week alone. </p><p> And two young immigrant children have died after being taken into custody  by Customs and Border Protection agents, the first deaths of children in  CBP custody for a decade.</p><p> In El Paso, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say they have  little choice but to release those hundreds of immigrants because of,  quote, decades of inaction by Congress that they say has limited their  ability to remove families who are in the U.S. illegally, and has set  limits on how long they can hold those families.</p><p> So, they're being dropped off at a bus station in El Paso, where aid groups  are offering support. More, by the way, are expected to be released today.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DYLAN CORBETT, DIRECTOR, HOPE BORDER INSTITUTE (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): They  have spent eight to 10 days in cells. Now they've been released. What we've  been doing as a community is to support them, giving them food, a place for  them to stay at night.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HUNT: President Trump has repeatedly said the era of so-called catch and  release has ended. But frankly, that is exactly what is happening in Texas  right now. And it all comes against the backdrop of the government shutdown  over President Trump's demand for a Border wall that he says could stem the  flow of illegal immigration.</p><p> The wall and, of course, the deaths of those two immigrant children will no  doubt top the agenda when Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen visits the  Border area in El Paso, Texas, Friday, and Yuma, Arizona, Saturday. </p><p> Mark?</p><p> STEYN: Just - just to be clear on that, Jonathan, ICE can hold these people  if that chap is right for - for 10 days or whatever. And then meanwhile  they're given a two-year court date. So, in the gap between the 10 days and  the two years, they just get to hang out in America? That's - that's the  idea of it (ph)?</p><p> HUNT: Right. Well what - what ICE is saying is that under the current laws,  they have no choice but to release these immigrants after that time frame.  And, therefore, they take them to the bus station and then, yes,  essentially they are free to go where they wish to do as they please, Mark.</p><p> STEYN: Well that seems a bit of a design flaw, Jonathan.</p><p> While - while migrants continue to pour into the United States, critics of  the President maintain that nothing can be done because a wall's useless.  CNN's Brian Karem recently ranted about the futility of mankind's oldest  defensive mechanism.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRIAN KAREM, JOURNALIST, PLAYBOY'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, CNN  POLITICAL  ANALYST, FORMER EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY SENTINEL: This  whole issue is a crock from start to finish. He picked it up on the  campaign trail as something to appease the masses and play to his base. </p><p> It's not going to stop terrorism. It's not going to be 2,000 miles long, as  originally planned. It's not going to be see-through. It's not going to be  eco- friendly. It's not going to be slats or heads on pikes or a beaded  curtain or anything else. You can't wall that border.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Jimmy Kimmel, meanwhile, has been ridiculing, Americans were so  desperate for a secure border they've been willing to donate to a GoFundMe  campaign for it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!: This - this  Trump supporter, guy named Brian Kolfage, started a GoFundMe campaign to  raise a billion dollars for the wall. He launched it on Sunday. It's  already up to almost $9 million. People - this is what people do with their  disposable income when they don't have loans from college to pay off.</p><p> (CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p> KIMMEL: Donating money for a wall that will never exist. It - it's like  starting a college fund for Harry Potter.</p><p> (CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p> KIMMEL: It's a - it's a - a more useful thing to do with your money would  be to go outside and feed it to a bird. But--</p><p> (CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p> KIMMEL: --you do have to admire the sacrifice they're making. I mean lot of  these people are dipping into their meth money for this.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Got it. Meth heads for national security. Thank you, Jimmy. So,  would a wall work or not?</p><p> Jason Piccolo is a former Special Agent and Supervisor with the Department  of Homeland Security, and he joins us now. </p><p> Everybody's mocking this. We've had Nancy Pelosi doing her beaded curtain  line. At this stage, I would welcome a 2,000 mile beaded curtain along the  Southern border. It would show a certain kind of resolve. But are these  critics right that this thing doesn't work, doesn't make any difference,  complete waste of time?</p><p> JASON PICCOLO, FORMER ICE SUPERVISOR, OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM VETERAN: No,  it'll work. Now the border is 2,000 miles long. And you won't be able to  actually wall the whole border. But that'll create chokepoints or - or  points where we could actually apprehend the immigrants coming in.</p><p> STEYN: Yes, well--</p><p> PICCOLO: So, yes, a wall would work.</p><p> STEYN: --yes. What's interesting to me is that if you look at up on the  Northern border, where there's far fewer people coming across, there's not  caravans massing on the 49th parallel, and yet, the United States  government has actually put physical barricades in a lot of cross border  towns on the Canadian border, presumably because it works there. </p><p> So, why would it not work on the Mexican border?</p><p> PICCOLO: Walls work. They do. Now, when I worked on a border, the border  was simply a strand of fence in some areas like a strand of wire. Now, you  have narco-traffickers coming across that same area. You have economic  migrants, it's just it's open. The whole border is pretty much open except  for, you know, few miles here and there.</p><p> STEYN: When - when you say it's open, because most - most people who cross  international frontiers legitimately will do so at big border posts. </p><p> But you're saying that even though we talk about this incessantly, there  are actually 100-mile stretches where people can actually just walk into  the United States, a country that's supposedly been on Orange Alert for 17  years.</p><p> PICCOLO: Yes, definitely. Now, I was on the DHS' human smuggling cell back  in 2015. And we tracked human smuggling corridors coming up from South  America. </p><p> Now, you do have Special Interest Aliens transiting into South America,  into Brazil, and traveling up those same routes that the economic migrants  and the narco-traffickers are using. So there--</p><p> STEYN: So--</p><p> PICCOLO: --anybody can come and go through that border.</p><p> STEYN: So you mean - you mean, when you say Special Interest Aliens, you -  you mean that potential jihadists have figured out. They - they look at  what's on their TV screens on the Rio Grande, and figure that instead of  trying to fly to JFK, you might as well just go to Latin America and walk  into the country.</p><p> PICCOLO: You can. The border's open. Now, I detailed out in Ajo, Arizona at  one time back in the early 2000s. And it was literally one strand of barbed  wire. So, yes, you could - anybody could walk across that border when the  various (ph) intent are with coming here for economic migration.</p><p> STEYN: A strand of barbed wire. That seems even more useless than the  beaded curtain. Jason, thank you for that. And thank you for the eyewitness  testimony on that Southern border. I'm not sure people actually visualize  it quite the way you know it.</p><p> Coming up, Tucker's going to be here to discuss the declining fortunes of  American men. And Paris is still coping with riots after the government  tried to levy a carbon tax. So, why do lawmakers want a carbon tax here?  That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> STEYN: It was another chaotic day on Wall Street today. Yesterday, the Dow  Jones average had its largest single-day gain in history. Today, the  average went on another downward streak falling by 600 points. </p><p> But in the afternoon, the market rallied surging almost 900 points to  finish the day up by 258 points. The market is still down about 2,500  points this month in what's been a very tumultuous end to the year. It's  like these algorithms just fell face-down in the eggnog.</p><p> The French have been rioting for more than a month now after Emmanuel  Macron's government tried to impose an anti-global warming gas tax upon  them. Nevertheless, a lot of Americans, including the outgoing Senator Jeff  Flake, think it's time for America to have its own carbon tax. Is that  wise?</p><p> Mark Reynolds is Executive Director of the Citizens Climate Lobby, and he  joins us. Mark, when you see what's happening in France, that's a more  extreme version of what happens when carbon taxes are actually put into  place elsewhere. People don't seem to like it, don't seem to care for it.</p><p> MARK REYNOLDS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CITIZENS CLIMATE LOBBY: First of all,  thank you so much for having me on the show. The nice thing about the  Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is that it actually puts money in  people's pockets. So, I think that there's people who are suffering both  here and in other countries. </p><p> And I think that the reason that there's so much Republicans' support -  support on both the House and the Senate version of this bill is it  actually sends, allocates money back to households, so that they are  prepared to deal with whatever they have to.</p><p> And again--</p><p> STEYN: Well--</p><p> REYNOLDS: --it doesn't tell them what to do with that money, just lets them  make a choice about whatever they want to do with it.</p><p> STEYN: Well let me tell - this is the bill that's being proposed in - the  carbon tax is being proposed in the United States, which under the proposal  supposedly then gives money back to households. But here's one big problem  with it, Mark.</p><p> Basically, the automatic increases kick in, I think, starting around 2022,  and they basically go all the way up until mid-century. So, and it's beyond  the control of other congresses. It just becomes like an entitlement  program that gets automatic increases every year and is beyond the control.</p><p> You can't go to a polling station if you don't like it, if the facts  change, if the circumstances change. It essentially puts the carbon tax  beyond democratic - democratic accountability, doesn't it?</p><p> REYNOLDS: Well Representative Francis Rooney, who's the lead Republican  sponsor from Florida says that he likes this bill because it's market- based. It actually lets the market determine how we get to the new energy  economy. </p><p> I think that's a lot of what Mr. Fitzpatrick, one of the Republicans on the  bill also said is, is, you know, you put a fee on carbon-based emissions,  you give the money back to households so that the government doesn't pick  what to do with it. You don't pick winners and losers. It'll be up for you  to--</p><p> STEYN: What about--</p><p> REYNOLDS: --to you and I to determine what we do with a dividend. But it'll  be actually a free-market bill--</p><p> STEYN: Well--</p><p> REYNOLDS: --and that's what the Republicans on the bill said they like  about it so much.</p><p> STEYN: What do you make of the CEI, the Competitive Enterprise Institute's  objection to it that it will actually kill America's new energy  independence, which is a phenomenon in the last few years, what we see with  fracking and so forth, and means we're no longer dependent on malign Saudi  sheiks who use their oil riches to spread their Wahhabist ideology around  the world. </p><p> The CEI's view is that the carbon tax is going to kill American energy  independence.</p><p> REYNOLDS: Yes. So, I think there's something really interesting happening  right now. There's actually a race to the new energy economy. And it's  probably going to be either us or China. China is making a huge investment  in renewable energy. And I heard - certainly hope it's us.</p><p> So, what I think that this bill does is creates enough incentive throughout  the entire--</p><p> STEYN: Well--</p><p> REYNOLDS: --economic system to create all the type of--</p><p> STEYN: --wait, wait.</p><p> REYNOLDS: --innovation that we know we need.</p><p> STEYN: But there's no carbon tax in China. The Yangtze is like the most  polluted river in the world the - with the - with what's coming down that  stream every day. It's nothing you'd want any of your kids to be gambling  and frolicking in.</p><p> So, they won't wait - what - what the French - the - the French protesters  object to is that this is their lives. It's not a theory. It's not a  macroeconomic theory. If it's a choice between sea levels in Tuvalu in the  22nd Century or how they have to live their lives in the century they're  actually living in, they'll prioritize the reality of their lives over  speculation a century hence.</p><p> REYNOLDS: Yes. I think that that's why so many Republicans like this bill  in both the House and Senate is because money's actually returned. You get  a monthly check and then it's your choice what you do with it. </p><p> I'm not going to tell you what to do with the money. The government's not  going to tell you what to - what to do with the money. It's going to be up  to American households to determine what to do.</p><p> STEYN: And - and you believe - and you believe that's good at - because  everything you - they always say that and then it goes into the General  Fund. The gas - gasoline taxes, they were supposed to be about it and they  all go into it (ph). Well we'll - we'll see how it works out. I don't see  the public appetite for it. </p><p> But, Mark, thank you for - thank you for talking with us today. And happy  post--</p><p> REYNOLDS: Yes. And thank you for - thank you for having me on. And let me  just say to the people who are watching, there is one of our chapters in  every community out there from Boise, Idaho, to Birmingham, Alabama. If you  want to work with people on solutions, we have a big tent, and we would  love to see you in your neighborhood.</p><p> STEYN: OK. Big tents we like. And we won't heat them with conventional  energy sources.</p><p> REYNOLDS: OK.</p><p> STEYN: Thank you for that, Mark. Happy post-Boxing Day to you. </p><p> It's time for Tucker's Final Exam. Have you been following the news over  the Christmas period? Find out if you can remember it better than the big- time professionals here at Fox. That's up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT: FINAL EXAM.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Oh, you know what that music means. It's time for Tucker's Final  Exam where the news professionals are interrogated, see if they can  actually remember the events they cover every day. </p><p> This week's Final Exam is a New York Special. We have Kennedy, the last  non-guest host in the building. And also - and also with us, from FOX News  Headlines 24/7, Carley Shimkus.</p><p> And actually, speaking of guest hosting, Carley will actually be in this  slot on Monday night. But for some reason we're going to stick her outside- -</p><p> LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, KENNEDY HOST, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Oh.</p><p> STEYN: --for the duration of the show. And then Kennedy will follow Carley.  So, this is the Fox New Year's Eve team. You'll--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Right.</p><p> STEYN: --you'll get a heads-up on ahead. Stay ahead of (ph)--</p><p> CARLEY SHIMKUS, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 REPORTER: We're going to have lot  of fun.</p><p> STEYN: --tuning in. OK, contestants, hands on buzzers. I'm going to ask the  questions. And the first one to buzz in gets to answer. But you must wait  until I finish asking. </p><p> You can answer once and I shall acknowledge you, according to rules set by  the International Quiz Show Committee in Geneva, by saying your name.  Correct answer's worth one point. Get it wrong, you lose a point. Best of  five wins. </p><p> Let's get started. Question one, an outgoing Democrat Senator just blasted  newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling her a shiny new object with cheap  rhetoric. Which lawmaker made those remarks?</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p> STEYN: And it's Kennedy.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Claire McCaskill.</p><p> STEYN: Claire McCaskill. Let's roll that tape.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CLAIRE CONNER MCCASKILL, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MISSOURI: I don't  know her. I'm - I'm a little confused why she's the thing. But it's a good  example of what I'm talking about, a bright and shiny new object.</p><p> The rhetoric is cheap. Getting results is a lot harder.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Meow. Saucer of--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --milk for Senator McCaskill.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Don't let the door hit you where the Lord split you, Senator  McCaskill.</p><p> STEYN: So, that's first blood to Kennedy. One-Zip as we head into question  two.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: OK.</p><p> STEYN: This is critical for Carley. Otherwise she - she'll be losing that  New Year's Eve gig. Question--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p> STEYN: --question two. Former First Lady, Michelle Obama, is now the most  admired woman in all of America. That's according to a new Gallup poll. But  to get them, Michelle Obama had to bump another woman who'd held on to the  top spot for 17 years.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p> STEYN: Who was the other woman?</p><p> SHIMKUS: I know it (ph).</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p> STEYN: Oh. And it's Kennedy again.</p><p> SHIMKUS: It was just a guess from me anyway.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Hillary Clinton.</p><p> STEYN: Oh, come on. Hillary Clinton, the most admired woman in America? The  17 - are you kidding me? Let's roll that tape.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Michelle Obama has overtaken Hillary Clinton as the  most admired woman in the country.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Good job. Oh, man. I'm getting cleaned (ph).</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Clinton held that top spot on that list for 17 years.  What does that say about Hillary now?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Me too (ph).</p><p> SHIMKUS: You know what? I thought it - I - I wanted to say Oprah because--</p><p> STEYN: Right.</p><p> SHIMKUS: --I thought - I feel like that - were truly is one of the most  admired women in America. But I think Hillary is now third and--</p><p> STEYN: No, yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: --Molly (ph) is in second or something like that.</p><p> STEYN: Oprah - Oprah is number two. But it's a tragedy--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --for Hillary. She was once the most admired--</p><p> SHIMKUS: She lost again.</p><p> STEYN: --woman in America and--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: I blame the Latvian bot farm and misogyny.</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Even though there are other women on the list, so--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Of course.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: --very misogynistic that she got the heave-ho.</p><p> STEYN: Yes, absolutely.</p><p> SHIMKUS: We are clearly on that list as well, four and five.</p><p> STEYN: Yes. Macedonian content farmers fixed that thing right (ph). It's  Two-Zip to Kennedy. This is--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p> STEYN: --come on, come on Carley.</p><p> SHIMKUS: I just want one point.</p><p> STEYN: Come on, you don't want to be outside on New Year's Eve.</p><p> SHIMKUS: I don't.</p><p> STEYN: This - we'll give you - we'll give you a studio if you can turn this  thing around.</p><p> SHIMKUS: OK.</p><p> STEYN: Question three. We recently told you about a popular calendar in  Russia, which features various images of a shirtless Vladimir Putin. That  same calendar is now a monster hit in another country and is outselling  ones featuring puny homegrown celebrities. Which country is it?</p><p> SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND) </p><p> SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p> STEYN: No, no. No. And this is (ph) - Kennedy.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: United States.</p><p> STEYN: Chest-less (ph) Putin in the United States?</p><p> SHIMKUS: Let's see.</p><p> STEYN: Doesn't sound likely.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm blushing. They're flying off the shelves in Japan--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: No.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --of all places.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Oh.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Oh.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A chain of Lifestyle stores indicates that the calendars  are their--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: I'll take a win by a loss.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --top-seller.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Russian President featured dipping into a hot tub  and posing with a fish.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Fell came there (ph)--</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's (ph) like 60 years old. Not looking too bad.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Wow.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And here he is cuddling a leopard, a very docile  leopard. The popularity of the calendars is reportedly fueled by a surge in  self-proclaimed Putin fans. Get them while they're hot, ladies. Putin--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: While they're hot.</p><p> STEYN: Yes. There's nothing a Japanese lady likes than--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Putin and a fish (ph).</p><p> STEYN: --being in a hot tub with a KGB torturer. Kennedy, disastrous move  there. She's lost one point.</p><p> SHIMKUS: It's all right.</p><p> STEYN: So there's still everything to play for. It's Two-Zero. </p><p> Question four, multiple choice.</p><p> SHIMKUS: One-zero.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Isn't it two-ones?</p><p> STEYN: Oh, no, one - one-zero.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: One-zero. Yes, Carley--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Oh, I lost a point?</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: I thought - I thought I kept it and then--</p><p> STEYN: No, no, you - you lost it.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: --I thought I kept the other two (ph)--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh, the two points (ph)--</p><p> STEYN: You're in huge trouble now.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Oh, boy.</p><p> STEYN: Question four. This is a multiple choice question. There's a crisis  on the International Space Station. Something mysterious was found by  astronauts inside a capsule that recently docked there. And Russian  officials say it's the result of a major breach. What was it they found?</p><p> SHIMKUS: I would--</p><p> STEYN: A, a sharp knife, B, a tiny hole, or C, a jar of pickles.</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> STEYN: And it's the trigger-happy Kennedy yet again. What do you say,  Kennedy?</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Jar of pickles.</p><p> STEYN: Jar of pickles</p><p> SHIMKUS: I was going to go with A. But let's--</p><p> STEYN: Let's roll that tape.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Matter of life and death. A tiny hole discovered in a  Russian capsule--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: We were both - we would have both been wrong.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --that docks to the International Space Station.</p><p> At first, scientists suspected the hole was caused by a meteorite strike.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And a good unobstructed view now of that black spot.  That's the hole on the external hull.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A Russian cosmonaut who examined the hole--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Oh.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --believes it was drilled from inside the capsule.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Good to know. I'm learning a lot on this show, by the way--</p><p> STEYN: Yes. If you're a-</p><p> SHIMKUS: --for the very first time.</p><p> STEYN: --if you're a Russian cosmonaut, just plug that hole with the  picture of Vladimir Putin chestless in the hot tub, that'll - that'll take  care of it.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: OK. So, as a result, Kennedy's lost another point. It's now zero- zero.</p><p> SHIMKUS: The final load (ph).</p><p> STEYN: So, this is Sudden Death.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT: SUDDEN DEATH.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Sudden Death.</p><p> SHIMKUS: This is the lowest scoring game--</p><p> STEYN: The Final - this is the lowest scoring game in the history of this  show. Final question.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Maybe we've been dipping into the New Year's champagne early--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: --Mark.</p><p> STEYN: Too much Wassail and Figgy pudding. Final question. Another multiple  choice, listen carefully.</p><p> SHIMKUS: OK.</p><p> STEYN: There is a viral video of a Colorado woman chasing down a thief who  had stolen her Christmas packages from her front door. Now, there's a  special name given to people who steal in this way. Is it A, a porch  pirate, B, a parcel poacher, or C, a package snatcher?</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> STEYN: And--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p> STEYN: --Carley. Oh, can we have a round of applause for this? Carley  succeeded in actually hitting the buzzer.</p><p> SHIMKUS: I didn't (ph).</p><p> STEYN: We didn't even know hers worked but maybe (ph)--</p><p> SHIMKUS: If I win this way (ph), it is a win I do not deserve.</p><p> STEYN: Oh, OK. Let's - let's see what--</p><p> SHIMKUS: I am going with A, porch pirate.</p><p> STEYN: Porch pirate. Roll tape.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The scourge of the holiday season. Those pesky porch  pirates intent on ruining Christmas. But one woman in Lakewood, Colorado--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Oh.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --has decided to take matters into her own hands.</p><p> RENEE ABEYTA, COLORADO HOMEOWNER: I looked at my Ring videos and I saw what  happened.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Renee Abeyta confronting the brazen pirate--</p><p> ABEYTA: Hey.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --who made her way through the neighborhood with her  stolen booty.</p><p> ABEYTA: Hey.</p><p> I thought no way is this happening to me.</p><p> Give it. I'm going to (BEEP) call the police.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh, yes.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ABEYTA: I got you on camera (BEEP). Give me (BEEP) thing now.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Wow. What assault (ph) the pirate herself?</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ABEYTA: I'm - I'm chasing you.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Leave me alone, lady. I didn't take anything.</p><p> ABEYTA: Yes, you did. I saw you. Throw it down.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: All right (ph).</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ABEYTA: And I would have ran for as many miles as I had to, to get my  package.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Good for her.</p><p> STEYN: Yes. Keira Knightley didn't talk like that in Porch Pirates of the  Caribbean.</p><p> SHIMKUS: No.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: No.</p><p> STEYN: That is and we have an amazing - this is a humiliation for Kennedy.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Wise turnaround (ph).</p><p> SHIMKUS: This is - this, this I don't deserve it.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: I feel like--</p><p> SHIMKUS: I don't.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: --Hillary Clinton on Election Night.</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: My victory was a sure thing, Mark.</p><p> STEYN: Right.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Kennedy did all the heavy-lifting. And I just--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: I won the popular vote here. Everyone knows it.</p><p> STEYN: No, you won - you won at your (ph) hand, it's hitting that buzzer.  Carley just hit it - hits it once and takes the trophy.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Can I - can I say? Thank you so much.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: I believe that mug really should go to Kennedy.</p><p> STEYN: No, come on. I can't stand this good sportsmanship. Here you - here  you go. There is your Tucker Carlson mug (ph)--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Right, so (ph).</p><p> STEYN: --the mug.</p><p> SHIMKUS: We'll share.</p><p> STEYN: You'll see these ladies in this time on Monday. That's all for this  week's Final Exam. Pay attention to the news each week and tune in on  Thursdays to see if you can do better than one-buzz Carley. </p><p> Tucker will be here next, right after the break.</p><p> SHIMKUS: No, I didn't--</p><p> STEYN: Like (ph)--</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> STEYN: Tucker recently sat down to interview the Author of a new book on  the crisis afflicting American men. Here's what happened.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT: MEN IN AMERICA.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TUCKER CARLSON- HOST: If you look at the numbers, you quickly conclude that  men are in crisis in America. Compared to women, they are far more likely  to drop out of school, fail to graduate, go to jail, not hold a job, commit  suicide, die of a drug overdose. </p><p> And yet, the establishment, and particularly, Democratic establishment  seems uninterested in all of this. And they think - they appear to think  that men are still too successful and need to be held back.</p><p> Andrew Yarrow is a former New York Times reporter, a Senior Fellow with the  Progressive Policy Institute. He just wrote an important new book called,  Man Out: Men on the Sidelines of American Life. He joins us tonight in  studio.</p><p> Mr. Yarrow - Yarrow, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p> ANDREW YARROW, FORMER NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER, PROGRESSIVE POLICY  INSTITUTE  SENIOR FELLOW, MAN OUT AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker, it's a pleasure--</p><p> CARLSON: So, I should, perhaps if I'm (ph) saying--</p><p> YARROW: --yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --I don't think you're a conservative activist, and that I'm also  grateful that someone is saying this because the numbers support that it's  true.</p><p> YARROW: It is true. And, as you say, the problem has really largely been  ignored. I mean Democrats and a lot of people in the country don't see men  as having problems. But there are a lot of men who are struggling,  struggling with work, struggling in families, struggling with health, lot  of areas I touch on in my book.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, to such a great extent that it would seem a crisis that  affects everybody because, of course, men and women need each other to  reproduce on the most basic level, but also every - everybody has a father  or brother, sons--</p><p> YARROW: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --why do you think it's been ignored?</p><p> YARROW: Well, there's been a lot of political correctness in this country  that's kind of made the main narrative be that, you know, women are the  oppressed ones. And they have been historically--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> YARROW: --oppressed. But, you know, that doesn't mean that there aren't a  lot of men struggling. I mean you don't - it's not a zero-sum game.</p><p> CARLSON: You're right.</p><p> YARROW: And--</p><p> CARLSON: But it's been presented as one that one sex succeeds only when  another moves backward. Where'd that assumption come from?</p><p> YARROW: Well, I think a lot of politics looks at things that way. And I  think it's - it's pretty unfortunate. But I think, you know, men have not  been, in many ways, good at advocating for themselves.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> YARROW: I mean it's been interesting in the last few elections. A lot of  the political activists have been women. I mean you hear more from women  these days. I mean men aren't good at forming groups--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> YARROW: --anymore.</p><p> CARLSON: So, you work at - at the Progressive Policy Institute. You're a  Fellow there. That's not the Heritage Foundation.</p><p> YARROW: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: I think it's fair to say you probably work in a mostly Liberal  world.</p><p> YARROW: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: What kind of reaction did your piece get among people you know?</p><p> YARROW: Well, it's interesting. Conservative media have tended to like it  more. It's, you know, it's kind of troubling that this should be a  bipartisan issue. </p><p> I mean all Americans should be doing well or should have the opportunity to  do well. And they should also have justice behind them. I mean men are  being accused wrongly. I mean there are a lot of awful things that men do.  Don't get me wrong but--</p><p> CARLSON: Well sure.</p><p> YARROW: --but, you know, the lack of due process in some of these sexual  assault allegations, it's, you know, it's pretty troubling. </p><p> CARLSON: It's just interesting because the most progressive President the  country's ever had, FDR, four terms, the first thing he did after getting  elected in 1932, the very first piece through the Congress was the CCC, the  Civilian Conservation Corps, which was--</p><p> YARROW: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --aimed at young men, just men between--</p><p> YARROW: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --18 and 25 or something like that--</p><p> YARROW: Right</p><p> CARLSON: --getting them back to work and restoring their vitality through  work. What would happen if a Democrat in the modern era suggested something  like that?</p><p> YARROW: Well, you think it would play well. You know, while the  unemployment statistics look good, there are a lot of men who've either  been pushed out of the labor force or dropped out. I mean they're about 17  - 18 percent of 25 to 64 year old men, who aren't working. </p><p> And, you know, there are a lot of men - younger men, who are neither in  school or working. So, you know, why is that? And, you know, why can't we  create better jobs for them? And yes, I mean you'd think a Democrat would  pitch some kind of jobs program.</p><p> CARLSON: I think I mean this is a longer conversation but I think the  answer is toxic masculinity.</p><p> YARROW: Yes, I mean the--</p><p> CARLSON: Whatever that means.</p><p> YARROW: Well, yes. I mean that's become the phrase du jour, I guess. I mean  there are clearly issues with masculinity. You know, I interviewed a lot of  men and some women around the country, about 200. And a lot of men told me,  a lot of, you know, even Liberal men said, \"Well feminism's done a lot for  women. But what's it done for me?\"</p><p> CARLSON: Well that's a - that's a fair question. And you ask it in this  book. Thank you for doing that.</p><p> YARROW: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Great to talk to you.</p><p> YARROW: Good to talk to you.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: That's one of the biggest stories of our time, so is this one.</p><p> Big tech has become the greatest threat to Americans' privacy and personal  freedoms. But now, Americans seem to be wising up to that. A new survey  finds that Americans trust Facebook less than any other company. Also, a  growing number of Americans seeking treatment for tech addiction as they  find themselves unable to look away from social media, their smartphones or  video games.</p><p> Tom Kersting is a family therapist and the Author of Disconnected: How to  Reconnect Our Digitally Distracted Kids. I've read that book, and so should  you. And he joins us now.</p><p> Just to go with the Tucker, the big story of our time thing, when you look  at this so-called tech addiction, and you follow where that leads, you -  you do worry that in some ways these rinky-dinky little things that started  as cat video sites somehow basically re-wiring humanity.</p><p> TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: They are. I mean if we  looked out the back window right now and - and counted how many people were  walking by staring at their phones, you'd probably have 70 percent of them  doing that. </p><p> And when it comes to addiction which, obviously, I've studied in my  background, basically if anything, whether it's gambling, alcohol, drugs,  anything that's considered addictive its - if it's affecting one of the  following four, you could be diagnosed as - as an addict.</p><p> And the four things are, is it affecting your family, is it affecting your  health, is it affecting your job or your occupation, and is it affecting  have you had any legal issues?</p><p> STEYN: Right.</p><p> KERSTING: And when we look at technology, we could check off each one of  those for many, many people. So, therefore, this whole addictive whether  it's a debate or not, I'm all about, I believe in a 100 percent.</p><p> STEYN: The - the difference being though that it's actually being kind of  organized on a global scale with--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --billions and billions of people. And when you look at children,  like middle-schoolers--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes, yes.</p><p> STEYN: --who've never known anything but this world, their behavior does  seem to be not where middle-schoolers were--</p><p> KERSTING: It's--</p><p> STEYN: --20, 50, 70 years ago.</p><p> KERSTING: --it's actually unbelievable. I tell people I - I - I get more  middle-school age kids with major anxiety disorders per year now--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --in my private practice than I did the previous 17 years  combined.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: And, you know, and you could - all the research that's done to  put - start to show that, starting to point to, you know, that the  absorption of social media, the lack of - of self, the lack of a sense of  self and so forth and how that's affecting the self-esteem and causing, you  know, issues with anxiety, depression, and other - other mental health -  health things.</p><p> STEYN: People do actually seem to prefer it though. You have a scene in  your book where you talk about when you were a young guy, just sitting at a  bar, you'd never know who's on the barstool next.</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: I can relate to that. Sometimes--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --you find yourself on the other side of the wall, you're sitting  next to an Australian, a Hungarian--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --you - you meet different people with different views. Now everyone  in the bar is just like--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --scrolling the phone.</p><p> KERSTING: When you go into the - the airport, if you travel, which, you  know--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --you do, I do. They have the screens in front of every barstool.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: So, like, you and I--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --instead of hanging out, talking with one another and--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --and kicking it off, now everybody's distracted by these  devices.</p><p> STEYN: Right. Sometimes--</p><p> KERSTING: So the--</p><p> STEYN: --you want to go where only Facebook knows--</p><p> KERSTING: --so - so it's like a - it's like--</p><p> STEYN: --you're in that area (ph).</p><p> KERSTING: --right. It's like bottles of wine dangling around if you're an  alcoholic--</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --24 hours a day, seven days a week, you can't escape from it.</p><p> STEYN: Yes. That's - that's a - that's a - a worrying thing. As I said, I  think this is one of the biggest stories of time, Tom. I dread (ph) to  think--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --where we're going to be if - if we're - if we don't change it. But  how do we change it?</p><p> KERSTING: Well we have - it's - it's not something that's going to happen  overnight. We just have to keep creating awareness, having conversations  like you and I are having right now, so that people could see this. They  can understand the ramifications of these things. I'm one of the guys out  there, you know, that's lecturing--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --that's writing about it and that's out there trying to get  other people to do the same. And it's - it's going to be a slow process but  I think we're going to have to get there.</p><p> STEYN: OK. Well we will - we will hold you to that Tom because something -  these companies are bigger than countries now. </p><p> That is about it for us tonight. You can tune in each night at 8:00 to the  show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink.  And don't forget to DVR the show. That's less harmful, less addictive than  if you just go on Facebook and look at it. Don't bother with that. Just DVR  the show, if you haven't set that up already.</p><p> Now, this is exciting moment in the evening. We are going to lift Nancy  Pelosi's beaded curtain and find out who is guest-hosting for Sean Hannity  tonight. Oh, who is it going to be? They've lifted the beaded curtain. I  think I can see--</p><p> JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR UTAH'S 3RD CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE COMMITTEE ON  OVERSIGHT  AND GOVERNMENT REFORM, COMMENTATOR: Oh, Mark.</p><p> STEYN: --Jason Kennedy filling in for Sean. Hey Jason--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p> STEYN: --oh, no, Jason Chaffetz. What--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Mark, thank you, great show.</p><p> STEYN: After all, hey by--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: I always love it when you're on with Tucker.</p><p> STEYN: No.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: I love it when you're on, so--</p><p> STEYN: Hey - hey, by--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: --thank you so much.</p><p> STEYN: --by the way, that was a terrific interview you did with Sam Johnson  today.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: And everyone should look at that. That was the best thing on TV this  morning.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Well--</p><p> STEYN: Terrific stuff.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Thank you. Thanks to Fox &amp; Friends. We have - actually later in  the show, we're going to go back and tell you about Sam Johnson, a special  man, an amazing personality and a true American hero, so thanks, Mark. We  appreciate it.</p><p> STEYN: Thanks a lot, Jason. Have a great show.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

The mainstream media taking  the opportunity to turn a presidential visit to American troops into an  attack on Trump.

Troops are not supposed to be  involved in political activities. The U.S. Military is not a political  force.</p><p>JOHN FRANCIS KIRBY, RETIRED UNITED STATES NAVY REAR ADMIRAL, FORMER  SPOKESPERSON FOR THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE: It's completely  inappropriate for the troops to do this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not supposed to--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Of course, nobody cared back when presidential candidate Barack  Obama signed memorabilia for the troops back in 2008. He had a D after his  name though instead of an R. Thankfully, not everybody's lost their minds.  Even some Liberals scolded the media for their hysteria.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID AXELROD, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, POLITICAL  CONSULTANT, ANALYST: It's - it's good that he went to see the troops,  important that he went to do it. He - he was criticized for it, obviously.  They wanted to address that. And so, I should - we should give him credit  where credit is due.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It just sends a - such a strong message that the - the  Trumps love our military, support our military, and what a great time to do  it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Well Joe Concha writes about Media for The Hill. He joins us now.  Joe, is this a good look for the media? Why are serving soldiers in a war  zone bringing particular hats to an event on base in a combat zone at  Christmas?</p><p>JOE CONCHA, THE HILL MEDIA REPORTER: Well the optics around that, Mark, are  horrific, right, because what you're doing here is it's - it's OK to go  after the President in terms of policy or the things that he says. </p><p>Once you start attacking the people that voted for him or military people  that are obviously serving overseas during Christmas, no less, then--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: --then you got a problem. And you have to ask yourself this  question, Mark. </p><p>Let's say, honestly, like you pointed out, as I did in my column today on  The Hill, if President Obama, as he did in 2008, signed a Hope and Change  t-shirts, do you really think any news organization would have gone ahead  with that story? Of course, they wouldn't have.</p><p>STEYN: No. I - I couldn't care less. Well what soldiers in these, frankly,  God-awful situations, because life in it - at a base in Iraq stinks. You -  it's not like being in Ramstein, Germany where the President was today. You  can't stroll down to town go to a local bar, meet one of the nice German  girls, or one of the local guy (ph), you know, that's nothing like that.</p><p>You're stuck in that lousy fortress that you hope is a fortress. And the  President comes to visit you. And the pre-occupation of the American media  is whether hats the troops chose to take to that event are somehow some  potential crime that they can be pulled up in front of a military court  for. I mean that's bonkers--</p><p>CONCHA: Yes, Mark, and--</p><p>STEYN: --isn't it?</p><p>CONCHA: --it's bonkers, yes. And I think that pivot happened because the  original narrative was, we - we'd all recall is that, President Trump was  supposed to be the first President since 2002 to not visit the troops at  Christmas. </p><p>And once that fell apart, when he literally landed in Iraq as the story was  going up and it originally came from NBC, then social media goes nuts. And  - and what happened was the pivot went from, \"Oh yes, OK. Trump went, sure,  but what was his motive exactly for going?\"</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CONCHA: I - I give you The Washington Post, Mark, quoting, the President's  visit follows months of public pressure for him to spend time with troops  deployed to conflicts in the Middle East. Think about that again, follows  months of public pressure.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: In other words, we, the media, got the public riled up to force  Trump to go to a war zone instead of him just going like every president  has done for the past 17 years.</p><p>STEYN: Well - well according to Soledad O'Brien, who's a lovely lady, but  she thought it was actually minutes of public pressure that Alyssa Milano  who - who actually tweeted as the President was halfway across the ocean,  why haven't you visited our troops, Soledad O - O'Brien actually gave  Alyssa Milano credit for shaming the President into getting on the plane  that he'd already gotten on.</p><p>CONCHA: Yes. And then what's forgotten in all this, of course, is if you  want to go to Walter Reed, let's say the President was shamed, and he goes  to Walter Reed, which is close to the White House, OK, then you could say  it's a last-minute thing. When you go to Iraq, you kind of have to plan it  in advance. You have to do it weeks in advance, obviously, for security.</p><p>Air Force One has to fly in with shades down and cellphones off and - and  all of that. So, you think you'd see though however, at least from NBC and  - and - and others, some remorse, some apology, some around, you know,  \"Hey, we went ahead with this story a little bit too early because we ran a  story on Christmas saying that the President hadn't been to see the troops  on Christmastime.\"</p><p>People don't mind that sort of transparency from the media. But yet, we  never see those sort of concessions. Instead, we see the pivots that are  negative like we always do in these situations. And that's why trust in  media is this. </p><p>Axios, SurveyMonkey poll just last year, 93 percent of Republicans think  that the media knowingly creates stories, makes them up, they're false. And  you say all right (ph), that's Republicans. They've always hated the media.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: They don't trust them. 79 percent of - of independents, Mark--</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>CONCHA: 53 percent of Democrats, even a majority, that's the thing. I mean  this is something that's going across the board--</p><p>STEYN: Sure (ph).</p><p>CONCHA: --in terms of all parties seeing exactly what's happening here,  sir.</p><p>STEYN: Hey Joe, thanks. Don't worry about that though. As soon as the media  call for a Special Counsel to investigate how those MAGA hats got to Iraq,  everything will be fine.</p><p>CONCHA: There you go (ph).</p><p>STEYN: Rochelle Ritchie is a former Press Secretary for the House  Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, and Rachel Campos-Duffy is  a Fox contributor, and they both join us.</p><p>Rochelle, how - stepping back and looking at this a little more objectively  than CNN &amp; Co. have done, is it really a good law - the troops liked the  guy. The guy got on with the troops. Is there really any political mileage  to be had in going on about this?</p><p>ROCHELLE RITCHIE, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY, HOUSE DEMOCRATIC POLICY AND  COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: So, I had a little bit of  a battle with myself about this. At first, I was saying, you know, no,  these men and women in uniform, they shouldn't have, you know, gotten their  hats signed. They shouldn't have been out there with Make America Great  Again hats.</p><p>And, you know, when you look at the facts, yes, it is a - it is breaking a  rule when it comes to the Department of Defense guidelines. But at the same  time, these troops have not seen an American President since 2009. I  believe Obama was the last one to - to go visit.</p><p>So, maybe they're not necessarily, you know, showing support for the  President or getting his signature because they are Republican--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, no, come on, who--</p><p>RITCHIE: --maybe - no, listen, listen--</p><p>STEYN: --no--</p><p>RITCHIE: --no, see, how can you disagree? I haven't even finished. </p><p>The Commander - it's their Commander-in-Chief. So, maybe it's not because  he's a Republican President. Maybe they're looking at it like he's the  Commander-in-Chief. We're proud to fight for our country or fight - we're  proud to stand behind our President--</p><p>STEYN: Let--</p><p>RITCHIE: --whether he has an R or a D behind his name. And, look, I could  really care less if the guys do it. As long as they're continuing to  protect our national security, have at it.</p><p>STEYN: Well Rochelle gave that theory rather more credit than I would  think, Rachel. I mean who the--</p><p>RITCHIE: I'm very balanced.</p><p>STEYN: --who the hell - if you have the misfortune to be spending Christmas  on one of those - those forts, cut off from life in the middle of the Iraqi  desert--</p><p>RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, AMERICAN TELEVISION PERSONALITY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.</p><p>STEYN: --who the hell cares what hat you take to a Christmas party  basically.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Of course, they shouldn't care. But I think the more  important question is why do - I mean - let's be honest. The reaction from  the troops was very overwhelmingly positive. And it should be. </p><p>Listen, Barack Obama decimated our military. Barack Obama--</p><p>RITCHIE: OK.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --wait a minute. He did. He cut funding for our military. He  put in rules of engagement that actually--</p><p>RITCHIE: But that's not even--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --caused - wait a minute that actually caused--</p><p>RITCHIE: But what does that have to do with--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --but let - let--</p><p>RITCHIE: --what we're talking about though with this Trump (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let - it does. It does have to do.</p><p>RITCHIE: --how?</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Because the - Barack Obama did all in - enacted rules of  engagement--</p><p>RITCHIE: I don't. It has nothing to do--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --Rochelle, let me finish. Rochelle--</p><p>RITCHIE: --OK. Go ahead, Rachel.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let me finish. He enacted rules of engagement that actually  put our military on the battlefield in danger--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --causing more battles (ph) but wait - wait a minute, Mark.  He did that.</p><p>RITCHIE: I'm sorry.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: And he went to the troops and they said he was a great  Commander-in-Chief. Donald Trump goes--</p><p>STEYN: Let me--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --over and does all this to not for Alyssa Milano or the  media - or the media. But he does it because he loves the troops. And they  say that he's doing it for a photo op.</p><p>STEYN: Oh--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: This is a man who loves the military.</p><p>STEYN: No, how (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was his number one issue.</p><p>RITCHIE: I - I--</p><p>STEYN: OK. How about this as a non-Democrat, non-Republican thing?  Democrats weren't in favor of the 21st Century Bush Wars, as they called  them.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right.</p><p>RITCHIE: Right.</p><p>STEYN: But nor was Donald - nor was Donald Trump in 2016.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: That's right.</p><p>STEYN: In - in a sense, Donald Trump is at odds with both Democrat policy  and Republican policy on the Middle East, Rochelle.</p><p>RITCHIE: Yes. He's definitely fighting both sides. And I think what - when  you talked about the press, I think the reason why the press is sort of  attacking on him, the - the Left-leaning press, I would say, is because of  some of the - the misleading comments that he made when he talked about the  pay raises for the military. We know that's not--</p><p>STEYN: Well they do - they did get the pay rises (ph).</p><p>RITCHIE: --necessarily true. They do get raises. But they're not getting a  10 percent raise. It's going to be, I think, 2.6 percent. So, I think there  are ways that the media was looking at it and attacking him for his less- than-knowledgeable education, I guess you could say, on what's really  happening--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: But (ph)--</p><p>RITCHIE: --there. But I don't I - I think that him visiting was a good  idea. I think there was an article by The Washington Post where it said  that he was actually scared to go over there for some time. So, I'm glad--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Ridiculous.</p><p>RITCHIE: --he got over that.</p><p>STEYN: That's a--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: He was not scared. And - and what would the media, you know,  betting MAGAs hats (ph) what would they have had him do? Say, \"Oh, I'm  sorry. I'm not going to sign your hat because of the Hatch Act,\" and then  they--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --would have criticized him and said--</p><p>RITCHIE: Well--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --\"Hey, what a jerk. He wouldn't sign a hat.\"</p><p>STEYN: By the way there's too much--</p><p>RITCHIE: I just - I just said I thought that was perfectly fine.</p><p>STEYN: --there's too much of that. The minute you--</p><p>RITCHIE: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --if you're seriously talking about soldiers doing something wrong  because they asked their Commander-in-Chief to sign a hat, then - then  you've flown the coop. That's not a land of law and things (ph)--</p><p>RITCHIE: I want to know (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It's - it's a bad look for the press. It's - the reason why  the American people hate the press and, by the way, the troops loved the  President because--</p><p>RITCHIE: Wait, wait, what is this? This is (ph) press--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --the troops love the President because he did sign a bill  that he took a lot of flack from the - from the Right for signing a big  bill that was--</p><p>RITCHIE: I think - I think--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --for funding the military.</p><p>RITCHIE: --I think that Trump's whole purpose--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: They love him.</p><p>RITCHIE: --of being there and - and this is - is - this is part of it, I  think that he also has a lot, I think, there was a - a part in this segment  right before you came to us about--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>RITCHIE: --this being public pressure. I think it's more political pressure  because of him, you know, General Kelly, then General Mattis, and so I  think that he's really trying to show that he has some sort of control of  what's happening right now in the middle in - in--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right. Why didn't - why didn't the--</p><p>STEYN: No, no, no, no--</p><p>RITCHIE: --Iraq. But then - but--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --why doesn't that criticism come to Barack Obama? He goes to  visit the troop, no one questions his motives.</p><p>RITCHIE: Well Obama is living his best life somewhere (ph).</p><p>STEYN: No, but it's a - that - you can't do--</p><p>RITCHIE: Can we leave him out of it?</p><p>STEYN: --those--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: But - but there is a double standard. And that is what people  are talking about, Rochelle.</p><p>STEYN: We got to - we got to go, ladies.</p><p>RITCHIE: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Iraq's a crazy place. You can't just plan those things with no  notice.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Absolutely, I agree (ph).</p><p>RITCHIE: No, you can't.</p><p>STEYN: Rochelle and Rachel will carry--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was Alyssa Milano.</p><p>STEYN: --this - this ones (ph) and they're going to take this to the green  room - where now - this is worse than the Sunni Triangle, the violence  that's like (ph) percolating it.</p><p>We're now on day six of the government shutdown triggered by Congress'  refusal to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. </p><p>Today, the President tweeted, \"Have the Democrats finally realized that we  desperately need border security and a wall on the Southern border?

President Trump has returned to the White House after visiting U.S.  forces yesterday in Iraq.</p><p>He's just tweeted, \"This isn't about the wall. Everybody knows that a wall  will work perfectly. In Israel, the wall works 99.9 percent. This is only  about the Dems not letting Donald Trump and the Republicans have a win.  They may have the 10 Senate votes. But we have the issue, border security.  2020.\"</p><p>In a statement, White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders says,  \"The President and his team in Washington over Christmas hoping to  negotiate a deal that would stop the dangerous crisis on the border,  protect American communities, and re-open the government, the Democrats  decided to go home.\"</p><p>She also says the Administration offered Democrats what she calls a  reasonable common-sense solution five days ago, though a spokesperson for  House Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, says, \"Democrats have offered  Republicans three options to re-open the government that all include  funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security, but not the  President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall.\"</p><p>While in Iraq, President Trump stressed the funding bill must include money  for a border wall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J.

ICE has been overwhelmed by asylum requests and  shackled by court rulings, and it's now releasing hundreds of migrants onto  the streets of El Paso.</p><p>The message to future migrants, of course, is that America is powerless to  stop them from settling here. Fox's Jonathan Hunt is here with more.  Jonathan?</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, CHIEF CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, says the immigration system  is at breaking point. Border Patrol agents say they're overwhelmed. Around  1,000 immigrants have been released onto the streets of El Paso, Texas this  week alone. </p><p>And two young immigrant children have died after being taken into custody  by Customs and Border Protection agents, the first deaths of children in  CBP custody for a decade.</p><p>In El Paso, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say they have  little choice but to release those hundreds of immigrants because of,  quote, decades of inaction by Congress that they say has limited their  ability to remove families who are in the U.S. illegally, and has set  limits on how long they can hold those families.</p><p>So, they're being dropped off at a bus station in El Paso, where aid groups  are offering support. More, by the way, are expected to be released today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DYLAN CORBETT, DIRECTOR, HOPE BORDER INSTITUTE (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): They  have spent eight to 10 days in cells. Now they've been released. What we've  been doing as a community is to support them, giving them food, a place for  them to stay at night.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT: President Trump has repeatedly said the era of so-called catch and  release has ended. But frankly, that is exactly what is happening in Texas  right now. And it all comes against the backdrop of the government shutdown  over President Trump's demand for a Border wall that he says could stem the  flow of illegal immigration.</p><p>The wall and, of course, the deaths of those two immigrant children will no  doubt top the agenda when Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen visits the  Border area in El Paso, Texas, Friday, and Yuma, Arizona, Saturday. </p><p>Mark?</p><p>STEYN: Just - just to be clear on that, Jonathan, ICE can hold these people  if that chap is right for - for 10 days or whatever. And then meanwhile  they're given a two-year court date. So, in the gap between the 10 days and  the two years, they just get to hang out in America? That's - that's the  idea of it (ph)?</p><p>HUNT: Right. Well what - what ICE is saying is that under the current laws,  they have no choice but to release these immigrants after that time frame.  And, therefore, they take them to the bus station and then, yes,  essentially they are free to go where they wish to do as they please, Mark.</p><p>STEYN: Well that seems a bit of a design flaw, Jonathan.</p><p>While - while migrants continue to pour into the United States, critics of  the President maintain that nothing can be done because a wall's useless.

So,  would a wall work or not?</p><p>Jason Piccolo is a former Special Agent and Supervisor with the Department  of Homeland Security, and he joins us now. </p><p>Everybody's mocking this. We've had Nancy Pelosi doing her beaded curtain  line. At this stage, I would welcome a 2,000 mile beaded curtain along the  Southern border. It would show a certain kind of resolve. But are these  critics right that this thing doesn't work, doesn't make any difference,  complete waste of time?</p><p>JASON PICCOLO, FORMER ICE SUPERVISOR, OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM VETERAN: No,  it'll work. Now the border is 2,000 miles long. And you won't be able to  actually wall the whole border. But that'll create chokepoints or - or  points where we could actually apprehend the immigrants coming in.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, well--</p><p>PICCOLO: So, yes, a wall would work.</p><p>STEYN: --yes. What's interesting to me is that if you look at up on the  Northern border, where there's far fewer people coming across, there's not  caravans massing on the 49th parallel, and yet, the United States  government has actually put physical barricades in a lot of cross border  towns on the Canadian border, presumably because it works there. </p><p>So, why would it not work on the Mexican border?</p><p>PICCOLO: Walls work. They do. Now, when I worked on a border, the border  was simply a strand of fence in some areas like a strand of wire. Now, you  have narco-traffickers coming across that same area. You have economic  migrants, it's just it's open. The whole border is pretty much open except  for, you know, few miles here and there.</p><p>STEYN: When - when you say it's open, because most - most people who cross  international frontiers legitimately will do so at big border posts. </p><p>But you're saying that even though we talk about this incessantly, there  are actually 100-mile stretches where people can actually just walk into  the United States, a country that's supposedly been on Orange Alert for 17  years.</p><p>PICCOLO: Yes, definitely. Now, I was on the DHS' human smuggling cell back  in 2015. And we tracked human smuggling corridors coming up from South  America. </p><p>Now, you do have Special Interest Aliens transiting into South America,  into Brazil, and traveling up those same routes that the economic migrants  and the narco-traffickers are using. So there--</p><p>STEYN: So--</p><p>PICCOLO: --anybody can come and go through that border.</p><p>STEYN: So you mean - you mean, when you say Special Interest Aliens, you -  you mean that potential jihadists have figured out. They - they look at  what's on their TV screens on the Rio Grande, and figure that instead of  trying to fly to JFK, you might as well just go to Latin America and walk  into the country.</p><p>PICCOLO: You can. The border's open. Now, I detailed out in Ajo, Arizona at  one time back in the early 2000s. And it was literally one strand of barbed  wire. So, yes, you could - anybody could walk across that border when the  various (ph) intent are with coming here for economic migration.</p><p>STEYN: A strand of barbed wire. That seems even more useless than the  beaded curtain. Jason, thank you for that. And thank you for the eyewitness  testimony on that Southern border. I'm not sure people actually visualize  it quite the way you know it.</p><p>Coming up, Tucker's going to be here to discuss the declining fortunes of  American men. And Paris is still coping with riots after the government  tried to levy a carbon tax. So, why do lawmakers want a carbon tax here?  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STEYN: It was another chaotic day on Wall Street today. Yesterday, the Dow  Jones average had its largest single-day gain in history. Today, the  average went on another downward streak falling by 600 points. </p><p>But in the afternoon, the market rallied surging almost 900 points to  finish the day up by 258 points. The market is still down about 2,500  points this month in what's been a very tumultuous end to the year. It's  like these algorithms just fell face-down in the eggnog.</p><p>The French have been rioting for more than a month now after Emmanuel  Macron's government tried to impose an anti-global warming gas tax upon  them. Nevertheless, a lot of Americans, including the outgoing Senator Jeff  Flake, think it's time for America to have its own carbon tax. Is that  wise?</p><p>Mark Reynolds is Executive Director of the Citizens Climate Lobby, and he  joins us. Mark, when you see what's happening in France, that's a more  extreme version of what happens when carbon taxes are actually put into  place elsewhere. People don't seem to like it, don't seem to care for it.</p><p>MARK REYNOLDS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CITIZENS CLIMATE LOBBY: First of all,  thank you so much for having me on the show. The nice thing about the  Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is that it actually puts money in  people's pockets. So, I think that there's people who are suffering both  here and in other countries. </p><p>And I think that the reason that there's so much Republicans' support -  support on both the House and the Senate version of this bill is it  actually sends, allocates money back to households, so that they are  prepared to deal with whatever they have to.</p><p>And again--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --it doesn't tell them what to do with that money, just lets them  make a choice about whatever they want to do with it.</p><p>STEYN: Well let me tell - this is the bill that's being proposed in - the  carbon tax is being proposed in the United States, which under the proposal  supposedly then gives money back to households. But here's one big problem  with it, Mark.</p><p>Basically, the automatic increases kick in, I think, starting around 2022,  and they basically go all the way up until mid-century. So, and it's beyond  the control of other congresses. It just becomes like an entitlement  program that gets automatic increases every year and is beyond the control.</p><p>You can't go to a polling station if you don't like it, if the facts  change, if the circumstances change. It essentially puts the carbon tax  beyond democratic - democratic accountability, doesn't it?</p><p>REYNOLDS: Well Representative Francis Rooney, who's the lead Republican  sponsor from Florida says that he likes this bill because it's market- based. It actually lets the market determine how we get to the new energy  economy. </p><p>I think that's a lot of what Mr. Fitzpatrick, one of the Republicans on the  bill also said is, is, you know, you put a fee on carbon-based emissions,  you give the money back to households so that the government doesn't pick  what to do with it. You don't pick winners and losers. It'll be up for you  to--</p><p>STEYN: What about--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --to you and I to determine what we do with a dividend. But it'll  be actually a free-market bill--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --and that's what the Republicans on the bill said they like  about it so much.</p><p>STEYN: What do you make of the CEI, the Competitive Enterprise Institute's  objection to it that it will actually kill America's new energy  independence, which is a phenomenon in the last few years, what we see with  fracking and so forth, and means we're no longer dependent on malign Saudi  sheiks who use their oil riches to spread their Wahhabist ideology around  the world. </p><p>The CEI's view is that the carbon tax is going to kill American energy  independence.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. So, I think there's something really interesting happening  right now. There's actually a race to the new energy economy. And it's  probably going to be either us or China. China is making a huge investment  in renewable energy. And I heard - certainly hope it's us.</p><p>So, what I think that this bill does is creates enough incentive throughout  the entire--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --economic system to create all the type of--</p><p>STEYN: --wait, wait.</p><p>REYNOLDS: --innovation that we know we need.</p><p>STEYN: But there's no carbon tax in China. The Yangtze is like the most  polluted river in the world the - with the - with what's coming down that  stream every day. It's nothing you'd want any of your kids to be gambling  and frolicking in.</p><p>So, they won't wait - what - what the French - the - the French protesters  object to is that this is their lives. It's not a theory. It's not a  macroeconomic theory. If it's a choice between sea levels in Tuvalu in the  22nd Century or how they have to live their lives in the century they're  actually living in, they'll prioritize the reality of their lives over  speculation a century hence.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. I think that that's why so many Republicans like this bill  in both the House and Senate is because money's actually returned. You get  a monthly check and then it's your choice what you do with it. </p><p>I'm not going to tell you what to do with the money. The government's not  going to tell you what to - what to do with the money. It's going to be up  to American households to determine what to do.</p><p>STEYN: And - and you believe - and you believe that's good at - because  everything you - they always say that and then it goes into the General  Fund. The gas - gasoline taxes, they were supposed to be about it and they  all go into it (ph). Well we'll - we'll see how it works out. I don't see  the public appetite for it. </p><p>But, Mark, thank you for - thank you for talking with us today. And happy  post--</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. And thank you for - thank you for having me on. And let me  just say to the people who are watching, there is one of our chapters in  every community out there from Boise, Idaho, to Birmingham, Alabama. If you  want to work with people on solutions, we have a big tent, and we would  love to see you in your neighborhood.</p><p>STEYN: OK. Big tents we like. And we won't heat them with conventional  energy sources.</p><p>REYNOLDS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Thank you for that, Mark. Happy post-Boxing Day to you. </p><p>It's time for Tucker's Final Exam.

It's time for Tucker's Final  Exam where the news professionals are interrogated, see if they can  actually remember the events they cover every day. </p><p>This week's Final Exam is a New York Special. We have Kennedy, the last  non-guest host in the building. And also - and also with us, from FOX News  Headlines 24/7, Carley Shimkus.</p><p>And actually, speaking of guest hosting, Carley will actually be in this  slot on Monday night. But for some reason we're going to stick her outside- -</p><p>LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, KENNEDY HOST, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: --for the duration of the show. And then Kennedy will follow Carley.  So, this is the Fox New Year's Eve team. You'll--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Right.</p><p>STEYN: --you'll get a heads-up on ahead. Stay ahead of (ph)--</p><p>CARLEY SHIMKUS, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 REPORTER: We're going to have lot  of fun.</p><p>STEYN: --tuning in. OK, contestants, hands on buzzers. I'm going to ask the  questions. And the first one to buzz in gets to answer. But you must wait  until I finish asking. </p><p>You can answer once and I shall acknowledge you, according to rules set by  the International Quiz Show Committee in Geneva, by saying your name.  Correct answer's worth one point. Get it wrong, you lose a point. Best of  five wins. </p><p>Let's get started. Question one, an outgoing Democrat Senator just blasted  newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling her a shiny new object with cheap  rhetoric. Which lawmaker made those remarks?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: And it's Kennedy.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Claire McCaskill.</p><p>STEYN: Claire McCaskill. Let's roll that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLAIRE CONNER MCCASKILL, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MISSOURI: I don't  know her. I'm - I'm a little confused why she's the thing. But it's a good  example of what I'm talking about, a bright and shiny new object.</p><p>The rhetoric is cheap. Getting results is a lot harder.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Meow.

One-Zip as we head into question  two.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: OK.</p><p>STEYN: This is critical for Carley. Otherwise she - she'll be losing that  New Year's Eve gig. Question--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: --question two. Former First Lady, Michelle Obama, is now the most  admired woman in all of America. That's according to a new Gallup poll. But  to get them, Michelle Obama had to bump another woman who'd held on to the  top spot for 17 years.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: Who was the other woman?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I know it (ph).</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: Oh. And it's Kennedy again.</p><p>SHIMKUS: It was just a guess from me anyway.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Hillary Clinton.</p><p>STEYN: Oh, come on. Hillary Clinton, the most admired woman in America? The  17 - are you kidding me? Let's roll that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Michelle Obama has overtaken Hillary Clinton as the  most admired woman in the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Good job. Oh, man. I'm getting cleaned (ph).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Clinton held that top spot on that list for 17 years.

I thought it - I - I wanted to say Oprah because--</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>SHIMKUS: --I thought - I feel like that - were truly is one of the most  admired women in America. But I think Hillary is now third and--</p><p>STEYN: No, yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: --Molly (ph) is in second or something like that.</p><p>STEYN: Oprah - Oprah is number two. But it's a tragedy--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --for Hillary. She was once the most admired--</p><p>SHIMKUS: She lost again.</p><p>STEYN: --woman in America and--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I blame the Latvian bot farm and misogyny.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Even though there are other women on the list, so--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Of course.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: --very misogynistic that she got the heave-ho.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>SHIMKUS: We are clearly on that list as well, four and five.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.

We recently told you about a popular calendar in  Russia, which features various images of a shirtless Vladimir Putin. That  same calendar is now a monster hit in another country and is outselling  ones featuring puny homegrown celebrities. Which country is it?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND) </p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p>STEYN: No, no. No. And this is (ph) - Kennedy.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: United States.</p><p>STEYN: Chest-less (ph) Putin in the United States?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Let's see.</p><p>STEYN: Doesn't sound likely.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm blushing.

The popularity of the calendars is reportedly fueled by a surge in  self-proclaimed Putin fans. Get them while they're hot, ladies. Putin--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: While they're hot.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. There's nothing a Japanese lady likes than--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Putin and a fish (ph).</p><p>STEYN: --being in a hot tub with a KGB torturer. Kennedy, disastrous move  there. She's lost one point.</p><p>SHIMKUS: It's all right.</p><p>STEYN: So there's still everything to play for. It's Two-Zero. </p><p>Question four, multiple choice.</p><p>SHIMKUS: One-zero.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Isn't it two-ones?</p><p>STEYN: Oh, no, one - one-zero.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: One-zero.

This is a multiple choice question. There's a crisis  on the International Space Station. Something mysterious was found by  astronauts inside a capsule that recently docked there. And Russian  officials say it's the result of a major breach. What was it they found?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I would--</p><p>STEYN: A, a sharp knife, B, a tiny hole, or C, a jar of pickles.</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>STEYN: And it's the trigger-happy Kennedy yet again. What do you say,  Kennedy?</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Jar of pickles.</p><p>STEYN: Jar of pickles</p><p>SHIMKUS: I was going to go with A. But let's--</p><p>STEYN: Let's roll that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Matter of life and death.

So, as a result, Kennedy's lost another point. It's now zero- zero.</p><p>SHIMKUS: The final load (ph).</p><p>STEYN: So, this is Sudden Death.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: SUDDEN DEATH.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Sudden Death.</p><p>SHIMKUS: This is the lowest scoring game--</p><p>STEYN: The Final - this is the lowest scoring game in the history of this  show.

Final question. Another multiple  choice, listen carefully.</p><p>SHIMKUS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: There is a viral video of a Colorado woman chasing down a thief who  had stolen her Christmas packages from her front door. Now, there's a  special name given to people who steal in this way. Is it A, a porch  pirate, B, a parcel poacher, or C, a package snatcher?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>STEYN: And--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: --Carley. Oh, can we have a round of applause for this? Carley  succeeded in actually hitting the buzzer.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I didn't (ph).</p><p>STEYN: We didn't even know hers worked but maybe (ph)--</p><p>SHIMKUS: If I win this way (ph), it is a win I do not deserve.</p><p>STEYN: Oh, OK.

Here's what happened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: MEN IN AMERICA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON- HOST: If you look at the numbers, you quickly conclude that  men are in crisis in America. Compared to women, they are far more likely  to drop out of school, fail to graduate, go to jail, not hold a job, commit  suicide, die of a drug overdose. </p><p>And yet, the establishment, and particularly, Democratic establishment  seems uninterested in all of this. And they think - they appear to think  that men are still too successful and need to be held back.</p><p>Andrew Yarrow is a former New York Times reporter, a Senior Fellow with the  Progressive Policy Institute. He just wrote an important new book called,  Man Out: Men on the Sidelines of American Life. He joins us tonight in  studio.</p><p>Mr. Yarrow - Yarrow, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>ANDREW YARROW, FORMER NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER, PROGRESSIVE POLICY INSTITUTE  SENIOR FELLOW, MAN OUT AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker, it's a pleasure--</p><p>CARLSON: So, I should, perhaps if I'm (ph) saying--</p><p>YARROW: --yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --I don't think you're a conservative activist, and that I'm also  grateful that someone is saying this because the numbers support that it's  true.</p><p>YARROW: It is true. And, as you say, the problem has really largely been  ignored. I mean Democrats and a lot of people in the country don't see men  as having problems. But there are a lot of men who are struggling,  struggling with work, struggling in families, struggling with health, lot  of areas I touch on in my book.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, to such a great extent that it would seem a crisis that  affects everybody because, of course, men and women need each other to  reproduce on the most basic level, but also every - everybody has a father  or brother, sons--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --why do you think it's been ignored?</p><p>YARROW: Well, there's been a lot of political correctness in this country  that's kind of made the main narrative be that, you know, women are the  oppressed ones. And they have been historically--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: --oppressed. But, you know, that doesn't mean that there aren't a  lot of men struggling. I mean you don't - it's not a zero-sum game.</p><p>CARLSON: You're right.</p><p>YARROW: And--</p><p>CARLSON: But it's been presented as one that one sex succeeds only when  another moves backward. Where'd that assumption come from?</p><p>YARROW: Well, I think a lot of politics looks at things that way. And I  think it's - it's pretty unfortunate. But I think, you know, men have not  been, in many ways, good at advocating for themselves.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: I mean it's been interesting in the last few elections. A lot of  the political activists have been women. I mean you hear more from women  these days. I mean men aren't good at forming groups--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: --anymore.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you work at - at the Progressive Policy Institute. You're a  Fellow there. That's not the Heritage Foundation.</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: I think it's fair to say you probably work in a mostly Liberal  world.</p><p>YARROW: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What kind of reaction did your piece get among people you know?</p><p>YARROW: Well, it's interesting. Conservative media have tended to like it  more. It's, you know, it's kind of troubling that this should be a  bipartisan issue. </p><p>I mean all Americans should be doing well or should have the opportunity to  do well. And they should also have justice behind them. I mean men are  being accused wrongly. I mean there are a lot of awful things that men do.  Don't get me wrong but--</p><p>CARLSON: Well sure.</p><p>YARROW: --but, you know, the lack of due process in some of these sexual  assault allegations, it's, you know, it's pretty troubling. </p><p>CARLSON: It's just interesting because the most progressive President the  country's ever had, FDR, four terms, the first thing he did after getting  elected in 1932, the very first piece through the Congress was the CCC, the  Civilian Conservation Corps, which was--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --aimed at young men, just men between--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --18 and 25 or something like that--</p><p>YARROW: Right</p><p>CARLSON: --getting them back to work and restoring their vitality through  work. What would happen if a Democrat in the modern era suggested something  like that?</p><p>YARROW: Well, you think it would play well. You know, while the  unemployment statistics look good, there are a lot of men who've either  been pushed out of the labor force or dropped out. I mean they're about 17  - 18 percent of 25 to 64 year old men, who aren't working. </p><p>And, you know, there are a lot of men - younger men, who are neither in  school or working. So, you know, why is that? And, you know, why can't we  create better jobs for them? And yes, I mean you'd think a Democrat would  pitch some kind of jobs program.</p><p>CARLSON: I think I mean this is a longer conversation but I think the  answer is toxic masculinity.</p><p>YARROW: Yes, I mean the--</p><p>CARLSON: Whatever that means.</p><p>YARROW: Well, yes. I mean that's become the phrase du jour, I guess. I mean  there are clearly issues with masculinity. You know, I interviewed a lot of  men and some women around the country, about 200. And a lot of men told me,  a lot of, you know, even Liberal men said, \"Well feminism's done a lot for  women. But what's it done for me?\"</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's a - that's a fair question. And you ask it in this  book. Thank you for doing that.</p><p>YARROW: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Great to talk to you.</p><p>YARROW: Good to talk to you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: That's one of the biggest stories of our time, so is this one.</p><p>Big tech has become the greatest threat to Americans' privacy and personal  freedoms.

And he joins us now.</p><p>Just to go with the Tucker, the big story of our time thing, when you look  at this so-called tech addiction, and you follow where that leads, you -  you do worry that in some ways these rinky-dinky little things that started  as cat video sites somehow basically re-wiring humanity.</p><p>TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: They are. I mean if we  looked out the back window right now and - and counted how many people were  walking by staring at their phones, you'd probably have 70 percent of them  doing that. </p><p>And when it comes to addiction which, obviously, I've studied in my  background, basically if anything, whether it's gambling, alcohol, drugs,  anything that's considered addictive its - if it's affecting one of the  following four, you could be diagnosed as - as an addict.</p><p>And the four things are, is it affecting your family, is it affecting your  health, is it affecting your job or your occupation, and is it affecting  have you had any legal issues?</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>KERSTING: And when we look at technology, we could check off each one of  those for many, many people. So, therefore, this whole addictive whether  it's a debate or not, I'm all about, I believe in a 100 percent.</p><p>STEYN: The - the difference being though that it's actually being kind of  organized on a global scale with--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --billions and billions of people. And when you look at children,  like middle-schoolers--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes, yes.</p><p>STEYN: --who've never known anything but this world, their behavior does  seem to be not where middle-schoolers were--</p><p>KERSTING: It's--</p><p>STEYN: --20, 50, 70 years ago.</p><p>KERSTING: --it's actually unbelievable. I tell people I - I - I get more  middle-school age kids with major anxiety disorders per year now--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --in my private practice than I did the previous 17 years  combined.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: And, you know, and you could - all the research that's done to  put - start to show that, starting to point to, you know, that the  absorption of social media, the lack of - of self, the lack of a sense of  self and so forth and how that's affecting the self-esteem and causing, you  know, issues with anxiety, depression, and other - other mental health -  health things.</p><p>STEYN: People do actually seem to prefer it though. You have a scene in  your book where you talk about when you were a young guy, just sitting at a  bar, you'd never know who's on the barstool next.</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: I can relate to that. Sometimes--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --you find yourself on the other side of the wall, you're sitting  next to an Australian, a Hungarian--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --you - you meet different people with different views. Now everyone  in the bar is just like--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --scrolling the phone.</p><p>KERSTING: When you go into the - the airport, if you travel, which, you  know--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --you do, I do. They have the screens in front of every barstool.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: So, like, you and I--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --instead of hanging out, talking with one another and--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --and kicking it off, now everybody's distracted by these  devices.</p><p>STEYN: Right. Sometimes--</p><p>KERSTING: So the--</p><p>STEYN: --you want to go where only Facebook knows--</p><p>KERSTING: --so - so it's like a - it's like--</p><p>STEYN: --you're in that area (ph).</p><p>KERSTING: --right. It's like bottles of wine dangling around if you're an  alcoholic--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --24 hours a day, seven days a week, you can't escape from it.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. That's - that's a - that's a - a worrying thing. As I said, I  think this is one of the biggest stories of time, Tom. I dread (ph) to  think--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --where we're going to be if - if we're - if we don't change it. But  how do we change it?</p><p>KERSTING: Well we have - it's - it's not something that's going to happen  overnight. We just have to keep creating awareness, having conversations  like you and I are having right now, so that people could see this. They  can understand the ramifications of these things. I'm one of the guys out  there, you know, that's lecturing--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --that's writing about it and that's out there trying to get  other people to do the same. And it's - it's going to be a slow process but  I think we're going to have to get there.</p><p>STEYN: OK. Well we will - we will hold you to that Tom because something -  these companies are bigger than countries now. </p><p>That is about it for us tonight. You can tune in each night at 8:00 to the  show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink.  And don't forget to DVR the show. That's less harmful, less addictive than  if you just go on Facebook and look at it. Don't bother with that. Just DVR  the show, if you haven't set that up already.</p><p>Now, this is exciting moment in the evening. We are going to lift Nancy  Pelosi's beaded curtain and find out who is guest-hosting for Sean Hannity  tonight. Oh, who is it going to be? They've lifted the beaded curtain. I  think I can see--</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR UTAH'S 3RD CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT  AND GOVERNMENT REFORM, COMMENTATOR: Oh, Mark.</p><p>STEYN: --Jason Kennedy filling in for Sean. Hey Jason--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p>STEYN: --oh, no, Jason Chaffetz. What--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Mark, thank you, great show.</p><p>STEYN: After all, hey by--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I always love it when you're on with Tucker.</p><p>STEYN: No.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I love it when you're on, so--</p><p>STEYN: Hey - hey, by--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: --thank you so much.</p><p>STEYN: --by the way, that was a terrific interview you did with Sam Johnson  today.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: And everyone should look at that. That was the best thing on TV this  morning.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well--</p><p>STEYN: Terrific stuff.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you. Thanks to Fox &amp; Friends. We have - actually later in  the show, we're going to go back and tell you about Sam Johnson, a special  man, an amazing personality and a true American hero, so thanks, Mark. We  appreciate it.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Jason. Have a great show.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Mark Steyn in for Tucker. He's sleeping off his  Boxing Day Bacchanalia but he will join us later to discuss the ongoing  collapse of men in America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, yet another Liberal media meltdown. The mainstream media taking  the opportunity to turn a presidential visit to American troops into an  attack on Trump. Take a look at the hysteria as the talking heads accused  the President of turning the post-Christmas visit into a political event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY COMMENTATOR, CNN NATIONAL  SECURITY ANALYST: From a national security perspective, for all the reasons  that you just listed, the President should have stayed home.</p><p>JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, RETIRED MAJOR GENERAL, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: The  reason that he went now is that he couldn't go to Mar-a-Lago because the  government was shut down.</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN TONIGHT HOST, CNN: It was like we kept saying \"He's like the  Grinch.\" Instead of - I'm being honest.</p><p>CHARLES JOSEPH SCARBOROUGH, MORNING JOE CO-HOST, MSNBC: We should also be  concerned that Mr. Trump once again used a captive audience of American  heroes to push his unpopular domestic agenda.</p><p>Even in doing something right, he figures out a way to sow chaos.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It took far too long, especially compared to President  Obama who visited troops in Iraq in his first three months in office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STEYN: Over at CNN, attacking the President wasn't enough. They decided to  attack the troops as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBARA STARR, PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT, CNN: The pool reporters traveling  said that the troops brought the hats with them, including one hat that  said \"Trump 2020.\" We will have to see if that actually proves to be the  case. </p><p>The question is, if they - if they brought them or if the President brought  them, what commander allowed that to really happen, because this is very  much against military policy and regulation. Troops are not supposed to be  involved in political activities. The U.S. Military is not a political  force.</p><p>JOHN FRANCIS KIRBY, RETIRED UNITED STATES NAVY REAR ADMIRAL, FORMER  SPOKESPERSON FOR THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE: It's completely  inappropriate for the troops to do this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not supposed to--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Of course, nobody cared back when presidential candidate Barack  Obama signed memorabilia for the troops back in 2008. He had a D after his  name though instead of an R. Thankfully, not everybody's lost their minds.  Even some Liberals scolded the media for their hysteria.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID AXELROD, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, POLITICAL  CONSULTANT, ANALYST: It's - it's good that he went to see the troops,  important that he went to do it. He - he was criticized for it, obviously.  They wanted to address that. And so, I should - we should give him credit  where credit is due.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It just sends a - such a strong message that the - the  Trumps love our military, support our military, and what a great time to do  it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Well Joe Concha writes about Media for The Hill. He joins us now.  Joe, is this a good look for the media? Why are serving soldiers in a war  zone bringing particular hats to an event on base in a combat zone at  Christmas?</p><p>JOE CONCHA, THE HILL MEDIA REPORTER: Well the optics around that, Mark, are  horrific, right, because what you're doing here is it's - it's OK to go  after the President in terms of policy or the things that he says. </p><p>Once you start attacking the people that voted for him or military people  that are obviously serving overseas during Christmas, no less, then--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: --then you got a problem. And you have to ask yourself this  question, Mark. </p><p>Let's say, honestly, like you pointed out, as I did in my column today on  The Hill, if President Obama, as he did in 2008, signed a Hope and Change  t-shirts, do you really think any news organization would have gone ahead  with that story? Of course, they wouldn't have.</p><p>STEYN: No. I - I couldn't care less. Well what soldiers in these, frankly,  God-awful situations, because life in it - at a base in Iraq stinks. You -  it's not like being in Ramstein, Germany where the President was today. You  can't stroll down to town go to a local bar, meet one of the nice German  girls, or one of the local guy (ph), you know, that's nothing like that.</p><p>You're stuck in that lousy fortress that you hope is a fortress. And the  President comes to visit you. And the pre-occupation of the American media  is whether hats the troops chose to take to that event are somehow some  potential crime that they can be pulled up in front of a military court  for. I mean that's bonkers--</p><p>CONCHA: Yes, Mark, and--</p><p>STEYN: --isn't it?</p><p>CONCHA: --it's bonkers, yes. And I think that pivot happened because the  original narrative was, we - we'd all recall is that, President Trump was  supposed to be the first President since 2002 to not visit the troops at  Christmas. </p><p>And once that fell apart, when he literally landed in Iraq as the story was  going up and it originally came from NBC, then social media goes nuts. And  - and what happened was the pivot went from, \"Oh yes, OK. Trump went, sure,  but what was his motive exactly for going?\"</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CONCHA: I - I give you The Washington Post, Mark, quoting, the President's  visit follows months of public pressure for him to spend time with troops  deployed to conflicts in the Middle East. Think about that again, follows  months of public pressure.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: In other words, we, the media, got the public riled up to force  Trump to go to a war zone instead of him just going like every president  has done for the past 17 years.</p><p>STEYN: Well - well according to Soledad O'Brien, who's a lovely lady, but  she thought it was actually minutes of public pressure that Alyssa Milano  who - who actually tweeted as the President was halfway across the ocean,  why haven't you visited our troops, Soledad O - O'Brien actually gave  Alyssa Milano credit for shaming the President into getting on the plane  that he'd already gotten on.</p><p>CONCHA: Yes. And then what's forgotten in all this, of course, is if you  want to go to Walter Reed, let's say the President was shamed, and he goes  to Walter Reed, which is close to the White House, OK, then you could say  it's a last-minute thing. When you go to Iraq, you kind of have to plan it  in advance. You have to do it weeks in advance, obviously, for security.</p><p>Air Force One has to fly in with shades down and cellphones off and - and  all of that. So, you think you'd see though however, at least from NBC and  - and - and others, some remorse, some apology, some around, you know,  \"Hey, we went ahead with this story a little bit too early because we ran a  story on Christmas saying that the President hadn't been to see the troops  on Christmastime.\"</p><p>People don't mind that sort of transparency from the media. But yet, we  never see those sort of concessions. Instead, we see the pivots that are  negative like we always do in these situations. And that's why trust in  media is this. </p><p>Axios, SurveyMonkey poll just last year, 93 percent of Republicans think  that the media knowingly creates stories, makes them up, they're false. And  you say all right (ph), that's Republicans. They've always hated the media.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: They don't trust them. 79 percent of - of independents, Mark--</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>CONCHA: 53 percent of Democrats, even a majority, that's the thing. I mean  this is something that's going across the board--</p><p>STEYN: Sure (ph).</p><p>CONCHA: --in terms of all parties seeing exactly what's happening here,  sir.</p><p>STEYN: Hey Joe, thanks. Don't worry about that though. As soon as the media  call for a Special Counsel to investigate how those MAGA hats got to Iraq,  everything will be fine.</p><p>CONCHA: There you go (ph).</p><p>STEYN: Rochelle Ritchie is a former Press Secretary for the House  Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, and Rachel Campos-Duffy is  a Fox contributor, and they both join us.</p><p>Rochelle, how - stepping back and looking at this a little more objectively  than CNN &amp; Co. have done, is it really a good law - the troops liked the  guy. The guy got on with the troops. Is there really any political mileage  to be had in going on about this?</p><p>ROCHELLE RITCHIE, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY, HOUSE DEMOCRATIC POLICY AND  COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: So, I had a little bit of  a battle with myself about this. At first, I was saying, you know, no,  these men and women in uniform, they shouldn't have, you know, gotten their  hats signed. They shouldn't have been out there with Make America Great  Again hats.</p><p>And, you know, when you look at the facts, yes, it is a - it is breaking a  rule when it comes to the Department of Defense guidelines. But at the same  time, these troops have not seen an American President since 2009. I  believe Obama was the last one to - to go visit.</p><p>So, maybe they're not necessarily, you know, showing support for the  President or getting his signature because they are Republican--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, no, come on, who--</p><p>RITCHIE: --maybe - no, listen, listen--</p><p>STEYN: --no--</p><p>RITCHIE: --no, see, how can you disagree? I haven't even finished. </p><p>The Commander - it's their Commander-in-Chief. So, maybe it's not because  he's a Republican President. Maybe they're looking at it like he's the  Commander-in-Chief. We're proud to fight for our country or fight - we're  proud to stand behind our President--</p><p>STEYN: Let--</p><p>RITCHIE: --whether he has an R or a D behind his name. And, look, I could  really care less if the guys do it. As long as they're continuing to  protect our national security, have at it.</p><p>STEYN: Well Rochelle gave that theory rather more credit than I would  think, Rachel. I mean who the--</p><p>RITCHIE: I'm very balanced.</p><p>STEYN: --who the hell - if you have the misfortune to be spending Christmas  on one of those - those forts, cut off from life in the middle of the Iraqi  desert--</p><p>RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, AMERICAN TELEVISION PERSONALITY, FOX NEWS  CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.</p><p>STEYN: --who the hell cares what hat you take to a Christmas party  basically.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Of course, they shouldn't care. But I think the more  important question is why do - I mean - let's be honest. The reaction from  the troops was very overwhelmingly positive. And it should be. </p><p>Listen, Barack Obama decimated our military. Barack Obama--</p><p>RITCHIE: OK.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --wait a minute. He did. He cut funding for our military. He  put in rules of engagement that actually--</p><p>RITCHIE: But that's not even--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --caused - wait a minute that actually caused--</p><p>RITCHIE: But what does that have to do with--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --but let - let--</p><p>RITCHIE: --what we're talking about though with this Trump (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let - it does. It does have to do.</p><p>RITCHIE: --how?</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Because the - Barack Obama did all in - enacted rules of  engagement--</p><p>RITCHIE: I don't. It has nothing to do--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --Rochelle, let me finish. Rochelle--</p><p>RITCHIE: --OK. Go ahead, Rachel.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let me finish. He enacted rules of engagement that actually  put our military on the battlefield in danger--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --causing more battles (ph) but wait - wait a minute, Mark.  He did that.</p><p>RITCHIE: I'm sorry.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: And he went to the troops and they said he was a great  Commander-in-Chief. Donald Trump goes--</p><p>STEYN: Let me--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --over and does all this to not for Alyssa Milano or the  media - or the media. But he does it because he loves the troops. And they  say that he's doing it for a photo op.</p><p>STEYN: Oh--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: This is a man who loves the military.</p><p>STEYN: No, how (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was his number one issue.</p><p>RITCHIE: I - I--</p><p>STEYN: OK. How about this as a non-Democrat, non-Republican thing?  Democrats weren't in favor of the 21st Century Bush Wars, as they called  them.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right.</p><p>RITCHIE: Right.</p><p>STEYN: But nor was Donald - nor was Donald Trump in 2016.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: That's right.</p><p>STEYN: In - in a sense, Donald Trump is at odds with both Democrat policy  and Republican policy on the Middle East, Rochelle.</p><p>RITCHIE: Yes. He's definitely fighting both sides. And I think what - when  you talked about the press, I think the reason why the press is sort of  attacking on him, the - the Left-leaning press, I would say, is because of  some of the - the misleading comments that he made when he talked about the  pay raises for the military. We know that's not--</p><p>STEYN: Well they do - they did get the pay rises (ph).</p><p>RITCHIE: --necessarily true. They do get raises. But they're not getting a  10 percent raise. It's going to be, I think, 2.6 percent. So, I think there  are ways that the media was looking at it and attacking him for his less- than-knowledgeable education, I guess you could say, on what's really  happening--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: But (ph)--</p><p>RITCHIE: --there. But I don't I - I think that him visiting was a good  idea. I think there was an article by The Washington Post where it said  that he was actually scared to go over there for some time. So, I'm glad--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Ridiculous.</p><p>RITCHIE: --he got over that.</p><p>STEYN: That's a--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: He was not scared. And - and what would the media, you know,  betting MAGAs hats (ph) what would they have had him do? Say, \"Oh, I'm  sorry. I'm not going to sign your hat because of the Hatch Act,\" and then  they--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --would have criticized him and said--</p><p>RITCHIE: Well--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --\"Hey, what a jerk. He wouldn't sign a hat.\"</p><p>STEYN: By the way there's too much--</p><p>RITCHIE: I just - I just said I thought that was perfectly fine.</p><p>STEYN: --there's too much of that. The minute you--</p><p>RITCHIE: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --if you're seriously talking about soldiers doing something wrong  because they asked their Commander-in-Chief to sign a hat, then - then  you've flown the coop. That's not a land of law and things (ph)--</p><p>RITCHIE: I want to know (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It's - it's a bad look for the press. It's - the reason why  the American people hate the press and, by the way, the troops loved the  President because--</p><p>RITCHIE: Wait, wait, what is this? This is (ph) press--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --the troops love the President because he did sign a bill  that he took a lot of flack from the - from the Right for signing a big  bill that was--</p><p>RITCHIE: I think - I think--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --for funding the military.</p><p>RITCHIE: --I think that Trump's whole purpose--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: They love him.</p><p>RITCHIE: --of being there and - and this is - is - this is part of it, I  think that he also has a lot, I think, there was a - a part in this segment  right before you came to us about--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>RITCHIE: --this being public pressure. I think it's more political pressure  because of him, you know, General Kelly, then General Mattis, and so I  think that he's really trying to show that he has some sort of control of  what's happening right now in the middle in - in--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right. Why didn't - why didn't the--</p><p>STEYN: No, no, no, no--</p><p>RITCHIE: --Iraq. But then - but--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --why doesn't that criticism come to Barack Obama? He goes to  visit the troop, no one questions his motives.</p><p>RITCHIE: Well Obama is living his best life somewhere (ph).</p><p>STEYN: No, but it's a - that - you can't do--</p><p>RITCHIE: Can we leave him out of it?</p><p>STEYN: --those--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: But - but there is a double standard. And that is what people  are talking about, Rochelle.</p><p>STEYN: We got to - we got to go, ladies.</p><p>RITCHIE: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Iraq's a crazy place. You can't just plan those things with no  notice.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Absolutely, I agree (ph).</p><p>RITCHIE: No, you can't.</p><p>STEYN: Rochelle and Rachel will carry--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was Alyssa Milano.</p><p>STEYN: --this - this ones (ph) and they're going to take this to the green  room - where now - this is worse than the Sunni Triangle, the violence  that's like (ph) percolating it.</p><p>We're now on day six of the government shutdown triggered by Congress'  refusal to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. </p><p>Today, the President tweeted, \"Have the Democrats finally realized that we  desperately need border security and a wall on the Southern border? We need  to stop drugs, human trafficking, gang members, and criminals from coming  into our country. And do the Dems realize that most of the people not  getting paid are Democrats?\"</p><p>Fox Washington Correspondent, Rich Edson, joins us with more on the  situation in D.C. It's all yours.</p><p>RICH EDSON, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p>Congress officially and briefly gaveled in this afternoon though there is  no sign of this shutdown ending anytime soon as Democrats in (ph) the White  House are a few billion dollars apart on funding for a wall on the Southern  border. President Trump has returned to the White House after visiting U.S.  forces yesterday in Iraq.</p><p>He's just tweeted, \"This isn't about the wall. Everybody knows that a wall  will work perfectly. In Israel, the wall works 99.9 percent. This is only  about the Dems not letting Donald Trump and the Republicans have a win.  They may have the 10 Senate votes. But we have the issue, border security.  2020.\"</p><p>In a statement, White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders says,  \"The President and his team in Washington over Christmas hoping to  negotiate a deal that would stop the dangerous crisis on the border,  protect American communities, and re-open the government, the Democrats  decided to go home.\"</p><p>She also says the Administration offered Democrats what she calls a  reasonable common-sense solution five days ago, though a spokesperson for  House Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, says, \"Democrats have offered  Republicans three options to re-open the government that all include  funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security, but not the  President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall.\"</p><p>While in Iraq, President Trump stressed the funding bill must include money  for a border wall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The folks are saying, \"Can  we have some drones? Can we have technology?\" Technology is bells and  whistles. You have to have a wall.

Though to end  this shutdown, the House, the Senate, and the White House must all agree on  the same funding bill.</p><p>On Capitol Hill, House Freedom Caucus Chairman, Mark Meadows, says the  needle has moved towards a very long shutdown, as Democrats and Republicans  appear to talk past one another.</p><p>Mark?</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Rich.</p><p>This is a Fox News Alert. Police in California are on the hunt for an  unnamed illegal immigrant, suspected of murdering a police officer.  Corporal Ronil Singh, an immigrant from Fiji, was gunned down Wednesday  morning during a traffic stop. Police have released surveillance footage of  the suspect, and say they believe he is still in the area. We will continue  to monitor this breaking story. </p><p>And coming up, Tucker will be back with us to discuss the crisis of  American manhood.

ICE has been overwhelmed by asylum requests and  shackled by court rulings, and it's now releasing hundreds of migrants onto  the streets of El Paso.</p><p>The message to future migrants, of course, is that America is powerless to  stop them from settling here. Fox's Jonathan Hunt is here with more.  Jonathan?</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, CHIEF CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, says the immigration system  is at breaking point. Border Patrol agents say they're overwhelmed. Around  1,000 immigrants have been released onto the streets of El Paso, Texas this  week alone. </p><p>And two young immigrant children have died after being taken into custody  by Customs and Border Protection agents, the first deaths of children in  CBP custody for a decade.</p><p>In El Paso, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say they have  little choice but to release those hundreds of immigrants because of,  quote, decades of inaction by Congress that they say has limited their  ability to remove families who are in the U.S. illegally, and has set  limits on how long they can hold those families.</p><p>So, they're being dropped off at a bus station in El Paso, where aid groups  are offering support. More, by the way, are expected to be released today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DYLAN CORBETT, DIRECTOR, HOPE BORDER INSTITUTE (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): They  have spent eight to 10 days in cells. Now they've been released. What we've  been doing as a community is to support them, giving them food, a place for  them to stay at night.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT: President Trump has repeatedly said the era of so-called catch and  release has ended. But frankly, that is exactly what is happening in Texas  right now. And it all comes against the backdrop of the government shutdown  over President Trump's demand for a Border wall that he says could stem the  flow of illegal immigration.</p><p>The wall and, of course, the deaths of those two immigrant children will no  doubt top the agenda when Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen visits the  Border area in El Paso, Texas, Friday, and Yuma, Arizona, Saturday. </p><p>Mark?</p><p>STEYN: Just - just to be clear on that, Jonathan, ICE can hold these people  if that chap is right for - for 10 days or whatever. And then meanwhile  they're given a two-year court date. So, in the gap between the 10 days and  the two years, they just get to hang out in America? That's - that's the  idea of it (ph)?</p><p>HUNT: Right. Well what - what ICE is saying is that under the current laws,  they have no choice but to release these immigrants after that time frame.  And, therefore, they take them to the bus station and then, yes,  essentially they are free to go where they wish to do as they please, Mark.</p><p>STEYN: Well that seems a bit of a design flaw, Jonathan.</p><p>While - while migrants continue to pour into the United States, critics of  the President maintain that nothing can be done because a wall's useless.  CNN's Brian Karem recently ranted about the futility of mankind's oldest  defensive mechanism.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN KAREM, JOURNALIST, PLAYBOY'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, CNN  POLITICAL  ANALYST, FORMER EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY SENTINEL: This  whole issue is a crock from start to finish. He picked it up on the  campaign trail as something to appease the masses and play to his base. </p><p>It's not going to stop terrorism. It's not going to be 2,000 miles long, as  originally planned. It's not going to be see-through. It's not going to be  eco- friendly. It's not going to be slats or heads on pikes or a beaded  curtain or anything else. You can't wall that border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Jimmy Kimmel, meanwhile, has been ridiculing, Americans were so  desperate for a secure border they've been willing to donate to a GoFundMe  campaign for it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!: This - this  Trump supporter, guy named Brian Kolfage, started a GoFundMe campaign to  raise a billion dollars for the wall. He launched it on Sunday. It's  already up to almost $9 million. People - this is what people do with their  disposable income when they don't have loans from college to pay off.</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: Donating money for a wall that will never exist. It - it's like  starting a college fund for Harry Potter.</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: It's a - it's a - a more useful thing to do with your money would  be to go outside and feed it to a bird. But--</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: --you do have to admire the sacrifice they're making. I mean lot of  these people are dipping into their meth money for this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Got it. Meth heads for national security. Thank you, Jimmy. So,  would a wall work or not?</p><p>Jason Piccolo is a former Special Agent and Supervisor with the Department  of Homeland Security, and he joins us now. </p><p>Everybody's mocking this. We've had Nancy Pelosi doing her beaded curtain  line. At this stage, I would welcome a 2,000 mile beaded curtain along the  Southern border. It would show a certain kind of resolve. But are these  critics right that this thing doesn't work, doesn't make any difference,  complete waste of time?</p><p>JASON PICCOLO, FORMER ICE SUPERVISOR, OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM VETERAN: No,  it'll work. Now the border is 2,000 miles long. And you won't be able to  actually wall the whole border. But that'll create chokepoints or - or  points where we could actually apprehend the immigrants coming in.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, well--</p><p>PICCOLO: So, yes, a wall would work.</p><p>STEYN: --yes. What's interesting to me is that if you look at up on the  Northern border, where there's far fewer people coming across, there's not  caravans massing on the 49th parallel, and yet, the United States  government has actually put physical barricades in a lot of cross border  towns on the Canadian border, presumably because it works there. </p><p>So, why would it not work on the Mexican border?</p><p>PICCOLO: Walls work. They do. Now, when I worked on a border, the border  was simply a strand of fence in some areas like a strand of wire. Now, you  have narco-traffickers coming across that same area. You have economic  migrants, it's just it's open. The whole border is pretty much open except  for, you know, few miles here and there.</p><p>STEYN: When - when you say it's open, because most - most people who cross  international frontiers legitimately will do so at big border posts. </p><p>But you're saying that even though we talk about this incessantly, there  are actually 100-mile stretches where people can actually just walk into  the United States, a country that's supposedly been on Orange Alert for 17  years.</p><p>PICCOLO: Yes, definitely. Now, I was on the DHS' human smuggling cell back  in 2015. And we tracked human smuggling corridors coming up from South  America. </p><p>Now, you do have Special Interest Aliens transiting into South America,  into Brazil, and traveling up those same routes that the economic migrants  and the narco-traffickers are using. So there--</p><p>STEYN: So--</p><p>PICCOLO: --anybody can come and go through that border.</p><p>STEYN: So you mean - you mean, when you say Special Interest Aliens, you -  you mean that potential jihadists have figured out. They - they look at  what's on their TV screens on the Rio Grande, and figure that instead of  trying to fly to JFK, you might as well just go to Latin America and walk  into the country.</p><p>PICCOLO: You can. The border's open. Now, I detailed out in Ajo, Arizona at  one time back in the early 2000s. And it was literally one strand of barbed  wire. So, yes, you could - anybody could walk across that border when the  various (ph) intent are with coming here for economic migration.</p><p>STEYN: A strand of barbed wire. That seems even more useless than the  beaded curtain. Jason, thank you for that. And thank you for the eyewitness  testimony on that Southern border. I'm not sure people actually visualize  it quite the way you know it.</p><p>Coming up, Tucker's going to be here to discuss the declining fortunes of  American men. And Paris is still coping with riots after the government  tried to levy a carbon tax. So, why do lawmakers want a carbon tax here?  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STEYN: It was another chaotic day on Wall Street today. Yesterday, the Dow  Jones average had its largest single-day gain in history. Today, the  average went on another downward streak falling by 600 points. </p><p>But in the afternoon, the market rallied surging almost 900 points to  finish the day up by 258 points. The market is still down about 2,500  points this month in what's been a very tumultuous end to the year. It's  like these algorithms just fell face-down in the eggnog.</p><p>The French have been rioting for more than a month now after Emmanuel  Macron's government tried to impose an anti-global warming gas tax upon  them. Nevertheless, a lot of Americans, including the outgoing Senator Jeff  Flake, think it's time for America to have its own carbon tax. Is that  wise?</p><p>Mark Reynolds is Executive Director of the Citizens Climate Lobby, and he  joins us. Mark, when you see what's happening in France, that's a more  extreme version of what happens when carbon taxes are actually put into  place elsewhere. People don't seem to like it, don't seem to care for it.</p><p>MARK REYNOLDS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CITIZENS CLIMATE LOBBY: First of all,  thank you so much for having me on the show. The nice thing about the  Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is that it actually puts money in  people's pockets. So, I think that there's people who are suffering both  here and in other countries. </p><p>And I think that the reason that there's so much Republicans' support -  support on both the House and the Senate version of this bill is it  actually sends, allocates money back to households, so that they are  prepared to deal with whatever they have to.</p><p>And again--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --it doesn't tell them what to do with that money, just lets them  make a choice about whatever they want to do with it.</p><p>STEYN: Well let me tell - this is the bill that's being proposed in - the  carbon tax is being proposed in the United States, which under the proposal  supposedly then gives money back to households. But here's one big problem  with it, Mark.</p><p>Basically, the automatic increases kick in, I think, starting around 2022,  and they basically go all the way up until mid-century. So, and it's beyond  the control of other congresses. It just becomes like an entitlement  program that gets automatic increases every year and is beyond the control.</p><p>You can't go to a polling station if you don't like it, if the facts  change, if the circumstances change. It essentially puts the carbon tax  beyond democratic - democratic accountability, doesn't it?</p><p>REYNOLDS: Well Representative Francis Rooney, who's the lead Republican  sponsor from Florida says that he likes this bill because it's market- based. It actually lets the market determine how we get to the new energy  economy. </p><p>I think that's a lot of what Mr. Fitzpatrick, one of the Republicans on the  bill also said is, is, you know, you put a fee on carbon-based emissions,  you give the money back to households so that the government doesn't pick  what to do with it. You don't pick winners and losers. It'll be up for you  to--</p><p>STEYN: What about--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --to you and I to determine what we do with a dividend. But it'll  be actually a free-market bill--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --and that's what the Republicans on the bill said they like  about it so much.</p><p>STEYN: What do you make of the CEI, the Competitive Enterprise Institute's  objection to it that it will actually kill America's new energy  independence, which is a phenomenon in the last few years, what we see with  fracking and so forth, and means we're no longer dependent on malign Saudi  sheiks who use their oil riches to spread their Wahhabist ideology around  the world. </p><p>The CEI's view is that the carbon tax is going to kill American energy  independence.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. So, I think there's something really interesting happening  right now. There's actually a race to the new energy economy. And it's  probably going to be either us or China. China is making a huge investment  in renewable energy. And I heard - certainly hope it's us.</p><p>So, what I think that this bill does is creates enough incentive throughout  the entire--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --economic system to create all the type of--</p><p>STEYN: --wait, wait.</p><p>REYNOLDS: --innovation that we know we need.</p><p>STEYN: But there's no carbon tax in China. The Yangtze is like the most  polluted river in the world the - with the - with what's coming down that  stream every day. It's nothing you'd want any of your kids to be gambling  and frolicking in.</p><p>So, they won't wait - what - what the French - the - the French protesters  object to is that this is their lives. It's not a theory. It's not a  macroeconomic theory. If it's a choice between sea levels in Tuvalu in the  22nd Century or how they have to live their lives in the century they're  actually living in, they'll prioritize the reality of their lives over  speculation a century hence.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. I think that that's why so many Republicans like this bill  in both the House and Senate is because money's actually returned. You get  a monthly check and then it's your choice what you do with it. </p><p>I'm not going to tell you what to do with the money. The government's not  going to tell you what to - what to do with the money. It's going to be up  to American households to determine what to do.</p><p>STEYN: And - and you believe - and you believe that's good at - because  everything you - they always say that and then it goes into the General  Fund. The gas - gasoline taxes, they were supposed to be about it and they  all go into it (ph). Well we'll - we'll see how it works out. I don't see  the public appetite for it. </p><p>But, Mark, thank you for - thank you for talking with us today. And happy  post--</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. And thank you for - thank you for having me on. And let me  just say to the people who are watching, there is one of our chapters in  every community out there from Boise, Idaho, to Birmingham, Alabama. If you  want to work with people on solutions, we have a big tent, and we would  love to see you in your neighborhood.</p><p>STEYN: OK. Big tents we like. And we won't heat them with conventional  energy sources.</p><p>REYNOLDS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Thank you for that, Mark. Happy post-Boxing Day to you. </p><p>It's time for Tucker's Final Exam. Have you been following the news over  the Christmas period? Find out if you can remember it better than the big- time professionals here at Fox. That's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: FINAL EXAM.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Oh, you know what that music means. It's time for Tucker's Final  Exam where the news professionals are interrogated, see if they can  actually remember the events they cover every day. </p><p>This week's Final Exam is a New York Special. We have Kennedy, the last  non-guest host in the building. And also - and also with us, from FOX News  Headlines 24/7, Carley Shimkus.</p><p>And actually, speaking of guest hosting, Carley will actually be in this  slot on Monday night. But for some reason we're going to stick her outside- -</p><p>LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, KENNEDY HOST, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: --for the duration of the show. And then Kennedy will follow Carley.  So, this is the Fox New Year's Eve team. You'll--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Right.</p><p>STEYN: --you'll get a heads-up on ahead. Stay ahead of (ph)--</p><p>CARLEY SHIMKUS, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 REPORTER: We're going to have lot  of fun.</p><p>STEYN: --tuning in. OK, contestants, hands on buzzers. I'm going to ask the  questions. And the first one to buzz in gets to answer. But you must wait  until I finish asking. </p><p>You can answer once and I shall acknowledge you, according to rules set by  the International Quiz Show Committee in Geneva, by saying your name.  Correct answer's worth one point. Get it wrong, you lose a point. Best of  five wins. </p><p>Let's get started. Question one, an outgoing Democrat Senator just blasted  newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling her a shiny new object with cheap  rhetoric. Which lawmaker made those remarks?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: And it's Kennedy.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Claire McCaskill.</p><p>STEYN: Claire McCaskill. Let's roll that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLAIRE CONNER MCCASKILL, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MISSOURI: I don't  know her. I'm - I'm a little confused why she's the thing. But it's a good  example of what I'm talking about, a bright and shiny new object.</p><p>The rhetoric is cheap. Getting results is a lot harder.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Meow. Saucer of--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --milk for Senator McCaskill.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Don't let the door hit you where the Lord split you, Senator  McCaskill.</p><p>STEYN: So, that's first blood to Kennedy. One-Zip as we head into question  two.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: OK.</p><p>STEYN: This is critical for Carley. Otherwise she - she'll be losing that  New Year's Eve gig. Question--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: --question two. Former First Lady, Michelle Obama, is now the most  admired woman in all of America. That's according to a new Gallup poll. But  to get them, Michelle Obama had to bump another woman who'd held on to the  top spot for 17 years.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: Who was the other woman?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I know it (ph).</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: Oh. And it's Kennedy again.</p><p>SHIMKUS: It was just a guess from me anyway.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Hillary Clinton.</p><p>STEYN: Oh, come on. Hillary Clinton, the most admired woman in America? The  17 - are you kidding me? Let's roll that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Michelle Obama has overtaken Hillary Clinton as the  most admired woman in the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Good job. Oh, man. I'm getting cleaned (ph).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Clinton held that top spot on that list for 17 years.  What does that say about Hillary now?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Me too (ph).</p><p>SHIMKUS: You know what? I thought it - I - I wanted to say Oprah because--</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>SHIMKUS: --I thought - I feel like that - were truly is one of the most  admired women in America. But I think Hillary is now third and--</p><p>STEYN: No, yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: --Molly (ph) is in second or something like that.</p><p>STEYN: Oprah - Oprah is number two. But it's a tragedy--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --for Hillary. She was once the most admired--</p><p>SHIMKUS: She lost again.</p><p>STEYN: --woman in America and--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I blame the Latvian bot farm and misogyny.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Even though there are other women on the list, so--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Of course.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: --very misogynistic that she got the heave-ho.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>SHIMKUS: We are clearly on that list as well, four and five.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. Macedonian content farmers fixed that thing right (ph). It's  Two-Zip to Kennedy. This is--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: --come on, come on Carley.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I just want one point.</p><p>STEYN: Come on, you don't want to be outside on New Year's Eve.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't.</p><p>STEYN: This - we'll give you - we'll give you a studio if you can turn this  thing around.</p><p>SHIMKUS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Question three. We recently told you about a popular calendar in  Russia, which features various images of a shirtless Vladimir Putin. That  same calendar is now a monster hit in another country and is outselling  ones featuring puny homegrown celebrities. Which country is it?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND) </p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p>STEYN: No, no. No. And this is (ph) - Kennedy.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: United States.</p><p>STEYN: Chest-less (ph) Putin in the United States?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Let's see.</p><p>STEYN: Doesn't sound likely.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm blushing.

The popularity of the calendars is reportedly fueled by a surge in  self-proclaimed Putin fans. Get them while they're hot, ladies. Putin--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: While they're hot.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. There's nothing a Japanese lady likes than--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Putin and a fish (ph).</p><p>STEYN: --being in a hot tub with a KGB torturer. Kennedy, disastrous move  there. She's lost one point.</p><p>SHIMKUS: It's all right.</p><p>STEYN: So there's still everything to play for. It's Two-Zero. </p><p>Question four, multiple choice.</p><p>SHIMKUS: One-zero.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Isn't it two-ones?</p><p>STEYN: Oh, no, one - one-zero.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: One-zero. Yes, Carley--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh, I lost a point?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I thought - I thought I kept it and then--</p><p>STEYN: No, no, you - you lost it.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: --I thought I kept the other two (ph)--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, the two points (ph)--</p><p>STEYN: You're in huge trouble now.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh, boy.</p><p>STEYN: Question four. This is a multiple choice question. There's a crisis  on the International Space Station. Something mysterious was found by  astronauts inside a capsule that recently docked there. And Russian  officials say it's the result of a major breach. What was it they found?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I would--</p><p>STEYN: A, a sharp knife, B, a tiny hole, or C, a jar of pickles.</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>STEYN: And it's the trigger-happy Kennedy yet again. What do you say,  Kennedy?</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Jar of pickles.</p><p>STEYN: Jar of pickles</p><p>SHIMKUS: I was going to go with A. But let's--</p><p>STEYN: Let's roll that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Matter of life and death.

If you're a-</p><p>SHIMKUS: --for the very first time.</p><p>STEYN: --if you're a Russian cosmonaut, just plug that hole with the  picture of Vladimir Putin chestless in the hot tub, that'll - that'll take  care of it.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: OK. So, as a result, Kennedy's lost another point. It's now zero- zero.</p><p>SHIMKUS: The final load (ph).</p><p>STEYN: So, this is Sudden Death.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: SUDDEN DEATH.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Sudden Death.</p><p>SHIMKUS: This is the lowest scoring game--</p><p>STEYN: The Final - this is the lowest scoring game in the history of this  show.

Final question. Another multiple  choice, listen carefully.</p><p>SHIMKUS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: There is a viral video of a Colorado woman chasing down a thief who  had stolen her Christmas packages from her front door. Now, there's a  special name given to people who steal in this way. Is it A, a porch  pirate, B, a parcel poacher, or C, a package snatcher?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>STEYN: And--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: --Carley. Oh, can we have a round of applause for this? Carley  succeeded in actually hitting the buzzer.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I didn't (ph).</p><p>STEYN: We didn't even know hers worked but maybe (ph)--</p><p>SHIMKUS: If I win this way (ph), it is a win I do not deserve.</p><p>STEYN: Oh, OK. Let's - let's see what--</p><p>SHIMKUS: I am going with A, porch pirate.</p><p>STEYN: Porch pirate. Roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The scourge of the holiday season.

Here's what happened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: MEN IN AMERICA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON- HOST: If you look at the numbers, you quickly conclude that  men are in crisis in America. Compared to women, they are far more likely  to drop out of school, fail to graduate, go to jail, not hold a job, commit  suicide, die of a drug overdose. </p><p>And yet, the establishment, and particularly, Democratic establishment  seems uninterested in all of this. And they think - they appear to think  that men are still too successful and need to be held back.</p><p>Andrew Yarrow is a former New York Times reporter, a Senior Fellow with the  Progressive Policy Institute. He just wrote an important new book called,  Man Out: Men on the Sidelines of American Life. He joins us tonight in  studio.</p><p>Mr. Yarrow - Yarrow, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>ANDREW YARROW, FORMER NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER, PROGRESSIVE POLICY  INSTITUTE  SENIOR FELLOW, MAN OUT AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker, it's a pleasure--</p><p>CARLSON: So, I should, perhaps if I'm (ph) saying--</p><p>YARROW: --yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --I don't think you're a conservative activist, and that I'm also  grateful that someone is saying this because the numbers support that it's  true.</p><p>YARROW: It is true. And, as you say, the problem has really largely been  ignored. I mean Democrats and a lot of people in the country don't see men  as having problems. But there are a lot of men who are struggling,  struggling with work, struggling in families, struggling with health, lot  of areas I touch on in my book.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, to such a great extent that it would seem a crisis that  affects everybody because, of course, men and women need each other to  reproduce on the most basic level, but also every - everybody has a father  or brother, sons--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --why do you think it's been ignored?</p><p>YARROW: Well, there's been a lot of political correctness in this country  that's kind of made the main narrative be that, you know, women are the  oppressed ones. And they have been historically--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: --oppressed. But, you know, that doesn't mean that there aren't a  lot of men struggling. I mean you don't - it's not a zero-sum game.</p><p>CARLSON: You're right.</p><p>YARROW: And--</p><p>CARLSON: But it's been presented as one that one sex succeeds only when  another moves backward. Where'd that assumption come from?</p><p>YARROW: Well, I think a lot of politics looks at things that way. And I  think it's - it's pretty unfortunate. But I think, you know, men have not  been, in many ways, good at advocating for themselves.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: I mean it's been interesting in the last few elections. A lot of  the political activists have been women. I mean you hear more from women  these days. I mean men aren't good at forming groups--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: --anymore.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you work at - at the Progressive Policy Institute. You're a  Fellow there. That's not the Heritage Foundation.</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: I think it's fair to say you probably work in a mostly Liberal  world.</p><p>YARROW: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What kind of reaction did your piece get among people you know?</p><p>YARROW: Well, it's interesting. Conservative media have tended to like it  more. It's, you know, it's kind of troubling that this should be a  bipartisan issue. </p><p>I mean all Americans should be doing well or should have the opportunity to  do well. And they should also have justice behind them. I mean men are  being accused wrongly. I mean there are a lot of awful things that men do.  Don't get me wrong but--</p><p>CARLSON: Well sure.</p><p>YARROW: --but, you know, the lack of due process in some of these sexual  assault allegations, it's, you know, it's pretty troubling. </p><p>CARLSON: It's just interesting because the most progressive President the  country's ever had, FDR, four terms, the first thing he did after getting  elected in 1932, the very first piece through the Congress was the CCC, the  Civilian Conservation Corps, which was--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --aimed at young men, just men between--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --18 and 25 or something like that--</p><p>YARROW: Right</p><p>CARLSON: --getting them back to work and restoring their vitality through  work. What would happen if a Democrat in the modern era suggested something  like that?</p><p>YARROW: Well, you think it would play well. You know, while the  unemployment statistics look good, there are a lot of men who've either  been pushed out of the labor force or dropped out. I mean they're about 17  - 18 percent of 25 to 64 year old men, who aren't working. </p><p>And, you know, there are a lot of men - younger men, who are neither in  school or working. So, you know, why is that? And, you know, why can't we  create better jobs for them? And yes, I mean you'd think a Democrat would  pitch some kind of jobs program.</p><p>CARLSON: I think I mean this is a longer conversation but I think the  answer is toxic masculinity.</p><p>YARROW: Yes, I mean the--</p><p>CARLSON: Whatever that means.</p><p>YARROW: Well, yes. I mean that's become the phrase du jour, I guess. I mean  there are clearly issues with masculinity. You know, I interviewed a lot of  men and some women around the country, about 200. And a lot of men told me,  a lot of, you know, even Liberal men said, \"Well feminism's done a lot for  women. But what's it done for me?\"</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's a - that's a fair question. And you ask it in this  book. Thank you for doing that.</p><p>YARROW: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Great to talk to you.</p><p>YARROW: Good to talk to you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: That's one of the biggest stories of our time, so is this one.</p><p>Big tech has become the greatest threat to Americans' privacy and personal  freedoms.

And he joins us now.</p><p>Just to go with the Tucker, the big story of our time thing, when you look  at this so-called tech addiction, and you follow where that leads, you -  you do worry that in some ways these rinky-dinky little things that started  as cat video sites somehow basically re-wiring humanity.</p><p>TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: They are. I mean if we  looked out the back window right now and - and counted how many people were  walking by staring at their phones, you'd probably have 70 percent of them  doing that. </p><p>And when it comes to addiction which, obviously, I've studied in my  background, basically if anything, whether it's gambling, alcohol, drugs,  anything that's considered addictive its - if it's affecting one of the  following four, you could be diagnosed as - as an addict.</p><p>And the four things are, is it affecting your family, is it affecting your  health, is it affecting your job or your occupation, and is it affecting  have you had any legal issues?</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>KERSTING: And when we look at technology, we could check off each one of  those for many, many people. So, therefore, this whole addictive whether  it's a debate or not, I'm all about, I believe in a 100 percent.</p><p>STEYN: The - the difference being though that it's actually being kind of  organized on a global scale with--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --billions and billions of people. And when you look at children,  like middle-schoolers--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes, yes.</p><p>STEYN: --who've never known anything but this world, their behavior does  seem to be not where middle-schoolers were--</p><p>KERSTING: It's--</p><p>STEYN: --20, 50, 70 years ago.</p><p>KERSTING: --it's actually unbelievable. I tell people I - I - I get more  middle-school age kids with major anxiety disorders per year now--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --in my private practice than I did the previous 17 years  combined.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: And, you know, and you could - all the research that's done to  put - start to show that, starting to point to, you know, that the  absorption of social media, the lack of - of self, the lack of a sense of  self and so forth and how that's affecting the self-esteem and causing, you  know, issues with anxiety, depression, and other - other mental health -  health things.</p><p>STEYN: People do actually seem to prefer it though. You have a scene in  your book where you talk about when you were a young guy, just sitting at a  bar, you'd never know who's on the barstool next.</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: I can relate to that. Sometimes--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --you find yourself on the other side of the wall, you're sitting  next to an Australian, a Hungarian--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --you - you meet different people with different views. Now everyone  in the bar is just like--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --scrolling the phone.</p><p>KERSTING: When you go into the - the airport, if you travel, which, you  know--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --you do, I do. They have the screens in front of every barstool.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: So, like, you and I--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --instead of hanging out, talking with one another and--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --and kicking it off, now everybody's distracted by these  devices.</p><p>STEYN: Right. Sometimes--</p><p>KERSTING: So the--</p><p>STEYN: --you want to go where only Facebook knows--</p><p>KERSTING: --so - so it's like a - it's like--</p><p>STEYN: --you're in that area (ph).</p><p>KERSTING: --right. It's like bottles of wine dangling around if you're an  alcoholic--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --24 hours a day, seven days a week, you can't escape from it.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. That's - that's a - that's a - a worrying thing. As I said, I  think this is one of the biggest stories of time, Tom. I dread (ph) to  think--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --where we're going to be if - if we're - if we don't change it. But  how do we change it?</p><p>KERSTING: Well we have - it's - it's not something that's going to happen  overnight. We just have to keep creating awareness, having conversations  like you and I are having right now, so that people could see this. They  can understand the ramifications of these things. I'm one of the guys out  there, you know, that's lecturing--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --that's writing about it and that's out there trying to get  other people to do the same. And it's - it's going to be a slow process but  I think we're going to have to get there.</p><p>STEYN: OK. Well we will - we will hold you to that Tom because something -  these companies are bigger than countries now. </p><p>That is about it for us tonight. You can tune in each night at 8:00 to the  show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink.  And don't forget to DVR the show. That's less harmful, less addictive than  if you just go on Facebook and look at it. Don't bother with that. Just DVR  the show, if you haven't set that up already.</p><p>Now, this is exciting moment in the evening. We are going to lift Nancy  Pelosi's beaded curtain and find out who is guest-hosting for Sean Hannity  tonight. Oh, who is it going to be? They've lifted the beaded curtain. I  think I can see--</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR UTAH'S 3RD CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE COMMITTEE ON  OVERSIGHT  AND GOVERNMENT REFORM, COMMENTATOR: Oh, Mark.</p><p>STEYN: --Jason Kennedy filling in for Sean. Hey Jason--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p>STEYN: --oh, no, Jason Chaffetz. What--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Mark, thank you, great show.</p><p>STEYN: After all, hey by--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I always love it when you're on with Tucker.</p><p>STEYN: No.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I love it when you're on, so--</p><p>STEYN: Hey - hey, by--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: --thank you so much.</p><p>STEYN: --by the way, that was a terrific interview you did with Sam Johnson  today.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: And everyone should look at that. That was the best thing on TV this  morning.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well--</p><p>STEYN: Terrific stuff.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you. Thanks to Fox &amp; Friends. We have - actually later in  the show, we're going to go back and tell you about Sam Johnson, a special  man, an amazing personality and a true American hero, so thanks, Mark. We  appreciate it.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Jason. Have a great show.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Mark Steyn in for Tucker. He's sleeping off his  Boxing Day Bacchanalia but he will join us later to discuss the ongoing  collapse of men in America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But first, yet another Liberal media meltdown. The mainstream media taking  the opportunity to turn a presidential visit to American troops into an  attack on Trump. Take a look at the hysteria as the talking heads accused  the President of turning the post-Christmas visit into a political event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY COMMENTATOR, CNN NATIONAL  SECURITY ANALYST: From a national security perspective, for all the reasons  that you just listed, the President should have stayed home.</p><p> JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, RETIRED MAJOR GENERAL, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: The  reason that he went now is that he couldn't go to Mar-a-Lago because the  government was shut down.</p><p> DON LEMON, CNN TONIGHT HOST, CNN: It was like we kept saying \"He's like the  Grinch.\" Instead of - I'm being honest.</p><p> CHARLES JOSEPH SCARBOROUGH, MORNING JOE CO-HOST, MSNBC: We should also be  concerned that Mr. Trump once again used a captive audience of American  heroes to push his unpopular domestic agenda.</p><p> Even in doing something right, he figures out a way to sow chaos.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It took far too long, especially compared to President  Obama who visited troops in Iraq in his first three months in office.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> STEYN: Over at CNN, attacking the President wasn't enough. They decided to  attack the troops as well.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARBARA STARR, PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT, CNN: The pool reporters traveling  said that the troops brought the hats with them, including one hat that  said \"Trump 2020.\" We will have to see if that actually proves to be the  case. </p><p> The question is, if they - if they brought them or if the President brought  them, what commander allowed that to really happen, because this is very  much against military policy and regulation. Troops are not supposed to be  involved in political activities. The U.S. Military is not a political  force.</p><p> JOHN FRANCIS KIRBY, RETIRED UNITED STATES NAVY REAR ADMIRAL, FORMER  SPOKESPERSON FOR THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE: It's completely  inappropriate for the troops to do this.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not supposed to--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Of course, nobody cared back when presidential candidate Barack  Obama signed memorabilia for the troops back in 2008. He had a D after his  name though instead of an R. Thankfully, not everybody's lost their minds.  Even some Liberals scolded the media for their hysteria.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DAVID AXELROD, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, POLITICAL  CONSULTANT, ANALYST: It's - it's good that he went to see the troops,  important that he went to do it. He - he was criticized for it, obviously.  They wanted to address that. And so, I should - we should give him credit  where credit is due.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It just sends a - such a strong message that the - the  Trumps love our military, support our military, and what a great time to do  it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Well Joe Concha writes about Media for The Hill. He joins us now.  Joe, is this a good look for the media? Why are serving soldiers in a war  zone bringing particular hats to an event on base in a combat zone at  Christmas?</p><p> JOE CONCHA, THE HILL MEDIA REPORTER: Well the optics around that, Mark, are  horrific, right, because what you're doing here is it's - it's OK to go  after the President in terms of policy or the things that he says. </p><p> Once you start attacking the people that voted for him or military people  that are obviously serving overseas during Christmas, no less, then--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> CONCHA: --then you got a problem. And you have to ask yourself this  question, Mark. </p><p> Let's say, honestly, like you pointed out, as I did in my column today on  The Hill, if President Obama, as he did in 2008, signed a Hope and Change  t-shirts, do you really think any news organization would have gone ahead  with that story? Of course, they wouldn't have.</p><p> STEYN: No. I - I couldn't care less. Well what soldiers in these, frankly,  God-awful situations, because life in it - at a base in Iraq stinks. You -  it's not like being in Ramstein, Germany where the President was today. You  can't stroll down to town go to a local bar, meet one of the nice German  girls, or one of the local guy (ph), you know, that's nothing like that.</p><p> You're stuck in that lousy fortress that you hope is a fortress. And the  President comes to visit you. And the pre-occupation of the American media  is whether hats the troops chose to take to that event are somehow some  potential crime that they can be pulled up in front of a military court  for. I mean that's bonkers--</p><p> CONCHA: Yes, Mark, and--</p><p> STEYN: --isn't it?</p><p> CONCHA: --it's bonkers, yes. And I think that pivot happened because the  original narrative was, we - we'd all recall is that, President Trump was  supposed to be the first President since 2002 to not visit the troops at  Christmas. </p><p> And once that fell apart, when he literally landed in Iraq as the story was  going up and it originally came from NBC, then social media goes nuts. And  - and what happened was the pivot went from, \"Oh yes, OK. Trump went, sure,  but what was his motive exactly for going?\"</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> CONCHA: I - I give you The Washington Post, Mark, quoting, the President's  visit follows months of public pressure for him to spend time with troops  deployed to conflicts in the Middle East. Think about that again, follows  months of public pressure.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> CONCHA: In other words, we, the media, got the public riled up to force  Trump to go to a war zone instead of him just going like every president  has done for the past 17 years.</p><p> STEYN: Well - well according to Soledad O'Brien, who's a lovely lady, but  she thought it was actually minutes of public pressure that Alyssa Milano  who - who actually tweeted as the President was halfway across the ocean,  why haven't you visited our troops, Soledad O - O'Brien actually gave  Alyssa Milano credit for shaming the President into getting on the plane  that he'd already gotten on.</p><p> CONCHA: Yes. And then what's forgotten in all this, of course, is if you  want to go to Walter Reed, let's say the President was shamed, and he goes  to Walter Reed, which is close to the White House, OK, then you could say  it's a last-minute thing. When you go to Iraq, you kind of have to plan it  in advance. You have to do it weeks in advance, obviously, for security.</p><p> Air Force One has to fly in with shades down and cellphones off and - and  all of that. So, you think you'd see though however, at least from NBC and  - and - and others, some remorse, some apology, some around, you know,  \"Hey, we went ahead with this story a little bit too early because we ran a  story on Christmas saying that the President hadn't been to see the troops  on Christmastime.\"</p><p> People don't mind that sort of transparency from the media. But yet, we  never see those sort of concessions. Instead, we see the pivots that are  negative like we always do in these situations. And that's why trust in  media is this. </p><p> Axios, SurveyMonkey poll just last year, 93 percent of Republicans think  that the media knowingly creates stories, makes them up, they're false. And  you say all right (ph), that's Republicans. They've always hated the media.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> CONCHA: They don't trust them. 79 percent of - of independents, Mark--</p><p> STEYN: Right.</p><p> CONCHA: 53 percent of Democrats, even a majority, that's the thing. I mean  this is something that's going across the board--</p><p> STEYN: Sure (ph).</p><p> CONCHA: --in terms of all parties seeing exactly what's happening here,  sir.</p><p> STEYN: Hey Joe, thanks. Don't worry about that though. As soon as the media  call for a Special Counsel to investigate how those MAGA hats got to Iraq,  everything will be fine.</p><p> CONCHA: There you go (ph).</p><p> STEYN: Rochelle Ritchie is a former Press Secretary for the House  Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, and Rachel Campos-Duffy is  a Fox contributor, and they both join us.</p><p> Rochelle, how - stepping back and looking at this a little more objectively  than CNN &amp; Co. have done, is it really a good law - the troops liked the  guy. The guy got on with the troops. Is there really any political mileage  to be had in going on about this?</p><p> ROCHELLE RITCHIE, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY, HOUSE DEMOCRATIC POLICY AND  COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: So, I had a little bit of  a battle with myself about this. At first, I was saying, you know, no,  these men and women in uniform, they shouldn't have, you know, gotten their  hats signed. They shouldn't have been out there with Make America Great  Again hats.</p><p> And, you know, when you look at the facts, yes, it is a - it is breaking a  rule when it comes to the Department of Defense guidelines. But at the same  time, these troops have not seen an American President since 2009. I  believe Obama was the last one to - to go visit.</p><p> So, maybe they're not necessarily, you know, showing support for the  President or getting his signature because they are Republican--</p><p> STEYN: Yes, no, come on, who--</p><p> RITCHIE: --maybe - no, listen, listen--</p><p> STEYN: --no--</p><p> RITCHIE: --no, see, how can you disagree? I haven't even finished. </p><p> The Commander - it's their Commander-in-Chief. So, maybe it's not because  he's a Republican President. Maybe they're looking at it like he's the  Commander-in-Chief. We're proud to fight for our country or fight - we're  proud to stand behind our President--</p><p> STEYN: Let--</p><p> RITCHIE: --whether he has an R or a D behind his name. And, look, I could  really care less if the guys do it. As long as they're continuing to  protect our national security, have at it.</p><p> STEYN: Well Rochelle gave that theory rather more credit than I would  think, Rachel. I mean who the--</p><p> RITCHIE: I'm very balanced.</p><p> STEYN: --who the hell - if you have the misfortune to be spending Christmas  on one of those - those forts, cut off from life in the middle of the Iraqi  desert--</p><p> RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, AMERICAN TELEVISION PERSONALITY, FOX NEWS  CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.</p><p> STEYN: --who the hell cares what hat you take to a Christmas party  basically.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Of course, they shouldn't care. But I think the more  important question is why do - I mean - let's be honest. The reaction from  the troops was very overwhelmingly positive. And it should be. </p><p> Listen, Barack Obama decimated our military. Barack Obama--</p><p> RITCHIE: OK.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --wait a minute. He did. He cut funding for our military. He  put in rules of engagement that actually--</p><p> RITCHIE: But that's not even--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --caused - wait a minute that actually caused--</p><p> RITCHIE: But what does that have to do with--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --but let - let--</p><p> RITCHIE: --what we're talking about though with this Trump (ph)--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let - it does. It does have to do.</p><p> RITCHIE: --how?</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Because the - Barack Obama did all in - enacted rules of  engagement--</p><p> RITCHIE: I don't. It has nothing to do--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --Rochelle, let me finish. Rochelle--</p><p> RITCHIE: --OK. Go ahead, Rachel.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let me finish. He enacted rules of engagement that actually  put our military on the battlefield in danger--</p><p> STEYN: Well--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --causing more battles (ph) but wait - wait a minute, Mark.  He did that.</p><p> RITCHIE: I'm sorry.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: And he went to the troops and they said he was a great  Commander-in-Chief. Donald Trump goes--</p><p> STEYN: Let me--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --over and does all this to not for Alyssa Milano or the  media - or the media. But he does it because he loves the troops. And they  say that he's doing it for a photo op.</p><p> STEYN: Oh--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: This is a man who loves the military.</p><p> STEYN: No, how (ph)--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was his number one issue.</p><p> RITCHIE: I - I--</p><p> STEYN: OK. How about this as a non-Democrat, non-Republican thing?  Democrats weren't in favor of the 21st Century Bush Wars, as they called  them.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right.</p><p> RITCHIE: Right.</p><p> STEYN: But nor was Donald - nor was Donald Trump in 2016.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: That's right.</p><p> STEYN: In - in a sense, Donald Trump is at odds with both Democrat policy  and Republican policy on the Middle East, Rochelle.</p><p> RITCHIE: Yes. He's definitely fighting both sides. And I think what - when  you talked about the press, I think the reason why the press is sort of  attacking on him, the - the Left-leaning press, I would say, is because of  some of the - the misleading comments that he made when he talked about the  pay raises for the military. We know that's not--</p><p> STEYN: Well they do - they did get the pay rises (ph).</p><p> RITCHIE: --necessarily true. They do get raises. But they're not getting a  10 percent raise. It's going to be, I think, 2.6 percent. So, I think there  are ways that the media was looking at it and attacking him for his less- than-knowledgeable education, I guess you could say, on what's really  happening--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: But (ph)--</p><p> RITCHIE: --there. But I don't I - I think that him visiting was a good  idea. I think there was an article by The Washington Post where it said  that he was actually scared to go over there for some time. So, I'm glad--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Ridiculous.</p><p> RITCHIE: --he got over that.</p><p> STEYN: That's a--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: He was not scared. And - and what would the media, you know,  betting MAGAs hats (ph) what would they have had him do? Say, \"Oh, I'm  sorry. I'm not going to sign your hat because of the Hatch Act,\" and then  they--</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --would have criticized him and said--</p><p> RITCHIE: Well--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --\"Hey, what a jerk. He wouldn't sign a hat.\"</p><p> STEYN: By the way there's too much--</p><p> RITCHIE: I just - I just said I thought that was perfectly fine.</p><p> STEYN: --there's too much of that. The minute you--</p><p> RITCHIE: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --if you're seriously talking about soldiers doing something wrong  because they asked their Commander-in-Chief to sign a hat, then - then  you've flown the coop. That's not a land of law and things (ph)--</p><p> RITCHIE: I want to know (ph)--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: It's - it's a bad look for the press. It's - the reason why  the American people hate the press and, by the way, the troops loved the  President because--</p><p> RITCHIE: Wait, wait, what is this? This is (ph) press--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --the troops love the President because he did sign a bill  that he took a lot of flack from the - from the Right for signing a big  bill that was--</p><p> RITCHIE: I think - I think--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --for funding the military.</p><p> RITCHIE: --I think that Trump's whole purpose--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: They love him.</p><p> RITCHIE: --of being there and - and this is - is - this is part of it, I  think that he also has a lot, I think, there was a - a part in this segment  right before you came to us about--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> RITCHIE: --this being public pressure. I think it's more political pressure  because of him, you know, General Kelly, then General Mattis, and so I  think that he's really trying to show that he has some sort of control of  what's happening right now in the middle in - in--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right. Why didn't - why didn't the--</p><p> STEYN: No, no, no, no--</p><p> RITCHIE: --Iraq. But then - but--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --why doesn't that criticism come to Barack Obama? He goes to  visit the troop, no one questions his motives.</p><p> RITCHIE: Well Obama is living his best life somewhere (ph).</p><p> STEYN: No, but it's a - that - you can't do--</p><p> RITCHIE: Can we leave him out of it?</p><p> STEYN: --those--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: But - but there is a double standard. And that is what people  are talking about, Rochelle.</p><p> STEYN: We got to - we got to go, ladies.</p><p> RITCHIE: OK.</p><p> STEYN: Iraq's a crazy place. You can't just plan those things with no  notice.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Absolutely, I agree (ph).</p><p> RITCHIE: No, you can't.</p><p> STEYN: Rochelle and Rachel will carry--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was Alyssa Milano.</p><p> STEYN: --this - this ones (ph) and they're going to take this to the green  room - where now - this is worse than the Sunni Triangle, the violence  that's like (ph) percolating it.</p><p> We're now on day six of the government shutdown triggered by Congress'  refusal to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. </p><p> Today, the President tweeted, \"Have the Democrats finally realized that we  desperately need border security and a wall on the Southern border? We need  to stop drugs, human trafficking, gang members, and criminals from coming  into our country. And do the Dems realize that most of the people not  getting paid are Democrats?\"</p><p> Fox Washington Correspondent, Rich Edson, joins us with more on the  situation in D.C. It's all yours.</p><p> RICH EDSON, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p>Congress officially and briefly gaveled in this afternoon though there is  no sign of this shutdown ending anytime soon as Democrats in (ph) the White  House are a few billion dollars apart on funding for a wall on the Southern  border. President Trump has returned to the White House after visiting U.S.  forces yesterday in Iraq.</p><p> He's just tweeted, \"This isn't about the wall. Everybody knows that a wall  will work perfectly. In Israel, the wall works 99.9 percent. This is only  about the Dems not letting Donald Trump and the Republicans have a win.  They may have the 10 Senate votes. But we have the issue, border security.  2020.\"</p><p> In a statement, White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders says,  \"The President and his team in Washington over Christmas hoping to  negotiate a deal that would stop the dangerous crisis on the border,  protect American communities, and re-open the government, the Democrats  decided to go home.\"</p><p> She also says the Administration offered Democrats what she calls a  reasonable common-sense solution five days ago, though a spokesperson for  House Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, says, \"Democrats have offered  Republicans three options to re-open the government that all include  funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security, but not the  President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall.\"</p><p> While in Iraq, President Trump stressed the funding bill must include money  for a border wall.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The folks are saying, \"Can  we have some drones? Can we have technology?\" Technology is bells and  whistles. You have to have a wall. You have to have protection. </p><p> When you say, \"How long is it going to take?\" \"When are they going to say  that we need border security?\"</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EDSON: Pelosi's office says Democrats will pass their bill to open the  government after they take control of the House next week. Though to end  this shutdown, the House, the Senate, and the White House must all agree on  the same funding bill.</p><p> On Capitol Hill, House Freedom Caucus Chairman, Mark Meadows, says the  needle has moved towards a very long shutdown, as Democrats and Republicans  appear to talk past one another.</p><p> Mark?</p><p> STEYN: Thanks a lot, Rich.</p><p> This is a Fox News Alert. Police in California are on the hunt for an  unnamed illegal immigrant, suspected of murdering a police officer.  Corporal Ronil Singh, an immigrant from Fiji, was gunned down Wednesday  morning during a traffic stop. Police have released surveillance footage of  the suspect, and say they believe he is still in the area. We will continue  to monitor this breaking story. </p><p> And coming up, Tucker will be back with us to discuss the crisis of  American manhood. Plus, President Trump insists the government won't re- open until he has money for his wall. But if he gets it, will that wall  work? That's next on TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> STEYN: El Paso, Texas is turning into Exhibit A of America's broken  immigration system. ICE has been overwhelmed by asylum requests and  shackled by court rulings, and it's now releasing hundreds of migrants onto  the streets of El Paso.</p><p> The message to future migrants, of course, is that America is powerless to  stop them from settling here. Fox's Jonathan Hunt is here with more.  Jonathan?</p><p> JONATHAN HUNT, CHIEF CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p> Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, says the immigration system  is at breaking point. Border Patrol agents say they're overwhelmed. Around  1,000 immigrants have been released onto the streets of El Paso, Texas this  week alone. </p><p> And two young immigrant children have died after being taken into custody  by Customs and Border Protection agents, the first deaths of children in  CBP custody for a decade.</p><p> In El Paso, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say they have  little choice but to release those hundreds of immigrants because of,  quote, decades of inaction by Congress that they say has limited their  ability to remove families who are in the U.S. illegally, and has set  limits on how long they can hold those families.</p><p> So, they're being dropped off at a bus station in El Paso, where aid groups  are offering support. More, by the way, are expected to be released today.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DYLAN CORBETT, DIRECTOR, HOPE BORDER INSTITUTE (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): They  have spent eight to 10 days in cells. Now they've been released. What we've  been doing as a community is to support them, giving them food, a place for  them to stay at night.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HUNT: President Trump has repeatedly said the era of so-called catch and  release has ended. But frankly, that is exactly what is happening in Texas  right now. And it all comes against the backdrop of the government shutdown  over President Trump's demand for a Border wall that he says could stem the  flow of illegal immigration.</p><p> The wall and, of course, the deaths of those two immigrant children will no  doubt top the agenda when Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen visits the  Border area in El Paso, Texas, Friday, and Yuma, Arizona, Saturday. </p><p> Mark?</p><p> STEYN: Just - just to be clear on that, Jonathan, ICE can hold these people  if that chap is right for - for 10 days or whatever. And then meanwhile  they're given a two-year court date. So, in the gap between the 10 days and  the two years, they just get to hang out in America? That's - that's the  idea of it (ph)?</p><p> HUNT: Right. Well what - what ICE is saying is that under the current laws,  they have no choice but to release these immigrants after that time frame.  And, therefore, they take them to the bus station and then, yes,  essentially they are free to go where they wish to do as they please, Mark.</p><p> STEYN: Well that seems a bit of a design flaw, Jonathan.</p><p> While - while migrants continue to pour into the United States, critics of  the President maintain that nothing can be done because a wall's useless.  CNN's Brian Karem recently ranted about the futility of mankind's oldest  defensive mechanism.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRIAN KAREM, JOURNALIST, PLAYBOY'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, CNN  POLITICAL  ANALYST, FORMER EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY SENTINEL: This  whole issue is a crock from start to finish. He picked it up on the  campaign trail as something to appease the masses and play to his base. </p><p> It's not going to stop terrorism. It's not going to be 2,000 miles long, as  originally planned. It's not going to be see-through. It's not going to be  eco- friendly. It's not going to be slats or heads on pikes or a beaded  curtain or anything else. You can't wall that border.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Jimmy Kimmel, meanwhile, has been ridiculing, Americans were so  desperate for a secure border they've been willing to donate to a GoFundMe  campaign for it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!: This - this  Trump supporter, guy named Brian Kolfage, started a GoFundMe campaign to  raise a billion dollars for the wall. He launched it on Sunday. It's  already up to almost $9 million. People - this is what people do with their  disposable income when they don't have loans from college to pay off.</p><p> (CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p> KIMMEL: Donating money for a wall that will never exist. It - it's like  starting a college fund for Harry Potter.</p><p> (CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p> KIMMEL: It's a - it's a - a more useful thing to do with your money would  be to go outside and feed it to a bird. But--</p><p> (CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p> KIMMEL: --you do have to admire the sacrifice they're making. I mean lot of  these people are dipping into their meth money for this.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Got it. Meth heads for national security. Thank you, Jimmy. So,  would a wall work or not?</p><p> Jason Piccolo is a former Special Agent and Supervisor with the Department  of Homeland Security, and he joins us now. </p><p> Everybody's mocking this. We've had Nancy Pelosi doing her beaded curtain  line. At this stage, I would welcome a 2,000 mile beaded curtain along the  Southern border. It would show a certain kind of resolve. But are these  critics right that this thing doesn't work, doesn't make any difference,  complete waste of time?</p><p> JASON PICCOLO, FORMER ICE SUPERVISOR, OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM VETERAN: No,  it'll work. Now the border is 2,000 miles long. And you won't be able to  actually wall the whole border. But that'll create chokepoints or - or  points where we could actually apprehend the immigrants coming in.</p><p> STEYN: Yes, well--</p><p> PICCOLO: So, yes, a wall would work.</p><p> STEYN: --yes. What's interesting to me is that if you look at up on the  Northern border, where there's far fewer people coming across, there's not  caravans massing on the 49th parallel, and yet, the United States  government has actually put physical barricades in a lot of cross border  towns on the Canadian border, presumably because it works there. </p><p> So, why would it not work on the Mexican border?</p><p> PICCOLO: Walls work. They do. Now, when I worked on a border, the border  was simply a strand of fence in some areas like a strand of wire. Now, you  have narco-traffickers coming across that same area. You have economic  migrants, it's just it's open. The whole border is pretty much open except  for, you know, few miles here and there.</p><p> STEYN: When - when you say it's open, because most - most people who cross  international frontiers legitimately will do so at big border posts. </p><p> But you're saying that even though we talk about this incessantly, there  are actually 100-mile stretches where people can actually just walk into  the United States, a country that's supposedly been on Orange Alert for 17  years.</p><p> PICCOLO: Yes, definitely. Now, I was on the DHS' human smuggling cell back  in 2015. And we tracked human smuggling corridors coming up from South  America. </p><p> Now, you do have Special Interest Aliens transiting into South America,  into Brazil, and traveling up those same routes that the economic migrants  and the narco-traffickers are using. So there--</p><p> STEYN: So--</p><p> PICCOLO: --anybody can come and go through that border.</p><p> STEYN: So you mean - you mean, when you say Special Interest Aliens, you -  you mean that potential jihadists have figured out. They - they look at  what's on their TV screens on the Rio Grande, and figure that instead of  trying to fly to JFK, you might as well just go to Latin America and walk  into the country.</p><p> PICCOLO: You can. The border's open. Now, I detailed out in Ajo, Arizona at  one time back in the early 2000s. And it was literally one strand of barbed  wire. So, yes, you could - anybody could walk across that border when the  various (ph) intent are with coming here for economic migration.</p><p> STEYN: A strand of barbed wire. That seems even more useless than the  beaded curtain. Jason, thank you for that. And thank you for the eyewitness  testimony on that Southern border. I'm not sure people actually visualize  it quite the way you know it.</p><p> Coming up, Tucker's going to be here to discuss the declining fortunes of  American men. And Paris is still coping with riots after the government  tried to levy a carbon tax. So, why do lawmakers want a carbon tax here?  That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> STEYN: It was another chaotic day on Wall Street today. Yesterday, the Dow  Jones average had its largest single-day gain in history. Today, the  average went on another downward streak falling by 600 points. </p><p> But in the afternoon, the market rallied surging almost 900 points to  finish the day up by 258 points. The market is still down about 2,500  points this month in what's been a very tumultuous end to the year. It's  like these algorithms just fell face-down in the eggnog.</p><p> The French have been rioting for more than a month now after Emmanuel  Macron's government tried to impose an anti-global warming gas tax upon  them. Nevertheless, a lot of Americans, including the outgoing Senator Jeff  Flake, think it's time for America to have its own carbon tax. Is that  wise?</p><p> Mark Reynolds is Executive Director of the Citizens Climate Lobby, and he  joins us. Mark, when you see what's happening in France, that's a more  extreme version of what happens when carbon taxes are actually put into  place elsewhere. People don't seem to like it, don't seem to care for it.</p><p> MARK REYNOLDS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CITIZENS CLIMATE LOBBY: First of all,  thank you so much for having me on the show. The nice thing about the  Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is that it actually puts money in  people's pockets. So, I think that there's people who are suffering both  here and in other countries. </p><p> And I think that the reason that there's so much Republicans' support -  support on both the House and the Senate version of this bill is it  actually sends, allocates money back to households, so that they are  prepared to deal with whatever they have to.</p><p> And again--</p><p> STEYN: Well--</p><p> REYNOLDS: --it doesn't tell them what to do with that money, just lets them  make a choice about whatever they want to do with it.</p><p> STEYN: Well let me tell - this is the bill that's being proposed in - the  carbon tax is being proposed in the United States, which under the proposal  supposedly then gives money back to households. But here's one big problem  with it, Mark.</p><p> Basically, the automatic increases kick in, I think, starting around 2022,  and they basically go all the way up until mid-century. So, and it's beyond  the control of other congresses. It just becomes like an entitlement  program that gets automatic increases every year and is beyond the control.</p><p> You can't go to a polling station if you don't like it, if the facts  change, if the circumstances change. It essentially puts the carbon tax  beyond democratic - democratic accountability, doesn't it?</p><p> REYNOLDS: Well Representative Francis Rooney, who's the lead Republican  sponsor from Florida says that he likes this bill because it's market- based. It actually lets the market determine how we get to the new energy  economy. </p><p> I think that's a lot of what Mr. Fitzpatrick, one of the Republicans on the  bill also said is, is, you know, you put a fee on carbon-based emissions,  you give the money back to households so that the government doesn't pick  what to do with it. You don't pick winners and losers. It'll be up for you  to--</p><p> STEYN: What about--</p><p> REYNOLDS: --to you and I to determine what we do with a dividend. But it'll  be actually a free-market bill--</p><p> STEYN: Well--</p><p> REYNOLDS: --and that's what the Republicans on the bill said they like  about it so much.</p><p> STEYN: What do you make of the CEI, the Competitive Enterprise Institute's  objection to it that it will actually kill America's new energy  independence, which is a phenomenon in the last few years, what we see with  fracking and so forth, and means we're no longer dependent on malign Saudi  sheiks who use their oil riches to spread their Wahhabist ideology around  the world. </p><p> The CEI's view is that the carbon tax is going to kill American energy  independence.</p><p> REYNOLDS: Yes. So, I think there's something really interesting happening  right now. There's actually a race to the new energy economy. And it's  probably going to be either us or China. China is making a huge investment  in renewable energy. And I heard - certainly hope it's us.</p><p> So, what I think that this bill does is creates enough incentive throughout  the entire--</p><p> STEYN: Well--</p><p> REYNOLDS: --economic system to create all the type of--</p><p> STEYN: --wait, wait.</p><p> REYNOLDS: --innovation that we know we need.</p><p> STEYN: But there's no carbon tax in China. The Yangtze is like the most  polluted river in the world the - with the - with what's coming down that  stream every day. It's nothing you'd want any of your kids to be gambling  and frolicking in.</p><p> So, they won't wait - what - what the French - the - the French protesters  object to is that this is their lives. It's not a theory. It's not a  macroeconomic theory. If it's a choice between sea levels in Tuvalu in the  22nd Century or how they have to live their lives in the century they're  actually living in, they'll prioritize the reality of their lives over  speculation a century hence.</p><p> REYNOLDS: Yes. I think that that's why so many Republicans like this bill  in both the House and Senate is because money's actually returned. You get  a monthly check and then it's your choice what you do with it. </p><p> I'm not going to tell you what to do with the money. The government's not  going to tell you what to - what to do with the money. It's going to be up  to American households to determine what to do.</p><p> STEYN: And - and you believe - and you believe that's good at - because  everything you - they always say that and then it goes into the General  Fund. The gas - gasoline taxes, they were supposed to be about it and they  all go into it (ph). Well we'll - we'll see how it works out. I don't see  the public appetite for it. </p><p> But, Mark, thank you for - thank you for talking with us today. And happy  post--</p><p> REYNOLDS: Yes. And thank you for - thank you for having me on. And let me  just say to the people who are watching, there is one of our chapters in  every community out there from Boise, Idaho, to Birmingham, Alabama. If you  want to work with people on solutions, we have a big tent, and we would  love to see you in your neighborhood.</p><p> STEYN: OK. Big tents we like. And we won't heat them with conventional  energy sources.</p><p> REYNOLDS: OK.</p><p> STEYN: Thank you for that, Mark. Happy post-Boxing Day to you. </p><p> It's time for Tucker's Final Exam. Have you been following the news over  the Christmas period? Find out if you can remember it better than the big- time professionals here at Fox. That's up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT: FINAL EXAM.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Oh, you know what that music means. It's time for Tucker's Final  Exam where the news professionals are interrogated, see if they can  actually remember the events they cover every day. </p><p> This week's Final Exam is a New York Special. We have Kennedy, the last  non-guest host in the building. And also - and also with us, from FOX News  Headlines 24/7, Carley Shimkus.</p><p> And actually, speaking of guest hosting, Carley will actually be in this  slot on Monday night. But for some reason we're going to stick her outside- -</p><p> LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, KENNEDY HOST, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Oh.</p><p> STEYN: --for the duration of the show. And then Kennedy will follow Carley.  So, this is the Fox New Year's Eve team. You'll--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Right.</p><p> STEYN: --you'll get a heads-up on ahead. Stay ahead of (ph)--</p><p> CARLEY SHIMKUS, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 REPORTER: We're going to have lot  of fun.</p><p> STEYN: --tuning in. OK, contestants, hands on buzzers. I'm going to ask the  questions. And the first one to buzz in gets to answer. But you must wait  until I finish asking. </p><p> You can answer once and I shall acknowledge you, according to rules set by  the International Quiz Show Committee in Geneva, by saying your name.  Correct answer's worth one point. Get it wrong, you lose a point. Best of  five wins. </p><p> Let's get started. Question one, an outgoing Democrat Senator just blasted  newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling her a shiny new object with cheap  rhetoric. Which lawmaker made those remarks?</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p> STEYN: And it's Kennedy.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Claire McCaskill.</p><p> STEYN: Claire McCaskill. Let's roll that tape.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CLAIRE CONNER MCCASKILL, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MISSOURI: I don't  know her. I'm - I'm a little confused why she's the thing. But it's a good  example of what I'm talking about, a bright and shiny new object.</p><p> The rhetoric is cheap. Getting results is a lot harder.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Meow. Saucer of--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --milk for Senator McCaskill.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Don't let the door hit you where the Lord split you, Senator  McCaskill.</p><p> STEYN: So, that's first blood to Kennedy. One-Zip as we head into question  two.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: OK.</p><p> STEYN: This is critical for Carley. Otherwise she - she'll be losing that  New Year's Eve gig. Question--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p> STEYN: --question two. Former First Lady, Michelle Obama, is now the most  admired woman in all of America. That's according to a new Gallup poll. But  to get them, Michelle Obama had to bump another woman who'd held on to the  top spot for 17 years.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p> STEYN: Who was the other woman?</p><p> SHIMKUS: I know it (ph).</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p> STEYN: Oh. And it's Kennedy again.</p><p> SHIMKUS: It was just a guess from me anyway.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Hillary Clinton.</p><p> STEYN: Oh, come on. Hillary Clinton, the most admired woman in America? The  17 - are you kidding me? Let's roll that tape.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Michelle Obama has overtaken Hillary Clinton as the  most admired woman in the country.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Good job. Oh, man. I'm getting cleaned (ph).</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Clinton held that top spot on that list for 17 years.  What does that say about Hillary now?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Me too (ph).</p><p> SHIMKUS: You know what? I thought it - I - I wanted to say Oprah because--</p><p> STEYN: Right.</p><p> SHIMKUS: --I thought - I feel like that - were truly is one of the most  admired women in America. But I think Hillary is now third and--</p><p> STEYN: No, yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: --Molly (ph) is in second or something like that.</p><p> STEYN: Oprah - Oprah is number two. But it's a tragedy--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --for Hillary. She was once the most admired--</p><p> SHIMKUS: She lost again.</p><p> STEYN: --woman in America and--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: I blame the Latvian bot farm and misogyny.</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Even though there are other women on the list, so--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Of course.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: --very misogynistic that she got the heave-ho.</p><p> STEYN: Yes, absolutely.</p><p> SHIMKUS: We are clearly on that list as well, four and five.</p><p> STEYN: Yes. Macedonian content farmers fixed that thing right (ph). It's  Two-Zip to Kennedy. This is--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p> STEYN: --come on, come on Carley.</p><p> SHIMKUS: I just want one point.</p><p> STEYN: Come on, you don't want to be outside on New Year's Eve.</p><p> SHIMKUS: I don't.</p><p> STEYN: This - we'll give you - we'll give you a studio if you can turn this  thing around.</p><p> SHIMKUS: OK.</p><p> STEYN: Question three. We recently told you about a popular calendar in  Russia, which features various images of a shirtless Vladimir Putin. That  same calendar is now a monster hit in another country and is outselling  ones featuring puny homegrown celebrities. Which country is it?</p><p> SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND) </p><p> SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p> STEYN: No, no. No. And this is (ph) - Kennedy.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: United States.</p><p> STEYN: Chest-less (ph) Putin in the United States?</p><p> SHIMKUS: Let's see.</p><p> STEYN: Doesn't sound likely.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm blushing. They're flying off the shelves in Japan--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: No.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --of all places.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Oh.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Oh.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A chain of Lifestyle stores indicates that the calendars  are their--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: I'll take a win by a loss.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --top-seller.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Russian President featured dipping into a hot tub  and posing with a fish.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Fell came there (ph)--</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's (ph) like 60 years old. Not looking too bad.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Wow.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And here he is cuddling a leopard, a very docile  leopard. The popularity of the calendars is reportedly fueled by a surge in  self-proclaimed Putin fans. Get them while they're hot, ladies. Putin--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: While they're hot.</p><p> STEYN: Yes. There's nothing a Japanese lady likes than--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Putin and a fish (ph).</p><p> STEYN: --being in a hot tub with a KGB torturer. Kennedy, disastrous move  there. She's lost one point.</p><p> SHIMKUS: It's all right.</p><p> STEYN: So there's still everything to play for. It's Two-Zero. </p><p> Question four, multiple choice.</p><p> SHIMKUS: One-zero.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Isn't it two-ones?</p><p> STEYN: Oh, no, one - one-zero.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: One-zero. Yes, Carley--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Oh, I lost a point?</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: I thought - I thought I kept it and then--</p><p> STEYN: No, no, you - you lost it.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: --I thought I kept the other two (ph)--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh, the two points (ph)--</p><p> STEYN: You're in huge trouble now.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Oh, boy.</p><p> STEYN: Question four. This is a multiple choice question. There's a crisis  on the International Space Station. Something mysterious was found by  astronauts inside a capsule that recently docked there. And Russian  officials say it's the result of a major breach. What was it they found?</p><p> SHIMKUS: I would--</p><p> STEYN: A, a sharp knife, B, a tiny hole, or C, a jar of pickles.</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> STEYN: And it's the trigger-happy Kennedy yet again. What do you say,  Kennedy?</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Jar of pickles.</p><p> STEYN: Jar of pickles</p><p> SHIMKUS: I was going to go with A. But let's--</p><p> STEYN: Let's roll that tape.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Matter of life and death. A tiny hole discovered in a  Russian capsule--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: We were both - we would have both been wrong.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --that docks to the International Space Station.</p><p> At first, scientists suspected the hole was caused by a meteorite strike.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And a good unobstructed view now of that black spot.  That's the hole on the external hull.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A Russian cosmonaut who examined the hole--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Oh.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --believes it was drilled from inside the capsule.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Good to know. I'm learning a lot on this show, by the way--</p><p> STEYN: Yes. If you're a-</p><p> SHIMKUS: --for the very first time.</p><p> STEYN: --if you're a Russian cosmonaut, just plug that hole with the  picture of Vladimir Putin chestless in the hot tub, that'll - that'll take  care of it.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: OK. So, as a result, Kennedy's lost another point. It's now zero- zero.</p><p> SHIMKUS: The final load (ph).</p><p> STEYN: So, this is Sudden Death.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT: SUDDEN DEATH.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Sudden Death.</p><p> SHIMKUS: This is the lowest scoring game--</p><p> STEYN: The Final - this is the lowest scoring game in the history of this  show. Final question.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Maybe we've been dipping into the New Year's champagne early--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: --Mark.</p><p> STEYN: Too much Wassail and Figgy pudding. Final question. Another multiple  choice, listen carefully.</p><p> SHIMKUS: OK.</p><p> STEYN: There is a viral video of a Colorado woman chasing down a thief who  had stolen her Christmas packages from her front door. Now, there's a  special name given to people who steal in this way. Is it A, a porch  pirate, B, a parcel poacher, or C, a package snatcher?</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> STEYN: And--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p> STEYN: --Carley. Oh, can we have a round of applause for this? Carley  succeeded in actually hitting the buzzer.</p><p> SHIMKUS: I didn't (ph).</p><p> STEYN: We didn't even know hers worked but maybe (ph)--</p><p> SHIMKUS: If I win this way (ph), it is a win I do not deserve.</p><p> STEYN: Oh, OK. Let's - let's see what--</p><p> SHIMKUS: I am going with A, porch pirate.</p><p> STEYN: Porch pirate. Roll tape.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The scourge of the holiday season. Those pesky porch  pirates intent on ruining Christmas. But one woman in Lakewood, Colorado--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Oh.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --has decided to take matters into her own hands.</p><p> RENEE ABEYTA, COLORADO HOMEOWNER: I looked at my Ring videos and I saw what  happened.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Renee Abeyta confronting the brazen pirate--</p><p> ABEYTA: Hey.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --who made her way through the neighborhood with her  stolen booty.</p><p> ABEYTA: Hey.</p><p> I thought no way is this happening to me.</p><p> Give it. I'm going to (BEEP) call the police.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh, yes.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ABEYTA: I got you on camera (BEEP). Give me (BEEP) thing now.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Wow. What assault (ph) the pirate herself?</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ABEYTA: I'm - I'm chasing you.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Leave me alone, lady. I didn't take anything.</p><p> ABEYTA: Yes, you did. I saw you. Throw it down.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: All right (ph).</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ABEYTA: And I would have ran for as many miles as I had to, to get my  package.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Good for her.</p><p> STEYN: Yes. Keira Knightley didn't talk like that in Porch Pirates of the  Caribbean.</p><p> SHIMKUS: No.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: No.</p><p> STEYN: That is and we have an amazing - this is a humiliation for Kennedy.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Wise turnaround (ph).</p><p> SHIMKUS: This is - this, this I don't deserve it.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: I feel like--</p><p> SHIMKUS: I don't.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: --Hillary Clinton on Election Night.</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: My victory was a sure thing, Mark.</p><p> STEYN: Right.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Kennedy did all the heavy-lifting. And I just--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: I won the popular vote here. Everyone knows it.</p><p> STEYN: No, you won - you won at your (ph) hand, it's hitting that buzzer.  Carley just hit it - hits it once and takes the trophy.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Can I - can I say? Thank you so much.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: I believe that mug really should go to Kennedy.</p><p> STEYN: No, come on. I can't stand this good sportsmanship. Here you - here  you go. There is your Tucker Carlson mug (ph)--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Right, so (ph).</p><p> STEYN: --the mug.</p><p> SHIMKUS: We'll share.</p><p> STEYN: You'll see these ladies in this time on Monday. That's all for this  week's Final Exam. Pay attention to the news each week and tune in on  Thursdays to see if you can do better than one-buzz Carley. </p><p> Tucker will be here next, right after the break.</p><p> SHIMKUS: No, I didn't--</p><p> STEYN: Like (ph)--</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> STEYN: Tucker recently sat down to interview the Author of a new book on  the crisis afflicting American men. Here's what happened.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT: MEN IN AMERICA.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TUCKER CARLSON- HOST: If you look at the numbers, you quickly conclude that  men are in crisis in America. Compared to women, they are far more likely  to drop out of school, fail to graduate, go to jail, not hold a job, commit  suicide, die of a drug overdose. </p><p> And yet, the establishment, and particularly, Democratic establishment  seems uninterested in all of this. And they think - they appear to think  that men are still too successful and need to be held back.</p><p> Andrew Yarrow is a former New York Times reporter, a Senior Fellow with the  Progressive Policy Institute. He just wrote an important new book called,  Man Out: Men on the Sidelines of American Life. He joins us tonight in  studio.</p><p> Mr. Yarrow - Yarrow, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p> ANDREW YARROW, FORMER NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER, PROGRESSIVE POLICY  INSTITUTE  SENIOR FELLOW, MAN OUT AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker, it's a pleasure--</p><p> CARLSON: So, I should, perhaps if I'm (ph) saying--</p><p> YARROW: --yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --I don't think you're a conservative activist, and that I'm also  grateful that someone is saying this because the numbers support that it's  true.</p><p> YARROW: It is true. And, as you say, the problem has really largely been  ignored. I mean Democrats and a lot of people in the country don't see men  as having problems. But there are a lot of men who are struggling,  struggling with work, struggling in families, struggling with health, lot  of areas I touch on in my book.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, to such a great extent that it would seem a crisis that  affects everybody because, of course, men and women need each other to  reproduce on the most basic level, but also every - everybody has a father  or brother, sons--</p><p> YARROW: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --why do you think it's been ignored?</p><p> YARROW: Well, there's been a lot of political correctness in this country  that's kind of made the main narrative be that, you know, women are the  oppressed ones. And they have been historically--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> YARROW: --oppressed. But, you know, that doesn't mean that there aren't a  lot of men struggling. I mean you don't - it's not a zero-sum game.</p><p> CARLSON: You're right.</p><p> YARROW: And--</p><p> CARLSON: But it's been presented as one that one sex succeeds only when  another moves backward. Where'd that assumption come from?</p><p> YARROW: Well, I think a lot of politics looks at things that way. And I  think it's - it's pretty unfortunate. But I think, you know, men have not  been, in many ways, good at advocating for themselves.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> YARROW: I mean it's been interesting in the last few elections. A lot of  the political activists have been women. I mean you hear more from women  these days. I mean men aren't good at forming groups--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> YARROW: --anymore.</p><p> CARLSON: So, you work at - at the Progressive Policy Institute. You're a  Fellow there. That's not the Heritage Foundation.</p><p> YARROW: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: I think it's fair to say you probably work in a mostly Liberal  world.</p><p> YARROW: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: What kind of reaction did your piece get among people you know?</p><p> YARROW: Well, it's interesting. Conservative media have tended to like it  more. It's, you know, it's kind of troubling that this should be a  bipartisan issue. </p><p> I mean all Americans should be doing well or should have the opportunity to  do well. And they should also have justice behind them. I mean men are  being accused wrongly. I mean there are a lot of awful things that men do.  Don't get me wrong but--</p><p> CARLSON: Well sure.</p><p> YARROW: --but, you know, the lack of due process in some of these sexual  assault allegations, it's, you know, it's pretty troubling. </p><p> CARLSON: It's just interesting because the most progressive President the  country's ever had, FDR, four terms, the first thing he did after getting  elected in 1932, the very first piece through the Congress was the CCC, the  Civilian Conservation Corps, which was--</p><p> YARROW: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --aimed at young men, just men between--</p><p> YARROW: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --18 and 25 or something like that--</p><p> YARROW: Right</p><p> CARLSON: --getting them back to work and restoring their vitality through  work. What would happen if a Democrat in the modern era suggested something  like that?</p><p> YARROW: Well, you think it would play well. You know, while the  unemployment statistics look good, there are a lot of men who've either  been pushed out of the labor force or dropped out. I mean they're about 17  - 18 percent of 25 to 64 year old men, who aren't working. </p><p> And, you know, there are a lot of men - younger men, who are neither in  school or working. So, you know, why is that? And, you know, why can't we  create better jobs for them? And yes, I mean you'd think a Democrat would  pitch some kind of jobs program.</p><p> CARLSON: I think I mean this is a longer conversation but I think the  answer is toxic masculinity.</p><p> YARROW: Yes, I mean the--</p><p> CARLSON: Whatever that means.</p><p> YARROW: Well, yes. I mean that's become the phrase du jour, I guess. I mean  there are clearly issues with masculinity. You know, I interviewed a lot of  men and some women around the country, about 200. And a lot of men told me,  a lot of, you know, even Liberal men said, \"Well feminism's done a lot for  women. But what's it done for me?\"</p><p> CARLSON: Well that's a - that's a fair question. And you ask it in this  book. Thank you for doing that.</p><p> YARROW: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Great to talk to you.</p><p> YARROW: Good to talk to you.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: That's one of the biggest stories of our time, so is this one.</p><p> Big tech has become the greatest threat to Americans' privacy and personal  freedoms. But now, Americans seem to be wising up to that. A new survey  finds that Americans trust Facebook less than any other company. Also, a  growing number of Americans seeking treatment for tech addiction as they  find themselves unable to look away from social media, their smartphones or  video games.</p><p> Tom Kersting is a family therapist and the Author of Disconnected: How to  Reconnect Our Digitally Distracted Kids. I've read that book, and so should  you. And he joins us now.</p><p> Just to go with the Tucker, the big story of our time thing, when you look  at this so-called tech addiction, and you follow where that leads, you -  you do worry that in some ways these rinky-dinky little things that started  as cat video sites somehow basically re-wiring humanity.</p><p> TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: They are. I mean if we  looked out the back window right now and - and counted how many people were  walking by staring at their phones, you'd probably have 70 percent of them  doing that. </p><p> And when it comes to addiction which, obviously, I've studied in my  background, basically if anything, whether it's gambling, alcohol, drugs,  anything that's considered addictive its - if it's affecting one of the  following four, you could be diagnosed as - as an addict.</p><p> And the four things are, is it affecting your family, is it affecting your  health, is it affecting your job or your occupation, and is it affecting  have you had any legal issues?</p><p> STEYN: Right.</p><p> KERSTING: And when we look at technology, we could check off each one of  those for many, many people. So, therefore, this whole addictive whether  it's a debate or not, I'm all about, I believe in a 100 percent.</p><p> STEYN: The - the difference being though that it's actually being kind of  organized on a global scale with--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --billions and billions of people. And when you look at children,  like middle-schoolers--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes, yes.</p><p> STEYN: --who've never known anything but this world, their behavior does  seem to be not where middle-schoolers were--</p><p> KERSTING: It's--</p><p> STEYN: --20, 50, 70 years ago.</p><p> KERSTING: --it's actually unbelievable. I tell people I - I - I get more  middle-school age kids with major anxiety disorders per year now--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --in my private practice than I did the previous 17 years  combined.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: And, you know, and you could - all the research that's done to  put - start to show that, starting to point to, you know, that the  absorption of social media, the lack of - of self, the lack of a sense of  self and so forth and how that's affecting the self-esteem and causing, you  know, issues with anxiety, depression, and other - other mental health -  health things.</p><p> STEYN: People do actually seem to prefer it though. You have a scene in  your book where you talk about when you were a young guy, just sitting at a  bar, you'd never know who's on the barstool next.</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: I can relate to that. Sometimes--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --you find yourself on the other side of the wall, you're sitting  next to an Australian, a Hungarian--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --you - you meet different people with different views. Now everyone  in the bar is just like--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --scrolling the phone.</p><p> KERSTING: When you go into the - the airport, if you travel, which, you  know--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --you do, I do. They have the screens in front of every barstool.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: So, like, you and I--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --instead of hanging out, talking with one another and--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --and kicking it off, now everybody's distracted by these  devices.</p><p> STEYN: Right. Sometimes--</p><p> KERSTING: So the--</p><p> STEYN: --you want to go where only Facebook knows--</p><p> KERSTING: --so - so it's like a - it's like--</p><p> STEYN: --you're in that area (ph).</p><p> KERSTING: --right. It's like bottles of wine dangling around if you're an  alcoholic--</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --24 hours a day, seven days a week, you can't escape from it.</p><p> STEYN: Yes. That's - that's a - that's a - a worrying thing. As I said, I  think this is one of the biggest stories of time, Tom. I dread (ph) to  think--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --where we're going to be if - if we're - if we don't change it. But  how do we change it?</p><p> KERSTING: Well we have - it's - it's not something that's going to happen  overnight. We just have to keep creating awareness, having conversations  like you and I are having right now, so that people could see this. They  can understand the ramifications of these things. I'm one of the guys out  there, you know, that's lecturing--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --that's writing about it and that's out there trying to get  other people to do the same. And it's - it's going to be a slow process but  I think we're going to have to get there.</p><p> STEYN: OK. Well we will - we will hold you to that Tom because something -  these companies are bigger than countries now. </p><p> That is about it for us tonight. You can tune in each night at 8:00 to the  show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink.  And don't forget to DVR the show. That's less harmful, less addictive than  if you just go on Facebook and look at it. Don't bother with that. Just DVR  the show, if you haven't set that up already.</p><p> Now, this is exciting moment in the evening. We are going to lift Nancy  Pelosi's beaded curtain and find out who is guest-hosting for Sean Hannity  tonight. Oh, who is it going to be? They've lifted the beaded curtain. I  think I can see--</p><p> JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR UTAH'S 3RD CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE COMMITTEE ON  OVERSIGHT  AND GOVERNMENT REFORM, COMMENTATOR: Oh, Mark.</p><p> STEYN: --Jason Kennedy filling in for Sean. Hey Jason--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p> STEYN: --oh, no, Jason Chaffetz. What--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Mark, thank you, great show.</p><p> STEYN: After all, hey by--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: I always love it when you're on with Tucker.</p><p> STEYN: No.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: I love it when you're on, so--</p><p> STEYN: Hey - hey, by--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: --thank you so much.</p><p> STEYN: --by the way, that was a terrific interview you did with Sam Johnson  today.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: And everyone should look at that. That was the best thing on TV this  morning.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Well--</p><p> STEYN: Terrific stuff.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Thank you. Thanks to Fox &amp; Friends. We have - actually later in  the show, we're going to go back and tell you about Sam Johnson, a special  man, an amazing personality and a true American hero, so thanks, Mark. We  appreciate it.</p><p> STEYN: Thanks a lot, Jason. Have a great show.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Mark Steyn in for Tucker. He's sleeping off his  Boxing Day Bacchanalia but he will join us later to discuss the ongoing  collapse of men in America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But first, yet another Liberal media meltdown. The mainstream media taking  the opportunity to turn a presidential visit to American troops into an  attack on Trump. Take a look at the hysteria as the talking heads accused  the President of turning the post-Christmas visit into a political event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY COMMENTATOR, CNN NATIONAL  SECURITY ANALYST: From a national security perspective, for all the reasons  that you just listed, the President should have stayed home.</p><p> JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, RETIRED MAJOR GENERAL, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: The  reason that he went now is that he couldn't go to Mar-a-Lago because the  government was shut down.</p><p> DON LEMON, CNN TONIGHT HOST, CNN: It was like we kept saying \"He's like the  Grinch.\" Instead of - I'm being honest.</p><p> CHARLES JOSEPH SCARBOROUGH, MORNING JOE CO-HOST, MSNBC: We should also be  concerned that Mr. Trump once again used a captive audience of American  heroes to push his unpopular domestic agenda.</p><p> Even in doing something right, he figures out a way to sow chaos.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It took far too long, especially compared to President  Obama who visited troops in Iraq in his first three months in office.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> STEYN: Over at CNN, attacking the President wasn't enough. They decided to  attack the troops as well.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARBARA STARR, PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT, CNN: The pool reporters traveling  said that the troops brought the hats with them, including one hat that  said \"Trump 2020.\" We will have to see if that actually proves to be the  case. </p><p> The question is, if they - if they brought them or if the President brought  them, what commander allowed that to really happen, because this is very  much against military policy and regulation. Troops are not supposed to be  involved in political activities. The U.S. Military is not a political  force.</p><p> JOHN FRANCIS KIRBY, RETIRED UNITED STATES NAVY REAR ADMIRAL, FORMER  SPOKESPERSON FOR THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE: It's completely  inappropriate for the troops to do this.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not supposed to--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Of course, nobody cared back when presidential candidate Barack  Obama signed memorabilia for the troops back in 2008. He had a D after his  name though instead of an R. Thankfully, not everybody's lost their minds.  Even some Liberals scolded the media for their hysteria.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DAVID AXELROD, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, POLITICAL  CONSULTANT, ANALYST: It's - it's good that he went to see the troops,  important that he went to do it. He - he was criticized for it, obviously.  They wanted to address that. And so, I should - we should give him credit  where credit is due.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It just sends a - such a strong message that the - the  Trumps love our military, support our military, and what a great time to do  it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Well Joe Concha writes about Media for The Hill. He joins us now.  Joe, is this a good look for the media? Why are serving soldiers in a war  zone bringing particular hats to an event on base in a combat zone at  Christmas?</p><p> JOE CONCHA, THE HILL MEDIA REPORTER: Well the optics around that, Mark, are  horrific, right, because what you're doing here is it's - it's OK to go  after the President in terms of policy or the things that he says. </p><p> Once you start attacking the people that voted for him or military people  that are obviously serving overseas during Christmas, no less, then--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> CONCHA: --then you got a problem. And you have to ask yourself this  question, Mark. </p><p> Let's say, honestly, like you pointed out, as I did in my column today on  The Hill, if President Obama, as he did in 2008, signed a Hope and Change  t-shirts, do you really think any news organization would have gone ahead  with that story? Of course, they wouldn't have.</p><p> STEYN: No. I - I couldn't care less. Well what soldiers in these, frankly,  God-awful situations, because life in it - at a base in Iraq stinks. You -  it's not like being in Ramstein, Germany where the President was today. You  can't stroll down to town go to a local bar, meet one of the nice German  girls, or one of the local guy (ph), you know, that's nothing like that.</p><p> You're stuck in that lousy fortress that you hope is a fortress. And the  President comes to visit you. And the pre-occupation of the American media  is whether hats the troops chose to take to that event are somehow some  potential crime that they can be pulled up in front of a military court  for. I mean that's bonkers--</p><p> CONCHA: Yes, Mark, and--</p><p> STEYN: --isn't it?</p><p> CONCHA: --it's bonkers, yes. And I think that pivot happened because the  original narrative was, we - we'd all recall is that, President Trump was  supposed to be the first President since 2002 to not visit the troops at  Christmas. </p><p> And once that fell apart, when he literally landed in Iraq as the story was  going up and it originally came from NBC, then social media goes nuts. And  - and what happened was the pivot went from, \"Oh yes, OK. Trump went, sure,  but what was his motive exactly for going?\"</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> CONCHA: I - I give you The Washington Post, Mark, quoting, the President's  visit follows months of public pressure for him to spend time with troops  deployed to conflicts in the Middle East. Think about that again, follows  months of public pressure.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> CONCHA: In other words, we, the media, got the public riled up to force  Trump to go to a war zone instead of him just going like every president  has done for the past 17 years.</p><p> STEYN: Well - well according to Soledad O'Brien, who's a lovely lady, but  she thought it was actually minutes of public pressure that Alyssa Milano  who - who actually tweeted as the President was halfway across the ocean,  why haven't you visited our troops, Soledad O - O'Brien actually gave  Alyssa Milano credit for shaming the President into getting on the plane  that he'd already gotten on.</p><p> CONCHA: Yes. And then what's forgotten in all this, of course, is if you  want to go to Walter Reed, let's say the President was shamed, and he goes  to Walter Reed, which is close to the White House, OK, then you could say  it's a last-minute thing. When you go to Iraq, you kind of have to plan it  in advance. You have to do it weeks in advance, obviously, for security.</p><p> Air Force One has to fly in with shades down and cellphones off and - and  all of that. So, you think you'd see though however, at least from NBC and  - and - and others, some remorse, some apology, some around, you know,  \"Hey, we went ahead with this story a little bit too early because we ran a  story on Christmas saying that the President hadn't been to see the troops  on Christmastime.\"</p><p> People don't mind that sort of transparency from the media. But yet, we  never see those sort of concessions. Instead, we see the pivots that are  negative like we always do in these situations. And that's why trust in  media is this. </p><p> Axios, SurveyMonkey poll just last year, 93 percent of Republicans think  that the media knowingly creates stories, makes them up, they're false. And  you say all right (ph), that's Republicans. They've always hated the media.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> CONCHA: They don't trust them. 79 percent of - of independents, Mark--</p><p> STEYN: Right.</p><p> CONCHA: 53 percent of Democrats, even a majority, that's the thing. I mean  this is something that's going across the board--</p><p> STEYN: Sure (ph).</p><p> CONCHA: --in terms of all parties seeing exactly what's happening here,  sir.</p><p> STEYN: Hey Joe, thanks. Don't worry about that though. As soon as the media  call for a Special Counsel to investigate how those MAGA hats got to Iraq,  everything will be fine.</p><p> CONCHA: There you go (ph).</p><p> STEYN: Rochelle Ritchie is a former Press Secretary for the House  Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, and Rachel Campos-Duffy is  a Fox contributor, and they both join us.</p><p> Rochelle, how - stepping back and looking at this a little more objectively  than CNN &amp; Co. have done, is it really a good law - the troops liked the  guy. The guy got on with the troops. Is there really any political mileage  to be had in going on about this?</p><p> ROCHELLE RITCHIE, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY, HOUSE DEMOCRATIC POLICY AND  COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: So, I had a little bit of  a battle with myself about this. At first, I was saying, you know, no,  these men and women in uniform, they shouldn't have, you know, gotten their  hats signed. They shouldn't have been out there with Make America Great  Again hats.</p><p> And, you know, when you look at the facts, yes, it is a - it is breaking a  rule when it comes to the Department of Defense guidelines. But at the same  time, these troops have not seen an American President since 2009. I  believe Obama was the last one to - to go visit.</p><p> So, maybe they're not necessarily, you know, showing support for the  President or getting his signature because they are Republican--</p><p> STEYN: Yes, no, come on, who--</p><p> RITCHIE: --maybe - no, listen, listen--</p><p> STEYN: --no--</p><p> RITCHIE: --no, see, how can you disagree? I haven't even finished. </p><p> The Commander - it's their Commander-in-Chief. So, maybe it's not because  he's a Republican President. Maybe they're looking at it like he's the  Commander-in-Chief. We're proud to fight for our country or fight - we're  proud to stand behind our President--</p><p> STEYN: Let--</p><p> RITCHIE: --whether he has an R or a D behind his name. And, look, I could  really care less if the guys do it. As long as they're continuing to  protect our national security, have at it.</p><p> STEYN: Well Rochelle gave that theory rather more credit than I would  think, Rachel. I mean who the--</p><p> RITCHIE: I'm very balanced.</p><p> STEYN: --who the hell - if you have the misfortune to be spending Christmas  on one of those - those forts, cut off from life in the middle of the Iraqi  desert--</p><p> RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, AMERICAN TELEVISION PERSONALITY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.</p><p> STEYN: --who the hell cares what hat you take to a Christmas party  basically.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Of course, they shouldn't care. But I think the more  important question is why do - I mean - let's be honest. The reaction from  the troops was very overwhelmingly positive. And it should be. </p><p> Listen, Barack Obama decimated our military. Barack Obama--</p><p> RITCHIE: OK.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --wait a minute. He did. He cut funding for our military. He  put in rules of engagement that actually--</p><p> RITCHIE: But that's not even--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --caused - wait a minute that actually caused--</p><p> RITCHIE: But what does that have to do with--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --but let - let--</p><p> RITCHIE: --what we're talking about though with this Trump (ph)--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let - it does. It does have to do.</p><p> RITCHIE: --how?</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Because the - Barack Obama did all in - enacted rules of  engagement--</p><p> RITCHIE: I don't. It has nothing to do--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --Rochelle, let me finish. Rochelle--</p><p> RITCHIE: --OK. Go ahead, Rachel.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let me finish. He enacted rules of engagement that actually  put our military on the battlefield in danger--</p><p> STEYN: Well--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --causing more battles (ph) but wait - wait a minute, Mark.  He did that.</p><p> RITCHIE: I'm sorry.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: And he went to the troops and they said he was a great  Commander-in-Chief. Donald Trump goes--</p><p> STEYN: Let me--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --over and does all this to not for Alyssa Milano or the  media - or the media. But he does it because he loves the troops. And they  say that he's doing it for a photo op.</p><p> STEYN: Oh--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: This is a man who loves the military.</p><p> STEYN: No, how (ph)--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was his number one issue.</p><p> RITCHIE: I - I--</p><p> STEYN: OK. How about this as a non-Democrat, non-Republican thing?  Democrats weren't in favor of the 21st Century Bush Wars, as they called  them.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right.</p><p> RITCHIE: Right.</p><p> STEYN: But nor was Donald - nor was Donald Trump in 2016.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: That's right.</p><p> STEYN: In - in a sense, Donald Trump is at odds with both Democrat policy  and Republican policy on the Middle East, Rochelle.</p><p> RITCHIE: Yes. He's definitely fighting both sides. And I think what - when  you talked about the press, I think the reason why the press is sort of  attacking on him, the - the Left-leaning press, I would say, is because of  some of the - the misleading comments that he made when he talked about the  pay raises for the military. We know that's not--</p><p> STEYN: Well they do - they did get the pay rises (ph).</p><p> RITCHIE: --necessarily true. They do get raises. But they're not getting a  10 percent raise. It's going to be, I think, 2.6 percent. So, I think there  are ways that the media was looking at it and attacking him for his less- than-knowledgeable education, I guess you could say, on what's really  happening--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: But (ph)--</p><p> RITCHIE: --there. But I don't I - I think that him visiting was a good  idea. I think there was an article by The Washington Post where it said  that he was actually scared to go over there for some time. So, I'm glad--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Ridiculous.</p><p> RITCHIE: --he got over that.</p><p> STEYN: That's a--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: He was not scared. And - and what would the media, you know,  betting MAGAs hats (ph) what would they have had him do? Say, \"Oh, I'm  sorry. I'm not going to sign your hat because of the Hatch Act,\" and then  they--</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --would have criticized him and said--</p><p> RITCHIE: Well--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --\"Hey, what a jerk. He wouldn't sign a hat.\"</p><p> STEYN: By the way there's too much--</p><p> RITCHIE: I just - I just said I thought that was perfectly fine.</p><p> STEYN: --there's too much of that. The minute you--</p><p> RITCHIE: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --if you're seriously talking about soldiers doing something wrong  because they asked their Commander-in-Chief to sign a hat, then - then  you've flown the coop. That's not a land of law and things (ph)--</p><p> RITCHIE: I want to know (ph)--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: It's - it's a bad look for the press. It's - the reason why  the American people hate the press and, by the way, the troops loved the  President because--</p><p> RITCHIE: Wait, wait, what is this? This is (ph) press--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --the troops love the President because he did sign a bill  that he took a lot of flack from the - from the Right for signing a big  bill that was--</p><p> RITCHIE: I think - I think--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --for funding the military.</p><p> RITCHIE: --I think that Trump's whole purpose--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: They love him.</p><p> RITCHIE: --of being there and - and this is - is - this is part of it, I  think that he also has a lot, I think, there was a - a part in this segment  right before you came to us about--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> RITCHIE: --this being public pressure. I think it's more political pressure  because of him, you know, General Kelly, then General Mattis, and so I  think that he's really trying to show that he has some sort of control of  what's happening right now in the middle in - in--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right. Why didn't - why didn't the--</p><p> STEYN: No, no, no, no--</p><p> RITCHIE: --Iraq. But then - but--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --why doesn't that criticism come to Barack Obama? He goes to  visit the troop, no one questions his motives.</p><p> RITCHIE: Well Obama is living his best life somewhere (ph).</p><p> STEYN: No, but it's a - that - you can't do--</p><p> RITCHIE: Can we leave him out of it?</p><p> STEYN: --those--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: But - but there is a double standard. And that is what people  are talking about, Rochelle.</p><p> STEYN: We got to - we got to go, ladies.</p><p> RITCHIE: OK.</p><p> STEYN: Iraq's a crazy place. You can't just plan those things with no  notice.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Absolutely, I agree (ph).</p><p> RITCHIE: No, you can't.</p><p> STEYN: Rochelle and Rachel will carry--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was Alyssa Milano.</p><p> STEYN: --this - this ones (ph) and they're going to take this to the green  room - where now - this is worse than the Sunni Triangle, the violence  that's like (ph) percolating it.</p><p> We're now on day six of the government shutdown triggered by Congress'  refusal to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. </p><p> Today, the President tweeted, \"Have the Democrats finally realized that we  desperately need border security and a wall on the Southern border? We need  to stop drugs, human trafficking, gang members, and criminals from coming  into our country. And do the Dems realize that most of the people not  getting paid are Democrats?\"</p><p> Fox Washington Correspondent, Rich Edson, joins us with more on the  situation in D.C. It's all yours.</p><p> RICH EDSON, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p>Congress officially and briefly gaveled in this afternoon though there is  no sign of this shutdown ending anytime soon as Democrats in (ph) the White  House are a few billion dollars apart on funding for a wall on the Southern  border. President Trump has returned to the White House after visiting U.S.  forces yesterday in Iraq.</p><p> He's just tweeted, \"This isn't about the wall. Everybody knows that a wall  will work perfectly. In Israel, the wall works 99.9 percent. This is only  about the Dems not letting Donald Trump and the Republicans have a win.  They may have the 10 Senate votes. But we have the issue, border security.  2020.\"</p><p> In a statement, White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders says,  \"The President and his team in Washington over Christmas hoping to  negotiate a deal that would stop the dangerous crisis on the border,  protect American communities, and re-open the government, the Democrats  decided to go home.\"</p><p> She also says the Administration offered Democrats what she calls a  reasonable common-sense solution five days ago, though a spokesperson for  House Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, says, \"Democrats have offered  Republicans three options to re-open the government that all include  funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security, but not the  President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall.\"</p><p> While in Iraq, President Trump stressed the funding bill must include money  for a border wall.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The folks are saying, \"Can  we have some drones? Can we have technology?\" Technology is bells and  whistles. You have to have a wall. You have to have protection. </p><p> When you say, \"How long is it going to take?\" \"When are they going to say  that we need border security?\"</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EDSON: Pelosi's office says Democrats will pass their bill to open the  government after they take control of the House next week. Though to end  this shutdown, the House, the Senate, and the White House must all agree on  the same funding bill.</p><p> On Capitol Hill, House Freedom Caucus Chairman, Mark Meadows, says the  needle has moved towards a very long shutdown, as Democrats and Republicans  appear to talk past one another.</p><p> Mark?</p><p> STEYN: Thanks a lot, Rich.</p><p> This is a Fox News Alert. Police in California are on the hunt for an  unnamed illegal immigrant, suspected of murdering a police officer.  Corporal Ronil Singh, an immigrant from Fiji, was gunned down Wednesday  morning during a traffic stop. Police have released surveillance footage of  the suspect, and say they believe he is still in the area. We will continue  to monitor this breaking story. </p><p> And coming up, Tucker will be back with us to discuss the crisis of  American manhood. Plus, President Trump insists the government won't re- open until he has money for his wall. But if he gets it, will that wall  work? That's next on TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> STEYN: El Paso, Texas is turning into Exhibit A of America's broken  immigration system. ICE has been overwhelmed by asylum requests and  shackled by court rulings, and it's now releasing hundreds of migrants onto  the streets of El Paso.</p><p> The message to future migrants, of course, is that America is powerless to  stop them from settling here. Fox's Jonathan Hunt is here with more.  Jonathan?</p><p> JONATHAN HUNT, CHIEF CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p> Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, says the immigration system  is at breaking point. Border Patrol agents say they're overwhelmed. Around  1,000 immigrants have been released onto the streets of El Paso, Texas this  week alone. </p><p> And two young immigrant children have died after being taken into custody  by Customs and Border Protection agents, the first deaths of children in  CBP custody for a decade.</p><p> In El Paso, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say they have  little choice but to release those hundreds of immigrants because of,  quote, decades of inaction by Congress that they say has limited their  ability to remove families who are in the U.S. illegally, and has set  limits on how long they can hold those families.</p><p> So, they're being dropped off at a bus station in El Paso, where aid groups  are offering support. More, by the way, are expected to be released today.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DYLAN CORBETT, DIRECTOR, HOPE BORDER INSTITUTE (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): They  have spent eight to 10 days in cells. Now they've been released. What we've  been doing as a community is to support them, giving them food, a place for  them to stay at night.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HUNT: President Trump has repeatedly said the era of so-called catch and  release has ended. But frankly, that is exactly what is happening in Texas  right now. And it all comes against the backdrop of the government shutdown  over President Trump's demand for a Border wall that he says could stem the  flow of illegal immigration.</p><p> The wall and, of course, the deaths of those two immigrant children will no  doubt top the agenda when Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen visits the  Border area in El Paso, Texas, Friday, and Yuma, Arizona, Saturday. </p><p> Mark?</p><p> STEYN: Just - just to be clear on that, Jonathan, ICE can hold these people  if that chap is right for - for 10 days or whatever. And then meanwhile  they're given a two-year court date. So, in the gap between the 10 days and  the two years, they just get to hang out in America? That's - that's the  idea of it (ph)?</p><p> HUNT: Right. Well what - what ICE is saying is that under the current laws,  they have no choice but to release these immigrants after that time frame.  And, therefore, they take them to the bus station and then, yes,  essentially they are free to go where they wish to do as they please, Mark.</p><p> STEYN: Well that seems a bit of a design flaw, Jonathan.</p><p> While - while migrants continue to pour into the United States, critics of  the President maintain that nothing can be done because a wall's useless.  CNN's Brian Karem recently ranted about the futility of mankind's oldest  defensive mechanism.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRIAN KAREM, JOURNALIST, PLAYBOY'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, CNN POLITICAL  ANALYST, FORMER EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY SENTINEL: This  whole issue is a crock from start to finish. He picked it up on the  campaign trail as something to appease the masses and play to his base. </p><p> It's not going to stop terrorism. It's not going to be 2,000 miles long, as  originally planned. It's not going to be see-through. It's not going to be  eco- friendly. It's not going to be slats or heads on pikes or a beaded  curtain or anything else. You can't wall that border.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Jimmy Kimmel, meanwhile, has been ridiculing, Americans were so  desperate for a secure border they've been willing to donate to a GoFundMe  campaign for it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!: This - this  Trump supporter, guy named Brian Kolfage, started a GoFundMe campaign to  raise a billion dollars for the wall. He launched it on Sunday. It's  already up to almost $9 million. People - this is what people do with their  disposable income when they don't have loans from college to pay off.</p><p> (CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p> KIMMEL: Donating money for a wall that will never exist. It - it's like  starting a college fund for Harry Potter.</p><p> (CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p> KIMMEL: It's a - it's a - a more useful thing to do with your money would  be to go outside and feed it to a bird. But--</p><p> (CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p> KIMMEL: --you do have to admire the sacrifice they're making. I mean lot of  these people are dipping into their meth money for this.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Got it. Meth heads for national security. Thank you, Jimmy. So,  would a wall work or not?</p><p> Jason Piccolo is a former Special Agent and Supervisor with the Department  of Homeland Security, and he joins us now. </p><p> Everybody's mocking this. We've had Nancy Pelosi doing her beaded curtain  line. At this stage, I would welcome a 2,000 mile beaded curtain along the  Southern border. It would show a certain kind of resolve. But are these  critics right that this thing doesn't work, doesn't make any difference,  complete waste of time?</p><p> JASON PICCOLO, FORMER ICE SUPERVISOR, OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM VETERAN: No,  it'll work. Now the border is 2,000 miles long. And you won't be able to  actually wall the whole border. But that'll create chokepoints or - or  points where we could actually apprehend the immigrants coming in.</p><p> STEYN: Yes, well--</p><p> PICCOLO: So, yes, a wall would work.</p><p> STEYN: --yes. What's interesting to me is that if you look at up on the  Northern border, where there's far fewer people coming across, there's not  caravans massing on the 49th parallel, and yet, the United States  government has actually put physical barricades in a lot of cross border  towns on the Canadian border, presumably because it works there. </p><p> So, why would it not work on the Mexican border?</p><p> PICCOLO: Walls work. They do. Now, when I worked on a border, the border  was simply a strand of fence in some areas like a strand of wire. Now, you  have narco-traffickers coming across that same area. You have economic  migrants, it's just it's open. The whole border is pretty much open except  for, you know, few miles here and there.</p><p> STEYN: When - when you say it's open, because most - most people who cross  international frontiers legitimately will do so at big border posts. </p><p> But you're saying that even though we talk about this incessantly, there  are actually 100-mile stretches where people can actually just walk into  the United States, a country that's supposedly been on Orange Alert for 17  years.</p><p> PICCOLO: Yes, definitely. Now, I was on the DHS' human smuggling cell back  in 2015. And we tracked human smuggling corridors coming up from South  America. </p><p> Now, you do have Special Interest Aliens transiting into South America,  into Brazil, and traveling up those same routes that the economic migrants  and the narco-traffickers are using. So there--</p><p> STEYN: So--</p><p> PICCOLO: --anybody can come and go through that border.</p><p> STEYN: So you mean - you mean, when you say Special Interest Aliens, you -  you mean that potential jihadists have figured out. They - they look at  what's on their TV screens on the Rio Grande, and figure that instead of  trying to fly to JFK, you might as well just go to Latin America and walk  into the country.</p><p> PICCOLO: You can. The border's open. Now, I detailed out in Ajo, Arizona at  one time back in the early 2000s. And it was literally one strand of barbed  wire. So, yes, you could - anybody could walk across that border when the  various (ph) intent are with coming here for economic migration.</p><p> STEYN: A strand of barbed wire. That seems even more useless than the  beaded curtain. Jason, thank you for that. And thank you for the eyewitness  testimony on that Southern border. I'm not sure people actually visualize  it quite the way you know it.</p><p> Coming up, Tucker's going to be here to discuss the declining fortunes of  American men. And Paris is still coping with riots after the government  tried to levy a carbon tax. So, why do lawmakers want a carbon tax here?  That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> STEYN: It was another chaotic day on Wall Street today. Yesterday, the Dow  Jones average had its largest single-day gain in history. Today, the  average went on another downward streak falling by 600 points. </p><p> But in the afternoon, the market rallied surging almost 900 points to  finish the day up by 258 points. The market is still down about 2,500  points this month in what's been a very tumultuous end to the year. It's  like these algorithms just fell face-down in the eggnog.</p><p> The French have been rioting for more than a month now after Emmanuel  Macron's government tried to impose an anti-global warming gas tax upon  them. Nevertheless, a lot of Americans, including the outgoing Senator Jeff  Flake, think it's time for America to have its own carbon tax. Is that  wise?</p><p> Mark Reynolds is Executive Director of the Citizens Climate Lobby, and he  joins us. Mark, when you see what's happening in France, that's a more  extreme version of what happens when carbon taxes are actually put into  place elsewhere. People don't seem to like it, don't seem to care for it.</p><p> MARK REYNOLDS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CITIZENS CLIMATE LOBBY: First of all,  thank you so much for having me on the show. The nice thing about the  Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is that it actually puts money in  people's pockets. So, I think that there's people who are suffering both  here and in other countries. </p><p> And I think that the reason that there's so much Republicans' support -  support on both the House and the Senate version of this bill is it  actually sends, allocates money back to households, so that they are  prepared to deal with whatever they have to.</p><p> And again--</p><p> STEYN: Well--</p><p> REYNOLDS: --it doesn't tell them what to do with that money, just lets them  make a choice about whatever they want to do with it.</p><p> STEYN: Well let me tell - this is the bill that's being proposed in - the  carbon tax is being proposed in the United States, which under the proposal  supposedly then gives money back to households. But here's one big problem  with it, Mark.</p><p> Basically, the automatic increases kick in, I think, starting around 2022,  and they basically go all the way up until mid-century. So, and it's beyond  the control of other congresses. It just becomes like an entitlement  program that gets automatic increases every year and is beyond the control.</p><p> You can't go to a polling station if you don't like it, if the facts  change, if the circumstances change. It essentially puts the carbon tax  beyond democratic - democratic accountability, doesn't it?</p><p> REYNOLDS: Well Representative Francis Rooney, who's the lead Republican  sponsor from Florida says that he likes this bill because it's market- based. It actually lets the market determine how we get to the new energy  economy. </p><p> I think that's a lot of what Mr. Fitzpatrick, one of the Republicans on the  bill also said is, is, you know, you put a fee on carbon-based emissions,  you give the money back to households so that the government doesn't pick  what to do with it. You don't pick winners and losers. It'll be up for you  to--</p><p> STEYN: What about--</p><p> REYNOLDS: --to you and I to determine what we do with a dividend. But it'll  be actually a free-market bill--</p><p> STEYN: Well--</p><p> REYNOLDS: --and that's what the Republicans on the bill said they like  about it so much.</p><p> STEYN: What do you make of the CEI, the Competitive Enterprise Institute's  objection to it that it will actually kill America's new energy  independence, which is a phenomenon in the last few years, what we see with  fracking and so forth, and means we're no longer dependent on malign Saudi  sheiks who use their oil riches to spread their Wahhabist ideology around  the world. </p><p> The CEI's view is that the carbon tax is going to kill American energy  independence.</p><p> REYNOLDS: Yes. So, I think there's something really interesting happening  right now. There's actually a race to the new energy economy. And it's  probably going to be either us or China. China is making a huge investment  in renewable energy. And I heard - certainly hope it's us.</p><p> So, what I think that this bill does is creates enough incentive throughout  the entire--</p><p> STEYN: Well--</p><p> REYNOLDS: --economic system to create all the type of--</p><p> STEYN: --wait, wait.</p><p> REYNOLDS: --innovation that we know we need.</p><p> STEYN: But there's no carbon tax in China. The Yangtze is like the most  polluted river in the world the - with the - with what's coming down that  stream every day. It's nothing you'd want any of your kids to be gambling  and frolicking in.</p><p> So, they won't wait - what - what the French - the - the French protesters  object to is that this is their lives. It's not a theory. It's not a  macroeconomic theory. If it's a choice between sea levels in Tuvalu in the  22nd Century or how they have to live their lives in the century they're  actually living in, they'll prioritize the reality of their lives over  speculation a century hence.</p><p> REYNOLDS: Yes. I think that that's why so many Republicans like this bill  in both the House and Senate is because money's actually returned. You get  a monthly check and then it's your choice what you do with it. </p><p> I'm not going to tell you what to do with the money. The government's not  going to tell you what to - what to do with the money. It's going to be up  to American households to determine what to do.</p><p> STEYN: And - and you believe - and you believe that's good at - because  everything you - they always say that and then it goes into the General  Fund. The gas - gasoline taxes, they were supposed to be about it and they  all go into it (ph). Well we'll - we'll see how it works out. I don't see  the public appetite for it. </p><p> But, Mark, thank you for - thank you for talking with us today. And happy  post--</p><p> REYNOLDS: Yes. And thank you for - thank you for having me on. And let me  just say to the people who are watching, there is one of our chapters in  every community out there from Boise, Idaho, to Birmingham, Alabama. If you  want to work with people on solutions, we have a big tent, and we would  love to see you in your neighborhood.</p><p> STEYN: OK. Big tents we like. And we won't heat them with conventional  energy sources.</p><p> REYNOLDS: OK.</p><p> STEYN: Thank you for that, Mark. Happy post-Boxing Day to you. </p><p> It's time for Tucker's Final Exam. Have you been following the news over  the Christmas period? Find out if you can remember it better than the big- time professionals here at Fox. That's up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT: FINAL EXAM.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Oh, you know what that music means. It's time for Tucker's Final  Exam where the news professionals are interrogated, see if they can  actually remember the events they cover every day. </p><p> This week's Final Exam is a New York Special. We have Kennedy, the last  non-guest host in the building. And also - and also with us, from FOX News  Headlines 24/7, Carley Shimkus.</p><p> And actually, speaking of guest hosting, Carley will actually be in this  slot on Monday night. But for some reason we're going to stick her outside- -</p><p> LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, KENNEDY HOST, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Oh.</p><p> STEYN: --for the duration of the show. And then Kennedy will follow Carley.  So, this is the Fox New Year's Eve team. You'll--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Right.</p><p> STEYN: --you'll get a heads-up on ahead. Stay ahead of (ph)--</p><p> CARLEY SHIMKUS, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 REPORTER: We're going to have lot  of fun.</p><p> STEYN: --tuning in. OK, contestants, hands on buzzers. I'm going to ask the  questions. And the first one to buzz in gets to answer. But you must wait  until I finish asking. </p><p> You can answer once and I shall acknowledge you, according to rules set by  the International Quiz Show Committee in Geneva, by saying your name.  Correct answer's worth one point. Get it wrong, you lose a point. Best of  five wins. </p><p> Let's get started. Question one, an outgoing Democrat Senator just blasted  newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling her a shiny new object with cheap  rhetoric. Which lawmaker made those remarks?</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p> STEYN: And it's Kennedy.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Claire McCaskill.</p><p> STEYN: Claire McCaskill. Let's roll that tape.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CLAIRE CONNER MCCASKILL, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MISSOURI: I don't  know her. I'm - I'm a little confused why she's the thing. But it's a good  example of what I'm talking about, a bright and shiny new object.</p><p> The rhetoric is cheap. Getting results is a lot harder.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Meow. Saucer of--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --milk for Senator McCaskill.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Don't let the door hit you where the Lord split you, Senator  McCaskill.</p><p> STEYN: So, that's first blood to Kennedy. One-Zip as we head into question  two.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: OK.</p><p> STEYN: This is critical for Carley. Otherwise she - she'll be losing that  New Year's Eve gig. Question--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p> STEYN: --question two. Former First Lady, Michelle Obama, is now the most  admired woman in all of America. That's according to a new Gallup poll. But  to get them, Michelle Obama had to bump another woman who'd held on to the  top spot for 17 years.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p> STEYN: Who was the other woman?</p><p> SHIMKUS: I know it (ph).</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p> STEYN: Oh. And it's Kennedy again.</p><p> SHIMKUS: It was just a guess from me anyway.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Hillary Clinton.</p><p> STEYN: Oh, come on. Hillary Clinton, the most admired woman in America? The  17 - are you kidding me? Let's roll that tape.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Michelle Obama has overtaken Hillary Clinton as the  most admired woman in the country.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Good job. Oh, man. I'm getting cleaned (ph).</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Clinton held that top spot on that list for 17 years.  What does that say about Hillary now?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Me too (ph).</p><p> SHIMKUS: You know what? I thought it - I - I wanted to say Oprah because--</p><p> STEYN: Right.</p><p> SHIMKUS: --I thought - I feel like that - were truly is one of the most  admired women in America. But I think Hillary is now third and--</p><p> STEYN: No, yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: --Molly (ph) is in second or something like that.</p><p> STEYN: Oprah - Oprah is number two. But it's a tragedy--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --for Hillary. She was once the most admired--</p><p> SHIMKUS: She lost again.</p><p> STEYN: --woman in America and--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: I blame the Latvian bot farm and misogyny.</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Even though there are other women on the list, so--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Of course.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: --very misogynistic that she got the heave-ho.</p><p> STEYN: Yes, absolutely.</p><p> SHIMKUS: We are clearly on that list as well, four and five.</p><p> STEYN: Yes. Macedonian content farmers fixed that thing right (ph). It's  Two-Zip to Kennedy. This is--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p> STEYN: --come on, come on Carley.</p><p> SHIMKUS: I just want one point.</p><p> STEYN: Come on, you don't want to be outside on New Year's Eve.</p><p> SHIMKUS: I don't.</p><p> STEYN: This - we'll give you - we'll give you a studio if you can turn this  thing around.</p><p> SHIMKUS: OK.</p><p> STEYN: Question three. We recently told you about a popular calendar in  Russia, which features various images of a shirtless Vladimir Putin. That  same calendar is now a monster hit in another country and is outselling  ones featuring puny homegrown celebrities. Which country is it?</p><p> SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND) </p><p> SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p> STEYN: No, no. No. And this is (ph) - Kennedy.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: United States.</p><p> STEYN: Chest-less (ph) Putin in the United States?</p><p> SHIMKUS: Let's see.</p><p> STEYN: Doesn't sound likely.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm blushing. They're flying off the shelves in Japan--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: No.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --of all places.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Oh.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Oh.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A chain of Lifestyle stores indicates that the calendars  are their--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: I'll take a win by a loss.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --top-seller.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Russian President featured dipping into a hot tub  and posing with a fish.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Fell came there (ph)--</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's (ph) like 60 years old. Not looking too bad.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Wow.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And here he is cuddling a leopard, a very docile  leopard. The popularity of the calendars is reportedly fueled by a surge in  self-proclaimed Putin fans. Get them while they're hot, ladies. Putin--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: While they're hot.</p><p> STEYN: Yes. There's nothing a Japanese lady likes than--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Putin and a fish (ph).</p><p> STEYN: --being in a hot tub with a KGB torturer. Kennedy, disastrous move  there. She's lost one point.</p><p> SHIMKUS: It's all right.</p><p> STEYN: So there's still everything to play for. It's Two-Zero. </p><p> Question four, multiple choice.</p><p> SHIMKUS: One-zero.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Isn't it two-ones?</p><p> STEYN: Oh, no, one - one-zero.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: One-zero. Yes, Carley--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Oh, I lost a point?</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: I thought - I thought I kept it and then--</p><p> STEYN: No, no, you - you lost it.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: --I thought I kept the other two (ph)--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh, the two points (ph)--</p><p> STEYN: You're in huge trouble now.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Oh, boy.</p><p> STEYN: Question four. This is a multiple choice question. There's a crisis  on the International Space Station. Something mysterious was found by  astronauts inside a capsule that recently docked there. And Russian  officials say it's the result of a major breach. What was it they found?</p><p> SHIMKUS: I would--</p><p> STEYN: A, a sharp knife, B, a tiny hole, or C, a jar of pickles.</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> STEYN: And it's the trigger-happy Kennedy yet again. What do you say,  Kennedy?</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Jar of pickles.</p><p> STEYN: Jar of pickles</p><p> SHIMKUS: I was going to go with A. But let's--</p><p> STEYN: Let's roll that tape.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Matter of life and death. A tiny hole discovered in a  Russian capsule--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: We were both - we would have both been wrong.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --that docks to the International Space Station.</p><p> At first, scientists suspected the hole was caused by a meteorite strike.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And a good unobstructed view now of that black spot.  That's the hole on the external hull.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A Russian cosmonaut who examined the hole--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Oh.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --believes it was drilled from inside the capsule.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Good to know. I'm learning a lot on this show, by the way--</p><p> STEYN: Yes. If you're a-</p><p> SHIMKUS: --for the very first time.</p><p> STEYN: --if you're a Russian cosmonaut, just plug that hole with the  picture of Vladimir Putin chestless in the hot tub, that'll - that'll take  care of it.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: OK. So, as a result, Kennedy's lost another point. It's now zero- zero.</p><p> SHIMKUS: The final load (ph).</p><p> STEYN: So, this is Sudden Death.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT: SUDDEN DEATH.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Sudden Death.</p><p> SHIMKUS: This is the lowest scoring game--</p><p> STEYN: The Final - this is the lowest scoring game in the history of this  show. Final question.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Maybe we've been dipping into the New Year's champagne early--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: --Mark.</p><p> STEYN: Too much Wassail and Figgy pudding. Final question. Another multiple  choice, listen carefully.</p><p> SHIMKUS: OK.</p><p> STEYN: There is a viral video of a Colorado woman chasing down a thief who  had stolen her Christmas packages from her front door. Now, there's a  special name given to people who steal in this way. Is it A, a porch  pirate, B, a parcel poacher, or C, a package snatcher?</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> STEYN: And--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p> STEYN: --Carley. Oh, can we have a round of applause for this? Carley  succeeded in actually hitting the buzzer.</p><p> SHIMKUS: I didn't (ph).</p><p> STEYN: We didn't even know hers worked but maybe (ph)--</p><p> SHIMKUS: If I win this way (ph), it is a win I do not deserve.</p><p> STEYN: Oh, OK. Let's - let's see what--</p><p> SHIMKUS: I am going with A, porch pirate.</p><p> STEYN: Porch pirate. Roll tape.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The scourge of the holiday season. Those pesky porch  pirates intent on ruining Christmas. But one woman in Lakewood, Colorado--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Oh.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --has decided to take matters into her own hands.</p><p> RENEE ABEYTA, COLORADO HOMEOWNER: I looked at my Ring videos and I saw what  happened.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Renee Abeyta confronting the brazen pirate--</p><p> ABEYTA: Hey.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --who made her way through the neighborhood with her  stolen booty.</p><p> ABEYTA: Hey.</p><p> I thought no way is this happening to me.</p><p> Give it. I'm going to (BEEP) call the police.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh, yes.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ABEYTA: I got you on camera (BEEP). Give me (BEEP) thing now.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Wow. What assault (ph) the pirate herself?</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ABEYTA: I'm - I'm chasing you.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Leave me alone, lady. I didn't take anything.</p><p> ABEYTA: Yes, you did. I saw you. Throw it down.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: All right (ph).</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ABEYTA: And I would have ran for as many miles as I had to, to get my  package.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Good for her.</p><p> STEYN: Yes. Keira Knightley didn't talk like that in Porch Pirates of the  Caribbean.</p><p> SHIMKUS: No.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: No.</p><p> STEYN: That is and we have an amazing - this is a humiliation for Kennedy.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Wise turnaround (ph).</p><p> SHIMKUS: This is - this, this I don't deserve it.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: I feel like--</p><p> SHIMKUS: I don't.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: --Hillary Clinton on Election Night.</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: My victory was a sure thing, Mark.</p><p> STEYN: Right.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Kennedy did all the heavy-lifting. And I just--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: I won the popular vote here. Everyone knows it.</p><p> STEYN: No, you won - you won at your (ph) hand, it's hitting that buzzer.  Carley just hit it - hits it once and takes the trophy.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Can I - can I say? Thank you so much.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: I believe that mug really should go to Kennedy.</p><p> STEYN: No, come on. I can't stand this good sportsmanship. Here you - here  you go. There is your Tucker Carlson mug (ph)--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Right, so (ph).</p><p> STEYN: --the mug.</p><p> SHIMKUS: We'll share.</p><p> STEYN: You'll see these ladies in this time on Monday. That's all for this  week's Final Exam. Pay attention to the news each week and tune in on  Thursdays to see if you can do better than one-buzz Carley. </p><p> Tucker will be here next, right after the break.</p><p> SHIMKUS: No, I didn't--</p><p> STEYN: Like (ph)--</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> STEYN: Tucker recently sat down to interview the Author of a new book on  the crisis afflicting American men. Here's what happened.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT: MEN IN AMERICA.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TUCKER CARLSON- HOST: If you look at the numbers, you quickly conclude that  men are in crisis in America. Compared to women, they are far more likely  to drop out of school, fail to graduate, go to jail, not hold a job, commit  suicide, die of a drug overdose. </p><p> And yet, the establishment, and particularly, Democratic establishment  seems uninterested in all of this. And they think - they appear to think  that men are still too successful and need to be held back.</p><p> Andrew Yarrow is a former New York Times reporter, a Senior Fellow with the  Progressive Policy Institute. He just wrote an important new book called,  Man Out: Men on the Sidelines of American Life. He joins us tonight in  studio.</p><p> Mr. Yarrow - Yarrow, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p> ANDREW YARROW, FORMER NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER, PROGRESSIVE POLICY INSTITUTE  SENIOR FELLOW, MAN OUT AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker, it's a pleasure--</p><p> CARLSON: So, I should, perhaps if I'm (ph) saying--</p><p> YARROW: --yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --I don't think you're a conservative activist, and that I'm also  grateful that someone is saying this because the numbers support that it's  true.</p><p> YARROW: It is true. And, as you say, the problem has really largely been  ignored. I mean Democrats and a lot of people in the country don't see men  as having problems. But there are a lot of men who are struggling,  struggling with work, struggling in families, struggling with health, lot  of areas I touch on in my book.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, to such a great extent that it would seem a crisis that  affects everybody because, of course, men and women need each other to  reproduce on the most basic level, but also every - everybody has a father  or brother, sons--</p><p> YARROW: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --why do you think it's been ignored?</p><p> YARROW: Well, there's been a lot of political correctness in this country  that's kind of made the main narrative be that, you know, women are the  oppressed ones. And they have been historically--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> YARROW: --oppressed. But, you know, that doesn't mean that there aren't a  lot of men struggling. I mean you don't - it's not a zero-sum game.</p><p> CARLSON: You're right.</p><p> YARROW: And--</p><p> CARLSON: But it's been presented as one that one sex succeeds only when  another moves backward. Where'd that assumption come from?</p><p> YARROW: Well, I think a lot of politics looks at things that way. And I  think it's - it's pretty unfortunate. But I think, you know, men have not  been, in many ways, good at advocating for themselves.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> YARROW: I mean it's been interesting in the last few elections. A lot of  the political activists have been women. I mean you hear more from women  these days. I mean men aren't good at forming groups--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> YARROW: --anymore.</p><p> CARLSON: So, you work at - at the Progressive Policy Institute. You're a  Fellow there. That's not the Heritage Foundation.</p><p> YARROW: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: I think it's fair to say you probably work in a mostly Liberal  world.</p><p> YARROW: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: What kind of reaction did your piece get among people you know?</p><p> YARROW: Well, it's interesting. Conservative media have tended to like it  more. It's, you know, it's kind of troubling that this should be a  bipartisan issue. </p><p> I mean all Americans should be doing well or should have the opportunity to  do well. And they should also have justice behind them. I mean men are  being accused wrongly. I mean there are a lot of awful things that men do.  Don't get me wrong but--</p><p> CARLSON: Well sure.</p><p> YARROW: --but, you know, the lack of due process in some of these sexual  assault allegations, it's, you know, it's pretty troubling. </p><p> CARLSON: It's just interesting because the most progressive President the  country's ever had, FDR, four terms, the first thing he did after getting  elected in 1932, the very first piece through the Congress was the CCC, the  Civilian Conservation Corps, which was--</p><p> YARROW: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --aimed at young men, just men between--</p><p> YARROW: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --18 and 25 or something like that--</p><p> YARROW: Right</p><p> CARLSON: --getting them back to work and restoring their vitality through  work. What would happen if a Democrat in the modern era suggested something  like that?</p><p> YARROW: Well, you think it would play well. You know, while the  unemployment statistics look good, there are a lot of men who've either  been pushed out of the labor force or dropped out. I mean they're about 17  - 18 percent of 25 to 64 year old men, who aren't working. </p><p> And, you know, there are a lot of men - younger men, who are neither in  school or working. So, you know, why is that? And, you know, why can't we  create better jobs for them? And yes, I mean you'd think a Democrat would  pitch some kind of jobs program.</p><p> CARLSON: I think I mean this is a longer conversation but I think the  answer is toxic masculinity.</p><p> YARROW: Yes, I mean the--</p><p> CARLSON: Whatever that means.</p><p> YARROW: Well, yes. I mean that's become the phrase du jour, I guess. I mean  there are clearly issues with masculinity. You know, I interviewed a lot of  men and some women around the country, about 200. And a lot of men told me,  a lot of, you know, even Liberal men said, \"Well feminism's done a lot for  women. But what's it done for me?\"</p><p> CARLSON: Well that's a - that's a fair question. And you ask it in this  book. Thank you for doing that.</p><p> YARROW: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Great to talk to you.</p><p> YARROW: Good to talk to you.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: That's one of the biggest stories of our time, so is this one.</p><p> Big tech has become the greatest threat to Americans' privacy and personal  freedoms. But now, Americans seem to be wising up to that. A new survey  finds that Americans trust Facebook less than any other company. Also, a  growing number of Americans seeking treatment for tech addiction as they  find themselves unable to look away from social media, their smartphones or  video games.</p><p> Tom Kersting is a family therapist and the Author of Disconnected: How to  Reconnect Our Digitally Distracted Kids. I've read that book, and so should  you. And he joins us now.</p><p> Just to go with the Tucker, the big story of our time thing, when you look  at this so-called tech addiction, and you follow where that leads, you -  you do worry that in some ways these rinky-dinky little things that started  as cat video sites somehow basically re-wiring humanity.</p><p> TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: They are. I mean if we  looked out the back window right now and - and counted how many people were  walking by staring at their phones, you'd probably have 70 percent of them  doing that. </p><p> And when it comes to addiction which, obviously, I've studied in my  background, basically if anything, whether it's gambling, alcohol, drugs,  anything that's considered addictive its - if it's affecting one of the  following four, you could be diagnosed as - as an addict.</p><p> And the four things are, is it affecting your family, is it affecting your  health, is it affecting your job or your occupation, and is it affecting  have you had any legal issues?</p><p> STEYN: Right.</p><p> KERSTING: And when we look at technology, we could check off each one of  those for many, many people. So, therefore, this whole addictive whether  it's a debate or not, I'm all about, I believe in a 100 percent.</p><p> STEYN: The - the difference being though that it's actually being kind of  organized on a global scale with--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --billions and billions of people. And when you look at children,  like middle-schoolers--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes, yes.</p><p> STEYN: --who've never known anything but this world, their behavior does  seem to be not where middle-schoolers were--</p><p> KERSTING: It's--</p><p> STEYN: --20, 50, 70 years ago.</p><p> KERSTING: --it's actually unbelievable. I tell people I - I - I get more  middle-school age kids with major anxiety disorders per year now--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --in my private practice than I did the previous 17 years  combined.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: And, you know, and you could - all the research that's done to  put - start to show that, starting to point to, you know, that the  absorption of social media, the lack of - of self, the lack of a sense of  self and so forth and how that's affecting the self-esteem and causing, you  know, issues with anxiety, depression, and other - other mental health -  health things.</p><p> STEYN: People do actually seem to prefer it though. You have a scene in  your book where you talk about when you were a young guy, just sitting at a  bar, you'd never know who's on the barstool next.</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: I can relate to that. Sometimes--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --you find yourself on the other side of the wall, you're sitting  next to an Australian, a Hungarian--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --you - you meet different people with different views. Now everyone  in the bar is just like--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --scrolling the phone.</p><p> KERSTING: When you go into the - the airport, if you travel, which, you  know--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --you do, I do. They have the screens in front of every barstool.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: So, like, you and I--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --instead of hanging out, talking with one another and--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --and kicking it off, now everybody's distracted by these  devices.</p><p> STEYN: Right. Sometimes--</p><p> KERSTING: So the--</p><p> STEYN: --you want to go where only Facebook knows--</p><p> KERSTING: --so - so it's like a - it's like--</p><p> STEYN: --you're in that area (ph).</p><p> KERSTING: --right. It's like bottles of wine dangling around if you're an  alcoholic--</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --24 hours a day, seven days a week, you can't escape from it.</p><p> STEYN: Yes. That's - that's a - that's a - a worrying thing. As I said, I  think this is one of the biggest stories of time, Tom. I dread (ph) to  think--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --where we're going to be if - if we're - if we don't change it. But  how do we change it?</p><p> KERSTING: Well we have - it's - it's not something that's going to happen  overnight. We just have to keep creating awareness, having conversations  like you and I are having right now, so that people could see this. They  can understand the ramifications of these things. I'm one of the guys out  there, you know, that's lecturing--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --that's writing about it and that's out there trying to get  other people to do the same. And it's - it's going to be a slow process but  I think we're going to have to get there.</p><p> STEYN: OK. Well we will - we will hold you to that Tom because something -  these companies are bigger than countries now. </p><p> That is about it for us tonight. You can tune in each night at 8:00 to the  show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink.  And don't forget to DVR the show. That's less harmful, less addictive than  if you just go on Facebook and look at it. Don't bother with that. Just DVR  the show, if you haven't set that up already.</p><p> Now, this is exciting moment in the evening. We are going to lift Nancy  Pelosi's beaded curtain and find out who is guest-hosting for Sean Hannity  tonight. Oh, who is it going to be? They've lifted the beaded curtain. I  think I can see--</p><p> JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR UTAH'S 3RD CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT  AND GOVERNMENT REFORM, COMMENTATOR: Oh, Mark.</p><p> STEYN: --Jason Kennedy filling in for Sean. Hey Jason--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p> STEYN: --oh, no, Jason Chaffetz. What--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Mark, thank you, great show.</p><p> STEYN: After all, hey by--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: I always love it when you're on with Tucker.</p><p> STEYN: No.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: I love it when you're on, so--</p><p> STEYN: Hey - hey, by--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: --thank you so much.</p><p> STEYN: --by the way, that was a terrific interview you did with Sam Johnson  today.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: And everyone should look at that. That was the best thing on TV this  morning.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Well--</p><p> STEYN: Terrific stuff.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Thank you. Thanks to Fox &amp; Friends. We have - actually later in  the show, we're going to go back and tell you about Sam Johnson, a special  man, an amazing personality and a true American hero, so thanks, Mark. We  appreciate it.</p><p> STEYN: Thanks a lot, Jason. Have a great show.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Mark Steyn in for Tucker. He's sleeping off his  Boxing Day Bacchanalia but he will join us later to discuss the ongoing  collapse of men in America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, yet another Liberal media meltdown. The mainstream media taking  the opportunity to turn a presidential visit to American troops into an  attack on Trump. Take a look at the hysteria as the talking heads accused  the President of turning the post-Christmas visit into a political event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY COMMENTATOR, CNN NATIONAL  SECURITY ANALYST: From a national security perspective, for all the reasons  that you just listed, the President should have stayed home.</p><p>JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, RETIRED MAJOR GENERAL, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: The  reason that he went now is that he couldn't go to Mar-a-Lago because the  government was shut down.</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN TONIGHT HOST, CNN: It was like we kept saying \"He's like the  Grinch.\" Instead of - I'm being honest.</p><p>CHARLES JOSEPH SCARBOROUGH, MORNING JOE CO-HOST, MSNBC: We should also be  concerned that Mr. Trump once again used a captive audience of American  heroes to push his unpopular domestic agenda.</p><p>Even in doing something right, he figures out a way to sow chaos.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It took far too long, especially compared to President  Obama who visited troops in Iraq in his first three months in office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STEYN: Over at CNN, attacking the President wasn't enough. They decided to  attack the troops as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBARA STARR, PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT, CNN: The pool reporters traveling  said that the troops brought the hats with them, including one hat that  said \"Trump 2020.\" We will have to see if that actually proves to be the  case. </p><p>The question is, if they - if they brought them or if the President brought  them, what commander allowed that to really happen, because this is very  much against military policy and regulation. Troops are not supposed to be  involved in political activities. The U.S. Military is not a political  force.</p><p>JOHN FRANCIS KIRBY, RETIRED UNITED STATES NAVY REAR ADMIRAL, FORMER  SPOKESPERSON FOR THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE: It's completely  inappropriate for the troops to do this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not supposed to--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Of course, nobody cared back when presidential candidate Barack  Obama signed memorabilia for the troops back in 2008. He had a D after his  name though instead of an R. Thankfully, not everybody's lost their minds.  Even some Liberals scolded the media for their hysteria.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID AXELROD, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, POLITICAL  CONSULTANT, ANALYST: It's - it's good that he went to see the troops,  important that he went to do it. He - he was criticized for it, obviously.  They wanted to address that. And so, I should - we should give him credit  where credit is due.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It just sends a - such a strong message that the - the  Trumps love our military, support our military, and what a great time to do  it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Well Joe Concha writes about Media for The Hill. He joins us now.  Joe, is this a good look for the media? Why are serving soldiers in a war  zone bringing particular hats to an event on base in a combat zone at  Christmas?</p><p>JOE CONCHA, THE HILL MEDIA REPORTER: Well the optics around that, Mark, are  horrific, right, because what you're doing here is it's - it's OK to go  after the President in terms of policy or the things that he says. </p><p>Once you start attacking the people that voted for him or military people  that are obviously serving overseas during Christmas, no less, then--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: --then you got a problem. And you have to ask yourself this  question, Mark. </p><p>Let's say, honestly, like you pointed out, as I did in my column today on  The Hill, if President Obama, as he did in 2008, signed a Hope and Change  t-shirts, do you really think any news organization would have gone ahead  with that story? Of course, they wouldn't have.</p><p>STEYN: No. I - I couldn't care less. Well what soldiers in these, frankly,  God-awful situations, because life in it - at a base in Iraq stinks. You -  it's not like being in Ramstein, Germany where the President was today. You  can't stroll down to town go to a local bar, meet one of the nice German  girls, or one of the local guy (ph), you know, that's nothing like that.</p><p>You're stuck in that lousy fortress that you hope is a fortress. And the  President comes to visit you. And the pre-occupation of the American media  is whether hats the troops chose to take to that event are somehow some  potential crime that they can be pulled up in front of a military court  for. I mean that's bonkers--</p><p>CONCHA: Yes, Mark, and--</p><p>STEYN: --isn't it?</p><p>CONCHA: --it's bonkers, yes. And I think that pivot happened because the  original narrative was, we - we'd all recall is that, President Trump was  supposed to be the first President since 2002 to not visit the troops at  Christmas. </p><p>And once that fell apart, when he literally landed in Iraq as the story was  going up and it originally came from NBC, then social media goes nuts. And  - and what happened was the pivot went from, \"Oh yes, OK. Trump went, sure,  but what was his motive exactly for going?\"</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CONCHA: I - I give you The Washington Post, Mark, quoting, the President's  visit follows months of public pressure for him to spend time with troops  deployed to conflicts in the Middle East. Think about that again, follows  months of public pressure.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: In other words, we, the media, got the public riled up to force  Trump to go to a war zone instead of him just going like every president  has done for the past 17 years.</p><p>STEYN: Well - well according to Soledad O'Brien, who's a lovely lady, but  she thought it was actually minutes of public pressure that Alyssa Milano  who - who actually tweeted as the President was halfway across the ocean,  why haven't you visited our troops, Soledad O - O'Brien actually gave  Alyssa Milano credit for shaming the President into getting on the plane  that he'd already gotten on.</p><p>CONCHA: Yes. And then what's forgotten in all this, of course, is if you  want to go to Walter Reed, let's say the President was shamed, and he goes  to Walter Reed, which is close to the White House, OK, then you could say  it's a last-minute thing. When you go to Iraq, you kind of have to plan it  in advance. You have to do it weeks in advance, obviously, for security.</p><p>Air Force One has to fly in with shades down and cellphones off and - and  all of that. So, you think you'd see though however, at least from NBC and  - and - and others, some remorse, some apology, some around, you know,  \"Hey, we went ahead with this story a little bit too early because we ran a  story on Christmas saying that the President hadn't been to see the troops  on Christmastime.\"</p><p>People don't mind that sort of transparency from the media. But yet, we  never see those sort of concessions. Instead, we see the pivots that are  negative like we always do in these situations. And that's why trust in  media is this. </p><p>Axios, SurveyMonkey poll just last year, 93 percent of Republicans think  that the media knowingly creates stories, makes them up, they're false. And  you say all right (ph), that's Republicans. They've always hated the media.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: They don't trust them. 79 percent of - of independents, Mark--</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>CONCHA: 53 percent of Democrats, even a majority, that's the thing. I mean  this is something that's going across the board--</p><p>STEYN: Sure (ph).</p><p>CONCHA: --in terms of all parties seeing exactly what's happening here,  sir.</p><p>STEYN: Hey Joe, thanks. Don't worry about that though. As soon as the media  call for a Special Counsel to investigate how those MAGA hats got to Iraq,  everything will be fine.</p><p>CONCHA: There you go (ph).</p><p>STEYN: Rochelle Ritchie is a former Press Secretary for the House  Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, and Rachel Campos-Duffy is  a Fox contributor, and they both join us.</p><p>Rochelle, how - stepping back and looking at this a little more objectively  than CNN &amp; Co. have done, is it really a good law - the troops liked the  guy. The guy got on with the troops. Is there really any political mileage  to be had in going on about this?</p><p>ROCHELLE RITCHIE, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY, HOUSE DEMOCRATIC POLICY AND  COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: So, I had a little bit of  a battle with myself about this. At first, I was saying, you know, no,  these men and women in uniform, they shouldn't have, you know, gotten their  hats signed. They shouldn't have been out there with Make America Great  Again hats.</p><p>And, you know, when you look at the facts, yes, it is a - it is breaking a  rule when it comes to the Department of Defense guidelines. But at the same  time, these troops have not seen an American President since 2009. I  believe Obama was the last one to - to go visit.</p><p>So, maybe they're not necessarily, you know, showing support for the  President or getting his signature because they are Republican--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, no, come on, who--</p><p>RITCHIE: --maybe - no, listen, listen--</p><p>STEYN: --no--</p><p>RITCHIE: --no, see, how can you disagree? I haven't even finished. </p><p>The Commander - it's their Commander-in-Chief. So, maybe it's not because  he's a Republican President. Maybe they're looking at it like he's the  Commander-in-Chief. We're proud to fight for our country or fight - we're  proud to stand behind our President--</p><p>STEYN: Let--</p><p>RITCHIE: --whether he has an R or a D behind his name. And, look, I could  really care less if the guys do it. As long as they're continuing to  protect our national security, have at it.</p><p>STEYN: Well Rochelle gave that theory rather more credit than I would  think, Rachel. I mean who the--</p><p>RITCHIE: I'm very balanced.</p><p>STEYN: --who the hell - if you have the misfortune to be spending Christmas  on one of those - those forts, cut off from life in the middle of the Iraqi  desert--</p><p>RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, AMERICAN TELEVISION PERSONALITY, FOX NEWS  CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.</p><p>STEYN: --who the hell cares what hat you take to a Christmas party  basically.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Of course, they shouldn't care. But I think the more  important question is why do - I mean - let's be honest. The reaction from  the troops was very overwhelmingly positive. And it should be. </p><p>Listen, Barack Obama decimated our military. Barack Obama--</p><p>RITCHIE: OK.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --wait a minute. He did. He cut funding for our military. He  put in rules of engagement that actually--</p><p>RITCHIE: But that's not even--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --caused - wait a minute that actually caused--</p><p>RITCHIE: But what does that have to do with--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --but let - let--</p><p>RITCHIE: --what we're talking about though with this Trump (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let - it does. It does have to do.</p><p>RITCHIE: --how?</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Because the - Barack Obama did all in - enacted rules of  engagement--</p><p>RITCHIE: I don't. It has nothing to do--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --Rochelle, let me finish. Rochelle--</p><p>RITCHIE: --OK. Go ahead, Rachel.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let me finish. He enacted rules of engagement that actually  put our military on the battlefield in danger--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --causing more battles (ph) but wait - wait a minute, Mark.  He did that.</p><p>RITCHIE: I'm sorry.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: And he went to the troops and they said he was a great  Commander-in-Chief. Donald Trump goes--</p><p>STEYN: Let me--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --over and does all this to not for Alyssa Milano or the  media - or the media. But he does it because he loves the troops. And they  say that he's doing it for a photo op.</p><p>STEYN: Oh--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: This is a man who loves the military.</p><p>STEYN: No, how (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was his number one issue.</p><p>RITCHIE: I - I--</p><p>STEYN: OK. How about this as a non-Democrat, non-Republican thing?  Democrats weren't in favor of the 21st Century Bush Wars, as they called  them.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right.</p><p>RITCHIE: Right.</p><p>STEYN: But nor was Donald - nor was Donald Trump in 2016.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: That's right.</p><p>STEYN: In - in a sense, Donald Trump is at odds with both Democrat policy  and Republican policy on the Middle East, Rochelle.</p><p>RITCHIE: Yes. He's definitely fighting both sides. And I think what - when  you talked about the press, I think the reason why the press is sort of  attacking on him, the - the Left-leaning press, I would say, is because of  some of the - the misleading comments that he made when he talked about the  pay raises for the military. We know that's not--</p><p>STEYN: Well they do - they did get the pay rises (ph).</p><p>RITCHIE: --necessarily true. They do get raises. But they're not getting a  10 percent raise. It's going to be, I think, 2.6 percent. So, I think there  are ways that the media was looking at it and attacking him for his less- than-knowledgeable education, I guess you could say, on what's really  happening--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: But (ph)--</p><p>RITCHIE: --there. But I don't I - I think that him visiting was a good  idea. I think there was an article by The Washington Post where it said  that he was actually scared to go over there for some time. So, I'm glad--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Ridiculous.</p><p>RITCHIE: --he got over that.</p><p>STEYN: That's a--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: He was not scared. And - and what would the media, you know,  betting MAGAs hats (ph) what would they have had him do? Say, \"Oh, I'm  sorry. I'm not going to sign your hat because of the Hatch Act,\" and then  they--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --would have criticized him and said--</p><p>RITCHIE: Well--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --\"Hey, what a jerk. He wouldn't sign a hat.\"</p><p>STEYN: By the way there's too much--</p><p>RITCHIE: I just - I just said I thought that was perfectly fine.</p><p>STEYN: --there's too much of that. The minute you--</p><p>RITCHIE: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --if you're seriously talking about soldiers doing something wrong  because they asked their Commander-in-Chief to sign a hat, then - then  you've flown the coop. That's not a land of law and things (ph)--</p><p>RITCHIE: I want to know (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It's - it's a bad look for the press. It's - the reason why  the American people hate the press and, by the way, the troops loved the  President because--</p><p>RITCHIE: Wait, wait, what is this? This is (ph) press--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --the troops love the President because he did sign a bill  that he took a lot of flack from the - from the Right for signing a big  bill that was--</p><p>RITCHIE: I think - I think--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --for funding the military.</p><p>RITCHIE: --I think that Trump's whole purpose--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: They love him.</p><p>RITCHIE: --of being there and - and this is - is - this is part of it, I  think that he also has a lot, I think, there was a - a part in this segment  right before you came to us about--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>RITCHIE: --this being public pressure. I think it's more political pressure  because of him, you know, General Kelly, then General Mattis, and so I  think that he's really trying to show that he has some sort of control of  what's happening right now in the middle in - in--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right. Why didn't - why didn't the--</p><p>STEYN: No, no, no, no--</p><p>RITCHIE: --Iraq. But then - but--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --why doesn't that criticism come to Barack Obama? He goes to  visit the troop, no one questions his motives.</p><p>RITCHIE: Well Obama is living his best life somewhere (ph).</p><p>STEYN: No, but it's a - that - you can't do--</p><p>RITCHIE: Can we leave him out of it?</p><p>STEYN: --those--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: But - but there is a double standard. And that is what people  are talking about, Rochelle.</p><p>STEYN: We got to - we got to go, ladies.</p><p>RITCHIE: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Iraq's a crazy place. You can't just plan those things with no  notice.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Absolutely, I agree (ph).</p><p>RITCHIE: No, you can't.</p><p>STEYN: Rochelle and Rachel will carry--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was Alyssa Milano.</p><p>STEYN: --this - this ones (ph) and they're going to take this to the green  room - where now - this is worse than the Sunni Triangle, the violence  that's like (ph) percolating it.</p><p>We're now on day six of the government shutdown triggered by Congress'  refusal to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. </p><p>Today, the President tweeted, \"Have the Democrats finally realized that we  desperately need border security and a wall on the Southern border?

President Trump has returned to the White House after visiting U.S.  forces yesterday in Iraq.</p><p>He's just tweeted, \"This isn't about the wall. Everybody knows that a wall  will work perfectly. In Israel, the wall works 99.9 percent. This is only  about the Dems not letting Donald Trump and the Republicans have a win.  They may have the 10 Senate votes. But we have the issue, border security.  2020.\"</p><p>In a statement, White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders says,  \"The President and his team in Washington over Christmas hoping to  negotiate a deal that would stop the dangerous crisis on the border,  protect American communities, and re-open the government, the Democrats  decided to go home.\"</p><p>She also says the Administration offered Democrats what she calls a  reasonable common-sense solution five days ago, though a spokesperson for  House Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, says, \"Democrats have offered  Republicans three options to re-open the government that all include  funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security, but not the  President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall.\"</p><p>While in Iraq, President Trump stressed the funding bill must include money  for a border wall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J.

Police in California are on the hunt for an  unnamed illegal immigrant, suspected of murdering a police officer.

ICE has been overwhelmed by asylum requests and  shackled by court rulings, and it's now releasing hundreds of migrants onto  the streets of El Paso.</p><p>The message to future migrants, of course, is that America is powerless to  stop them from settling here. Fox's Jonathan Hunt is here with more.  Jonathan?</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, CHIEF CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, says the immigration system  is at breaking point. Border Patrol agents say they're overwhelmed. Around  1,000 immigrants have been released onto the streets of El Paso, Texas this  week alone. </p><p>And two young immigrant children have died after being taken into custody  by Customs and Border Protection agents, the first deaths of children in  CBP custody for a decade.</p><p>In El Paso, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say they have  little choice but to release those hundreds of immigrants because of,  quote, decades of inaction by Congress that they say has limited their  ability to remove families who are in the U.S. illegally, and has set  limits on how long they can hold those families.</p><p>So, they're being dropped off at a bus station in El Paso, where aid groups  are offering support. More, by the way, are expected to be released today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DYLAN CORBETT, DIRECTOR, HOPE BORDER INSTITUTE (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): They  have spent eight to 10 days in cells. Now they've been released. What we've  been doing as a community is to support them, giving them food, a place for  them to stay at night.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT: President Trump has repeatedly said the era of so-called catch and  release has ended. But frankly, that is exactly what is happening in Texas  right now. And it all comes against the backdrop of the government shutdown  over President Trump's demand for a Border wall that he says could stem the  flow of illegal immigration.</p><p>The wall and, of course, the deaths of those two immigrant children will no  doubt top the agenda when Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen visits the  Border area in El Paso, Texas, Friday, and Yuma, Arizona, Saturday. </p><p>Mark?</p><p>STEYN: Just - just to be clear on that, Jonathan, ICE can hold these people  if that chap is right for - for 10 days or whatever. And then meanwhile  they're given a two-year court date. So, in the gap between the 10 days and  the two years, they just get to hang out in America? That's - that's the  idea of it (ph)?</p><p>HUNT: Right. Well what - what ICE is saying is that under the current laws,  they have no choice but to release these immigrants after that time frame.  And, therefore, they take them to the bus station and then, yes,  essentially they are free to go where they wish to do as they please, Mark.</p><p>STEYN: Well that seems a bit of a design flaw, Jonathan.</p><p>While - while migrants continue to pour into the United States, critics of  the President maintain that nothing can be done because a wall's useless.  CNN's Brian Karem recently ranted about the futility of mankind's oldest  defensive mechanism.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN KAREM, JOURNALIST, PLAYBOY'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, CNN  POLITICAL  ANALYST, FORMER EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY SENTINEL: This  whole issue is a crock from start to finish. He picked it up on the  campaign trail as something to appease the masses and play to his base. </p><p>It's not going to stop terrorism. It's not going to be 2,000 miles long, as  originally planned. It's not going to be see-through. It's not going to be  eco- friendly. It's not going to be slats or heads on pikes or a beaded  curtain or anything else. You can't wall that border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Jimmy Kimmel, meanwhile, has been ridiculing, Americans were so  desperate for a secure border they've been willing to donate to a GoFundMe  campaign for it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!: This - this  Trump supporter, guy named Brian Kolfage, started a GoFundMe campaign to  raise a billion dollars for the wall.

People - this is what people do with their  disposable income when they don't have loans from college to pay off.</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: Donating money for a wall that will never exist. It - it's like  starting a college fund for Harry Potter.</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: It's a - it's a - a more useful thing to do with your money would  be to go outside and feed it to a bird. But--</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: --you do have to admire the sacrifice they're making. I mean lot of  these people are dipping into their meth money for this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Got it. Meth heads for national security. Thank you, Jimmy. So,  would a wall work or not?</p><p>Jason Piccolo is a former Special Agent and Supervisor with the Department  of Homeland Security, and he joins us now. </p><p>Everybody's mocking this. We've had Nancy Pelosi doing her beaded curtain  line. At this stage, I would welcome a 2,000 mile beaded curtain along the  Southern border. It would show a certain kind of resolve. But are these  critics right that this thing doesn't work, doesn't make any difference,  complete waste of time?</p><p>JASON PICCOLO, FORMER ICE SUPERVISOR, OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM VETERAN: No,  it'll work. Now the border is 2,000 miles long. And you won't be able to  actually wall the whole border. But that'll create chokepoints or - or  points where we could actually apprehend the immigrants coming in.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, well--</p><p>PICCOLO: So, yes, a wall would work.</p><p>STEYN: --yes. What's interesting to me is that if you look at up on the  Northern border, where there's far fewer people coming across, there's not  caravans massing on the 49th parallel, and yet, the United States  government has actually put physical barricades in a lot of cross border  towns on the Canadian border, presumably because it works there. </p><p>So, why would it not work on the Mexican border?</p><p>PICCOLO: Walls work. They do. Now, when I worked on a border, the border  was simply a strand of fence in some areas like a strand of wire. Now, you  have narco-traffickers coming across that same area. You have economic  migrants, it's just it's open. The whole border is pretty much open except  for, you know, few miles here and there.</p><p>STEYN: When - when you say it's open, because most - most people who cross  international frontiers legitimately will do so at big border posts. </p><p>But you're saying that even though we talk about this incessantly, there  are actually 100-mile stretches where people can actually just walk into  the United States, a country that's supposedly been on Orange Alert for 17  years.</p><p>PICCOLO: Yes, definitely. Now, I was on the DHS' human smuggling cell back  in 2015. And we tracked human smuggling corridors coming up from South  America. </p><p>Now, you do have Special Interest Aliens transiting into South America,  into Brazil, and traveling up those same routes that the economic migrants  and the narco-traffickers are using. So there--</p><p>STEYN: So--</p><p>PICCOLO: --anybody can come and go through that border.</p><p>STEYN: So you mean - you mean, when you say Special Interest Aliens, you -  you mean that potential jihadists have figured out. They - they look at  what's on their TV screens on the Rio Grande, and figure that instead of  trying to fly to JFK, you might as well just go to Latin America and walk  into the country.</p><p>PICCOLO: You can. The border's open. Now, I detailed out in Ajo, Arizona at  one time back in the early 2000s. And it was literally one strand of barbed  wire. So, yes, you could - anybody could walk across that border when the  various (ph) intent are with coming here for economic migration.</p><p>STEYN: A strand of barbed wire. That seems even more useless than the  beaded curtain. Jason, thank you for that. And thank you for the eyewitness  testimony on that Southern border. I'm not sure people actually visualize  it quite the way you know it.</p><p>Coming up, Tucker's going to be here to discuss the declining fortunes of  American men. And Paris is still coping with riots after the government  tried to levy a carbon tax. So, why do lawmakers want a carbon tax here?  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STEYN: It was another chaotic day on Wall Street today. Yesterday, the Dow  Jones average had its largest single-day gain in history. Today, the  average went on another downward streak falling by 600 points. </p><p>But in the afternoon, the market rallied surging almost 900 points to  finish the day up by 258 points. The market is still down about 2,500  points this month in what's been a very tumultuous end to the year. It's  like these algorithms just fell face-down in the eggnog.</p><p>The French have been rioting for more than a month now after Emmanuel  Macron's government tried to impose an anti-global warming gas tax upon  them. Nevertheless, a lot of Americans, including the outgoing Senator Jeff  Flake, think it's time for America to have its own carbon tax. Is that  wise?</p><p>Mark Reynolds is Executive Director of the Citizens Climate Lobby, and he  joins us. Mark, when you see what's happening in France, that's a more  extreme version of what happens when carbon taxes are actually put into  place elsewhere. People don't seem to like it, don't seem to care for it.</p><p>MARK REYNOLDS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CITIZENS CLIMATE LOBBY: First of all,  thank you so much for having me on the show. The nice thing about the  Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is that it actually puts money in  people's pockets. So, I think that there's people who are suffering both  here and in other countries. </p><p>And I think that the reason that there's so much Republicans' support -  support on both the House and the Senate version of this bill is it  actually sends, allocates money back to households, so that they are  prepared to deal with whatever they have to.</p><p>And again--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --it doesn't tell them what to do with that money, just lets them  make a choice about whatever they want to do with it.</p><p>STEYN: Well let me tell - this is the bill that's being proposed in - the  carbon tax is being proposed in the United States, which under the proposal  supposedly then gives money back to households. But here's one big problem  with it, Mark.</p><p>Basically, the automatic increases kick in, I think, starting around 2022,  and they basically go all the way up until mid-century. So, and it's beyond  the control of other congresses. It just becomes like an entitlement  program that gets automatic increases every year and is beyond the control.</p><p>You can't go to a polling station if you don't like it, if the facts  change, if the circumstances change. It essentially puts the carbon tax  beyond democratic - democratic accountability, doesn't it?</p><p>REYNOLDS: Well Representative Francis Rooney, who's the lead Republican  sponsor from Florida says that he likes this bill because it's market- based. It actually lets the market determine how we get to the new energy  economy. </p><p>I think that's a lot of what Mr. Fitzpatrick, one of the Republicans on the  bill also said is, is, you know, you put a fee on carbon-based emissions,  you give the money back to households so that the government doesn't pick  what to do with it. You don't pick winners and losers. It'll be up for you  to--</p><p>STEYN: What about--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --to you and I to determine what we do with a dividend. But it'll  be actually a free-market bill--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --and that's what the Republicans on the bill said they like  about it so much.</p><p>STEYN: What do you make of the CEI, the Competitive Enterprise Institute's  objection to it that it will actually kill America's new energy  independence, which is a phenomenon in the last few years, what we see with  fracking and so forth, and means we're no longer dependent on malign Saudi  sheiks who use their oil riches to spread their Wahhabist ideology around  the world. </p><p>The CEI's view is that the carbon tax is going to kill American energy  independence.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. So, I think there's something really interesting happening  right now. There's actually a race to the new energy economy. And it's  probably going to be either us or China. China is making a huge investment  in renewable energy. And I heard - certainly hope it's us.</p><p>So, what I think that this bill does is creates enough incentive throughout  the entire--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --economic system to create all the type of--</p><p>STEYN: --wait, wait.</p><p>REYNOLDS: --innovation that we know we need.</p><p>STEYN: But there's no carbon tax in China. The Yangtze is like the most  polluted river in the world the - with the - with what's coming down that  stream every day. It's nothing you'd want any of your kids to be gambling  and frolicking in.</p><p>So, they won't wait - what - what the French - the - the French protesters  object to is that this is their lives. It's not a theory. It's not a  macroeconomic theory. If it's a choice between sea levels in Tuvalu in the  22nd Century or how they have to live their lives in the century they're  actually living in, they'll prioritize the reality of their lives over  speculation a century hence.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. I think that that's why so many Republicans like this bill  in both the House and Senate is because money's actually returned. You get  a monthly check and then it's your choice what you do with it. </p><p>I'm not going to tell you what to do with the money. The government's not  going to tell you what to - what to do with the money. It's going to be up  to American households to determine what to do.</p><p>STEYN: And - and you believe - and you believe that's good at - because  everything you - they always say that and then it goes into the General  Fund. The gas - gasoline taxes, they were supposed to be about it and they  all go into it (ph). Well we'll - we'll see how it works out. I don't see  the public appetite for it. </p><p>But, Mark, thank you for - thank you for talking with us today. And happy  post--</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. And thank you for - thank you for having me on. And let me  just say to the people who are watching, there is one of our chapters in  every community out there from Boise, Idaho, to Birmingham, Alabama. If you  want to work with people on solutions, we have a big tent, and we would  love to see you in your neighborhood.</p><p>STEYN: OK. Big tents we like. And we won't heat them with conventional  energy sources.</p><p>REYNOLDS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Thank you for that, Mark. Happy post-Boxing Day to you. </p><p>It's time for Tucker's Final Exam. Have you been following the news over  the Christmas period? Find out if you can remember it better than the big- time professionals here at Fox. That's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: FINAL EXAM.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Oh, you know what that music means. It's time for Tucker's Final  Exam where the news professionals are interrogated, see if they can  actually remember the events they cover every day. </p><p>This week's Final Exam is a New York Special. We have Kennedy, the last  non-guest host in the building. And also - and also with us, from FOX News  Headlines 24/7, Carley Shimkus.</p><p>And actually, speaking of guest hosting, Carley will actually be in this  slot on Monday night. But for some reason we're going to stick her outside- -</p><p>LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, KENNEDY HOST, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: --for the duration of the show. And then Kennedy will follow Carley.  So, this is the Fox New Year's Eve team. You'll--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Right.</p><p>STEYN: --you'll get a heads-up on ahead. Stay ahead of (ph)--</p><p>CARLEY SHIMKUS, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 REPORTER: We're going to have lot  of fun.</p><p>STEYN: --tuning in. OK, contestants, hands on buzzers. I'm going to ask the  questions. And the first one to buzz in gets to answer. But you must wait  until I finish asking. </p><p>You can answer once and I shall acknowledge you, according to rules set by  the International Quiz Show Committee in Geneva, by saying your name.  Correct answer's worth one point. Get it wrong, you lose a point. Best of  five wins. </p><p>Let's get started. Question one, an outgoing Democrat Senator just blasted  newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling her a shiny new object with cheap  rhetoric. Which lawmaker made those remarks?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: And it's Kennedy.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Claire McCaskill.</p><p>STEYN: Claire McCaskill. Let's roll that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLAIRE CONNER MCCASKILL, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MISSOURI: I don't  know her. I'm - I'm a little confused why she's the thing. But it's a good  example of what I'm talking about, a bright and shiny new object.</p><p>The rhetoric is cheap. Getting results is a lot harder.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Meow. Saucer of--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --milk for Senator McCaskill.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Don't let the door hit you where the Lord split you, Senator  McCaskill.</p><p>STEYN: So, that's first blood to Kennedy. One-Zip as we head into question  two.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: OK.</p><p>STEYN: This is critical for Carley. Otherwise she - she'll be losing that  New Year's Eve gig. Question--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: --question two. Former First Lady, Michelle Obama, is now the most  admired woman in all of America. That's according to a new Gallup poll. But  to get them, Michelle Obama had to bump another woman who'd held on to the  top spot for 17 years.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: Who was the other woman?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I know it (ph).</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: Oh. And it's Kennedy again.</p><p>SHIMKUS: It was just a guess from me anyway.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Hillary Clinton.</p><p>STEYN: Oh, come on. Hillary Clinton, the most admired woman in America? The  17 - are you kidding me? Let's roll that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Michelle Obama has overtaken Hillary Clinton as the  most admired woman in the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Good job. Oh, man. I'm getting cleaned (ph).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Clinton held that top spot on that list for 17 years.  What does that say about Hillary now?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Me too (ph).</p><p>SHIMKUS: You know what? I thought it - I - I wanted to say Oprah because--</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>SHIMKUS: --I thought - I feel like that - were truly is one of the most  admired women in America. But I think Hillary is now third and--</p><p>STEYN: No, yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: --Molly (ph) is in second or something like that.</p><p>STEYN: Oprah - Oprah is number two. But it's a tragedy--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --for Hillary. She was once the most admired--</p><p>SHIMKUS: She lost again.</p><p>STEYN: --woman in America and--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I blame the Latvian bot farm and misogyny.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Even though there are other women on the list, so--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Of course.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: --very misogynistic that she got the heave-ho.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>SHIMKUS: We are clearly on that list as well, four and five.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. Macedonian content farmers fixed that thing right (ph). It's  Two-Zip to Kennedy. This is--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: --come on, come on Carley.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I just want one point.</p><p>STEYN: Come on, you don't want to be outside on New Year's Eve.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't.</p><p>STEYN: This - we'll give you - we'll give you a studio if you can turn this  thing around.</p><p>SHIMKUS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Question three. We recently told you about a popular calendar in  Russia, which features various images of a shirtless Vladimir Putin. That  same calendar is now a monster hit in another country and is outselling  ones featuring puny homegrown celebrities. Which country is it?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND) </p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p>STEYN: No, no. No. And this is (ph) - Kennedy.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: United States.</p><p>STEYN: Chest-less (ph) Putin in the United States?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Let's see.</p><p>STEYN: Doesn't sound likely.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm blushing.

The popularity of the calendars is reportedly fueled by a surge in  self-proclaimed Putin fans. Get them while they're hot, ladies. Putin--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: While they're hot.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. There's nothing a Japanese lady likes than--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Putin and a fish (ph).</p><p>STEYN: --being in a hot tub with a KGB torturer. Kennedy, disastrous move  there. She's lost one point.</p><p>SHIMKUS: It's all right.</p><p>STEYN: So there's still everything to play for. It's Two-Zero. </p><p>Question four, multiple choice.</p><p>SHIMKUS: One-zero.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Isn't it two-ones?</p><p>STEYN: Oh, no, one - one-zero.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: One-zero. Yes, Carley--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh, I lost a point?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I thought - I thought I kept it and then--</p><p>STEYN: No, no, you - you lost it.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: --I thought I kept the other two (ph)--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, the two points (ph)--</p><p>STEYN: You're in huge trouble now.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh, boy.</p><p>STEYN: Question four. This is a multiple choice question. There's a crisis  on the International Space Station. Something mysterious was found by  astronauts inside a capsule that recently docked there. And Russian  officials say it's the result of a major breach. What was it they found?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I would--</p><p>STEYN: A, a sharp knife, B, a tiny hole, or C, a jar of pickles.</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>STEYN: And it's the trigger-happy Kennedy yet again. What do you say,  Kennedy?</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Jar of pickles.</p><p>STEYN: Jar of pickles</p><p>SHIMKUS: I was going to go with A. But let's--</p><p>STEYN: Let's roll that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Matter of life and death. A tiny hole discovered in a  Russian capsule--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: We were both - we would have both been wrong.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --that docks to the International Space Station.</p><p>At first, scientists suspected the hole was caused by a meteorite strike.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And a good unobstructed view now of that black spot.

If you're a-</p><p>SHIMKUS: --for the very first time.</p><p>STEYN: --if you're a Russian cosmonaut, just plug that hole with the  picture of Vladimir Putin chestless in the hot tub, that'll - that'll take  care of it.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: OK. So, as a result, Kennedy's lost another point. It's now zero- zero.</p><p>SHIMKUS: The final load (ph).</p><p>STEYN: So, this is Sudden Death.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: SUDDEN DEATH.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Sudden Death.</p><p>SHIMKUS: This is the lowest scoring game--</p><p>STEYN: The Final - this is the lowest scoring game in the history of this  show.

Final question. Another multiple  choice, listen carefully.</p><p>SHIMKUS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: There is a viral video of a Colorado woman chasing down a thief who  had stolen her Christmas packages from her front door. Now, there's a  special name given to people who steal in this way. Is it A, a porch  pirate, B, a parcel poacher, or C, a package snatcher?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>STEYN: And--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: --Carley. Oh, can we have a round of applause for this? Carley  succeeded in actually hitting the buzzer.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I didn't (ph).</p><p>STEYN: We didn't even know hers worked but maybe (ph)--</p><p>SHIMKUS: If I win this way (ph), it is a win I do not deserve.</p><p>STEYN: Oh, OK. Let's - let's see what--</p><p>SHIMKUS: I am going with A, porch pirate.</p><p>STEYN: Porch pirate. Roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The scourge of the holiday season.

Here's what happened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: MEN IN AMERICA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON- HOST: If you look at the numbers, you quickly conclude that  men are in crisis in America. Compared to women, they are far more likely  to drop out of school, fail to graduate, go to jail, not hold a job, commit  suicide, die of a drug overdose. </p><p>And yet, the establishment, and particularly, Democratic establishment  seems uninterested in all of this. And they think - they appear to think  that men are still too successful and need to be held back.</p><p>Andrew Yarrow is a former New York Times reporter, a Senior Fellow with the  Progressive Policy Institute. He just wrote an important new book called,  Man Out: Men on the Sidelines of American Life. He joins us tonight in  studio.</p><p>Mr. Yarrow - Yarrow, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>ANDREW YARROW, FORMER NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER, PROGRESSIVE POLICY  INSTITUTE  SENIOR FELLOW, MAN OUT AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker, it's a pleasure--</p><p>CARLSON: So, I should, perhaps if I'm (ph) saying--</p><p>YARROW: --yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --I don't think you're a conservative activist, and that I'm also  grateful that someone is saying this because the numbers support that it's  true.</p><p>YARROW: It is true. And, as you say, the problem has really largely been  ignored. I mean Democrats and a lot of people in the country don't see men  as having problems. But there are a lot of men who are struggling,  struggling with work, struggling in families, struggling with health, lot  of areas I touch on in my book.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, to such a great extent that it would seem a crisis that  affects everybody because, of course, men and women need each other to  reproduce on the most basic level, but also every - everybody has a father  or brother, sons--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --why do you think it's been ignored?</p><p>YARROW: Well, there's been a lot of political correctness in this country  that's kind of made the main narrative be that, you know, women are the  oppressed ones. And they have been historically--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: --oppressed. But, you know, that doesn't mean that there aren't a  lot of men struggling. I mean you don't - it's not a zero-sum game.</p><p>CARLSON: You're right.</p><p>YARROW: And--</p><p>CARLSON: But it's been presented as one that one sex succeeds only when  another moves backward. Where'd that assumption come from?</p><p>YARROW: Well, I think a lot of politics looks at things that way. And I  think it's - it's pretty unfortunate. But I think, you know, men have not  been, in many ways, good at advocating for themselves.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: I mean it's been interesting in the last few elections. A lot of  the political activists have been women. I mean you hear more from women  these days. I mean men aren't good at forming groups--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: --anymore.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you work at - at the Progressive Policy Institute. You're a  Fellow there. That's not the Heritage Foundation.</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: I think it's fair to say you probably work in a mostly Liberal  world.</p><p>YARROW: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What kind of reaction did your piece get among people you know?</p><p>YARROW: Well, it's interesting. Conservative media have tended to like it  more. It's, you know, it's kind of troubling that this should be a  bipartisan issue. </p><p>I mean all Americans should be doing well or should have the opportunity to  do well. And they should also have justice behind them. I mean men are  being accused wrongly. I mean there are a lot of awful things that men do.  Don't get me wrong but--</p><p>CARLSON: Well sure.</p><p>YARROW: --but, you know, the lack of due process in some of these sexual  assault allegations, it's, you know, it's pretty troubling. </p><p>CARLSON: It's just interesting because the most progressive President the  country's ever had, FDR, four terms, the first thing he did after getting  elected in 1932, the very first piece through the Congress was the CCC, the  Civilian Conservation Corps, which was--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --aimed at young men, just men between--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --18 and 25 or something like that--</p><p>YARROW: Right</p><p>CARLSON: --getting them back to work and restoring their vitality through  work. What would happen if a Democrat in the modern era suggested something  like that?</p><p>YARROW: Well, you think it would play well. You know, while the  unemployment statistics look good, there are a lot of men who've either  been pushed out of the labor force or dropped out. I mean they're about 17  - 18 percent of 25 to 64 year old men, who aren't working. </p><p>And, you know, there are a lot of men - younger men, who are neither in  school or working. So, you know, why is that? And, you know, why can't we  create better jobs for them? And yes, I mean you'd think a Democrat would  pitch some kind of jobs program.</p><p>CARLSON: I think I mean this is a longer conversation but I think the  answer is toxic masculinity.</p><p>YARROW: Yes, I mean the--</p><p>CARLSON: Whatever that means.</p><p>YARROW: Well, yes. I mean that's become the phrase du jour, I guess. I mean  there are clearly issues with masculinity. You know, I interviewed a lot of  men and some women around the country, about 200. And a lot of men told me,  a lot of, you know, even Liberal men said, \"Well feminism's done a lot for  women. But what's it done for me?\"</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's a - that's a fair question. And you ask it in this  book. Thank you for doing that.</p><p>YARROW: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Great to talk to you.</p><p>YARROW: Good to talk to you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: That's one of the biggest stories of our time, so is this one.</p><p>Big tech has become the greatest threat to Americans' privacy and personal  freedoms. But now, Americans seem to be wising up to that. A new survey  finds that Americans trust Facebook less than any other company. Also, a  growing number of Americans seeking treatment for tech addiction as they  find themselves unable to look away from social media, their smartphones or  video games.</p><p>Tom Kersting is a family therapist and the Author of Disconnected: How to  Reconnect Our Digitally Distracted Kids. I've read that book, and so should  you. And he joins us now.</p><p>Just to go with the Tucker, the big story of our time thing, when you look  at this so-called tech addiction, and you follow where that leads, you -  you do worry that in some ways these rinky-dinky little things that started  as cat video sites somehow basically re-wiring humanity.</p><p>TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: They are. I mean if we  looked out the back window right now and - and counted how many people were  walking by staring at their phones, you'd probably have 70 percent of them  doing that. </p><p>And when it comes to addiction which, obviously, I've studied in my  background, basically if anything, whether it's gambling, alcohol, drugs,  anything that's considered addictive its - if it's affecting one of the  following four, you could be diagnosed as - as an addict.</p><p>And the four things are, is it affecting your family, is it affecting your  health, is it affecting your job or your occupation, and is it affecting  have you had any legal issues?</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>KERSTING: And when we look at technology, we could check off each one of  those for many, many people. So, therefore, this whole addictive whether  it's a debate or not, I'm all about, I believe in a 100 percent.</p><p>STEYN: The - the difference being though that it's actually being kind of  organized on a global scale with--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --billions and billions of people. And when you look at children,  like middle-schoolers--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes, yes.</p><p>STEYN: --who've never known anything but this world, their behavior does  seem to be not where middle-schoolers were--</p><p>KERSTING: It's--</p><p>STEYN: --20, 50, 70 years ago.</p><p>KERSTING: --it's actually unbelievable. I tell people I - I - I get more  middle-school age kids with major anxiety disorders per year now--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --in my private practice than I did the previous 17 years  combined.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: And, you know, and you could - all the research that's done to  put - start to show that, starting to point to, you know, that the  absorption of social media, the lack of - of self, the lack of a sense of  self and so forth and how that's affecting the self-esteem and causing, you  know, issues with anxiety, depression, and other - other mental health -  health things.</p><p>STEYN: People do actually seem to prefer it though. You have a scene in  your book where you talk about when you were a young guy, just sitting at a  bar, you'd never know who's on the barstool next.</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: I can relate to that. Sometimes--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --you find yourself on the other side of the wall, you're sitting  next to an Australian, a Hungarian--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --you - you meet different people with different views. Now everyone  in the bar is just like--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --scrolling the phone.</p><p>KERSTING: When you go into the - the airport, if you travel, which, you  know--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --you do, I do. They have the screens in front of every barstool.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: So, like, you and I--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --instead of hanging out, talking with one another and--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --and kicking it off, now everybody's distracted by these  devices.</p><p>STEYN: Right. Sometimes--</p><p>KERSTING: So the--</p><p>STEYN: --you want to go where only Facebook knows--</p><p>KERSTING: --so - so it's like a - it's like--</p><p>STEYN: --you're in that area (ph).</p><p>KERSTING: --right. It's like bottles of wine dangling around if you're an  alcoholic--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --24 hours a day, seven days a week, you can't escape from it.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. That's - that's a - that's a - a worrying thing. As I said, I  think this is one of the biggest stories of time, Tom. I dread (ph) to  think--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --where we're going to be if - if we're - if we don't change it. But  how do we change it?</p><p>KERSTING: Well we have - it's - it's not something that's going to happen  overnight. We just have to keep creating awareness, having conversations  like you and I are having right now, so that people could see this. They  can understand the ramifications of these things. I'm one of the guys out  there, you know, that's lecturing--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --that's writing about it and that's out there trying to get  other people to do the same. And it's - it's going to be a slow process but  I think we're going to have to get there.</p><p>STEYN: OK. Well we will - we will hold you to that Tom because something -  these companies are bigger than countries now. </p><p>That is about it for us tonight. You can tune in each night at 8:00 to the  show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink.  And don't forget to DVR the show. That's less harmful, less addictive than  if you just go on Facebook and look at it. Don't bother with that. Just DVR  the show, if you haven't set that up already.</p><p>Now, this is exciting moment in the evening. We are going to lift Nancy  Pelosi's beaded curtain and find out who is guest-hosting for Sean Hannity  tonight. Oh, who is it going to be? They've lifted the beaded curtain. I  think I can see--</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR UTAH'S 3RD CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE COMMITTEE ON  OVERSIGHT  AND GOVERNMENT REFORM, COMMENTATOR: Oh, Mark.</p><p>STEYN: --Jason Kennedy filling in for Sean. Hey Jason--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p>STEYN: --oh, no, Jason Chaffetz. What--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Mark, thank you, great show.</p><p>STEYN: After all, hey by--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I always love it when you're on with Tucker.</p><p>STEYN: No.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I love it when you're on, so--</p><p>STEYN: Hey - hey, by--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: --thank you so much.</p><p>STEYN: --by the way, that was a terrific interview you did with Sam Johnson  today.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: And everyone should look at that. That was the best thing on TV this  morning.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well--</p><p>STEYN: Terrific stuff.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you. Thanks to Fox &amp; Friends. We have - actually later in  the show, we're going to go back and tell you about Sam Johnson, a special  man, an amazing personality and a true American hero, so thanks, Mark. We  appreciate it.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Jason. Have a great show.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Mark Steyn in for Tucker. He's sleeping off his  Boxing Day Bacchanalia but he will join us later to discuss the ongoing  collapse of men in America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But first, yet another Liberal media meltdown. The mainstream media taking  the opportunity to turn a presidential visit to American troops into an  attack on Trump. Take a look at the hysteria as the talking heads accused  the President of turning the post-Christmas visit into a political event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY COMMENTATOR, CNN NATIONAL  SECURITY ANALYST: From a national security perspective, for all the reasons  that you just listed, the President should have stayed home.</p><p> JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, RETIRED MAJOR GENERAL, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: The  reason that he went now is that he couldn't go to Mar-a-Lago because the  government was shut down.</p><p> DON LEMON, CNN TONIGHT HOST, CNN: It was like we kept saying \"He's like the  Grinch.\" Instead of - I'm being honest.</p><p> CHARLES JOSEPH SCARBOROUGH, MORNING JOE CO-HOST, MSNBC: We should also be  concerned that Mr. Trump once again used a captive audience of American  heroes to push his unpopular domestic agenda.</p><p> Even in doing something right, he figures out a way to sow chaos.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It took far too long, especially compared to President  Obama who visited troops in Iraq in his first three months in office.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> STEYN: Over at CNN, attacking the President wasn't enough. They decided to  attack the troops as well.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARBARA STARR, PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT, CNN: The pool reporters traveling  said that the troops brought the hats with them, including one hat that  said \"Trump 2020.\" We will have to see if that actually proves to be the  case. </p><p> The question is, if they - if they brought them or if the President brought  them, what commander allowed that to really happen, because this is very  much against military policy and regulation. Troops are not supposed to be  involved in political activities. The U.S. Military is not a political  force.</p><p> JOHN FRANCIS KIRBY, RETIRED UNITED STATES NAVY REAR ADMIRAL, FORMER  SPOKESPERSON FOR THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE: It's completely  inappropriate for the troops to do this.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not supposed to--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Of course, nobody cared back when presidential candidate Barack  Obama signed memorabilia for the troops back in 2008. He had a D after his  name though instead of an R. Thankfully, not everybody's lost their minds.  Even some Liberals scolded the media for their hysteria.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DAVID AXELROD, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, POLITICAL  CONSULTANT, ANALYST: It's - it's good that he went to see the troops,  important that he went to do it. He - he was criticized for it, obviously.  They wanted to address that. And so, I should - we should give him credit  where credit is due.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It just sends a - such a strong message that the - the  Trumps love our military, support our military, and what a great time to do  it.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Well Joe Concha writes about Media for The Hill. He joins us now.  Joe, is this a good look for the media? Why are serving soldiers in a war  zone bringing particular hats to an event on base in a combat zone at  Christmas?</p><p> JOE CONCHA, THE HILL MEDIA REPORTER: Well the optics around that, Mark, are  horrific, right, because what you're doing here is it's - it's OK to go  after the President in terms of policy or the things that he says. </p><p> Once you start attacking the people that voted for him or military people  that are obviously serving overseas during Christmas, no less, then--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> CONCHA: --then you got a problem. And you have to ask yourself this  question, Mark. </p><p> Let's say, honestly, like you pointed out, as I did in my column today on  The Hill, if President Obama, as he did in 2008, signed a Hope and Change  t-shirts, do you really think any news organization would have gone ahead  with that story? Of course, they wouldn't have.</p><p> STEYN: No. I - I couldn't care less. Well what soldiers in these, frankly,  God-awful situations, because life in it - at a base in Iraq stinks. You -  it's not like being in Ramstein, Germany where the President was today. You  can't stroll down to town go to a local bar, meet one of the nice German  girls, or one of the local guy (ph), you know, that's nothing like that.</p><p> You're stuck in that lousy fortress that you hope is a fortress. And the  President comes to visit you. And the pre-occupation of the American media  is whether hats the troops chose to take to that event are somehow some  potential crime that they can be pulled up in front of a military court  for. I mean that's bonkers--</p><p> CONCHA: Yes, Mark, and--</p><p> STEYN: --isn't it?</p><p> CONCHA: --it's bonkers, yes. And I think that pivot happened because the  original narrative was, we - we'd all recall is that, President Trump was  supposed to be the first President since 2002 to not visit the troops at  Christmas. </p><p> And once that fell apart, when he literally landed in Iraq as the story was  going up and it originally came from NBC, then social media goes nuts. And  - and what happened was the pivot went from, \"Oh yes, OK. Trump went, sure,  but what was his motive exactly for going?\"</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> CONCHA: I - I give you The Washington Post, Mark, quoting, the President's  visit follows months of public pressure for him to spend time with troops  deployed to conflicts in the Middle East. Think about that again, follows  months of public pressure.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> CONCHA: In other words, we, the media, got the public riled up to force  Trump to go to a war zone instead of him just going like every president  has done for the past 17 years.</p><p> STEYN: Well - well according to Soledad O'Brien, who's a lovely lady, but  she thought it was actually minutes of public pressure that Alyssa Milano  who - who actually tweeted as the President was halfway across the ocean,  why haven't you visited our troops, Soledad O - O'Brien actually gave  Alyssa Milano credit for shaming the President into getting on the plane  that he'd already gotten on.</p><p> CONCHA: Yes. And then what's forgotten in all this, of course, is if you  want to go to Walter Reed, let's say the President was shamed, and he goes  to Walter Reed, which is close to the White House, OK, then you could say  it's a last-minute thing. When you go to Iraq, you kind of have to plan it  in advance. You have to do it weeks in advance, obviously, for security.</p><p> Air Force One has to fly in with shades down and cellphones off and - and  all of that. So, you think you'd see though however, at least from NBC and  - and - and others, some remorse, some apology, some around, you know,  \"Hey, we went ahead with this story a little bit too early because we ran a  story on Christmas saying that the President hadn't been to see the troops  on Christmastime.\"</p><p> People don't mind that sort of transparency from the media. But yet, we  never see those sort of concessions. Instead, we see the pivots that are  negative like we always do in these situations. And that's why trust in  media is this. </p><p> Axios, SurveyMonkey poll just last year, 93 percent of Republicans think  that the media knowingly creates stories, makes them up, they're false. And  you say all right (ph), that's Republicans. They've always hated the media.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> CONCHA: They don't trust them. 79 percent of - of independents, Mark--</p><p> STEYN: Right.</p><p> CONCHA: 53 percent of Democrats, even a majority, that's the thing. I mean  this is something that's going across the board--</p><p> STEYN: Sure (ph).</p><p> CONCHA: --in terms of all parties seeing exactly what's happening here,  sir.</p><p> STEYN: Hey Joe, thanks. Don't worry about that though. As soon as the media  call for a Special Counsel to investigate how those MAGA hats got to Iraq,  everything will be fine.</p><p> CONCHA: There you go (ph).</p><p> STEYN: Rochelle Ritchie is a former Press Secretary for the House  Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, and Rachel Campos-Duffy is  a Fox contributor, and they both join us.</p><p> Rochelle, how - stepping back and looking at this a little more objectively  than CNN &amp; Co. have done, is it really a good law - the troops liked the  guy. The guy got on with the troops. Is there really any political mileage  to be had in going on about this?</p><p> ROCHELLE RITCHIE, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY, HOUSE DEMOCRATIC POLICY AND  COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: So, I had a little bit of  a battle with myself about this. At first, I was saying, you know, no,  these men and women in uniform, they shouldn't have, you know, gotten their  hats signed. They shouldn't have been out there with Make America Great  Again hats.</p><p> And, you know, when you look at the facts, yes, it is a - it is breaking a  rule when it comes to the Department of Defense guidelines. But at the same  time, these troops have not seen an American President since 2009. I  believe Obama was the last one to - to go visit.</p><p> So, maybe they're not necessarily, you know, showing support for the  President or getting his signature because they are Republican--</p><p> STEYN: Yes, no, come on, who--</p><p> RITCHIE: --maybe - no, listen, listen--</p><p> STEYN: --no--</p><p> RITCHIE: --no, see, how can you disagree? I haven't even finished. </p><p> The Commander - it's their Commander-in-Chief. So, maybe it's not because  he's a Republican President. Maybe they're looking at it like he's the  Commander-in-Chief. We're proud to fight for our country or fight - we're  proud to stand behind our President--</p><p> STEYN: Let--</p><p> RITCHIE: --whether he has an R or a D behind his name. And, look, I could  really care less if the guys do it. As long as they're continuing to  protect our national security, have at it.</p><p> STEYN: Well Rochelle gave that theory rather more credit than I would  think, Rachel. I mean who the--</p><p> RITCHIE: I'm very balanced.</p><p> STEYN: --who the hell - if you have the misfortune to be spending Christmas  on one of those - those forts, cut off from life in the middle of the Iraqi  desert--</p><p> RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, AMERICAN TELEVISION PERSONALITY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.</p><p> STEYN: --who the hell cares what hat you take to a Christmas party  basically.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Of course, they shouldn't care. But I think the more  important question is why do - I mean - let's be honest. The reaction from  the troops was very overwhelmingly positive. And it should be. </p><p> Listen, Barack Obama decimated our military. Barack Obama--</p><p> RITCHIE: OK.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --wait a minute. He did. He cut funding for our military. He  put in rules of engagement that actually--</p><p> RITCHIE: But that's not even--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --caused - wait a minute that actually caused--</p><p> RITCHIE: But what does that have to do with--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --but let - let--</p><p> RITCHIE: --what we're talking about though with this Trump (ph)--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let - it does. It does have to do.</p><p> RITCHIE: --how?</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Because the - Barack Obama did all in - enacted rules of  engagement--</p><p> RITCHIE: I don't. It has nothing to do--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --Rochelle, let me finish. Rochelle--</p><p> RITCHIE: --OK. Go ahead, Rachel.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let me finish. He enacted rules of engagement that actually  put our military on the battlefield in danger--</p><p> STEYN: Well--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --causing more battles (ph) but wait - wait a minute, Mark.  He did that.</p><p> RITCHIE: I'm sorry.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: And he went to the troops and they said he was a great  Commander-in-Chief. Donald Trump goes--</p><p> STEYN: Let me--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --over and does all this to not for Alyssa Milano or the  media - or the media. But he does it because he loves the troops. And they  say that he's doing it for a photo op.</p><p> STEYN: Oh--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: This is a man who loves the military.</p><p> STEYN: No, how (ph)--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was his number one issue.</p><p> RITCHIE: I - I--</p><p> STEYN: OK. How about this as a non-Democrat, non-Republican thing?  Democrats weren't in favor of the 21st Century Bush Wars, as they called  them.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right.</p><p> RITCHIE: Right.</p><p> STEYN: But nor was Donald - nor was Donald Trump in 2016.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: That's right.</p><p> STEYN: In - in a sense, Donald Trump is at odds with both Democrat policy  and Republican policy on the Middle East, Rochelle.</p><p> RITCHIE: Yes. He's definitely fighting both sides. And I think what - when  you talked about the press, I think the reason why the press is sort of  attacking on him, the - the Left-leaning press, I would say, is because of  some of the - the misleading comments that he made when he talked about the  pay raises for the military. We know that's not--</p><p> STEYN: Well they do - they did get the pay rises (ph).</p><p> RITCHIE: --necessarily true. They do get raises. But they're not getting a  10 percent raise. It's going to be, I think, 2.6 percent. So, I think there  are ways that the media was looking at it and attacking him for his less- than-knowledgeable education, I guess you could say, on what's really  happening--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: But (ph)--</p><p> RITCHIE: --there. But I don't I - I think that him visiting was a good  idea. I think there was an article by The Washington Post where it said  that he was actually scared to go over there for some time. So, I'm glad--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Ridiculous.</p><p> RITCHIE: --he got over that.</p><p> STEYN: That's a--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: He was not scared. And - and what would the media, you know,  betting MAGAs hats (ph) what would they have had him do? Say, \"Oh, I'm  sorry. I'm not going to sign your hat because of the Hatch Act,\" and then  they--</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --would have criticized him and said--</p><p> RITCHIE: Well--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --\"Hey, what a jerk. He wouldn't sign a hat.\"</p><p> STEYN: By the way there's too much--</p><p> RITCHIE: I just - I just said I thought that was perfectly fine.</p><p> STEYN: --there's too much of that. The minute you--</p><p> RITCHIE: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --if you're seriously talking about soldiers doing something wrong  because they asked their Commander-in-Chief to sign a hat, then - then  you've flown the coop. That's not a land of law and things (ph)--</p><p> RITCHIE: I want to know (ph)--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: It's - it's a bad look for the press. It's - the reason why  the American people hate the press and, by the way, the troops loved the  President because--</p><p> RITCHIE: Wait, wait, what is this? This is (ph) press--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --the troops love the President because he did sign a bill  that he took a lot of flack from the - from the Right for signing a big  bill that was--</p><p> RITCHIE: I think - I think--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --for funding the military.</p><p> RITCHIE: --I think that Trump's whole purpose--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: They love him.</p><p> RITCHIE: --of being there and - and this is - is - this is part of it, I  think that he also has a lot, I think, there was a - a part in this segment  right before you came to us about--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> RITCHIE: --this being public pressure. I think it's more political pressure  because of him, you know, General Kelly, then General Mattis, and so I  think that he's really trying to show that he has some sort of control of  what's happening right now in the middle in - in--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right. Why didn't - why didn't the--</p><p> STEYN: No, no, no, no--</p><p> RITCHIE: --Iraq. But then - but--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: --why doesn't that criticism come to Barack Obama? He goes to  visit the troop, no one questions his motives.</p><p> RITCHIE: Well Obama is living his best life somewhere (ph).</p><p> STEYN: No, but it's a - that - you can't do--</p><p> RITCHIE: Can we leave him out of it?</p><p> STEYN: --those--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: But - but there is a double standard. And that is what people  are talking about, Rochelle.</p><p> STEYN: We got to - we got to go, ladies.</p><p> RITCHIE: OK.</p><p> STEYN: Iraq's a crazy place. You can't just plan those things with no  notice.</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: Absolutely, I agree (ph).</p><p> RITCHIE: No, you can't.</p><p> STEYN: Rochelle and Rachel will carry--</p><p> CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was Alyssa Milano.</p><p> STEYN: --this - this ones (ph) and they're going to take this to the green  room - where now - this is worse than the Sunni Triangle, the violence  that's like (ph) percolating it.</p><p> We're now on day six of the government shutdown triggered by Congress'  refusal to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. </p><p> Today, the President tweeted, \"Have the Democrats finally realized that we  desperately need border security and a wall on the Southern border? We need  to stop drugs, human trafficking, gang members, and criminals from coming  into our country. And do the Dems realize that most of the people not  getting paid are Democrats?\"</p><p> Fox Washington Correspondent, Rich Edson, joins us with more on the  situation in D.C. It's all yours.</p><p> RICH EDSON, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p>Congress officially and briefly gaveled in this afternoon though there is  no sign of this shutdown ending anytime soon as Democrats in (ph) the White  House are a few billion dollars apart on funding for a wall on the Southern  border. President Trump has returned to the White House after visiting U.S.  forces yesterday in Iraq.</p><p> He's just tweeted, \"This isn't about the wall. Everybody knows that a wall  will work perfectly. In Israel, the wall works 99.9 percent. This is only  about the Dems not letting Donald Trump and the Republicans have a win.  They may have the 10 Senate votes. But we have the issue, border security.  2020.\"</p><p> In a statement, White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders says,  \"The President and his team in Washington over Christmas hoping to  negotiate a deal that would stop the dangerous crisis on the border,  protect American communities, and re-open the government, the Democrats  decided to go home.\"</p><p> She also says the Administration offered Democrats what she calls a  reasonable common-sense solution five days ago, though a spokesperson for  House Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, says, \"Democrats have offered  Republicans three options to re-open the government that all include  funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security, but not the  President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall.\"</p><p> While in Iraq, President Trump stressed the funding bill must include money  for a border wall.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The folks are saying, \"Can  we have some drones? Can we have technology?\" Technology is bells and  whistles. You have to have a wall. You have to have protection. </p><p> When you say, \"How long is it going to take?\" \"When are they going to say  that we need border security?\"</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EDSON: Pelosi's office says Democrats will pass their bill to open the  government after they take control of the House next week. Though to end  this shutdown, the House, the Senate, and the White House must all agree on  the same funding bill.</p><p> On Capitol Hill, House Freedom Caucus Chairman, Mark Meadows, says the  needle has moved towards a very long shutdown, as Democrats and Republicans  appear to talk past one another.</p><p> Mark?</p><p> STEYN: Thanks a lot, Rich.</p><p> This is a Fox News Alert. Police in California are on the hunt for an  unnamed illegal immigrant, suspected of murdering a police officer.  Corporal Ronil Singh, an immigrant from Fiji, was gunned down Wednesday  morning during a traffic stop. Police have released surveillance footage of  the suspect, and say they believe he is still in the area. We will continue  to monitor this breaking story. </p><p> And coming up, Tucker will be back with us to discuss the crisis of  American manhood. Plus, President Trump insists the government won't re- open until he has money for his wall. But if he gets it, will that wall  work? That's next on TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> STEYN: El Paso, Texas is turning into Exhibit A of America's broken  immigration system. ICE has been overwhelmed by asylum requests and  shackled by court rulings, and it's now releasing hundreds of migrants onto  the streets of El Paso.</p><p> The message to future migrants, of course, is that America is powerless to  stop them from settling here. Fox's Jonathan Hunt is here with more.  Jonathan?</p><p> JONATHAN HUNT, CHIEF CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p> Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, says the immigration system  is at breaking point. Border Patrol agents say they're overwhelmed. Around  1,000 immigrants have been released onto the streets of El Paso, Texas this  week alone. </p><p> And two young immigrant children have died after being taken into custody  by Customs and Border Protection agents, the first deaths of children in  CBP custody for a decade.</p><p> In El Paso, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say they have  little choice but to release those hundreds of immigrants because of,  quote, decades of inaction by Congress that they say has limited their  ability to remove families who are in the U.S. illegally, and has set  limits on how long they can hold those families.</p><p> So, they're being dropped off at a bus station in El Paso, where aid groups  are offering support. More, by the way, are expected to be released today.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DYLAN CORBETT, DIRECTOR, HOPE BORDER INSTITUTE (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): They  have spent eight to 10 days in cells. Now they've been released. What we've  been doing as a community is to support them, giving them food, a place for  them to stay at night.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> HUNT: President Trump has repeatedly said the era of so-called catch and  release has ended. But frankly, that is exactly what is happening in Texas  right now. And it all comes against the backdrop of the government shutdown  over President Trump's demand for a Border wall that he says could stem the  flow of illegal immigration.</p><p> The wall and, of course, the deaths of those two immigrant children will no  doubt top the agenda when Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen visits the  Border area in El Paso, Texas, Friday, and Yuma, Arizona, Saturday. </p><p> Mark?</p><p> STEYN: Just - just to be clear on that, Jonathan, ICE can hold these people  if that chap is right for - for 10 days or whatever. And then meanwhile  they're given a two-year court date. So, in the gap between the 10 days and  the two years, they just get to hang out in America? That's - that's the  idea of it (ph)?</p><p> HUNT: Right. Well what - what ICE is saying is that under the current laws,  they have no choice but to release these immigrants after that time frame.  And, therefore, they take them to the bus station and then, yes,  essentially they are free to go where they wish to do as they please, Mark.</p><p> STEYN: Well that seems a bit of a design flaw, Jonathan.</p><p> While - while migrants continue to pour into the United States, critics of  the President maintain that nothing can be done because a wall's useless.  CNN's Brian Karem recently ranted about the futility of mankind's oldest  defensive mechanism.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BRIAN KAREM, JOURNALIST, PLAYBOY'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, CNN POLITICAL  ANALYST, FORMER EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY SENTINEL: This  whole issue is a crock from start to finish. He picked it up on the  campaign trail as something to appease the masses and play to his base. </p><p> It's not going to stop terrorism. It's not going to be 2,000 miles long, as  originally planned. It's not going to be see-through. It's not going to be  eco- friendly. It's not going to be slats or heads on pikes or a beaded  curtain or anything else. You can't wall that border.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Jimmy Kimmel, meanwhile, has been ridiculing, Americans were so  desperate for a secure border they've been willing to donate to a GoFundMe  campaign for it.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!: This - this  Trump supporter, guy named Brian Kolfage, started a GoFundMe campaign to  raise a billion dollars for the wall. He launched it on Sunday. It's  already up to almost $9 million. People - this is what people do with their  disposable income when they don't have loans from college to pay off.</p><p> (CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p> KIMMEL: Donating money for a wall that will never exist. It - it's like  starting a college fund for Harry Potter.</p><p> (CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p> KIMMEL: It's a - it's a - a more useful thing to do with your money would  be to go outside and feed it to a bird. But--</p><p> (CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p> KIMMEL: --you do have to admire the sacrifice they're making. I mean lot of  these people are dipping into their meth money for this.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Got it. Meth heads for national security. Thank you, Jimmy. So,  would a wall work or not?</p><p> Jason Piccolo is a former Special Agent and Supervisor with the Department  of Homeland Security, and he joins us now. </p><p> Everybody's mocking this. We've had Nancy Pelosi doing her beaded curtain  line. At this stage, I would welcome a 2,000 mile beaded curtain along the  Southern border. It would show a certain kind of resolve. But are these  critics right that this thing doesn't work, doesn't make any difference,  complete waste of time?</p><p> JASON PICCOLO, FORMER ICE SUPERVISOR, OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM VETERAN: No,  it'll work. Now the border is 2,000 miles long. And you won't be able to  actually wall the whole border. But that'll create chokepoints or - or  points where we could actually apprehend the immigrants coming in.</p><p> STEYN: Yes, well--</p><p> PICCOLO: So, yes, a wall would work.</p><p> STEYN: --yes. What's interesting to me is that if you look at up on the  Northern border, where there's far fewer people coming across, there's not  caravans massing on the 49th parallel, and yet, the United States  government has actually put physical barricades in a lot of cross border  towns on the Canadian border, presumably because it works there. </p><p> So, why would it not work on the Mexican border?</p><p> PICCOLO: Walls work. They do. Now, when I worked on a border, the border  was simply a strand of fence in some areas like a strand of wire. Now, you  have narco-traffickers coming across that same area. You have economic  migrants, it's just it's open. The whole border is pretty much open except  for, you know, few miles here and there.</p><p> STEYN: When - when you say it's open, because most - most people who cross  international frontiers legitimately will do so at big border posts. </p><p> But you're saying that even though we talk about this incessantly, there  are actually 100-mile stretches where people can actually just walk into  the United States, a country that's supposedly been on Orange Alert for 17  years.</p><p> PICCOLO: Yes, definitely. Now, I was on the DHS' human smuggling cell back  in 2015. And we tracked human smuggling corridors coming up from South  America. </p><p> Now, you do have Special Interest Aliens transiting into South America,  into Brazil, and traveling up those same routes that the economic migrants  and the narco-traffickers are using. So there--</p><p> STEYN: So--</p><p> PICCOLO: --anybody can come and go through that border.</p><p> STEYN: So you mean - you mean, when you say Special Interest Aliens, you -  you mean that potential jihadists have figured out. They - they look at  what's on their TV screens on the Rio Grande, and figure that instead of  trying to fly to JFK, you might as well just go to Latin America and walk  into the country.</p><p> PICCOLO: You can. The border's open. Now, I detailed out in Ajo, Arizona at  one time back in the early 2000s. And it was literally one strand of barbed  wire. So, yes, you could - anybody could walk across that border when the  various (ph) intent are with coming here for economic migration.</p><p> STEYN: A strand of barbed wire. That seems even more useless than the  beaded curtain. Jason, thank you for that. And thank you for the eyewitness  testimony on that Southern border. I'm not sure people actually visualize  it quite the way you know it.</p><p> Coming up, Tucker's going to be here to discuss the declining fortunes of  American men. And Paris is still coping with riots after the government  tried to levy a carbon tax. So, why do lawmakers want a carbon tax here?  That's next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> STEYN: It was another chaotic day on Wall Street today. Yesterday, the Dow  Jones average had its largest single-day gain in history. Today, the  average went on another downward streak falling by 600 points. </p><p> But in the afternoon, the market rallied surging almost 900 points to  finish the day up by 258 points. The market is still down about 2,500  points this month in what's been a very tumultuous end to the year. It's  like these algorithms just fell face-down in the eggnog.</p><p> The French have been rioting for more than a month now after Emmanuel  Macron's government tried to impose an anti-global warming gas tax upon  them. Nevertheless, a lot of Americans, including the outgoing Senator Jeff  Flake, think it's time for America to have its own carbon tax. Is that  wise?</p><p> Mark Reynolds is Executive Director of the Citizens Climate Lobby, and he  joins us. Mark, when you see what's happening in France, that's a more  extreme version of what happens when carbon taxes are actually put into  place elsewhere. People don't seem to like it, don't seem to care for it.</p><p> MARK REYNOLDS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CITIZENS CLIMATE LOBBY: First of all,  thank you so much for having me on the show. The nice thing about the  Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is that it actually puts money in  people's pockets. So, I think that there's people who are suffering both  here and in other countries. </p><p> And I think that the reason that there's so much Republicans' support -  support on both the House and the Senate version of this bill is it  actually sends, allocates money back to households, so that they are  prepared to deal with whatever they have to.</p><p> And again--</p><p> STEYN: Well--</p><p> REYNOLDS: --it doesn't tell them what to do with that money, just lets them  make a choice about whatever they want to do with it.</p><p> STEYN: Well let me tell - this is the bill that's being proposed in - the  carbon tax is being proposed in the United States, which under the proposal  supposedly then gives money back to households. But here's one big problem  with it, Mark.</p><p> Basically, the automatic increases kick in, I think, starting around 2022,  and they basically go all the way up until mid-century. So, and it's beyond  the control of other congresses. It just becomes like an entitlement  program that gets automatic increases every year and is beyond the control.</p><p> You can't go to a polling station if you don't like it, if the facts  change, if the circumstances change. It essentially puts the carbon tax  beyond democratic - democratic accountability, doesn't it?</p><p> REYNOLDS: Well Representative Francis Rooney, who's the lead Republican  sponsor from Florida says that he likes this bill because it's market- based. It actually lets the market determine how we get to the new energy  economy. </p><p> I think that's a lot of what Mr. Fitzpatrick, one of the Republicans on the  bill also said is, is, you know, you put a fee on carbon-based emissions,  you give the money back to households so that the government doesn't pick  what to do with it. You don't pick winners and losers. It'll be up for you  to--</p><p> STEYN: What about--</p><p> REYNOLDS: --to you and I to determine what we do with a dividend. But it'll  be actually a free-market bill--</p><p> STEYN: Well--</p><p> REYNOLDS: --and that's what the Republicans on the bill said they like  about it so much.</p><p> STEYN: What do you make of the CEI, the Competitive Enterprise Institute's  objection to it that it will actually kill America's new energy  independence, which is a phenomenon in the last few years, what we see with  fracking and so forth, and means we're no longer dependent on malign Saudi  sheiks who use their oil riches to spread their Wahhabist ideology around  the world. </p><p> The CEI's view is that the carbon tax is going to kill American energy  independence.</p><p> REYNOLDS: Yes. So, I think there's something really interesting happening  right now. There's actually a race to the new energy economy. And it's  probably going to be either us or China. China is making a huge investment  in renewable energy. And I heard - certainly hope it's us.</p><p> So, what I think that this bill does is creates enough incentive throughout  the entire--</p><p> STEYN: Well--</p><p> REYNOLDS: --economic system to create all the type of--</p><p> STEYN: --wait, wait.</p><p> REYNOLDS: --innovation that we know we need.</p><p> STEYN: But there's no carbon tax in China. The Yangtze is like the most  polluted river in the world the - with the - with what's coming down that  stream every day. It's nothing you'd want any of your kids to be gambling  and frolicking in.</p><p> So, they won't wait - what - what the French - the - the French protesters  object to is that this is their lives. It's not a theory. It's not a  macroeconomic theory. If it's a choice between sea levels in Tuvalu in the  22nd Century or how they have to live their lives in the century they're  actually living in, they'll prioritize the reality of their lives over  speculation a century hence.</p><p> REYNOLDS: Yes. I think that that's why so many Republicans like this bill  in both the House and Senate is because money's actually returned. You get  a monthly check and then it's your choice what you do with it. </p><p> I'm not going to tell you what to do with the money. The government's not  going to tell you what to - what to do with the money. It's going to be up  to American households to determine what to do.</p><p> STEYN: And - and you believe - and you believe that's good at - because  everything you - they always say that and then it goes into the General  Fund. The gas - gasoline taxes, they were supposed to be about it and they  all go into it (ph). Well we'll - we'll see how it works out. I don't see  the public appetite for it. </p><p> But, Mark, thank you for - thank you for talking with us today. And happy  post--</p><p> REYNOLDS: Yes. And thank you for - thank you for having me on. And let me  just say to the people who are watching, there is one of our chapters in  every community out there from Boise, Idaho, to Birmingham, Alabama. If you  want to work with people on solutions, we have a big tent, and we would  love to see you in your neighborhood.</p><p> STEYN: OK. Big tents we like. And we won't heat them with conventional  energy sources.</p><p> REYNOLDS: OK.</p><p> STEYN: Thank you for that, Mark. Happy post-Boxing Day to you. </p><p> It's time for Tucker's Final Exam. Have you been following the news over  the Christmas period? Find out if you can remember it better than the big- time professionals here at Fox. That's up next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT: FINAL EXAM.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Oh, you know what that music means. It's time for Tucker's Final  Exam where the news professionals are interrogated, see if they can  actually remember the events they cover every day. </p><p> This week's Final Exam is a New York Special. We have Kennedy, the last  non-guest host in the building. And also - and also with us, from FOX News  Headlines 24/7, Carley Shimkus.</p><p> And actually, speaking of guest hosting, Carley will actually be in this  slot on Monday night. But for some reason we're going to stick her outside- -</p><p> LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, KENNEDY HOST, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Oh.</p><p> STEYN: --for the duration of the show. And then Kennedy will follow Carley.  So, this is the Fox New Year's Eve team. You'll--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Right.</p><p> STEYN: --you'll get a heads-up on ahead. Stay ahead of (ph)--</p><p> CARLEY SHIMKUS, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 REPORTER: We're going to have lot  of fun.</p><p> STEYN: --tuning in. OK, contestants, hands on buzzers. I'm going to ask the  questions. And the first one to buzz in gets to answer. But you must wait  until I finish asking. </p><p> You can answer once and I shall acknowledge you, according to rules set by  the International Quiz Show Committee in Geneva, by saying your name.  Correct answer's worth one point. Get it wrong, you lose a point. Best of  five wins. </p><p> Let's get started. Question one, an outgoing Democrat Senator just blasted  newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling her a shiny new object with cheap  rhetoric. Which lawmaker made those remarks?</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p> STEYN: And it's Kennedy.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Claire McCaskill.</p><p> STEYN: Claire McCaskill. Let's roll that tape.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CLAIRE CONNER MCCASKILL, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MISSOURI: I don't  know her. I'm - I'm a little confused why she's the thing. But it's a good  example of what I'm talking about, a bright and shiny new object.</p><p> The rhetoric is cheap. Getting results is a lot harder.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Meow. Saucer of--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --milk for Senator McCaskill.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Don't let the door hit you where the Lord split you, Senator  McCaskill.</p><p> STEYN: So, that's first blood to Kennedy. One-Zip as we head into question  two.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: OK.</p><p> STEYN: This is critical for Carley. Otherwise she - she'll be losing that  New Year's Eve gig. Question--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p> STEYN: --question two. Former First Lady, Michelle Obama, is now the most  admired woman in all of America. That's according to a new Gallup poll. But  to get them, Michelle Obama had to bump another woman who'd held on to the  top spot for 17 years.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p> STEYN: Who was the other woman?</p><p> SHIMKUS: I know it (ph).</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p> STEYN: Oh. And it's Kennedy again.</p><p> SHIMKUS: It was just a guess from me anyway.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Hillary Clinton.</p><p> STEYN: Oh, come on. Hillary Clinton, the most admired woman in America? The  17 - are you kidding me? Let's roll that tape.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Michelle Obama has overtaken Hillary Clinton as the  most admired woman in the country.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Good job. Oh, man. I'm getting cleaned (ph).</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Clinton held that top spot on that list for 17 years.  What does that say about Hillary now?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Me too (ph).</p><p> SHIMKUS: You know what? I thought it - I - I wanted to say Oprah because--</p><p> STEYN: Right.</p><p> SHIMKUS: --I thought - I feel like that - were truly is one of the most  admired women in America. But I think Hillary is now third and--</p><p> STEYN: No, yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: --Molly (ph) is in second or something like that.</p><p> STEYN: Oprah - Oprah is number two. But it's a tragedy--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --for Hillary. She was once the most admired--</p><p> SHIMKUS: She lost again.</p><p> STEYN: --woman in America and--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: I blame the Latvian bot farm and misogyny.</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Even though there are other women on the list, so--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Of course.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: --very misogynistic that she got the heave-ho.</p><p> STEYN: Yes, absolutely.</p><p> SHIMKUS: We are clearly on that list as well, four and five.</p><p> STEYN: Yes. Macedonian content farmers fixed that thing right (ph). It's  Two-Zip to Kennedy. This is--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p> STEYN: --come on, come on Carley.</p><p> SHIMKUS: I just want one point.</p><p> STEYN: Come on, you don't want to be outside on New Year's Eve.</p><p> SHIMKUS: I don't.</p><p> STEYN: This - we'll give you - we'll give you a studio if you can turn this  thing around.</p><p> SHIMKUS: OK.</p><p> STEYN: Question three. We recently told you about a popular calendar in  Russia, which features various images of a shirtless Vladimir Putin. That  same calendar is now a monster hit in another country and is outselling  ones featuring puny homegrown celebrities. Which country is it?</p><p> SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND) </p><p> SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p> STEYN: No, no. No. And this is (ph) - Kennedy.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: United States.</p><p> STEYN: Chest-less (ph) Putin in the United States?</p><p> SHIMKUS: Let's see.</p><p> STEYN: Doesn't sound likely.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm blushing. They're flying off the shelves in Japan--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: No.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --of all places.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Oh.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Oh.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A chain of Lifestyle stores indicates that the calendars  are their--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: I'll take a win by a loss.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --top-seller.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: The Russian President featured dipping into a hot tub  and posing with a fish.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Fell came there (ph)--</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Yes.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He's (ph) like 60 years old. Not looking too bad.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Wow.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And here he is cuddling a leopard, a very docile  leopard. The popularity of the calendars is reportedly fueled by a surge in  self-proclaimed Putin fans. Get them while they're hot, ladies. Putin--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: While they're hot.</p><p> STEYN: Yes. There's nothing a Japanese lady likes than--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Putin and a fish (ph).</p><p> STEYN: --being in a hot tub with a KGB torturer. Kennedy, disastrous move  there. She's lost one point.</p><p> SHIMKUS: It's all right.</p><p> STEYN: So there's still everything to play for. It's Two-Zero. </p><p> Question four, multiple choice.</p><p> SHIMKUS: One-zero.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Isn't it two-ones?</p><p> STEYN: Oh, no, one - one-zero.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: One-zero. Yes, Carley--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Oh, I lost a point?</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: I thought - I thought I kept it and then--</p><p> STEYN: No, no, you - you lost it.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: --I thought I kept the other two (ph)--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh, the two points (ph)--</p><p> STEYN: You're in huge trouble now.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Oh, boy.</p><p> STEYN: Question four. This is a multiple choice question. There's a crisis  on the International Space Station. Something mysterious was found by  astronauts inside a capsule that recently docked there. And Russian  officials say it's the result of a major breach. What was it they found?</p><p> SHIMKUS: I would--</p><p> STEYN: A, a sharp knife, B, a tiny hole, or C, a jar of pickles.</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> STEYN: And it's the trigger-happy Kennedy yet again. What do you say,  Kennedy?</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Jar of pickles.</p><p> STEYN: Jar of pickles</p><p> SHIMKUS: I was going to go with A. But let's--</p><p> STEYN: Let's roll that tape.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Matter of life and death. A tiny hole discovered in a  Russian capsule--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: We were both - we would have both been wrong.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --that docks to the International Space Station.</p><p> At first, scientists suspected the hole was caused by a meteorite strike.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And a good unobstructed view now of that black spot.  That's the hole on the external hull.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A Russian cosmonaut who examined the hole--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Oh.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --believes it was drilled from inside the capsule.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Good to know. I'm learning a lot on this show, by the way--</p><p> STEYN: Yes. If you're a-</p><p> SHIMKUS: --for the very first time.</p><p> STEYN: --if you're a Russian cosmonaut, just plug that hole with the  picture of Vladimir Putin chestless in the hot tub, that'll - that'll take  care of it.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: OK. So, as a result, Kennedy's lost another point. It's now zero- zero.</p><p> SHIMKUS: The final load (ph).</p><p> STEYN: So, this is Sudden Death.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT: SUDDEN DEATH.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: Sudden Death.</p><p> SHIMKUS: This is the lowest scoring game--</p><p> STEYN: The Final - this is the lowest scoring game in the history of this  show. Final question.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Maybe we've been dipping into the New Year's champagne early--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: --Mark.</p><p> STEYN: Too much Wassail and Figgy pudding. Final question. Another multiple  choice, listen carefully.</p><p> SHIMKUS: OK.</p><p> STEYN: There is a viral video of a Colorado woman chasing down a thief who  had stolen her Christmas packages from her front door. Now, there's a  special name given to people who steal in this way. Is it A, a porch  pirate, B, a parcel poacher, or C, a package snatcher?</p><p> (BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p> STEYN: And--</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p> STEYN: --Carley. Oh, can we have a round of applause for this? Carley  succeeded in actually hitting the buzzer.</p><p> SHIMKUS: I didn't (ph).</p><p> STEYN: We didn't even know hers worked but maybe (ph)--</p><p> SHIMKUS: If I win this way (ph), it is a win I do not deserve.</p><p> STEYN: Oh, OK. Let's - let's see what--</p><p> SHIMKUS: I am going with A, porch pirate.</p><p> STEYN: Porch pirate. Roll tape.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The scourge of the holiday season. Those pesky porch  pirates intent on ruining Christmas. But one woman in Lakewood, Colorado--</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Oh.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --has decided to take matters into her own hands.</p><p> RENEE ABEYTA, COLORADO HOMEOWNER: I looked at my Ring videos and I saw what  happened.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Renee Abeyta confronting the brazen pirate--</p><p> ABEYTA: Hey.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --who made her way through the neighborhood with her  stolen booty.</p><p> ABEYTA: Hey.</p><p> I thought no way is this happening to me.</p><p> Give it. I'm going to (BEEP) call the police.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Oh, yes.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ABEYTA: I got you on camera (BEEP). Give me (BEEP) thing now.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Wow. What assault (ph) the pirate herself?</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ABEYTA: I'm - I'm chasing you.</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Leave me alone, lady. I didn't take anything.</p><p> ABEYTA: Yes, you did. I saw you. Throw it down.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MONTGOMERY: All right (ph).</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> ABEYTA: And I would have ran for as many miles as I had to, to get my  package.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SHIMKUS: Good for her.</p><p> STEYN: Yes. Keira Knightley didn't talk like that in Porch Pirates of the  Caribbean.</p><p> SHIMKUS: No.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: No.</p><p> STEYN: That is and we have an amazing - this is a humiliation for Kennedy.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Wise turnaround (ph).</p><p> SHIMKUS: This is - this, this I don't deserve it.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: I feel like--</p><p> SHIMKUS: I don't.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: --Hillary Clinton on Election Night.</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> MONTGOMERY: My victory was a sure thing, Mark.</p><p> STEYN: Right.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Kennedy did all the heavy-lifting. And I just--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: I won the popular vote here. Everyone knows it.</p><p> STEYN: No, you won - you won at your (ph) hand, it's hitting that buzzer.  Carley just hit it - hits it once and takes the trophy.</p><p> SHIMKUS: Can I - can I say? Thank you so much.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> SHIMKUS: I believe that mug really should go to Kennedy.</p><p> STEYN: No, come on. I can't stand this good sportsmanship. Here you - here  you go. There is your Tucker Carlson mug (ph)--</p><p> MONTGOMERY: Right, so (ph).</p><p> STEYN: --the mug.</p><p> SHIMKUS: We'll share.</p><p> STEYN: You'll see these ladies in this time on Monday. That's all for this  week's Final Exam. Pay attention to the news each week and tune in on  Thursdays to see if you can do better than one-buzz Carley. </p><p> Tucker will be here next, right after the break.</p><p> SHIMKUS: No, I didn't--</p><p> STEYN: Like (ph)--</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> STEYN: Tucker recently sat down to interview the Author of a new book on  the crisis afflicting American men. Here's what happened.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT: MEN IN AMERICA.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TUCKER CARLSON- HOST: If you look at the numbers, you quickly conclude that  men are in crisis in America. Compared to women, they are far more likely  to drop out of school, fail to graduate, go to jail, not hold a job, commit  suicide, die of a drug overdose. </p><p> And yet, the establishment, and particularly, Democratic establishment  seems uninterested in all of this. And they think - they appear to think  that men are still too successful and need to be held back.</p><p> Andrew Yarrow is a former New York Times reporter, a Senior Fellow with the  Progressive Policy Institute. He just wrote an important new book called,  Man Out: Men on the Sidelines of American Life. He joins us tonight in  studio.</p><p> Mr. Yarrow - Yarrow, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p> ANDREW YARROW, FORMER NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER, PROGRESSIVE POLICY INSTITUTE  SENIOR FELLOW, MAN OUT AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker, it's a pleasure--</p><p> CARLSON: So, I should, perhaps if I'm (ph) saying--</p><p> YARROW: --yes.</p><p> CARLSON: --I don't think you're a conservative activist, and that I'm also  grateful that someone is saying this because the numbers support that it's  true.</p><p> YARROW: It is true. And, as you say, the problem has really largely been  ignored. I mean Democrats and a lot of people in the country don't see men  as having problems. But there are a lot of men who are struggling,  struggling with work, struggling in families, struggling with health, lot  of areas I touch on in my book.</p><p> CARLSON: Well, to such a great extent that it would seem a crisis that  affects everybody because, of course, men and women need each other to  reproduce on the most basic level, but also every - everybody has a father  or brother, sons--</p><p> YARROW: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --why do you think it's been ignored?</p><p> YARROW: Well, there's been a lot of political correctness in this country  that's kind of made the main narrative be that, you know, women are the  oppressed ones. And they have been historically--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> YARROW: --oppressed. But, you know, that doesn't mean that there aren't a  lot of men struggling. I mean you don't - it's not a zero-sum game.</p><p> CARLSON: You're right.</p><p> YARROW: And--</p><p> CARLSON: But it's been presented as one that one sex succeeds only when  another moves backward. Where'd that assumption come from?</p><p> YARROW: Well, I think a lot of politics looks at things that way. And I  think it's - it's pretty unfortunate. But I think, you know, men have not  been, in many ways, good at advocating for themselves.</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> YARROW: I mean it's been interesting in the last few elections. A lot of  the political activists have been women. I mean you hear more from women  these days. I mean men aren't good at forming groups--</p><p> CARLSON: Yes.</p><p> YARROW: --anymore.</p><p> CARLSON: So, you work at - at the Progressive Policy Institute. You're a  Fellow there. That's not the Heritage Foundation.</p><p> YARROW: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: I think it's fair to say you probably work in a mostly Liberal  world.</p><p> YARROW: Yes.</p><p> CARLSON: What kind of reaction did your piece get among people you know?</p><p> YARROW: Well, it's interesting. Conservative media have tended to like it  more. It's, you know, it's kind of troubling that this should be a  bipartisan issue. </p><p> I mean all Americans should be doing well or should have the opportunity to  do well. And they should also have justice behind them. I mean men are  being accused wrongly. I mean there are a lot of awful things that men do.  Don't get me wrong but--</p><p> CARLSON: Well sure.</p><p> YARROW: --but, you know, the lack of due process in some of these sexual  assault allegations, it's, you know, it's pretty troubling. </p><p> CARLSON: It's just interesting because the most progressive President the  country's ever had, FDR, four terms, the first thing he did after getting  elected in 1932, the very first piece through the Congress was the CCC, the  Civilian Conservation Corps, which was--</p><p> YARROW: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --aimed at young men, just men between--</p><p> YARROW: Right.</p><p> CARLSON: --18 and 25 or something like that--</p><p> YARROW: Right</p><p> CARLSON: --getting them back to work and restoring their vitality through  work. What would happen if a Democrat in the modern era suggested something  like that?</p><p> YARROW: Well, you think it would play well. You know, while the  unemployment statistics look good, there are a lot of men who've either  been pushed out of the labor force or dropped out. I mean they're about 17  - 18 percent of 25 to 64 year old men, who aren't working. </p><p> And, you know, there are a lot of men - younger men, who are neither in  school or working. So, you know, why is that? And, you know, why can't we  create better jobs for them? And yes, I mean you'd think a Democrat would  pitch some kind of jobs program.</p><p> CARLSON: I think I mean this is a longer conversation but I think the  answer is toxic masculinity.</p><p> YARROW: Yes, I mean the--</p><p> CARLSON: Whatever that means.</p><p> YARROW: Well, yes. I mean that's become the phrase du jour, I guess. I mean  there are clearly issues with masculinity. You know, I interviewed a lot of  men and some women around the country, about 200. And a lot of men told me,  a lot of, you know, even Liberal men said, \"Well feminism's done a lot for  women. But what's it done for me?\"</p><p> CARLSON: Well that's a - that's a fair question. And you ask it in this  book. Thank you for doing that.</p><p> YARROW: Thank you.</p><p> CARLSON: Great to talk to you.</p><p> YARROW: Good to talk to you.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> STEYN: That's one of the biggest stories of our time, so is this one.</p><p> Big tech has become the greatest threat to Americans' privacy and personal  freedoms. But now, Americans seem to be wising up to that. A new survey  finds that Americans trust Facebook less than any other company. Also, a  growing number of Americans seeking treatment for tech addiction as they  find themselves unable to look away from social media, their smartphones or  video games.</p><p> Tom Kersting is a family therapist and the Author of Disconnected: How to  Reconnect Our Digitally Distracted Kids. I've read that book, and so should  you. And he joins us now.</p><p> Just to go with the Tucker, the big story of our time thing, when you look  at this so-called tech addiction, and you follow where that leads, you -  you do worry that in some ways these rinky-dinky little things that started  as cat video sites somehow basically re-wiring humanity.</p><p> TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: They are. I mean if we  looked out the back window right now and - and counted how many people were  walking by staring at their phones, you'd probably have 70 percent of them  doing that. </p><p> And when it comes to addiction which, obviously, I've studied in my  background, basically if anything, whether it's gambling, alcohol, drugs,  anything that's considered addictive its - if it's affecting one of the  following four, you could be diagnosed as - as an addict.</p><p> And the four things are, is it affecting your family, is it affecting your  health, is it affecting your job or your occupation, and is it affecting  have you had any legal issues?</p><p> STEYN: Right.</p><p> KERSTING: And when we look at technology, we could check off each one of  those for many, many people. So, therefore, this whole addictive whether  it's a debate or not, I'm all about, I believe in a 100 percent.</p><p> STEYN: The - the difference being though that it's actually being kind of  organized on a global scale with--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --billions and billions of people. And when you look at children,  like middle-schoolers--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes, yes.</p><p> STEYN: --who've never known anything but this world, their behavior does  seem to be not where middle-schoolers were--</p><p> KERSTING: It's--</p><p> STEYN: --20, 50, 70 years ago.</p><p> KERSTING: --it's actually unbelievable. I tell people I - I - I get more  middle-school age kids with major anxiety disorders per year now--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --in my private practice than I did the previous 17 years  combined.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: And, you know, and you could - all the research that's done to  put - start to show that, starting to point to, you know, that the  absorption of social media, the lack of - of self, the lack of a sense of  self and so forth and how that's affecting the self-esteem and causing, you  know, issues with anxiety, depression, and other - other mental health -  health things.</p><p> STEYN: People do actually seem to prefer it though. You have a scene in  your book where you talk about when you were a young guy, just sitting at a  bar, you'd never know who's on the barstool next.</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: I can relate to that. Sometimes--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --you find yourself on the other side of the wall, you're sitting  next to an Australian, a Hungarian--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --you - you meet different people with different views. Now everyone  in the bar is just like--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --scrolling the phone.</p><p> KERSTING: When you go into the - the airport, if you travel, which, you  know--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --you do, I do. They have the screens in front of every barstool.</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: So, like, you and I--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --instead of hanging out, talking with one another and--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --and kicking it off, now everybody's distracted by these  devices.</p><p> STEYN: Right. Sometimes--</p><p> KERSTING: So the--</p><p> STEYN: --you want to go where only Facebook knows--</p><p> KERSTING: --so - so it's like a - it's like--</p><p> STEYN: --you're in that area (ph).</p><p> KERSTING: --right. It's like bottles of wine dangling around if you're an  alcoholic--</p><p> STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --24 hours a day, seven days a week, you can't escape from it.</p><p> STEYN: Yes. That's - that's a - that's a - a worrying thing. As I said, I  think this is one of the biggest stories of time, Tom. I dread (ph) to  think--</p><p> KERSTING: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: --where we're going to be if - if we're - if we don't change it. But  how do we change it?</p><p> KERSTING: Well we have - it's - it's not something that's going to happen  overnight. We just have to keep creating awareness, having conversations  like you and I are having right now, so that people could see this. They  can understand the ramifications of these things. I'm one of the guys out  there, you know, that's lecturing--</p><p> STEYN: Yes.</p><p> KERSTING: --that's writing about it and that's out there trying to get  other people to do the same. And it's - it's going to be a slow process but  I think we're going to have to get there.</p><p> STEYN: OK. Well we will - we will hold you to that Tom because something -  these companies are bigger than countries now. </p><p> That is about it for us tonight. You can tune in each night at 8:00 to the  show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink.  And don't forget to DVR the show. That's less harmful, less addictive than  if you just go on Facebook and look at it. Don't bother with that. Just DVR  the show, if you haven't set that up already.</p><p> Now, this is exciting moment in the evening. We are going to lift Nancy  Pelosi's beaded curtain and find out who is guest-hosting for Sean Hannity  tonight. Oh, who is it going to be? They've lifted the beaded curtain. I  think I can see--</p><p> JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR UTAH'S 3RD CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT  AND GOVERNMENT REFORM, COMMENTATOR: Oh, Mark.</p><p> STEYN: --Jason Kennedy filling in for Sean. Hey Jason--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p> STEYN: --oh, no, Jason Chaffetz. What--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Mark, thank you, great show.</p><p> STEYN: After all, hey by--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: I always love it when you're on with Tucker.</p><p> STEYN: No.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: I love it when you're on, so--</p><p> STEYN: Hey - hey, by--</p><p> CHAFFETZ: --thank you so much.</p><p> STEYN: --by the way, that was a terrific interview you did with Sam Johnson  today.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p> STEYN: And everyone should look at that. That was the best thing on TV this  morning.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Well--</p><p> STEYN: Terrific stuff.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Thank you. Thanks to Fox &amp; Friends. We have - actually later in  the show, we're going to go back and tell you about Sam Johnson, a special  man, an amazing personality and a true American hero, so thanks, Mark. We  appreciate it.</p><p> STEYN: Thanks a lot, Jason. Have a great show.</p><p> CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Mark Steyn in for Tucker. He's sleeping off his  Boxing Day Bacchanalia but he will join us later to discuss the ongoing  collapse of men in America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, yet another Liberal media meltdown. The mainstream media taking  the opportunity to turn a presidential visit to American troops into an  attack on Trump. Take a look at the hysteria as the talking heads accused  the President of turning the post-Christmas visit into a political event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY COMMENTATOR, CNN NATIONAL  SECURITY ANALYST: From a national security perspective, for all the reasons  that you just listed, the President should have stayed home.</p><p>JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, RETIRED MAJOR GENERAL, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: The  reason that he went now is that he couldn't go to Mar-a-Lago because the  government was shut down.</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN TONIGHT HOST, CNN: It was like we kept saying \"He's like the  Grinch.\" Instead of - I'm being honest.</p><p>CHARLES JOSEPH SCARBOROUGH, MORNING JOE CO-HOST, MSNBC: We should also be  concerned that Mr. Trump once again used a captive audience of American  heroes to push his unpopular domestic agenda.</p><p>Even in doing something right, he figures out a way to sow chaos.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It took far too long, especially compared to President  Obama who visited troops in Iraq in his first three months in office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STEYN: Over at CNN, attacking the President wasn't enough. They decided to  attack the troops as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBARA STARR, PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT, CNN: The pool reporters traveling  said that the troops brought the hats with them, including one hat that  said \"Trump 2020.\" We will have to see if that actually proves to be the  case. </p><p>The question is, if they - if they brought them or if the President brought  them, what commander allowed that to really happen, because this is very  much against military policy and regulation. Troops are not supposed to be  involved in political activities. The U.S. Military is not a political  force.</p><p>JOHN FRANCIS KIRBY, RETIRED UNITED STATES NAVY REAR ADMIRAL, FORMER  SPOKESPERSON FOR THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE: It's completely  inappropriate for the troops to do this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not supposed to--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Of course, nobody cared back when presidential candidate Barack  Obama signed memorabilia for the troops back in 2008. He had a D after his  name though instead of an R. Thankfully, not everybody's lost their minds.  Even some Liberals scolded the media for their hysteria.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID AXELROD, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, POLITICAL  CONSULTANT, ANALYST: It's - it's good that he went to see the troops,  important that he went to do it. He - he was criticized for it, obviously.  They wanted to address that. And so, I should - we should give him credit  where credit is due.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It just sends a - such a strong message that the - the  Trumps love our military, support our military, and what a great time to do  it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Well Joe Concha writes about Media for The Hill. He joins us now.  Joe, is this a good look for the media? Why are serving soldiers in a war  zone bringing particular hats to an event on base in a combat zone at  Christmas?</p><p>JOE CONCHA, THE HILL MEDIA REPORTER: Well the optics around that, Mark, are  horrific, right, because what you're doing here is it's - it's OK to go  after the President in terms of policy or the things that he says. </p><p>Once you start attacking the people that voted for him or military people  that are obviously serving overseas during Christmas, no less, then--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: --then you got a problem. And you have to ask yourself this  question, Mark. </p><p>Let's say, honestly, like you pointed out, as I did in my column today on  The Hill, if President Obama, as he did in 2008, signed a Hope and Change  t-shirts, do you really think any news organization would have gone ahead  with that story? Of course, they wouldn't have.</p><p>STEYN: No. I - I couldn't care less. Well what soldiers in these, frankly,  God-awful situations, because life in it - at a base in Iraq stinks. You -  it's not like being in Ramstein, Germany where the President was today. You  can't stroll down to town go to a local bar, meet one of the nice German  girls, or one of the local guy (ph), you know, that's nothing like that.</p><p>You're stuck in that lousy fortress that you hope is a fortress. And the  President comes to visit you. And the pre-occupation of the American media  is whether hats the troops chose to take to that event are somehow some  potential crime that they can be pulled up in front of a military court  for. I mean that's bonkers--</p><p>CONCHA: Yes, Mark, and--</p><p>STEYN: --isn't it?</p><p>CONCHA: --it's bonkers, yes. And I think that pivot happened because the  original narrative was, we - we'd all recall is that, President Trump was  supposed to be the first President since 2002 to not visit the troops at  Christmas. </p><p>And once that fell apart, when he literally landed in Iraq as the story was  going up and it originally came from NBC, then social media goes nuts. And  - and what happened was the pivot went from, \"Oh yes, OK. Trump went, sure,  but what was his motive exactly for going?\"</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CONCHA: I - I give you The Washington Post, Mark, quoting, the President's  visit follows months of public pressure for him to spend time with troops  deployed to conflicts in the Middle East. Think about that again, follows  months of public pressure.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: In other words, we, the media, got the public riled up to force  Trump to go to a war zone instead of him just going like every president  has done for the past 17 years.</p><p>STEYN: Well - well according to Soledad O'Brien, who's a lovely lady, but  she thought it was actually minutes of public pressure that Alyssa Milano  who - who actually tweeted as the President was halfway across the ocean,  why haven't you visited our troops, Soledad O - O'Brien actually gave  Alyssa Milano credit for shaming the President into getting on the plane  that he'd already gotten on.</p><p>CONCHA: Yes. And then what's forgotten in all this, of course, is if you  want to go to Walter Reed, let's say the President was shamed, and he goes  to Walter Reed, which is close to the White House, OK, then you could say  it's a last-minute thing. When you go to Iraq, you kind of have to plan it  in advance. You have to do it weeks in advance, obviously, for security.</p><p>Air Force One has to fly in with shades down and cellphones off and - and  all of that. So, you think you'd see though however, at least from NBC and  - and - and others, some remorse, some apology, some around, you know,  \"Hey, we went ahead with this story a little bit too early because we ran a  story on Christmas saying that the President hadn't been to see the troops  on Christmastime.\"</p><p>People don't mind that sort of transparency from the media. But yet, we  never see those sort of concessions. Instead, we see the pivots that are  negative like we always do in these situations. And that's why trust in  media is this. </p><p>Axios, SurveyMonkey poll just last year, 93 percent of Republicans think  that the media knowingly creates stories, makes them up, they're false. And  you say all right (ph), that's Republicans. They've always hated the media.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: They don't trust them. 79 percent of - of independents, Mark--</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>CONCHA: 53 percent of Democrats, even a majority, that's the thing. I mean  this is something that's going across the board--</p><p>STEYN: Sure (ph).</p><p>CONCHA: --in terms of all parties seeing exactly what's happening here,  sir.</p><p>STEYN: Hey Joe, thanks. Don't worry about that though. As soon as the media  call for a Special Counsel to investigate how those MAGA hats got to Iraq,  everything will be fine.</p><p>CONCHA: There you go (ph).</p><p>STEYN: Rochelle Ritchie is a former Press Secretary for the House  Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, and Rachel Campos-Duffy is  a Fox contributor, and they both join us.</p><p>Rochelle, how - stepping back and looking at this a little more objectively  than CNN &amp; Co. have done, is it really a good law - the troops liked the  guy. The guy got on with the troops. Is there really any political mileage  to be had in going on about this?</p><p>ROCHELLE RITCHIE, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY, HOUSE DEMOCRATIC POLICY AND  COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: So, I had a little bit of  a battle with myself about this. At first, I was saying, you know, no,  these men and women in uniform, they shouldn't have, you know, gotten their  hats signed. They shouldn't have been out there with Make America Great  Again hats.</p><p>And, you know, when you look at the facts, yes, it is a - it is breaking a  rule when it comes to the Department of Defense guidelines. But at the same  time, these troops have not seen an American President since 2009. I  believe Obama was the last one to - to go visit.</p><p>So, maybe they're not necessarily, you know, showing support for the  President or getting his signature because they are Republican--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, no, come on, who--</p><p>RITCHIE: --maybe - no, listen, listen--</p><p>STEYN: --no--</p><p>RITCHIE: --no, see, how can you disagree? I haven't even finished. </p><p>The Commander - it's their Commander-in-Chief. So, maybe it's not because  he's a Republican President. Maybe they're looking at it like he's the  Commander-in-Chief. We're proud to fight for our country or fight - we're  proud to stand behind our President--</p><p>STEYN: Let--</p><p>RITCHIE: --whether he has an R or a D behind his name. And, look, I could  really care less if the guys do it. As long as they're continuing to  protect our national security, have at it.</p><p>STEYN: Well Rochelle gave that theory rather more credit than I would  think, Rachel. I mean who the--</p><p>RITCHIE: I'm very balanced.</p><p>STEYN: --who the hell - if you have the misfortune to be spending Christmas  on one of those - those forts, cut off from life in the middle of the Iraqi  desert--</p><p>RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, AMERICAN TELEVISION PERSONALITY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.</p><p>STEYN: --who the hell cares what hat you take to a Christmas party  basically.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Of course, they shouldn't care. But I think the more  important question is why do - I mean - let's be honest. The reaction from  the troops was very overwhelmingly positive. And it should be. </p><p>Listen, Barack Obama decimated our military. Barack Obama--</p><p>RITCHIE: OK.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --wait a minute. He did. He cut funding for our military. He  put in rules of engagement that actually--</p><p>RITCHIE: But that's not even--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --caused - wait a minute that actually caused--</p><p>RITCHIE: But what does that have to do with--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --but let - let--</p><p>RITCHIE: --what we're talking about though with this Trump (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let - it does. It does have to do.</p><p>RITCHIE: --how?</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Because the - Barack Obama did all in - enacted rules of  engagement--</p><p>RITCHIE: I don't. It has nothing to do--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --Rochelle, let me finish. Rochelle--</p><p>RITCHIE: --OK. Go ahead, Rachel.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let me finish. He enacted rules of engagement that actually  put our military on the battlefield in danger--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --causing more battles (ph) but wait - wait a minute, Mark.  He did that.</p><p>RITCHIE: I'm sorry.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: And he went to the troops and they said he was a great  Commander-in-Chief. Donald Trump goes--</p><p>STEYN: Let me--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --over and does all this to not for Alyssa Milano or the  media - or the media. But he does it because he loves the troops. And they  say that he's doing it for a photo op.</p><p>STEYN: Oh--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: This is a man who loves the military.</p><p>STEYN: No, how (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was his number one issue.</p><p>RITCHIE: I - I--</p><p>STEYN: OK. How about this as a non-Democrat, non-Republican thing?  Democrats weren't in favor of the 21st Century Bush Wars, as they called  them.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right.</p><p>RITCHIE: Right.</p><p>STEYN: But nor was Donald - nor was Donald Trump in 2016.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: That's right.</p><p>STEYN: In - in a sense, Donald Trump is at odds with both Democrat policy  and Republican policy on the Middle East, Rochelle.</p><p>RITCHIE: Yes. He's definitely fighting both sides. And I think what - when  you talked about the press, I think the reason why the press is sort of  attacking on him, the - the Left-leaning press, I would say, is because of  some of the - the misleading comments that he made when he talked about the  pay raises for the military. We know that's not--</p><p>STEYN: Well they do - they did get the pay rises (ph).</p><p>RITCHIE: --necessarily true. They do get raises. But they're not getting a  10 percent raise. It's going to be, I think, 2.6 percent. So, I think there  are ways that the media was looking at it and attacking him for his less- than-knowledgeable education, I guess you could say, on what's really  happening--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: But (ph)--</p><p>RITCHIE: --there. But I don't I - I think that him visiting was a good  idea. I think there was an article by The Washington Post where it said  that he was actually scared to go over there for some time. So, I'm glad--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Ridiculous.</p><p>RITCHIE: --he got over that.</p><p>STEYN: That's a--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: He was not scared. And - and what would the media, you know,  betting MAGAs hats (ph) what would they have had him do? Say, \"Oh, I'm  sorry. I'm not going to sign your hat because of the Hatch Act,\" and then  they--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --would have criticized him and said--</p><p>RITCHIE: Well--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --\"Hey, what a jerk. He wouldn't sign a hat.\"</p><p>STEYN: By the way there's too much--</p><p>RITCHIE: I just - I just said I thought that was perfectly fine.</p><p>STEYN: --there's too much of that. The minute you--</p><p>RITCHIE: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --if you're seriously talking about soldiers doing something wrong  because they asked their Commander-in-Chief to sign a hat, then - then  you've flown the coop. That's not a land of law and things (ph)--</p><p>RITCHIE: I want to know (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It's - it's a bad look for the press. It's - the reason why  the American people hate the press and, by the way, the troops loved the  President because--</p><p>RITCHIE: Wait, wait, what is this? This is (ph) press--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --the troops love the President because he did sign a bill  that he took a lot of flack from the - from the Right for signing a big  bill that was--</p><p>RITCHIE: I think - I think--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --for funding the military.</p><p>RITCHIE: --I think that Trump's whole purpose--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: They love him.</p><p>RITCHIE: --of being there and - and this is - is - this is part of it, I  think that he also has a lot, I think, there was a - a part in this segment  right before you came to us about--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>RITCHIE: --this being public pressure. I think it's more political pressure  because of him, you know, General Kelly, then General Mattis, and so I  think that he's really trying to show that he has some sort of control of  what's happening right now in the middle in - in--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right. Why didn't - why didn't the--</p><p>STEYN: No, no, no, no--</p><p>RITCHIE: --Iraq. But then - but--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --why doesn't that criticism come to Barack Obama? He goes to  visit the troop, no one questions his motives.</p><p>RITCHIE: Well Obama is living his best life somewhere (ph).</p><p>STEYN: No, but it's a - that - you can't do--</p><p>RITCHIE: Can we leave him out of it?</p><p>STEYN: --those--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: But - but there is a double standard. And that is what people  are talking about, Rochelle.</p><p>STEYN: We got to - we got to go, ladies.</p><p>RITCHIE: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Iraq's a crazy place. You can't just plan those things with no  notice.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Absolutely, I agree (ph).</p><p>RITCHIE: No, you can't.</p><p>STEYN: Rochelle and Rachel will carry--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was Alyssa Milano.</p><p>STEYN: --this - this ones (ph) and they're going to take this to the green  room - where now - this is worse than the Sunni Triangle, the violence  that's like (ph) percolating it.</p><p>We're now on day six of the government shutdown triggered by Congress'  refusal to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. </p><p>Today, the President tweeted, \"Have the Democrats finally realized that we  desperately need border security and a wall on the Southern border? We need  to stop drugs, human trafficking, gang members, and criminals from coming  into our country. And do the Dems realize that most of the people not  getting paid are Democrats?\"</p><p>Fox Washington Correspondent, Rich Edson, joins us with more on the  situation in D.C. It's all yours.</p><p>RICH EDSON, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p>Congress officially and briefly gaveled in this afternoon though there is  no sign of this shutdown ending anytime soon as Democrats in (ph) the White  House are a few billion dollars apart on funding for a wall on the Southern  border. President Trump has returned to the White House after visiting U.S.  forces yesterday in Iraq.</p><p>He's just tweeted, \"This isn't about the wall. Everybody knows that a wall  will work perfectly. In Israel, the wall works 99.9 percent. This is only  about the Dems not letting Donald Trump and the Republicans have a win.  They may have the 10 Senate votes. But we have the issue, border security.  2020.\"</p><p>In a statement, White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders says,  \"The President and his team in Washington over Christmas hoping to  negotiate a deal that would stop the dangerous crisis on the border,  protect American communities, and re-open the government, the Democrats  decided to go home.\"</p><p>She also says the Administration offered Democrats what she calls a  reasonable common-sense solution five days ago, though a spokesperson for  House Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, says, \"Democrats have offered  Republicans three options to re-open the government that all include  funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security, but not the  President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall.\"</p><p>While in Iraq, President Trump stressed the funding bill must include money  for a border wall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J.

Police in California are on the hunt for an  unnamed illegal immigrant, suspected of murdering a police officer.

ICE has been overwhelmed by asylum requests and  shackled by court rulings, and it's now releasing hundreds of migrants onto  the streets of El Paso.</p><p>The message to future migrants, of course, is that America is powerless to  stop them from settling here. Fox's Jonathan Hunt is here with more.  Jonathan?</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, CHIEF CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, says the immigration system  is at breaking point. Border Patrol agents say they're overwhelmed. Around  1,000 immigrants have been released onto the streets of El Paso, Texas this  week alone. </p><p>And two young immigrant children have died after being taken into custody  by Customs and Border Protection agents, the first deaths of children in  CBP custody for a decade.</p><p>In El Paso, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say they have  little choice but to release those hundreds of immigrants because of,  quote, decades of inaction by Congress that they say has limited their  ability to remove families who are in the U.S. illegally, and has set  limits on how long they can hold those families.</p><p>So, they're being dropped off at a bus station in El Paso, where aid groups  are offering support. More, by the way, are expected to be released today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DYLAN CORBETT, DIRECTOR, HOPE BORDER INSTITUTE (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): They  have spent eight to 10 days in cells. Now they've been released. What we've  been doing as a community is to support them, giving them food, a place for  them to stay at night.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT: President Trump has repeatedly said the era of so-called catch and  release has ended. But frankly, that is exactly what is happening in Texas  right now. And it all comes against the backdrop of the government shutdown  over President Trump's demand for a Border wall that he says could stem the  flow of illegal immigration.</p><p>The wall and, of course, the deaths of those two immigrant children will no  doubt top the agenda when Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen visits the  Border area in El Paso, Texas, Friday, and Yuma, Arizona, Saturday. </p><p>Mark?</p><p>STEYN: Just - just to be clear on that, Jonathan, ICE can hold these people  if that chap is right for - for 10 days or whatever. And then meanwhile  they're given a two-year court date. So, in the gap between the 10 days and  the two years, they just get to hang out in America? That's - that's the  idea of it (ph)?</p><p>HUNT: Right. Well what - what ICE is saying is that under the current laws,  they have no choice but to release these immigrants after that time frame.  And, therefore, they take them to the bus station and then, yes,  essentially they are free to go where they wish to do as they please, Mark.</p><p>STEYN: Well that seems a bit of a design flaw, Jonathan.</p><p>While - while migrants continue to pour into the United States, critics of  the President maintain that nothing can be done because a wall's useless.  CNN's Brian Karem recently ranted about the futility of mankind's oldest  defensive mechanism.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN KAREM, JOURNALIST, PLAYBOY'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, CNN POLITICAL  ANALYST, FORMER EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY SENTINEL: This  whole issue is a crock from start to finish. He picked it up on the  campaign trail as something to appease the masses and play to his base. </p><p>It's not going to stop terrorism. It's not going to be 2,000 miles long, as  originally planned. It's not going to be see-through. It's not going to be  eco- friendly. It's not going to be slats or heads on pikes or a beaded  curtain or anything else. You can't wall that border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Jimmy Kimmel, meanwhile, has been ridiculing, Americans were so  desperate for a secure border they've been willing to donate to a GoFundMe  campaign for it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!: This - this  Trump supporter, guy named Brian Kolfage, started a GoFundMe campaign to  raise a billion dollars for the wall. He launched it on Sunday. It's  already up to almost $9 million. People - this is what people do with their  disposable income when they don't have loans from college to pay off.</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: Donating money for a wall that will never exist. It - it's like  starting a college fund for Harry Potter.</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: It's a - it's a - a more useful thing to do with your money would  be to go outside and feed it to a bird. But--</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: --you do have to admire the sacrifice they're making. I mean lot of  these people are dipping into their meth money for this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Got it. Meth heads for national security. Thank you, Jimmy. So,  would a wall work or not?</p><p>Jason Piccolo is a former Special Agent and Supervisor with the Department  of Homeland Security, and he joins us now. </p><p>Everybody's mocking this. We've had Nancy Pelosi doing her beaded curtain  line. At this stage, I would welcome a 2,000 mile beaded curtain along the  Southern border. It would show a certain kind of resolve. But are these  critics right that this thing doesn't work, doesn't make any difference,  complete waste of time?</p><p>JASON PICCOLO, FORMER ICE SUPERVISOR, OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM VETERAN: No,  it'll work. Now the border is 2,000 miles long. And you won't be able to  actually wall the whole border. But that'll create chokepoints or - or  points where we could actually apprehend the immigrants coming in.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, well--</p><p>PICCOLO: So, yes, a wall would work.</p><p>STEYN: --yes. What's interesting to me is that if you look at up on the  Northern border, where there's far fewer people coming across, there's not  caravans massing on the 49th parallel, and yet, the United States  government has actually put physical barricades in a lot of cross border  towns on the Canadian border, presumably because it works there. </p><p>So, why would it not work on the Mexican border?</p><p>PICCOLO: Walls work. They do. Now, when I worked on a border, the border  was simply a strand of fence in some areas like a strand of wire. Now, you  have narco-traffickers coming across that same area. You have economic  migrants, it's just it's open. The whole border is pretty much open except  for, you know, few miles here and there.</p><p>STEYN: When - when you say it's open, because most - most people who cross  international frontiers legitimately will do so at big border posts. </p><p>But you're saying that even though we talk about this incessantly, there  are actually 100-mile stretches where people can actually just walk into  the United States, a country that's supposedly been on Orange Alert for 17  years.</p><p>PICCOLO: Yes, definitely. Now, I was on the DHS' human smuggling cell back  in 2015. And we tracked human smuggling corridors coming up from South  America. </p><p>Now, you do have Special Interest Aliens transiting into South America,  into Brazil, and traveling up those same routes that the economic migrants  and the narco-traffickers are using. So there--</p><p>STEYN: So--</p><p>PICCOLO: --anybody can come and go through that border.</p><p>STEYN: So you mean - you mean, when you say Special Interest Aliens, you -  you mean that potential jihadists have figured out. They - they look at  what's on their TV screens on the Rio Grande, and figure that instead of  trying to fly to JFK, you might as well just go to Latin America and walk  into the country.</p><p>PICCOLO: You can. The border's open. Now, I detailed out in Ajo, Arizona at  one time back in the early 2000s. And it was literally one strand of barbed  wire. So, yes, you could - anybody could walk across that border when the  various (ph) intent are with coming here for economic migration.</p><p>STEYN: A strand of barbed wire. That seems even more useless than the  beaded curtain. Jason, thank you for that. And thank you for the eyewitness  testimony on that Southern border. I'm not sure people actually visualize  it quite the way you know it.</p><p>Coming up, Tucker's going to be here to discuss the declining fortunes of  American men. And Paris is still coping with riots after the government  tried to levy a carbon tax. So, why do lawmakers want a carbon tax here?  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STEYN: It was another chaotic day on Wall Street today. Yesterday, the Dow  Jones average had its largest single-day gain in history. Today, the  average went on another downward streak falling by 600 points. </p><p>But in the afternoon, the market rallied surging almost 900 points to  finish the day up by 258 points. The market is still down about 2,500  points this month in what's been a very tumultuous end to the year. It's  like these algorithms just fell face-down in the eggnog.</p><p>The French have been rioting for more than a month now after Emmanuel  Macron's government tried to impose an anti-global warming gas tax upon  them. Nevertheless, a lot of Americans, including the outgoing Senator Jeff  Flake, think it's time for America to have its own carbon tax. Is that  wise?</p><p>Mark Reynolds is Executive Director of the Citizens Climate Lobby, and he  joins us. Mark, when you see what's happening in France, that's a more  extreme version of what happens when carbon taxes are actually put into  place elsewhere. People don't seem to like it, don't seem to care for it.</p><p>MARK REYNOLDS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CITIZENS CLIMATE LOBBY: First of all,  thank you so much for having me on the show. The nice thing about the  Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is that it actually puts money in  people's pockets. So, I think that there's people who are suffering both  here and in other countries. </p><p>And I think that the reason that there's so much Republicans' support -  support on both the House and the Senate version of this bill is it  actually sends, allocates money back to households, so that they are  prepared to deal with whatever they have to.</p><p>And again--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --it doesn't tell them what to do with that money, just lets them  make a choice about whatever they want to do with it.</p><p>STEYN: Well let me tell - this is the bill that's being proposed in - the  carbon tax is being proposed in the United States, which under the proposal  supposedly then gives money back to households. But here's one big problem  with it, Mark.</p><p>Basically, the automatic increases kick in, I think, starting around 2022,  and they basically go all the way up until mid-century. So, and it's beyond  the control of other congresses. It just becomes like an entitlement  program that gets automatic increases every year and is beyond the control.</p><p>You can't go to a polling station if you don't like it, if the facts  change, if the circumstances change. It essentially puts the carbon tax  beyond democratic - democratic accountability, doesn't it?</p><p>REYNOLDS: Well Representative Francis Rooney, who's the lead Republican  sponsor from Florida says that he likes this bill because it's market- based. It actually lets the market determine how we get to the new energy  economy. </p><p>I think that's a lot of what Mr. Fitzpatrick, one of the Republicans on the  bill also said is, is, you know, you put a fee on carbon-based emissions,  you give the money back to households so that the government doesn't pick  what to do with it. You don't pick winners and losers. It'll be up for you  to--</p><p>STEYN: What about--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --to you and I to determine what we do with a dividend. But it'll  be actually a free-market bill--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --and that's what the Republicans on the bill said they like  about it so much.</p><p>STEYN: What do you make of the CEI, the Competitive Enterprise Institute's  objection to it that it will actually kill America's new energy  independence, which is a phenomenon in the last few years, what we see with  fracking and so forth, and means we're no longer dependent on malign Saudi  sheiks who use their oil riches to spread their Wahhabist ideology around  the world. </p><p>The CEI's view is that the carbon tax is going to kill American energy  independence.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. So, I think there's something really interesting happening  right now. There's actually a race to the new energy economy. And it's  probably going to be either us or China. China is making a huge investment  in renewable energy. And I heard - certainly hope it's us.</p><p>So, what I think that this bill does is creates enough incentive throughout  the entire--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --economic system to create all the type of--</p><p>STEYN: --wait, wait.</p><p>REYNOLDS: --innovation that we know we need.</p><p>STEYN: But there's no carbon tax in China. The Yangtze is like the most  polluted river in the world the - with the - with what's coming down that  stream every day. It's nothing you'd want any of your kids to be gambling  and frolicking in.</p><p>So, they won't wait - what - what the French - the - the French protesters  object to is that this is their lives. It's not a theory. It's not a  macroeconomic theory. If it's a choice between sea levels in Tuvalu in the  22nd Century or how they have to live their lives in the century they're  actually living in, they'll prioritize the reality of their lives over  speculation a century hence.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. I think that that's why so many Republicans like this bill  in both the House and Senate is because money's actually returned. You get  a monthly check and then it's your choice what you do with it. </p><p>I'm not going to tell you what to do with the money. The government's not  going to tell you what to - what to do with the money. It's going to be up  to American households to determine what to do.</p><p>STEYN: And - and you believe - and you believe that's good at - because  everything you - they always say that and then it goes into the General  Fund. The gas - gasoline taxes, they were supposed to be about it and they  all go into it (ph). Well we'll - we'll see how it works out. I don't see  the public appetite for it. </p><p>But, Mark, thank you for - thank you for talking with us today. And happy  post--</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. And thank you for - thank you for having me on. And let me  just say to the people who are watching, there is one of our chapters in  every community out there from Boise, Idaho, to Birmingham, Alabama. If you  want to work with people on solutions, we have a big tent, and we would  love to see you in your neighborhood.</p><p>STEYN: OK. Big tents we like. And we won't heat them with conventional  energy sources.</p><p>REYNOLDS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Thank you for that, Mark. Happy post-Boxing Day to you. </p><p>It's time for Tucker's Final Exam. Have you been following the news over  the Christmas period? Find out if you can remember it better than the big- time professionals here at Fox. That's up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: FINAL EXAM.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Oh, you know what that music means. It's time for Tucker's Final  Exam where the news professionals are interrogated, see if they can  actually remember the events they cover every day. </p><p>This week's Final Exam is a New York Special. We have Kennedy, the last  non-guest host in the building. And also - and also with us, from FOX News  Headlines 24/7, Carley Shimkus.</p><p>And actually, speaking of guest hosting, Carley will actually be in this  slot on Monday night. But for some reason we're going to stick her outside- -</p><p>LISA KENNEDY MONTGOMERY, KENNEDY HOST, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: --for the duration of the show. And then Kennedy will follow Carley.  So, this is the Fox New Year's Eve team. You'll--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Right.</p><p>STEYN: --you'll get a heads-up on ahead. Stay ahead of (ph)--</p><p>CARLEY SHIMKUS, FOX NEWS HEADLINES 24/7 REPORTER: We're going to have lot  of fun.</p><p>STEYN: --tuning in. OK, contestants, hands on buzzers. I'm going to ask the  questions. And the first one to buzz in gets to answer. But you must wait  until I finish asking. </p><p>You can answer once and I shall acknowledge you, according to rules set by  the International Quiz Show Committee in Geneva, by saying your name.  Correct answer's worth one point. Get it wrong, you lose a point. Best of  five wins. </p><p>Let's get started. Question one, an outgoing Democrat Senator just blasted  newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling her a shiny new object with cheap  rhetoric. Which lawmaker made those remarks?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: And it's Kennedy.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Claire McCaskill.</p><p>STEYN: Claire McCaskill. Let's roll that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CLAIRE CONNER MCCASKILL, SENIOR UNITED STATES SENATOR, MISSOURI: I don't  know her. I'm - I'm a little confused why she's the thing. But it's a good  example of what I'm talking about, a bright and shiny new object.</p><p>The rhetoric is cheap. Getting results is a lot harder.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Meow. Saucer of--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --milk for Senator McCaskill.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Don't let the door hit you where the Lord split you, Senator  McCaskill.</p><p>STEYN: So, that's first blood to Kennedy. One-Zip as we head into question  two.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: OK.</p><p>STEYN: This is critical for Carley. Otherwise she - she'll be losing that  New Year's Eve gig. Question--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: --question two. Former First Lady, Michelle Obama, is now the most  admired woman in all of America. That's according to a new Gallup poll. But  to get them, Michelle Obama had to bump another woman who'd held on to the  top spot for 17 years.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: Who was the other woman?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I know it (ph).</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: Oh. And it's Kennedy again.</p><p>SHIMKUS: It was just a guess from me anyway.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Hillary Clinton.</p><p>STEYN: Oh, come on. Hillary Clinton, the most admired woman in America? The  17 - are you kidding me? Let's roll that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Michelle Obama has overtaken Hillary Clinton as the  most admired woman in the country.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Good job. Oh, man. I'm getting cleaned (ph).</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Clinton held that top spot on that list for 17 years.  What does that say about Hillary now?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Me too (ph).</p><p>SHIMKUS: You know what? I thought it - I - I wanted to say Oprah because--</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>SHIMKUS: --I thought - I feel like that - were truly is one of the most  admired women in America. But I think Hillary is now third and--</p><p>STEYN: No, yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: --Molly (ph) is in second or something like that.</p><p>STEYN: Oprah - Oprah is number two. But it's a tragedy--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --for Hillary. She was once the most admired--</p><p>SHIMKUS: She lost again.</p><p>STEYN: --woman in America and--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I blame the Latvian bot farm and misogyny.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Even though there are other women on the list, so--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Of course.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: --very misogynistic that she got the heave-ho.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, absolutely.</p><p>SHIMKUS: We are clearly on that list as well, four and five.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. Macedonian content farmers fixed that thing right (ph). It's  Two-Zip to Kennedy. This is--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, no.</p><p>STEYN: --come on, come on Carley.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I just want one point.</p><p>STEYN: Come on, you don't want to be outside on New Year's Eve.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't.</p><p>STEYN: This - we'll give you - we'll give you a studio if you can turn this  thing around.</p><p>SHIMKUS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Question three. We recently told you about a popular calendar in  Russia, which features various images of a shirtless Vladimir Putin. That  same calendar is now a monster hit in another country and is outselling  ones featuring puny homegrown celebrities. Which country is it?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND) </p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't know.</p><p>STEYN: No, no. No. And this is (ph) - Kennedy.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: United States.</p><p>STEYN: Chest-less (ph) Putin in the United States?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Let's see.</p><p>STEYN: Doesn't sound likely.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm blushing.

The popularity of the calendars is reportedly fueled by a surge in  self-proclaimed Putin fans. Get them while they're hot, ladies. Putin--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: While they're hot.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. There's nothing a Japanese lady likes than--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Putin and a fish (ph).</p><p>STEYN: --being in a hot tub with a KGB torturer. Kennedy, disastrous move  there. She's lost one point.</p><p>SHIMKUS: It's all right.</p><p>STEYN: So there's still everything to play for. It's Two-Zero. </p><p>Question four, multiple choice.</p><p>SHIMKUS: One-zero.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Isn't it two-ones?</p><p>STEYN: Oh, no, one - one-zero.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: One-zero. Yes, Carley--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh, I lost a point?</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I thought - I thought I kept it and then--</p><p>STEYN: No, no, you - you lost it.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: --I thought I kept the other two (ph)--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh, the two points (ph)--</p><p>STEYN: You're in huge trouble now.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh, boy.</p><p>STEYN: Question four. This is a multiple choice question. There's a crisis  on the International Space Station. Something mysterious was found by  astronauts inside a capsule that recently docked there. And Russian  officials say it's the result of a major breach. What was it they found?</p><p>SHIMKUS: I would--</p><p>STEYN: A, a sharp knife, B, a tiny hole, or C, a jar of pickles.</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>STEYN: And it's the trigger-happy Kennedy yet again. What do you say,  Kennedy?</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Jar of pickles.</p><p>STEYN: Jar of pickles</p><p>SHIMKUS: I was going to go with A. But let's--</p><p>STEYN: Let's roll that tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Matter of life and death. A tiny hole discovered in a  Russian capsule--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: We were both - we would have both been wrong.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --that docks to the International Space Station.</p><p>At first, scientists suspected the hole was caused by a meteorite strike.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And a good unobstructed view now of that black spot.  That's the hole on the external hull.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: A Russian cosmonaut who examined the hole--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Oh.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: --believes it was drilled from inside the capsule.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHIMKUS: Good to know. I'm learning a lot on this show, by the way--</p><p>STEYN: Yes. If you're a-</p><p>SHIMKUS: --for the very first time.</p><p>STEYN: --if you're a Russian cosmonaut, just plug that hole with the  picture of Vladimir Putin chestless in the hot tub, that'll - that'll take  care of it.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: OK. So, as a result, Kennedy's lost another point. It's now zero- zero.</p><p>SHIMKUS: The final load (ph).</p><p>STEYN: So, this is Sudden Death.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: SUDDEN DEATH.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Sudden Death.</p><p>SHIMKUS: This is the lowest scoring game--</p><p>STEYN: The Final - this is the lowest scoring game in the history of this  show. Final question.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Maybe we've been dipping into the New Year's champagne early--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: --Mark.</p><p>STEYN: Too much Wassail and Figgy pudding. Final question. Another multiple  choice, listen carefully.</p><p>SHIMKUS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: There is a viral video of a Colorado woman chasing down a thief who  had stolen her Christmas packages from her front door. Now, there's a  special name given to people who steal in this way. Is it A, a porch  pirate, B, a parcel poacher, or C, a package snatcher?</p><p>(BUZZERS SOUND)</p><p>STEYN: And--</p><p>SHIMKUS: Oh.</p><p>STEYN: --Carley. Oh, can we have a round of applause for this? Carley  succeeded in actually hitting the buzzer.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I didn't (ph).</p><p>STEYN: We didn't even know hers worked but maybe (ph)--</p><p>SHIMKUS: If I win this way (ph), it is a win I do not deserve.</p><p>STEYN: Oh, OK. Let's - let's see what--</p><p>SHIMKUS: I am going with A, porch pirate.</p><p>STEYN: Porch pirate. Roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The scourge of the holiday season. Those pesky porch  pirates intent on ruining Christmas.

Keira Knightley didn't talk like that in Porch Pirates of the  Caribbean.</p><p>SHIMKUS: No.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: No.</p><p>STEYN: That is and we have an amazing - this is a humiliation for Kennedy.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Wise turnaround (ph).</p><p>SHIMKUS: This is - this, this I don't deserve it.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: I feel like--</p><p>SHIMKUS: I don't.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: --Hillary Clinton on Election Night.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: My victory was a sure thing, Mark.</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Kennedy did all the heavy-lifting.

Carley just hit it - hits it once and takes the trophy.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Can I - can I say? Thank you so much.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: I believe that mug really should go to Kennedy.</p><p>STEYN: No, come on. I can't stand this good sportsmanship. Here you - here  you go. There is your Tucker Carlson mug (ph)--</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Right, so (ph).</p><p>STEYN: --the mug.</p><p>SHIMKUS: We'll share.</p><p>STEYN: You'll see these ladies in this time on Monday. That's all for this  week's Final Exam. Pay attention to the news each week and tune in on  Thursdays to see if you can do better than one-buzz Carley. </p><p>Tucker will be here next, right after the break.</p><p>SHIMKUS: No, I didn't--</p><p>STEYN: Like (ph)--</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STEYN: Tucker recently sat down to interview the Author of a new book on  the crisis afflicting American men. Here's what happened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: MEN IN AMERICA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON- HOST: If you look at the numbers, you quickly conclude that  men are in crisis in America. Compared to women, they are far more likely  to drop out of school, fail to graduate, go to jail, not hold a job, commit  suicide, die of a drug overdose. </p><p>And yet, the establishment, and particularly, Democratic establishment  seems uninterested in all of this. And they think - they appear to think  that men are still too successful and need to be held back.</p><p>Andrew Yarrow is a former New York Times reporter, a Senior Fellow with the  Progressive Policy Institute. He just wrote an important new book called,  Man Out: Men on the Sidelines of American Life. He joins us tonight in  studio.</p><p>Mr. Yarrow - Yarrow, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>ANDREW YARROW, FORMER NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER, PROGRESSIVE POLICY INSTITUTE  SENIOR FELLOW, MAN OUT AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker, it's a pleasure--</p><p>CARLSON: So, I should, perhaps if I'm (ph) saying--</p><p>YARROW: --yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --I don't think you're a conservative activist, and that I'm also  grateful that someone is saying this because the numbers support that it's  true.</p><p>YARROW: It is true. And, as you say, the problem has really largely been  ignored. I mean Democrats and a lot of people in the country don't see men  as having problems. But there are a lot of men who are struggling,  struggling with work, struggling in families, struggling with health, lot  of areas I touch on in my book.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, to such a great extent that it would seem a crisis that  affects everybody because, of course, men and women need each other to  reproduce on the most basic level, but also every - everybody has a father  or brother, sons--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --why do you think it's been ignored?</p><p>YARROW: Well, there's been a lot of political correctness in this country  that's kind of made the main narrative be that, you know, women are the  oppressed ones. And they have been historically--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: --oppressed. But, you know, that doesn't mean that there aren't a  lot of men struggling. I mean you don't - it's not a zero-sum game.</p><p>CARLSON: You're right.</p><p>YARROW: And--</p><p>CARLSON: But it's been presented as one that one sex succeeds only when  another moves backward. Where'd that assumption come from?</p><p>YARROW: Well, I think a lot of politics looks at things that way. And I  think it's - it's pretty unfortunate. But I think, you know, men have not  been, in many ways, good at advocating for themselves.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: I mean it's been interesting in the last few elections. A lot of  the political activists have been women. I mean you hear more from women  these days. I mean men aren't good at forming groups--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: --anymore.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you work at - at the Progressive Policy Institute. You're a  Fellow there. That's not the Heritage Foundation.</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: I think it's fair to say you probably work in a mostly Liberal  world.</p><p>YARROW: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What kind of reaction did your piece get among people you know?</p><p>YARROW: Well, it's interesting. Conservative media have tended to like it  more. It's, you know, it's kind of troubling that this should be a  bipartisan issue. </p><p>I mean all Americans should be doing well or should have the opportunity to  do well. And they should also have justice behind them. I mean men are  being accused wrongly. I mean there are a lot of awful things that men do.  Don't get me wrong but--</p><p>CARLSON: Well sure.</p><p>YARROW: --but, you know, the lack of due process in some of these sexual  assault allegations, it's, you know, it's pretty troubling. </p><p>CARLSON: It's just interesting because the most progressive President the  country's ever had, FDR, four terms, the first thing he did after getting  elected in 1932, the very first piece through the Congress was the CCC, the  Civilian Conservation Corps, which was--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --aimed at young men, just men between--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --18 and 25 or something like that--</p><p>YARROW: Right</p><p>CARLSON: --getting them back to work and restoring their vitality through  work. What would happen if a Democrat in the modern era suggested something  like that?</p><p>YARROW: Well, you think it would play well. You know, while the  unemployment statistics look good, there are a lot of men who've either  been pushed out of the labor force or dropped out. I mean they're about 17  - 18 percent of 25 to 64 year old men, who aren't working. </p><p>And, you know, there are a lot of men - younger men, who are neither in  school or working. So, you know, why is that? And, you know, why can't we  create better jobs for them? And yes, I mean you'd think a Democrat would  pitch some kind of jobs program.</p><p>CARLSON: I think I mean this is a longer conversation but I think the  answer is toxic masculinity.</p><p>YARROW: Yes, I mean the--</p><p>CARLSON: Whatever that means.</p><p>YARROW: Well, yes. I mean that's become the phrase du jour, I guess. I mean  there are clearly issues with masculinity. You know, I interviewed a lot of  men and some women around the country, about 200. And a lot of men told me,  a lot of, you know, even Liberal men said, \"Well feminism's done a lot for  women. But what's it done for me?\"</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's a - that's a fair question. And you ask it in this  book. Thank you for doing that.</p><p>YARROW: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Great to talk to you.</p><p>YARROW: Good to talk to you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: That's one of the biggest stories of our time, so is this one.</p><p>Big tech has become the greatest threat to Americans' privacy and personal  freedoms. But now, Americans seem to be wising up to that. A new survey  finds that Americans trust Facebook less than any other company. Also, a  growing number of Americans seeking treatment for tech addiction as they  find themselves unable to look away from social media, their smartphones or  video games.</p><p>Tom Kersting is a family therapist and the Author of Disconnected: How to  Reconnect Our Digitally Distracted Kids. I've read that book, and so should  you. And he joins us now.</p><p>Just to go with the Tucker, the big story of our time thing, when you look  at this so-called tech addiction, and you follow where that leads, you -  you do worry that in some ways these rinky-dinky little things that started  as cat video sites somehow basically re-wiring humanity.</p><p>TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: They are. I mean if we  looked out the back window right now and - and counted how many people were  walking by staring at their phones, you'd probably have 70 percent of them  doing that. </p><p>And when it comes to addiction which, obviously, I've studied in my  background, basically if anything, whether it's gambling, alcohol, drugs,  anything that's considered addictive its - if it's affecting one of the  following four, you could be diagnosed as - as an addict.</p><p>And the four things are, is it affecting your family, is it affecting your  health, is it affecting your job or your occupation, and is it affecting  have you had any legal issues?</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>KERSTING: And when we look at technology, we could check off each one of  those for many, many people. So, therefore, this whole addictive whether  it's a debate or not, I'm all about, I believe in a 100 percent.</p><p>STEYN: The - the difference being though that it's actually being kind of  organized on a global scale with--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --billions and billions of people. And when you look at children,  like middle-schoolers--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes, yes.</p><p>STEYN: --who've never known anything but this world, their behavior does  seem to be not where middle-schoolers were--</p><p>KERSTING: It's--</p><p>STEYN: --20, 50, 70 years ago.</p><p>KERSTING: --it's actually unbelievable. I tell people I - I - I get more  middle-school age kids with major anxiety disorders per year now--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --in my private practice than I did the previous 17 years  combined.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: And, you know, and you could - all the research that's done to  put - start to show that, starting to point to, you know, that the  absorption of social media, the lack of - of self, the lack of a sense of  self and so forth and how that's affecting the self-esteem and causing, you  know, issues with anxiety, depression, and other - other mental health -  health things.</p><p>STEYN: People do actually seem to prefer it though. You have a scene in  your book where you talk about when you were a young guy, just sitting at a  bar, you'd never know who's on the barstool next.</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: I can relate to that. Sometimes--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --you find yourself on the other side of the wall, you're sitting  next to an Australian, a Hungarian--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --you - you meet different people with different views. Now everyone  in the bar is just like--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --scrolling the phone.</p><p>KERSTING: When you go into the - the airport, if you travel, which, you  know--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --you do, I do. They have the screens in front of every barstool.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: So, like, you and I--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --instead of hanging out, talking with one another and--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --and kicking it off, now everybody's distracted by these  devices.</p><p>STEYN: Right. Sometimes--</p><p>KERSTING: So the--</p><p>STEYN: --you want to go where only Facebook knows--</p><p>KERSTING: --so - so it's like a - it's like--</p><p>STEYN: --you're in that area (ph).</p><p>KERSTING: --right. It's like bottles of wine dangling around if you're an  alcoholic--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --24 hours a day, seven days a week, you can't escape from it.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. That's - that's a - that's a - a worrying thing. As I said, I  think this is one of the biggest stories of time, Tom. I dread (ph) to  think--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --where we're going to be if - if we're - if we don't change it. But  how do we change it?</p><p>KERSTING: Well we have - it's - it's not something that's going to happen  overnight. We just have to keep creating awareness, having conversations  like you and I are having right now, so that people could see this. They  can understand the ramifications of these things. I'm one of the guys out  there, you know, that's lecturing--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --that's writing about it and that's out there trying to get  other people to do the same. And it's - it's going to be a slow process but  I think we're going to have to get there.</p><p>STEYN: OK. Well we will - we will hold you to that Tom because something -  these companies are bigger than countries now. </p><p>That is about it for us tonight. You can tune in each night at 8:00 to the  show that is the sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness, and groupthink.  And don't forget to DVR the show. That's less harmful, less addictive than  if you just go on Facebook and look at it. Don't bother with that. Just DVR  the show, if you haven't set that up already.</p><p>Now, this is exciting moment in the evening. We are going to lift Nancy  Pelosi's beaded curtain and find out who is guest-hosting for Sean Hannity  tonight. Oh, who is it going to be? They've lifted the beaded curtain. I  think I can see--</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER U.S. REPRESENTATIVE FOR UTAH'S 3RD CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES HOUSE COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT  AND GOVERNMENT REFORM, COMMENTATOR: Oh, Mark.</p><p>STEYN: --Jason Kennedy filling in for Sean. Hey Jason--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p>STEYN: --oh, no, Jason Chaffetz. What--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Mark, thank you, great show.</p><p>STEYN: After all, hey by--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I always love it when you're on with Tucker.</p><p>STEYN: No.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: I love it when you're on, so--</p><p>STEYN: Hey - hey, by--</p><p>CHAFFETZ: --thank you so much.</p><p>STEYN: --by the way, that was a terrific interview you did with Sam Johnson  today.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: And everyone should look at that. That was the best thing on TV this  morning.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Well--</p><p>STEYN: Terrific stuff.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you. Thanks to Fox &amp; Friends. We have - actually later in  the show, we're going to go back and tell you about Sam Johnson, a special  man, an amazing personality and a true American hero, so thanks, Mark. We  appreciate it.</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Jason. Have a great show.</p><p>CHAFFETZ: Thank you.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

I'm Mark Steyn in for Tucker. He's sleeping off his  Boxing Day Bacchanalia but he will join us later to discuss the ongoing  collapse of men in America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But first, yet another Liberal media meltdown. The mainstream media taking  the opportunity to turn a presidential visit to American troops into an  attack on Trump. Take a look at the hysteria as the talking heads accused  the President of turning the post-Christmas visit into a political event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SAMANTHA VINOGRAD, AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY COMMENTATOR, CNN NATIONAL  SECURITY ANALYST: From a national security perspective, for all the reasons  that you just listed, the President should have stayed home.</p><p>JAMES \"SPIDER\" MARKS, RETIRED MAJOR GENERAL, CNN MILITARY ANALYST: The  reason that he went now is that he couldn't go to Mar-a-Lago because the  government was shut down.</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN TONIGHT HOST, CNN: It was like we kept saying \"He's like the  Grinch.\" Instead of - I'm being honest.</p><p>CHARLES JOSEPH SCARBOROUGH, MORNING JOE CO-HOST, MSNBC: We should also be  concerned that Mr. Trump once again used a captive audience of American  heroes to push his unpopular domestic agenda.</p><p>Even in doing something right, he figures out a way to sow chaos.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It took far too long, especially compared to President  Obama who visited troops in Iraq in his first three months in office.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>STEYN: Over at CNN, attacking the President wasn't enough. They decided to  attack the troops as well.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARBARA STARR, PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT, CNN: The pool reporters traveling  said that the troops brought the hats with them, including one hat that  said \"Trump 2020.\" We will have to see if that actually proves to be the  case. </p><p>The question is, if they - if they brought them or if the President brought  them, what commander allowed that to really happen, because this is very  much against military policy and regulation. Troops are not supposed to be  involved in political activities. The U.S. Military is not a political  force.</p><p>JOHN FRANCIS KIRBY, RETIRED UNITED STATES NAVY REAR ADMIRAL, FORMER  SPOKESPERSON FOR THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF STATE: It's completely  inappropriate for the troops to do this.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Not supposed to--</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Of course, nobody cared back when presidential candidate Barack  Obama signed memorabilia for the troops back in 2008. He had a D after his  name though instead of an R. Thankfully, not everybody's lost their minds.  Even some Liberals scolded the media for their hysteria.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID AXELROD, FORMER SENIOR ADVISER TO OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, POLITICAL  CONSULTANT, ANALYST: It's - it's good that he went to see the troops,  important that he went to do it. He - he was criticized for it, obviously.  They wanted to address that. And so, I should - we should give him credit  where credit is due.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It just sends a - such a strong message that the - the  Trumps love our military, support our military, and what a great time to do  it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Well Joe Concha writes about Media for The Hill. He joins us now.  Joe, is this a good look for the media? Why are serving soldiers in a war  zone bringing particular hats to an event on base in a combat zone at  Christmas?</p><p>JOE CONCHA, THE HILL MEDIA REPORTER: Well the optics around that, Mark, are  horrific, right, because what you're doing here is it's - it's OK to go  after the President in terms of policy or the things that he says. </p><p>Once you start attacking the people that voted for him or military people  that are obviously serving overseas during Christmas, no less, then--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: --then you got a problem. And you have to ask yourself this  question, Mark. </p><p>Let's say, honestly, like you pointed out, as I did in my column today on  The Hill, if President Obama, as he did in 2008, signed a Hope and Change  t-shirts, do you really think any news organization would have gone ahead  with that story? Of course, they wouldn't have.</p><p>STEYN: No. I - I couldn't care less. Well what soldiers in these, frankly,  God-awful situations, because life in it - at a base in Iraq stinks. You -  it's not like being in Ramstein, Germany where the President was today. You  can't stroll down to town go to a local bar, meet one of the nice German  girls, or one of the local guy (ph), you know, that's nothing like that.</p><p>You're stuck in that lousy fortress that you hope is a fortress. And the  President comes to visit you. And the pre-occupation of the American media  is whether hats the troops chose to take to that event are somehow some  potential crime that they can be pulled up in front of a military court  for. I mean that's bonkers--</p><p>CONCHA: Yes, Mark, and--</p><p>STEYN: --isn't it?</p><p>CONCHA: --it's bonkers, yes. And I think that pivot happened because the  original narrative was, we - we'd all recall is that, President Trump was  supposed to be the first President since 2002 to not visit the troops at  Christmas. </p><p>And once that fell apart, when he literally landed in Iraq as the story was  going up and it originally came from NBC, then social media goes nuts. And  - and what happened was the pivot went from, \"Oh yes, OK. Trump went, sure,  but what was his motive exactly for going?\"</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CONCHA: I - I give you The Washington Post, Mark, quoting, the President's  visit follows months of public pressure for him to spend time with troops  deployed to conflicts in the Middle East. Think about that again, follows  months of public pressure.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: In other words, we, the media, got the public riled up to force  Trump to go to a war zone instead of him just going like every president  has done for the past 17 years.</p><p>STEYN: Well - well according to Soledad O'Brien, who's a lovely lady, but  she thought it was actually minutes of public pressure that Alyssa Milano  who - who actually tweeted as the President was halfway across the ocean,  why haven't you visited our troops, Soledad O - O'Brien actually gave  Alyssa Milano credit for shaming the President into getting on the plane  that he'd already gotten on.</p><p>CONCHA: Yes. And then what's forgotten in all this, of course, is if you  want to go to Walter Reed, let's say the President was shamed, and he goes  to Walter Reed, which is close to the White House, OK, then you could say  it's a last-minute thing. When you go to Iraq, you kind of have to plan it  in advance. You have to do it weeks in advance, obviously, for security.</p><p>Air Force One has to fly in with shades down and cellphones off and - and  all of that. So, you think you'd see though however, at least from NBC and  - and - and others, some remorse, some apology, some around, you know,  \"Hey, we went ahead with this story a little bit too early because we ran a  story on Christmas saying that the President hadn't been to see the troops  on Christmastime.\"</p><p>People don't mind that sort of transparency from the media. But yet, we  never see those sort of concessions. Instead, we see the pivots that are  negative like we always do in these situations. And that's why trust in  media is this. </p><p>Axios, SurveyMonkey poll just last year, 93 percent of Republicans think  that the media knowingly creates stories, makes them up, they're false. And  you say all right (ph), that's Republicans. They've always hated the media.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>CONCHA: They don't trust them. 79 percent of - of independents, Mark--</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>CONCHA: 53 percent of Democrats, even a majority, that's the thing. I mean  this is something that's going across the board--</p><p>STEYN: Sure (ph).</p><p>CONCHA: --in terms of all parties seeing exactly what's happening here,  sir.</p><p>STEYN: Hey Joe, thanks. Don't worry about that though. As soon as the media  call for a Special Counsel to investigate how those MAGA hats got to Iraq,  everything will be fine.</p><p>CONCHA: There you go (ph).</p><p>STEYN: Rochelle Ritchie is a former Press Secretary for the House  Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, and Rachel Campos-Duffy is  a Fox contributor, and they both join us.</p><p>Rochelle, how - stepping back and looking at this a little more objectively  than CNN &amp; Co. have done, is it really a good law - the troops liked the  guy. The guy got on with the troops. Is there really any political mileage  to be had in going on about this?</p><p>ROCHELLE RITCHIE, FORMER PRESS SECRETARY, HOUSE DEMOCRATIC POLICY AND  COMMUNICATIONS COMMITTEE, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: So, I had a little bit of  a battle with myself about this. At first, I was saying, you know, no,  these men and women in uniform, they shouldn't have, you know, gotten their  hats signed. They shouldn't have been out there with Make America Great  Again hats.</p><p>And, you know, when you look at the facts, yes, it is a - it is breaking a  rule when it comes to the Department of Defense guidelines. But at the same  time, these troops have not seen an American President since 2009. I  believe Obama was the last one to - to go visit.</p><p>So, maybe they're not necessarily, you know, showing support for the  President or getting his signature because they are Republican--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, no, come on, who--</p><p>RITCHIE: --maybe - no, listen, listen--</p><p>STEYN: --no--</p><p>RITCHIE: --no, see, how can you disagree? I haven't even finished. </p><p>The Commander - it's their Commander-in-Chief. So, maybe it's not because  he's a Republican President. Maybe they're looking at it like he's the  Commander-in-Chief. We're proud to fight for our country or fight - we're  proud to stand behind our President--</p><p>STEYN: Let--</p><p>RITCHIE: --whether he has an R or a D behind his name. And, look, I could  really care less if the guys do it. As long as they're continuing to  protect our national security, have at it.</p><p>STEYN: Well Rochelle gave that theory rather more credit than I would  think, Rachel. I mean who the--</p><p>RITCHIE: I'm very balanced.</p><p>STEYN: --who the hell - if you have the misfortune to be spending Christmas  on one of those - those forts, cut off from life in the middle of the Iraqi  desert--</p><p>RACHEL CAMPOS-DUFFY, AMERICAN TELEVISION PERSONALITY, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Right.</p><p>STEYN: --who the hell cares what hat you take to a Christmas party  basically.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Of course, they shouldn't care. But I think the more  important question is why do - I mean - let's be honest. The reaction from  the troops was very overwhelmingly positive. And it should be. </p><p>Listen, Barack Obama decimated our military. Barack Obama--</p><p>RITCHIE: OK.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --wait a minute. He did. He cut funding for our military. He  put in rules of engagement that actually--</p><p>RITCHIE: But that's not even--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --caused - wait a minute that actually caused--</p><p>RITCHIE: But what does that have to do with--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --but let - let--</p><p>RITCHIE: --what we're talking about though with this Trump (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let - it does. It does have to do.</p><p>RITCHIE: --how?</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Because the - Barack Obama did all in - enacted rules of  engagement--</p><p>RITCHIE: I don't. It has nothing to do--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --Rochelle, let me finish. Rochelle--</p><p>RITCHIE: --OK. Go ahead, Rachel.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --let me finish. He enacted rules of engagement that actually  put our military on the battlefield in danger--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --causing more battles (ph) but wait - wait a minute, Mark.  He did that.</p><p>RITCHIE: I'm sorry.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: And he went to the troops and they said he was a great  Commander-in-Chief. Donald Trump goes--</p><p>STEYN: Let me--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --over and does all this to not for Alyssa Milano or the  media - or the media. But he does it because he loves the troops. And they  say that he's doing it for a photo op.</p><p>STEYN: Oh--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: This is a man who loves the military.</p><p>STEYN: No, how (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was his number one issue.</p><p>RITCHIE: I - I--</p><p>STEYN: OK. How about this as a non-Democrat, non-Republican thing?  Democrats weren't in favor of the 21st Century Bush Wars, as they called  them.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right.</p><p>RITCHIE: Right.</p><p>STEYN: But nor was Donald - nor was Donald Trump in 2016.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: That's right.</p><p>STEYN: In - in a sense, Donald Trump is at odds with both Democrat policy  and Republican policy on the Middle East, Rochelle.</p><p>RITCHIE: Yes. He's definitely fighting both sides. And I think what - when  you talked about the press, I think the reason why the press is sort of  attacking on him, the - the Left-leaning press, I would say, is because of  some of the - the misleading comments that he made when he talked about the  pay raises for the military. We know that's not--</p><p>STEYN: Well they do - they did get the pay rises (ph).</p><p>RITCHIE: --necessarily true. They do get raises. But they're not getting a  10 percent raise. It's going to be, I think, 2.6 percent. So, I think there  are ways that the media was looking at it and attacking him for his less- than-knowledgeable education, I guess you could say, on what's really  happening--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: But (ph)--</p><p>RITCHIE: --there. But I don't I - I think that him visiting was a good  idea. I think there was an article by The Washington Post where it said  that he was actually scared to go over there for some time. So, I'm glad--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Ridiculous.</p><p>RITCHIE: --he got over that.</p><p>STEYN: That's a--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: He was not scared. And - and what would the media, you know,  betting MAGAs hats (ph) what would they have had him do? Say, \"Oh, I'm  sorry. I'm not going to sign your hat because of the Hatch Act,\" and then  they--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --would have criticized him and said--</p><p>RITCHIE: Well--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --\"Hey, what a jerk. He wouldn't sign a hat.\"</p><p>STEYN: By the way there's too much--</p><p>RITCHIE: I just - I just said I thought that was perfectly fine.</p><p>STEYN: --there's too much of that. The minute you--</p><p>RITCHIE: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --if you're seriously talking about soldiers doing something wrong  because they asked their Commander-in-Chief to sign a hat, then - then  you've flown the coop. That's not a land of law and things (ph)--</p><p>RITCHIE: I want to know (ph)--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It's - it's a bad look for the press. It's - the reason why  the American people hate the press and, by the way, the troops loved the  President because--</p><p>RITCHIE: Wait, wait, what is this? This is (ph) press--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --the troops love the President because he did sign a bill  that he took a lot of flack from the - from the Right for signing a big  bill that was--</p><p>RITCHIE: I think - I think--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --for funding the military.</p><p>RITCHIE: --I think that Trump's whole purpose--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: They love him.</p><p>RITCHIE: --of being there and - and this is - is - this is part of it, I  think that he also has a lot, I think, there was a - a part in this segment  right before you came to us about--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>RITCHIE: --this being public pressure. I think it's more political pressure  because of him, you know, General Kelly, then General Mattis, and so I  think that he's really trying to show that he has some sort of control of  what's happening right now in the middle in - in--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Right. Why didn't - why didn't the--</p><p>STEYN: No, no, no, no--</p><p>RITCHIE: --Iraq. But then - but--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: --why doesn't that criticism come to Barack Obama? He goes to  visit the troop, no one questions his motives.</p><p>RITCHIE: Well Obama is living his best life somewhere (ph).</p><p>STEYN: No, but it's a - that - you can't do--</p><p>RITCHIE: Can we leave him out of it?</p><p>STEYN: --those--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: But - but there is a double standard. And that is what people  are talking about, Rochelle.</p><p>STEYN: We got to - we got to go, ladies.</p><p>RITCHIE: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Iraq's a crazy place. You can't just plan those things with no  notice.</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: Absolutely, I agree (ph).</p><p>RITCHIE: No, you can't.</p><p>STEYN: Rochelle and Rachel will carry--</p><p>CAMPOS-DUFFY: It was Alyssa Milano.</p><p>STEYN: --this - this ones (ph) and they're going to take this to the green  room - where now - this is worse than the Sunni Triangle, the violence  that's like (ph) percolating it.</p><p>We're now on day six of the government shutdown triggered by Congress'  refusal to fund a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. </p><p>Today, the President tweeted, \"Have the Democrats finally realized that we  desperately need border security and a wall on the Southern border? We need  to stop drugs, human trafficking, gang members, and criminals from coming  into our country. And do the Dems realize that most of the people not  getting paid are Democrats?\"</p><p>Fox Washington Correspondent, Rich Edson, joins us with more on the  situation in D.C. It's all yours.</p><p>RICH EDSON, WASHINGTON CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p>Congress officially and briefly gaveled in this afternoon though there is  no sign of this shutdown ending anytime soon as Democrats in (ph) the White  House are a few billion dollars apart on funding for a wall on the Southern  border. President Trump has returned to the White House after visiting U.S.  forces yesterday in Iraq.</p><p>He's just tweeted, \"This isn't about the wall. Everybody knows that a wall  will work perfectly. In Israel, the wall works 99.9 percent. This is only  about the Dems not letting Donald Trump and the Republicans have a win.  They may have the 10 Senate votes. But we have the issue, border security.  2020.\"</p><p>In a statement, White House Press Secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders says,  \"The President and his team in Washington over Christmas hoping to  negotiate a deal that would stop the dangerous crisis on the border,  protect American communities, and re-open the government, the Democrats  decided to go home.\"</p><p>She also says the Administration offered Democrats what she calls a  reasonable common-sense solution five days ago, though a spokesperson for  House Minority Leader, Nancy Pelosi, says, \"Democrats have offered  Republicans three options to re-open the government that all include  funding for strong, sensible, and effective border security, but not the  President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall.\"</p><p>While in Iraq, President Trump stressed the funding bill must include money  for a border wall.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD J. TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The folks are saying, \"Can  we have some drones? Can we have technology?\" Technology is bells and  whistles. You have to have a wall. You have to have protection. </p><p>When you say, \"How long is it going to take?\" \"When are they going to say  that we need border security?\"</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EDSON: Pelosi's office says Democrats will pass their bill to open the  government after they take control of the House next week. Though to end  this shutdown, the House, the Senate, and the White House must all agree on  the same funding bill.</p><p>On Capitol Hill, House Freedom Caucus Chairman, Mark Meadows, says the  needle has moved towards a very long shutdown, as Democrats and Republicans  appear to talk past one another.</p><p>Mark?</p><p>STEYN: Thanks a lot, Rich.</p><p>This is a Fox News Alert. Police in California are on the hunt for an  unnamed illegal immigrant, suspected of murdering a police officer.  Corporal Ronil Singh, an immigrant from Fiji, was gunned down Wednesday  morning during a traffic stop. Police have released surveillance footage of  the suspect, and say they believe he is still in the area. We will continue  to monitor this breaking story. </p><p>And coming up, Tucker will be back with us to discuss the crisis of  American manhood. Plus, President Trump insists the government won't re- open until he has money for his wall. But if he gets it, will that wall  work? That's next on TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STEYN: El Paso, Texas is turning into Exhibit A of America's broken  immigration system. ICE has been overwhelmed by asylum requests and  shackled by court rulings, and it's now releasing hundreds of migrants onto  the streets of El Paso.</p><p>The message to future migrants, of course, is that America is powerless to  stop them from settling here. Fox's Jonathan Hunt is here with more.  Jonathan?</p><p>JONATHAN HUNT, CHIEF CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS CHANNEL: Good evening, Mark.</p><p>Homeland Security Secretary, Kirstjen Nielsen, says the immigration system  is at breaking point. Border Patrol agents say they're overwhelmed. Around  1,000 immigrants have been released onto the streets of El Paso, Texas this  week alone. </p><p>And two young immigrant children have died after being taken into custody  by Customs and Border Protection agents, the first deaths of children in  CBP custody for a decade.</p><p>In El Paso, Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials say they have  little choice but to release those hundreds of immigrants because of,  quote, decades of inaction by Congress that they say has limited their  ability to remove families who are in the U.S. illegally, and has set  limits on how long they can hold those families.</p><p>So, they're being dropped off at a bus station in El Paso, where aid groups  are offering support. More, by the way, are expected to be released today.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DYLAN CORBETT, DIRECTOR, HOPE BORDER INSTITUTE (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): They  have spent eight to 10 days in cells. Now they've been released. What we've  been doing as a community is to support them, giving them food, a place for  them to stay at night.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>HUNT: President Trump has repeatedly said the era of so-called catch and  release has ended. But frankly, that is exactly what is happening in Texas  right now. And it all comes against the backdrop of the government shutdown  over President Trump's demand for a Border wall that he says could stem the  flow of illegal immigration.</p><p>The wall and, of course, the deaths of those two immigrant children will no  doubt top the agenda when Homeland Security Secretary Nielsen visits the  Border area in El Paso, Texas, Friday, and Yuma, Arizona, Saturday. </p><p>Mark?</p><p>STEYN: Just - just to be clear on that, Jonathan, ICE can hold these people  if that chap is right for - for 10 days or whatever. And then meanwhile  they're given a two-year court date. So, in the gap between the 10 days and  the two years, they just get to hang out in America? That's - that's the  idea of it (ph)?</p><p>HUNT: Right. Well what - what ICE is saying is that under the current laws,  they have no choice but to release these immigrants after that time frame.  And, therefore, they take them to the bus station and then, yes,  essentially they are free to go where they wish to do as they please, Mark.</p><p>STEYN: Well that seems a bit of a design flaw, Jonathan.</p><p>While - while migrants continue to pour into the United States, critics of  the President maintain that nothing can be done because a wall's useless.  CNN's Brian Karem recently ranted about the futility of mankind's oldest  defensive mechanism.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN KAREM, JOURNALIST, PLAYBOY'S WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, CNN POLITICAL  ANALYST, FORMER EXECUTIVE EDITOR OF THE MONTGOMERY COUNTY SENTINEL: This  whole issue is a crock from start to finish. He picked it up on the  campaign trail as something to appease the masses and play to his base. </p><p>It's not going to stop terrorism. It's not going to be 2,000 miles long, as  originally planned. It's not going to be see-through. It's not going to be  eco- friendly. It's not going to be slats or heads on pikes or a beaded  curtain or anything else. You can't wall that border.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Jimmy Kimmel, meanwhile, has been ridiculing, Americans were so  desperate for a secure border they've been willing to donate to a GoFundMe  campaign for it.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIMMY KIMMEL, HOST, EXECUTIVE PRODUCER, JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE!: This - this  Trump supporter, guy named Brian Kolfage, started a GoFundMe campaign to  raise a billion dollars for the wall. He launched it on Sunday. It's  already up to almost $9 million. People - this is what people do with their  disposable income when they don't have loans from college to pay off.</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: Donating money for a wall that will never exist. It - it's like  starting a college fund for Harry Potter.</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: It's a - it's a - a more useful thing to do with your money would  be to go outside and feed it to a bird. But--</p><p>(CROWD LAUGHING)</p><p>KIMMEL: --you do have to admire the sacrifice they're making. I mean lot of  these people are dipping into their meth money for this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: Got it. Meth heads for national security. Thank you, Jimmy. So,  would a wall work or not?</p><p>Jason Piccolo is a former Special Agent and Supervisor with the Department  of Homeland Security, and he joins us now. </p><p>Everybody's mocking this. We've had Nancy Pelosi doing her beaded curtain  line. At this stage, I would welcome a 2,000 mile beaded curtain along the  Southern border. It would show a certain kind of resolve. But are these  critics right that this thing doesn't work, doesn't make any difference,  complete waste of time?</p><p>JASON PICCOLO, FORMER ICE SUPERVISOR, OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM VETERAN: No,  it'll work. Now the border is 2,000 miles long. And you won't be able to  actually wall the whole border. But that'll create chokepoints or - or  points where we could actually apprehend the immigrants coming in.</p><p>STEYN: Yes, well--</p><p>PICCOLO: So, yes, a wall would work.</p><p>STEYN: --yes. What's interesting to me is that if you look at up on the  Northern border, where there's far fewer people coming across, there's not  caravans massing on the 49th parallel, and yet, the United States  government has actually put physical barricades in a lot of cross border  towns on the Canadian border, presumably because it works there. </p><p>So, why would it not work on the Mexican border?</p><p>PICCOLO: Walls work. They do. Now, when I worked on a border, the border  was simply a strand of fence in some areas like a strand of wire. Now, you  have narco-traffickers coming across that same area. You have economic  migrants, it's just it's open. The whole border is pretty much open except  for, you know, few miles here and there.</p><p>STEYN: When - when you say it's open, because most - most people who cross  international frontiers legitimately will do so at big border posts. </p><p>But you're saying that even though we talk about this incessantly, there  are actually 100-mile stretches where people can actually just walk into  the United States, a country that's supposedly been on Orange Alert for 17  years.</p><p>PICCOLO: Yes, definitely. Now, I was on the DHS' human smuggling cell back  in 2015. And we tracked human smuggling corridors coming up from South  America. </p><p>Now, you do have Special Interest Aliens transiting into South America,  into Brazil, and traveling up those same routes that the economic migrants  and the narco-traffickers are using. So there--</p><p>STEYN: So--</p><p>PICCOLO: --anybody can come and go through that border.</p><p>STEYN: So you mean - you mean, when you say Special Interest Aliens, you -  you mean that potential jihadists have figured out. They - they look at  what's on their TV screens on the Rio Grande, and figure that instead of  trying to fly to JFK, you might as well just go to Latin America and walk  into the country.</p><p>PICCOLO: You can. The border's open. Now, I detailed out in Ajo, Arizona at  one time back in the early 2000s. And it was literally one strand of barbed  wire. So, yes, you could - anybody could walk across that border when the  various (ph) intent are with coming here for economic migration.</p><p>STEYN: A strand of barbed wire. That seems even more useless than the  beaded curtain. Jason, thank you for that. And thank you for the eyewitness  testimony on that Southern border. I'm not sure people actually visualize  it quite the way you know it.</p><p>Coming up, Tucker's going to be here to discuss the declining fortunes of  American men. And Paris is still coping with riots after the government  tried to levy a carbon tax. So, why do lawmakers want a carbon tax here?  That's next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>STEYN: It was another chaotic day on Wall Street today. Yesterday, the Dow  Jones average had its largest single-day gain in history. Today, the  average went on another downward streak falling by 600 points. </p><p>But in the afternoon, the market rallied surging almost 900 points to  finish the day up by 258 points. The market is still down about 2,500  points this month in what's been a very tumultuous end to the year. It's  like these algorithms just fell face-down in the eggnog.</p><p>The French have been rioting for more than a month now after Emmanuel  Macron's government tried to impose an anti-global warming gas tax upon  them. Nevertheless, a lot of Americans, including the outgoing Senator Jeff  Flake, think it's time for America to have its own carbon tax. Is that  wise?</p><p>Mark Reynolds is Executive Director of the Citizens Climate Lobby, and he  joins us. Mark, when you see what's happening in France, that's a more  extreme version of what happens when carbon taxes are actually put into  place elsewhere. People don't seem to like it, don't seem to care for it.</p><p>MARK REYNOLDS, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, CITIZENS CLIMATE LOBBY: First of all,  thank you so much for having me on the show. The nice thing about the  Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act is that it actually puts money in  people's pockets. So, I think that there's people who are suffering both  here and in other countries. </p><p>And I think that the reason that there's so much Republicans' support -  support on both the House and the Senate version of this bill is it  actually sends, allocates money back to households, so that they are  prepared to deal with whatever they have to.</p><p>And again--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --it doesn't tell them what to do with that money, just lets them  make a choice about whatever they want to do with it.</p><p>STEYN: Well let me tell - this is the bill that's being proposed in - the  carbon tax is being proposed in the United States, which under the proposal  supposedly then gives money back to households. But here's one big problem  with it, Mark.</p><p>Basically, the automatic increases kick in, I think, starting around 2022,  and they basically go all the way up until mid-century. So, and it's beyond  the control of other congresses. It just becomes like an entitlement  program that gets automatic increases every year and is beyond the control.</p><p>You can't go to a polling station if you don't like it, if the facts  change, if the circumstances change. It essentially puts the carbon tax  beyond democratic - democratic accountability, doesn't it?</p><p>REYNOLDS: Well Representative Francis Rooney, who's the lead Republican  sponsor from Florida says that he likes this bill because it's market- based. It actually lets the market determine how we get to the new energy  economy. </p><p>I think that's a lot of what Mr. Fitzpatrick, one of the Republicans on the  bill also said is, is, you know, you put a fee on carbon-based emissions,  you give the money back to households so that the government doesn't pick  what to do with it. You don't pick winners and losers. It'll be up for you  to--</p><p>STEYN: What about--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --to you and I to determine what we do with a dividend. But it'll  be actually a free-market bill--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --and that's what the Republicans on the bill said they like  about it so much.</p><p>STEYN: What do you make of the CEI, the Competitive Enterprise Institute's  objection to it that it will actually kill America's new energy  independence, which is a phenomenon in the last few years, what we see with  fracking and so forth, and means we're no longer dependent on malign Saudi  sheiks who use their oil riches to spread their Wahhabist ideology around  the world. </p><p>The CEI's view is that the carbon tax is going to kill American energy  independence.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. So, I think there's something really interesting happening  right now. There's actually a race to the new energy economy. And it's  probably going to be either us or China. China is making a huge investment  in renewable energy. And I heard - certainly hope it's us.</p><p>So, what I think that this bill does is creates enough incentive throughout  the entire--</p><p>STEYN: Well--</p><p>REYNOLDS: --economic system to create all the type of--</p><p>STEYN: --wait, wait.</p><p>REYNOLDS: --innovation that we know we need.</p><p>STEYN: But there's no carbon tax in China. The Yangtze is like the most  polluted river in the world the - with the - with what's coming down that  stream every day. It's nothing you'd want any of your kids to be gambling  and frolicking in.</p><p>So, they won't wait - what - what the French - the - the French protesters  object to is that this is their lives. It's not a theory. It's not a  macroeconomic theory. If it's a choice between sea levels in Tuvalu in the  22nd Century or how they have to live their lives in the century they're  actually living in, they'll prioritize the reality of their lives over  speculation a century hence.</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. I think that that's why so many Republicans like this bill  in both the House and Senate is because money's actually returned. You get  a monthly check and then it's your choice what you do with it. </p><p>I'm not going to tell you what to do with the money. The government's not  going to tell you what to - what to do with the money. It's going to be up  to American households to determine what to do.</p><p>STEYN: And - and you believe - and you believe that's good at - because  everything you - they always say that and then it goes into the General  Fund. The gas - gasoline taxes, they were supposed to be about it and they  all go into it (ph). Well we'll - we'll see how it works out. I don't see  the public appetite for it. </p><p>But, Mark, thank you for - thank you for talking with us today. And happy  post--</p><p>REYNOLDS: Yes. And thank you for - thank you for having me on. And let me  just say to the people who are watching, there is one of our chapters in  every community out there from Boise, Idaho, to Birmingham, Alabama. If you  want to work with people on solutions, we have a big tent, and we would  love to see you in your neighborhood.</p><p>STEYN: OK. Big tents we like. And we won't heat them with conventional  energy sources.</p><p>REYNOLDS: OK.</p><p>STEYN: Thank you for that, Mark. Happy post-Boxing Day to you. </p><p>It's time for Tucker's Final Exam.

Question one, an outgoing Democrat Senator just blasted  newcomer Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez calling her a shiny new object with cheap  rhetoric.

It's Two-Zero. </p><p>Question four, multiple choice.</p><p>SHIMKUS: One-zero.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Isn't it two-ones?</p><p>STEYN: Oh, no, one - one-zero.</p><p>MONTGOMERY: Yes.</p><p>SHIMKUS: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: One-zero.

This is a multiple choice question. There's a crisis  on the International Space Station. Something mysterious was found by  astronauts inside a capsule that recently docked there. And Russian  officials say it's the result of a major breach.

Here's what happened.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: MEN IN AMERICA.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TUCKER CARLSON- HOST: If you look at the numbers, you quickly conclude that  men are in crisis in America. Compared to women, they are far more likely  to drop out of school, fail to graduate, go to jail, not hold a job, commit  suicide, die of a drug overdose. </p><p>And yet, the establishment, and particularly, Democratic establishment  seems uninterested in all of this. And they think - they appear to think  that men are still too successful and need to be held back.</p><p>Andrew Yarrow is a former New York Times reporter, a Senior Fellow with the  Progressive Policy Institute. He just wrote an important new book called,  Man Out: Men on the Sidelines of American Life. He joins us tonight in  studio.</p><p>Mr. Yarrow - Yarrow, thank you very much for coming on.</p><p>ANDREW YARROW, FORMER NEW YORK TIMES REPORTER, PROGRESSIVE POLICY INSTITUTE  SENIOR FELLOW, MAN OUT AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker, it's a pleasure--</p><p>CARLSON: So, I should, perhaps if I'm (ph) saying--</p><p>YARROW: --yes.</p><p>CARLSON: --I don't think you're a conservative activist, and that I'm also  grateful that someone is saying this because the numbers support that it's  true.</p><p>YARROW: It is true. And, as you say, the problem has really largely been  ignored. I mean Democrats and a lot of people in the country don't see men  as having problems. But there are a lot of men who are struggling,  struggling with work, struggling in families, struggling with health, lot  of areas I touch on in my book.</p><p>CARLSON: Well, to such a great extent that it would seem a crisis that  affects everybody because, of course, men and women need each other to  reproduce on the most basic level, but also every - everybody has a father  or brother, sons--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --why do you think it's been ignored?</p><p>YARROW: Well, there's been a lot of political correctness in this country  that's kind of made the main narrative be that, you know, women are the  oppressed ones. And they have been historically--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: --oppressed. But, you know, that doesn't mean that there aren't a  lot of men struggling. I mean you don't - it's not a zero-sum game.</p><p>CARLSON: You're right.</p><p>YARROW: And--</p><p>CARLSON: But it's been presented as one that one sex succeeds only when  another moves backward. Where'd that assumption come from?</p><p>YARROW: Well, I think a lot of politics looks at things that way. And I  think it's - it's pretty unfortunate. But I think, you know, men have not  been, in many ways, good at advocating for themselves.</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: I mean it's been interesting in the last few elections. A lot of  the political activists have been women. I mean you hear more from women  these days. I mean men aren't good at forming groups--</p><p>CARLSON: Yes.</p><p>YARROW: --anymore.</p><p>CARLSON: So, you work at - at the Progressive Policy Institute. You're a  Fellow there. That's not the Heritage Foundation.</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: I think it's fair to say you probably work in a mostly Liberal  world.</p><p>YARROW: Yes.</p><p>CARLSON: What kind of reaction did your piece get among people you know?</p><p>YARROW: Well, it's interesting. Conservative media have tended to like it  more. It's, you know, it's kind of troubling that this should be a  bipartisan issue. </p><p>I mean all Americans should be doing well or should have the opportunity to  do well. And they should also have justice behind them. I mean men are  being accused wrongly. I mean there are a lot of awful things that men do.  Don't get me wrong but--</p><p>CARLSON: Well sure.</p><p>YARROW: --but, you know, the lack of due process in some of these sexual  assault allegations, it's, you know, it's pretty troubling. </p><p>CARLSON: It's just interesting because the most progressive President the  country's ever had, FDR, four terms, the first thing he did after getting  elected in 1932, the very first piece through the Congress was the CCC, the  Civilian Conservation Corps, which was--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --aimed at young men, just men between--</p><p>YARROW: Right.</p><p>CARLSON: --18 and 25 or something like that--</p><p>YARROW: Right</p><p>CARLSON: --getting them back to work and restoring their vitality through  work. What would happen if a Democrat in the modern era suggested something  like that?</p><p>YARROW: Well, you think it would play well. You know, while the  unemployment statistics look good, there are a lot of men who've either  been pushed out of the labor force or dropped out. I mean they're about 17  - 18 percent of 25 to 64 year old men, who aren't working. </p><p>And, you know, there are a lot of men - younger men, who are neither in  school or working. So, you know, why is that? And, you know, why can't we  create better jobs for them? And yes, I mean you'd think a Democrat would  pitch some kind of jobs program.</p><p>CARLSON: I think I mean this is a longer conversation but I think the  answer is toxic masculinity.</p><p>YARROW: Yes, I mean the--</p><p>CARLSON: Whatever that means.</p><p>YARROW: Well, yes. I mean that's become the phrase du jour, I guess. I mean  there are clearly issues with masculinity. You know, I interviewed a lot of  men and some women around the country, about 200. And a lot of men told me,  a lot of, you know, even Liberal men said, \"Well feminism's done a lot for  women. But what's it done for me?\"</p><p>CARLSON: Well that's a - that's a fair question. And you ask it in this  book. Thank you for doing that.</p><p>YARROW: Thank you.</p><p>CARLSON: Great to talk to you.</p><p>YARROW: Good to talk to you.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TEXT: TECH TYRANNY.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEYN: That's one of the biggest stories of our time, so is this one.</p><p>Big tech has become the greatest threat to Americans' privacy and personal  freedoms. But now, Americans seem to be wising up to that. A new survey  finds that Americans trust Facebook less than any other company. Also, a  growing number of Americans seeking treatment for tech addiction as they  find themselves unable to look away from social media, their smartphones or  video games.</p><p>Tom Kersting is a family therapist and the Author of Disconnected: How to  Reconnect Our Digitally Distracted Kids. I've read that book, and so should  you. And he joins us now.</p><p>Just to go with the Tucker, the big story of our time thing, when you look  at this so-called tech addiction, and you follow where that leads, you -  you do worry that in some ways these rinky-dinky little things that started  as cat video sites somehow basically re-wiring humanity.</p><p>TOM KERSTING, PSYCHOTHERAPIST, DISCONNECTED AUTHOR: They are. I mean if we  looked out the back window right now and - and counted how many people were  walking by staring at their phones, you'd probably have 70 percent of them  doing that. </p><p>And when it comes to addiction which, obviously, I've studied in my  background, basically if anything, whether it's gambling, alcohol, drugs,  anything that's considered addictive its - if it's affecting one of the  following four, you could be diagnosed as - as an addict.</p><p>And the four things are, is it affecting your family, is it affecting your  health, is it affecting your job or your occupation, and is it affecting  have you had any legal issues?</p><p>STEYN: Right.</p><p>KERSTING: And when we look at technology, we could check off each one of  those for many, many people. So, therefore, this whole addictive whether  it's a debate or not, I'm all about, I believe in a 100 percent.</p><p>STEYN: The - the difference being though that it's actually being kind of  organized on a global scale with--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --billions and billions of people. And when you look at children,  like middle-schoolers--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes, yes.</p><p>STEYN: --who've never known anything but this world, their behavior does  seem to be not where middle-schoolers were--</p><p>KERSTING: It's--</p><p>STEYN: --20, 50, 70 years ago.</p><p>KERSTING: --it's actually unbelievable. I tell people I - I - I get more  middle-school age kids with major anxiety disorders per year now--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --in my private practice than I did the previous 17 years  combined.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: And, you know, and you could - all the research that's done to  put - start to show that, starting to point to, you know, that the  absorption of social media, the lack of - of self, the lack of a sense of  self and so forth and how that's affecting the self-esteem and causing, you  know, issues with anxiety, depression, and other - other mental health -  health things.</p><p>STEYN: People do actually seem to prefer it though. You have a scene in  your book where you talk about when you were a young guy, just sitting at a  bar, you'd never know who's on the barstool next.</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: I can relate to that. Sometimes--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --you find yourself on the other side of the wall, you're sitting  next to an Australian, a Hungarian--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --you - you meet different people with different views. Now everyone  in the bar is just like--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --scrolling the phone.</p><p>KERSTING: When you go into the - the airport, if you travel, which, you  know--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --you do, I do. They have the screens in front of every barstool.</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: So, like, you and I--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --instead of hanging out, talking with one another and--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --and kicking it off, now everybody's distracted by these  devices.</p><p>STEYN: Right. Sometimes--</p><p>KERSTING: So the--</p><p>STEYN: --you want to go where only Facebook knows--</p><p>KERSTING: --so - so it's like a - it's like--</p><p>STEYN: --you're in that area (ph).</p><p>KERSTING: --right. It's like bottles of wine dangling around if you're an  alcoholic--</p><p>STEYN: Yes, yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --24 hours a day, seven days a week, you can't escape from it.</p><p>STEYN: Yes. That's - that's a - that's a - a worrying thing. As I said, I  think this is one of the biggest stories of time, Tom. I dread (ph) to  think--</p><p>KERSTING: Yes.</p><p>STEYN: --where we're going to be if - if we're - if we don't change it. But  how do we change it?</p><p>KERSTING: Well we have - it's - it's not something that's going to happen  overnight. We just have to keep creating awareness, having conversations  like you and I are having right now, so that people could see this. They  can understand the ramifications of these things. I'm one of the guys out  there, you know, that's lecturing--</p><p>STEYN: Yes.</p><p>KERSTING: --that's writing about it and that's out there trying to get  other people to do the same. And it's - it's going to be a slow process but  I think we're going to have to get there.</p><p>STEYN: OK. Well we will - we will hold you to that Tom because something -  these companies are bigger than countries now. </p><p>That is about it for us tonight.

Overall M&amp;A deal value is down 26% to $626 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Economic uncertainty, leading to a cautious attitude among businesses, is the big reason, with the looming fiscal cliff having an impact in the U.S.</p><p>But the fuel to ignite activity is there. Big tech companies such as Cisco Systems, Microsoft and Apple have billions of dollars in cash. Interest rates are low, with easy access to money for firms with good credit.</p><p>For now, though, M&amp;A deals that are getting done aren't blockbusters.</p><p>It's a similar story with initial public offerings. IPOs are being made, but few are blockbusters.</p><p>\"There remains a hunker-down mentality,\" said Matthew Porzio, marketing vice president at enterprise software maker IntraLinks Holdings. \"Our (M&amp;A) deal flow indicator in the third quarter shows a slowdown from the second.\"</p><p>Yet it's as if the spring is coiled and ready to fly. Private equity firms are watching the market and willing to jump into M&amp;As if conditions improve, Porzio says.</p><p>\"What we're hearing from clients is that everyone has this cautious optimism, a guarded confidence that 2013 will be better,\" Porzio said. \"All they are waiting for is some really positive news or some significant deals that will build momentum.\"</p><p>Nearly 60% of 143 U.S. private equity firms polled recently by accounting firm Grant Thornton International said they expect M&amp;As to increase in 2013, but by how much depends on the economy, competitive forces and government regulations.</p><p>Private equity companies often seek to acquire firms with a long-term intent on selling them at a profit or seeing them through an IPO. Some might keep acquisitions, improve operations and use profit to help with other deals.</p><p>Not Enough Active Buyers</p><p>In 2012, private equity was more active in the consumer, health care, business service, industrial and manufacturing sectors, says the Grant Thornton report. But private equity isn't seeing enough acquirers or attractive IPO possibilities.</p><p>\"Initial public offerings are becoming even less relevant as an option for liquidity,\" the Grant Thornton report said.</p><p>Data from market research firm Ipreo back that up. The firm found that the number of companies awaiting an IPO has steadily declined this year.</p><p>Of companies that have filed for an IPO or amended such a filing in the past six months, just 35 are in the pipeline, Ipreo says. That's down from 87 since January. Of those 35, health care accounts for the most, at nine, followed by technology, at five.</p><p>This year, 126 IPOs have launched on U.S. markets, the same number as last year, Ipreo says.</p><p>Telecommunications is the one field ripe with M&amp;A potential, according to a study by IBISWorld.</p><p>A flurry of M&amp;A activity among wireless communication providers has led to renewed talks of long-expected industry consolidation.</p><p>In October, Deutsche Telekom entered into a $1.5 billion agreement to merge its T-Mobile USA unit with prepaid carrier MetroPCS, the No. 5 U.S. wireless carrier.</p><p>Japanese mobile operator Softbank in October agreed to buy about 70% of Sprint Nextelfor $20 billion, giving it a toehold in the U.S. and giving Sprint money it needs to expand its network and, perhaps, make acquisitions. \"A consensus is that things are coming to head in the U.S. market for wireless telecom operators, as with a saturated market an acquisition is the best way to grow,\" said Kevin Boyland, an IBISWorld analyst.</p><p>It's unlikely that AT&amp;T and Verizon Communications will be able to pull off a mega deal, due to regulatory constraints, but others have plenty of opportunity.</p><p>\"There are a lot of smaller regional carriers that T-Mobile or Sprint could be interested in,\" Boyland said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVDLY-4274273</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVDLY2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:576M-DWB1-DYTD-938Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"665\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Investor's Business Daily, Inc.

We all know about the limited distance that these can travel, but what about the charging infrastructure? It will be OK for the better-off whose houses have drives where they can install a charging point, but what about all the folks who do not have this facility? Will they be obliged to run cables across the pavement? Apart from that, will the local sub-stations be able to cope with such a high demand for power at night time? It seems to me that the government is quite happy for the not-so-well-off in our society to be barred from driving in these everincreasing zero emission zones. Electric vehicles that need charging externally are flawed, for me even LPG is a better zero emission option.</p><p>Martyn Lomas Coventry Social media sites must tackle abuse THE Home Secretary recently laid down a much-needed challenge to big tech companies at the NSPCC's HQ in London.</p><p>Sajid Javid said he was demanding change to protect children from online groomers as well as urging the industry to tackle the vile trade in indecent images.</p><p>NSPCC research shows that the equivalent of one child in every primary school classroom surveyed has been sent a naked or semi-naked image from an adult; and one in 50 had sent a nude or seminude image to an adult. Those images and messages are sent through social networks and texting apps, which recklessly expose children to content and behaviours completely inappropriate for their age, and now social networks have become a gateway to child abuse.</p><p>Social media sites often know where we shop, what we buy and even where we go on holiday to target us with adverts. If they can use that technology for profit, then why not to flag the risks to our children and proactively detect these groomers? The government must now force social networks to tackle the problem blighting their sites, and that means changing the law.</p><p>The NSPCC's Wild West Web campaign is calling on Mr Javid and culture secretary Jeremy Wright to create an independent regulator with the power to investigate and to fine social networks which fall short.</p><p>Social networks must also be forced to publish annual transparency reports about the scale of abuse on their platforms.</p><p>In the coming months the government will publish its White Paper setting out proposals for what social network regulation could look like.

And why does the prime minister, arguing the value of investment in that developing continent, impose such life-sapping Tory austerity in our own country? Spending billions on international development is in Britain's interest, creating trade and prosperity while helping to keep us safe. Never forget the loudest Tory critics of aid also championed the cuts at home which have squeezed living standards and crippled the NHS.

The survey , released Thursday, is the latest sign of U.S. consumers becoming more critical of Silicon Valley over the past few years, and at a time when lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are ramping up calls for more regulation.   For consumers, privacy has been a major concern in recent years, especially since the 2016 Cambridge Analytica scandal and its effect on the presidential election.   An overwhelming 85 percent of respondents said they were concerned by the amount of data online platforms store about them, and 81 percent expressed concern that platforms are holding that data to build out consumer profiles.   \u201cThe collection of personal data, too often without the permission or even awareness of the user, and the inability of these companies to take responsibility for content that is shared on their platforms, raises serious ethical questions about these platforms,\u201d Consumer Reports policy analyst Laurel Lehman said in a statement.   The release of the survey results come as multiple investigations into the country\u2019s biggest technology companies are coming to a close. Many of those investigations, led both by regulators and lawmakers, focus on competition concerns in the digital marketplace.   Seventy-nine percent of poll respondents said big tech mergers and acquisitions hurt competition and consumer choice.   \u201cAmericans are frustrated with the behavior of these massive technology companies. Because these companies have demonstrated an unwillingness to hold themselves accountable, consumers want policymakers to take action to rein in the power of these platforms,\u201d Jonathan Schwantes, senior policy counsel for Consumer Reports, said in a statement.   The poll of 3,219 adults was conducted in July by NORC at the University of Chicago. The margin of error for the sample was plus or minus 2.17 percentage points.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43155197101</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XC-9YG1-JCSC-J2C3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"376\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>The Hill</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 24, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

It was conducted in August for The Ryerson Leadership Lab.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There seems to be support for change in these platforms,\" says Sam Andrey, director of policy and research for the university think-tank, which studies leadership and the democratic process. \"Attitudes are definitely shifting. More people than not think there is a role for government.\"</p><p>The poll didn't ask exactly how government should regulate Big Tech, but most respondents supported moves such as requiring platforms to delete illegal content such as hate speech in a timely manner (77 per cent) or posts that intentionally spread misinformation (75 per cent). Respondents also supported requiring platforms to develop third-party fact checking verification of news posts, and increasing digital and media literary education (70 per cent).</p><p>However, only 36 per cent said they were strongly or somewhat supportive of breaking up social media platforms like Facebook, while 45 per cent were neutral on the issue. Nineteen per cent of respondents felt strongly, or somewhat did not support breaking up the platforms.</p><p>Among social media companies, Facebook is the least trusted by Canadians. But social media companies in general rank the lowest in trust overall, below that of oil companies, telecom providers, banks and traditional news media.</p><p>Andrey says there has been a shift in public sentiment in the wake of scandals involving privacy, data dumping, fake news and targeted political advertising that have made Canadians more skeptical of Big Tech.</p><p>\"I think in the wake of issues such as Brexit, the Trump presidency and Cambridge Analytica, you are seeing a general distrust of social media,\" says Andrey.</p><p>The survey revealed that 95 per cent of respondents get their information from Google search compared to 86 per cent from television and 73 per cent from print newspapers.</p><p>Ryerson also asked whether Canadians should go the route of France and impose a three per cent tax on large technology companies. The United States has pushed back against the tax, saying it unfairly targets American companies.</p><p>Because big technology companies typically aren't headquartered in the countries they do business in, critics say they pay far less taxes than they should be required to, which has become a bone of contention for lawmakers globally.</p><p>Thirty-eight per cent of Canadians either strongly or somewhat supported a tax, while 30 per cent strongly or somewhat didn't support the tax, showing that opinion is divided.</p><p>\"It did surprise me a bit that opinion would be so split,\" says Andrey. \"Although Canadians do generally have an aversion to paying higher taxes, this isn't about individuals paying the tax. It speaks to the fact there is probably more work to do in this area. Perhaps to unpack for people how valuable these companies are and the impact they are having domestically.\"</p><p>Ryerson's leadership lab has also teamed up with the British firm Who Targets Me to monitor the current federal election, launching Who Targets Me Canada.</p><p>The app allows Canadians to see a personalized breakdown of how political parties are targeting them with Facebook advertising. Facebook has also put in a library that allows users to see how much political parties are spending on advertising.</p><p>\"People recognize now that new technology is not an unalloyed good,\" says Sam Jeffers, founder of the non-partisan Who Targets Me. \"We have to ensure that the platforms are not the only people who are enforcing their rules.\"</p><p>Jeffers, a visiting global fellow at the Ryerson Leadership Lab has implemented his software in the German and U.K. elections.</p><p>\"Some of the players are bypassing traditional media with misinformation and we try to put this stuff in proper context so there is more transparency,\" says Jeffers. \"It creates a problem if people lose faith in the democratic process.\"</p><p>The survey by Abacus revealed that 36 per cent of Canadians would ban targeted advertising if they could. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 1.8 per cent 19 times out of 20.</p><p>\"I think there is definitely concern over how political parties are using personal information to target Canadians,\" says Andrey. \"And there are obviously strong feelings on this.

It was conducted in August for The Ryerson Leadership Lab.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There seems to be support for change in these platforms,\" says Sam Andrey, director of policy and research for the university think-tank, which studies leadership and the democratic process. \"Attitudes are definitely shifting. More people than not think there is a role for government.\"</p><p>The poll didn't ask exactly how government should regulate Big Tech, but most respondents supported moves such as requiring platforms to delete illegal content such as hate speech in a timely manner (77 per cent) or posts that intentionally spread misinformation (75 per cent). Respondents also supported requiring platforms to develop third-party fact checking verification of news posts, and increasing digital and media literary education (70 per cent).</p><p>However, only 36 per cent said they were strongly or somewhat supportive of breaking up social media platforms like Facebook, while 45 per cent were neutral on the issue. Nineteen per cent of respondents felt strongly, or somewhat did not support breaking up the platforms.</p><p>Among social media companies, Facebook is the least trusted by Canadians. But social media companies in general rank the lowest in trust overall, below that of oil companies, telecom providers, banks and traditional news media.</p><p>Andrey says there has been a shift in public sentiment in the wake of scandals involving privacy, data dumping, fake news and targeted political advertising that have made Canadians more skeptical of Big Tech.</p><p>\"I think in the wake of issues such as Brexit, the Trump presidency and Cambridge Analytica, you are seeing a general distrust of social media,\" says Andrey.</p><p>The survey revealed that 95 per cent of respondents get their information from Google search compared to 86 per cent from television and 73 per cent from print newspapers.</p><p>Ryerson also asked whether Canadians should go the route of France and impose a three per cent tax on large technology companies. The United States has pushed back against the tax, saying it unfairly targets American companies.</p><p>Because big technology companies typically aren't headquartered in the countries they do business in, critics say they pay far less taxes than they should be required to, which has become a bone of contention for lawmakers globally.</p><p>Thirty-eight per cent of Canadians either strongly or somewhat supported a tax, while 30 per cent strongly or somewhat didn't support the tax, showing that opinion is divided.</p><p>\"It did surprise me a bit that opinion would be so split,\" says Andrey. \"Although Canadians do generally have an aversion to paying higher taxes, this isn't about individuals paying the tax. It speaks to the fact there is probably more work to do in this area. Perhaps to unpack for people how valuable these companies are and the impact they are having domestically.\"</p><p>Ryerson's leadership lab has also teamed up with the British firm Who Targets Me to monitor the current federal election, launching Who Targets Me Canada.</p><p>The app allows Canadians to see a personalized breakdown of how political parties are targeting them with Facebook advertising.

This is Vincent Shen. Thanks to all the Fools out there tuning in. It is Wednesday, January 25th and we're pre-recording this episode to take advantage of the fact that Fool.com contributor Seth McNew is here in D.C. this week and in studio with me right now. Seth, welcome back to Industry Focus, how has 2017 been treating you so far?</p><p>Seth McNew: Thanks a lot, Vince! It's been good, I just got back from a long trip in Asia, so I am excited to be back in the States.</p><p>Shen: Yes, and we will hear a little bit about that. Where did you go?</p><p>McNew: I went to few places. I started in Tokyo and then onto Macau.</p><p>Shen: Okay, excellent. That Macau leg of your trip is what we will be talking about a little bit. Even Tokyo, too, will play into it toward the end of the show, because today we're talking about hospitality, gaming, and a few developments with a notable former start-up, upstart and then also a kind of outlook for gaming and how some of the new resorts in Macau have been performing and what you've seen firsthand from your trip.</p><p>For our first topic we'd like to revisit Airbnb a little bit. I actually was surprised to find that we haven't really covered the company, substantially at least since 2015. Of course, they have not gone through their IPO yet, but some of the rumors are building up that 2017 is going to be the year after 2016 amounted to a rather slow year for Silicon Valley IPOs. Airbnb though, just in case for anyone who hasn't used the service, quick overview what it is, what they do.</p><p>McNew: Yes, sure. Airbnb at its core, it's booking rooms but through private listers. As opposed to a hotel that either licenses or owns properties and you're booking straight through them. Airbnb is just the social platform that allows people with open rooms to list those rooms and then renters can go on the app and book a room.</p><p>Shen: The way I've heard you describe which I really like is, you're essentially crowdsourcing various places to stay in these various cities all over the world, and their reach is incredible now, I think they're in like a 190 countries. Airbnb started in 2008. They have millions and millions of guests across many, many, many listings. I think the theme that we're seeing that will take the focus today for the company is that for a long time now in the overall vacation travel booking industry, companies likePriceline,Expediahave seen the value in bundling essentially. By offering you or giving you the option to book through them, not only your airfare, but we where you're going to stay, maybe your car rental, by bundling that and giving you a discount, it's still more lucrative for the company. It seems like with some recent news in November and December that Airbnb is very much embracing this model with the launch of what they're calling Trips, right?</p><p>McNew: Right. It's pretty amazing to remember that Airbnb is less than a decade old. It started in 2008 and here we saw it was disrupting the hotel industry and maybe now online travel agencies, maybe something else but the launch of Trips really shows how they're able to use their platform to really diversify.</p><p>Shen: In case you haven't seen the release for Trips, the way they describe it, kind of break it down into three components which is their Experiences, their Places, and their Homes. The Experiences aspect of it is very interesting. I believe they started testing for this as early as June of last year, but I think the more official release went out in November. As of early December, the most recent number I could find, Airbnb is offering 500 experiences available in about 12 cities around the world, and I am pretty sure that is expanding quickly to at least another 30 or 40 cities if it hasn't already. Just an example, and I think it's really interesting what these experiences might be, one example is you get to surf and explore the outdoors with a local in Los Angeles. The price is for three days of this immersed experience is $349 per person.</p><p>Another example, in Tokyo, where you just came from, you learn the art of the samurai. This is another that they kind of highlight on the Airbnb site. Two days for $437, and you can even book with hosts who have partnered with nonprofit organizations, and the company cites that 100% of the guest payment goes to the organization itself which I thought was interesting.</p><p>Reading through the frequently asked questions for people who would like to host an experience, they've obviously implemented some pretty strict standards making the experience unique, value-added, having that local touch and flavor that you might not be able to get as a tourist traveling there just for a week or two. These experiences can break down into two categories from what I find. Something that's just a couple hours and then something that's more of a multi-day immersion.</p><p>I was surprised they actually mentioned these numbers. The average price for bookings for the shorter experiences is just a $100, whereas the average for the multi-day immersions is about $270. The way the company makes money here is they collect a 20% booking service fee on the experiences from the hosts, not the guests, which is interesting because for their more traditional business model, they have that 3% listing fee I believe it is, and they charge usually 6% to 12% of the cost of the stay to the guests.</p><p>That's the Experiences part of it . . .</p><p>McNew: This is just by chance, I did one of these in Tokyo. I did an experience so I took a . . .</p><p>Shen: Oh, perfect! Here we go.</p><p>McNew: I took a bike ride around Tokyo. It happened to be an American who's been living in Tokyo. It was about three hours long. He took us on a bike all around these alley ways in Tokyo and we got to see the city. It was only about $22. It was great, we got to message with him on the app right before hand, all the payments were taken through Airbnb.</p><p>Shen: Did he just stay with you for like an afternoon about?</p><p>McNew: Yeah. I think it started in the mid-afternoon. We took a bike ride around sunset, and then we all had dinner together. It was definitely a full experience and well worth the $22 for sure.</p><p>Shen: Awesome! That sounds really cool. This, again, is part of Airbnb's efforts to start branching out beyond just the where you put your head each night, and to bring in not just the experiences like what you just described. The second part of this Trips platform which is what they describe as their Places. This has several options itself. The first one I could that find was with these guidebooks. I'm not sure if you saw any of these during your travels, but they call them Insider Guidebooks. Basically, the press release describes them as \"hidden gems identified by cultural experts and neighborhood insiders.\" There's a hundred of these guidebooks available at launch in six cities. They're also pushing meetups, I think encouraging local businesses to organize meetups among locals and also travelers in the same city. They have these audio walks where they partner with Detour. At launch, it's only available in Los Angeles, but that's expected to expand to San Francisco, Paris, London, Tokyo, and Seoul this spring. It's basically supposed to be unique, very much value-added audio walks.</p><p>Those are the two components, and of course the third component of the trips is what they describe as Homes which is their traditional business. I found the exact numbers here. They have three million homes now available in 50,000 cities spread across 191 countries. Quite the footprint. Overall, what do you think about . . . I think the question that a lot of people have on their mind around Airbnb with this news and in general, the company having at this point a $30 billion valuation, when is the IPO going to happen? I know a lot of this is going to be coming from rumors and the momentum of other deals, but what do you think?</p><p>McNew: Yeah, exactly! It's really all speculation at this point. The company hasn't announced any specific plans other than saying that they are working to shore up their financial position so that they're ready for an IPO, but pretty much the CEO says it's not in their near-term plans. Now what near-term means, none of us know. Does that mean late 2017, we're not really sure. I think the really interesting part is that the valuation is there. Their most recent round, which was in part by an arm ofAlphabet, listing them as valuing at $30 billion, second largest right behindMarriott.</p><p>Shen: The company at this point has raised specifically over $3 billion in it's eight, nine years of existence. With that $30 billion valuation, for the numbers that I could find, it's really hard obviously because they haven't filed an S-1 or anything like that, but the 2015 revenue number that I could find was $900 million. Estimates of 2016 revenue at $1.7 billion which is 90% year-over-year top line growth, pretty incredible. Definitely seems like they're managing to maintain that momentum behind new listings being added, guests buying into the service, but the core issue for a lot of these unicorns still is on the bottom line. Not surprisingly, the company is still operating at a loss. The most recent number I could find was for 2015. The operating loss was estimated as $150 million. You're absolutely right, company management could be biding their time trying to figure out -- the process might take six months, but you want to know what the market is like for IPOs. One bad deal from a big tech start-up could spell bad news for a lot of deals that are expected to come after that.</p><p>Beyond Airbnb though, or beyond the IPO, I think another issue is of the legal challenges and regulations you mentioned to me before the show that when you just search news for Airbnb, the majority of the content is around some legal challenge or hearing in some city abroad or even within the States like New York City. What are they facing right now? What's the big challenge?</p><p>McNew: I think you're right, and it's coming from cities internationally as well. Europe, they're having huge issues with that, some of the government regulations there. I think the big challenge is, how are you going to maintain that top line growth if your biggest markets, New York, San Francisco, if the governments there are working to limit how much people can make using Airbnb, how long they can list properties for -- those kinds of things.</p><p>I think they're doing the right things to try to combat this. They're diversifying a little bit. They're working with regulators to make sure that they can get the right tax information. They recently, last year had hired former US Attorney General Eric Holder to be on their board to help them navigate some of these things. I think they're doing the right things. It's certainly a risk, but we'll just have to see how that shapes out.</p><p>Shen: For anyone who's traveled with Airbnb and you love the service, some of the, I guess the qualms that local governments have had is the issue of the short-term rentals potentially limiting housing availability in already very high demand metropolitan cities. Also, driving up pricing for a lot of housing. I think the company has made efforts as a result of all these lawsuits and hearings to try and crack down a little bit on what essentially amount to professional Airbnb landlords.</p><p>People who have multiple listings. Instead of being somewhere they live, and that they rent out on occasion, I think the limit in certain places for example is 90 days a year. No more than 90 days in the U.K., but some of these properties are available 40 weeks a year. Obviously, that is their business to rent it out on a regular basis, that's having issues on housing market in general in these cities. That seems to be the issue people are trying to figure out. Take all that into account, I think the question becomes also -- $30 billion company now, you mentioned second one behind Marriott -- what has the rise of Airbnb done to the more traditional hospitality industry? How are some of these players facing it? Do you think it is all that different for example, from Marriott's business model which is very franchise and management based?</p><p>McNew: Yes, I think when we look at those three million listings, that's obviously a lot more. Marriott has 1.1 million rooms around the world.</p><p>Shen: In its whole network.</p><p>McNew: In its whole network of rooms, but from what I've read, management of these companies doesn't seem too concerned right now. They're biggest business is U.S. business or business around the world. It's kind of business travel and Airbnb really is looking for that more leisure travel. You're not really going to have business conferences in people's private homes. Until Airbnb can kind of figure out that part of it, I think these hotels are pretty well insulated, but of course it's still eating into some of their business and when you're in a very low growth sector that hotels are in right now, that's going to be an issue.</p><p>Looking back in 2016, the market hasn't been too concerned clearly. Marriott,Hilton,\u00a0andHyatt's stock prices all risen over 20% each throughout 2016, so they've done OK, even with this threat.</p><p>Shen: Okay. Overall, I definitely will be curious to follow the news, see when this company starts maybe management commentary, narrows down the timing a little bit. I think a company that everyone is watching to drive or to set the pace or set the tone for IPOs this year will be Snap. That seems to be the one that's expected near term. Other big deals like Uber and Airbnb will follow. We'll have to watch, see how the market reception is to these earlier deals.</p><p>Moving on now to your travels a little bit, let's first go to Macau. I've had you on here before as like my insider having lived there for a little bit, and experience again now at the newest resorts that have opened fromWynn (NASDAQ: WYNN) and other major casino operators in that region. What did you see?</p><p>McNew: Macau has grown so much since I lived there. It was great to be back. The city looks completely different. There are tons of new resorts open, but what struck me is, it didn't seem to have that many people. Having come from Vegas, the resorts look amazing and the whole area, and Macau has really grown up. It's just not like packed streets like you'd see in Vegas. That was a bit of a concern, but the resorts themselves . . . I went to each of the new resorts. I'd say the two that really struck out were the new Wynn Palace which is just opulent and incredible. There's a gondola that takes you from the front side of the lake all the way up to your room. Inside it's just like you'd expect from Wynn. It's beautiful in its design. Great shopping, great casinos. There's not really a lot of entertainment aspects of it outside of the shopping and casinos, but that's kind of Wynn style.</p><p>Moving on toLas Vegas Sands (NYSE: LVS)\u00a0though, this was my favorite, it's the Parisian. It's kind of this French inspired resort. A 50%-scale Eiffel Tower right outside. You walk in, there are mime shows, there are clowns walking around. The place is the most interesting casino I've been in in any country yet.</p><p>Shen: Did you notice at all, I think, a big trend that people have talked about in Macau was the decline of what was previously the segment that really drove business there which was the VIPs. Did you feel like as these resorts, the industry overall tries to target what they call the mass market gamblers a little bit more. Did you see that actually when you were at the resorts in terms of the tables, the clientele there? Did you feel like you saw a lot more high roller VIPs which you might expect at Wynn, known for its opulence versus some of the other resorts or anything like that?</p><p>McNew: Yeah. I think that gets back to kind of how the companies even before Macau taking it's dive pitched to their audience. Wynn is much more upscale kind of VIP experience, as it is in Las Vegas. Las Vegas Sands has always been kind of more of that mass market, but even more so now you really see that divide where when you go to the Parisian, that's the Las Vegas Sands, when you really see that it's entertainment first and gambling second, where the Wynn still feels the other way. It still feels gambling first, entertainment second.</p><p>Shen: Okay. For the market overall, do you feel like it's finally at that point where people are seeing that recovery after a year, year and half, two years at most of ongoing declines. Month over month seeing their overall gaming revenue in that region fall by pretty significant amounts. How are the numbers now for that region looking?</p><p>McNew: It was actually a little longer. I think it was 26 months of year-over-year declines since 2014. Actually, January was the fifth month in a row of year-over-year increases, at 8%, nothing to shake a leg at. It's definitely starting to grow again. Full-year for 2016 was still down 3% over 2015, but analysts are expecting that 2017 will return to growth for the first time in a while. I think that's looking pretty good.</p><p>For how much gambling revenue Macau still has, which is about three times as much as Las Vegas, it still just has a lot fewer visitors than Las Vegas has. I think ramping up the number of visitors with things like governments having better policies toward visitation, more entertainment focused things to the mass market. I think we're really going to see a change there in the next couple of years.</p><p>Shen: Just to add some context if you haven't been following the situation, I feel like overall, tourist traffic levels to that region took a dive overall once the Chinese government kind of cracked down on some of the VIP gaming. This was around more issues with like money laundering and essentially the ultra-wealthy in China taking their money out of the country and using Macau to kind of cycle it through. The President and the rest of the Government had a real crack down policy on that which really shifted things from Macau resorts catering to VIPs, to trying to reach a wider audience.</p><p>McNew: Yeah, and it actually wasn't just the VIPs, it was even just travel restrictions for all people from mainland China going into Macau for amount of time they could spend, how often they could return to Macau. Those regulations kind of eased up a little bit in 2016 which helped those numbers to grow a little bit, but as we saw in December, there was news that the Chinese government was going to restrict ATM withdrawals, which again sent each of these stocks down. We can see that it's still volatile there. I'm trying to understand what the government policies will be, but as of right now, it still looks pretty positive.</p><p>Shen: The last topic I wanted to touch on, and this is a huge opportunity, big news for the gaming industry was in December. The Japanese Parliament finally passed the law legalizing casinos. Still a lot of work to be done on the regulation side of determining taxes, social programs things like that, but overall, it appears that government leaders will be welcoming some of the major casino operators like the ones we've talked about: Wynn, Las Vegas Sands,MGM. The thing is, seems like they're targeting not smaller operations, but these large integrated resorts, kind of looking to Singapore, for example, as a model.</p><p>According to one piece of research I found, it's from Daiwa Research, they estimate that just three casinos in Japan could generate as much as $10 billion in annual net profits in this market. What do you think? What is some of the timing? How are companies viewing this? Because this seems like a huge, huge opportunity.</p><p>McNew: Yeah, and we've been covering this for a while about every Congress session there. They've really tried to pass this, and it finally got through. People are really excited about this. It still has to go through some regulatory looks before they're going to figure out licensing, but for the companies that win a license to be there, I really think this is the next frontier for growth for this industry.</p><p>Shen: Interestingly enough, I think the casino operators and a lot of other tourists are very excited, but some surveys that I found, actually locally among the Japanese population show quite a bit of actual hesitation about this move. They were like 12% really supported the idea, but the numbers behind this opportunity are undeniable.</p><p>McNew: I think some of that hesitation is just people are afraid of having a casino here. That's why the integrated resort model that worked in Singapore could really work so well. The Singapore government had invited these casinos knowing that it's going to be a small casino, but lots of other entertainment options with full resorts of restaurants and theaters and those kinds of things.</p><p>Shen: Obviously, the political opposition was worried about issues like gambling addiction, money laundering, influence of organized crime, but those are things that they will be working through as a framework gets built out over the next few years. Keep in mind that from what I could find, no one actually expects these new resorts that will be opening in the country to start operations until at least 2022 or 2023, so quite a ways out. Like you said, the licenses haven't even been figured out yet. How many? Who's it going to go to? I'm not sure how much detail you have around this, but I have to imagine that the various major casino operators are already positioning themselves as much as they can to meet partnerships, to get their foot in the door as soon as the flood gates essentially open.</p><p>McNew: I'm sure these licenses will be kind of parsed out with local investors as well, so they'll be some partnerships. I think when you're trying to figure out which companies are going to win licenses, you can just look at what's happened in Singapore. Las Vegas Sands was one of the ones that won there, and its resort there is beautiful. That's kind of become the model of how these integrated resorts can really drive business for a country.</p><p>Shen: Yup. The last thing I will touch on is the fact that Japan itself is no stranger to gambling. There's actually a pretty substantial market there already in two forms that I could find. Currently, horse, boat, and bicycle races already take legal bets, so that's already a pretty well-established industry for gaming in the country. From what I could find, the horse races alone managed to bring in about $25 billion in wagers in 2015, so quite significant.</p><p>You combine that with the existing, and this is a really interesting world. For any Fools listening, do a little bit more research. Just search pachinko parlors or the history of them. It's very interesting. These Pachinko parlors essentially, like adult arcades I guess operate in a bit of a legal gray area, very ambiguous. You collect tokens, you can exchange it for a physical prize to avoid regulations, but then you can take that physical prize to another location and exchange that for cash. It's just gray area, the best way to describe it but, in terms of the size of that market, pachinko players spent almost $200 billion in 2015 which is actually down from I think its height in the 90's. Clearly i think with such a large economy and generally very wealthy citizens, I can totally understand why the casino operators are extremely excited about the market that Japan presents.</p><p>McNew: Absolutely.</p><p>Shen: Otherwise, I'm going to leave it off there. Any other takeaways that you think for Airbnb or gaming industry, Macau? Anything and then we'll just wrap up.</p><p>McNew: No, I'll just say for Airbnb, for anybody who's interested in this space, I would really try to use the platform just to see how well it really does work.</p><p>Shen: Okay. Now that you mention that, there's two other things I forgot to touch on during our previous discussion. This again goes back to the way that they have been trying to bundle as many services as possible. This is something that actually just came through this morning in terms of news, and that is a potential deal that Airbnb might be closing soon with a social payment start-up called Tilt. Basically, would effectively give Airbnb experience with payments, and the key thing is Tilt is focused on social events which allow its users to do things like split bills, plan trips, pay as a group.</p><p>They also have their Trip Itinerary which brings a guests trip timeline all together into something simple and easy to use. I think with each of these moves, integrating everything more and more into the overall Airbnb service really does indicate to me that timing 2017 could very much be the year.</p><p>Thanks a lot, Seth!

The company has faced criticism over the privacy of this data, particularly since the Cambridge Analytica scandal showed misuse and manipulations were possible. On Wednesday, another US agency, the Federal Trade Commission, announced that Facebook has agreed to a settlement of $5 billion for privacy violations. Facebook also agreed to pay a $100 million penalty for misleading securities regulators.</p><p>With Google</p><p>Critics say Google's dominance in search has allowed it to squash rivals - notably because Google can show its own products above competitors' or feature its own ads prominently. Google has also faced scrutiny over the practices to get its search and other products featured on phones. A third major concern is its hold on advertising. The company has been fined 8 billion by EU over antitrust practices in the three areas.</p><p>With Amazon</p><p>Amazon dominates e-commerce in several countries and has faced scrutiny into whether it is using data to gain an edge on third-party merchants, who are both its customers and rivals. One Congressman has said Amazon rolled out replicas under its own brand and then steered customers to its own products. US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin on Wednesday accused Amazon of \"destroying\" retail industry.</p><p>The investigations</p><p>The United States department of justice's (DoJ) antitrust division announced it will investigate whether these companies are using their power to thwart competition. Separately, a US legislative committee also began an unprecedented antitrust probe into Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple over their aggressive business practices.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hindustan Times.

Thank you so much for being with us. I'm Christi Paul.</p><p>SAVIDGE: And I'm Martin Savidge, in for Victor Blackwell.</p><p>Deal or no deal at the U.S./Mexico border? The incoming Mexican government is denying reports in \"The Washington Post\" that it's reached a deal that President Trump keep asylum seekers out of the United States.</p><p>PAUL: Also, embedded enemies around the president. According to \"The Washington Post\", former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says the president is surrounded by disloyal staff and, quote, swamp creatures. The new allegations from those in the president's inner circle.</p><p>But, first, let us wish you good luck if you're traveling today.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Yes.</p><p>PAUL: Major winter storm, it's got heavy snow, strong winds, and expected to make a mess for holiday travelers heading home this weekend.</p><p>SAVIDGE: And if you're one of them, you want to listen up, because CNN meteorologist Allison Chinchar is in the CNN Weather Center with the forecast of what lies ahead -- Allison.</p><p>ALLISON CHINCHAR, CNN METEOROLOGIST: Yes, there's going to be a lot of delays today in multiple different regions. That's going to be the key. In the Northeast, you got some small delays from that system that's beginning to exit. In the Southeast, it's dense fog. In fact, you have over 40 million people under a dense fog advisory.</p><p>But it's the Midwest. This is where we expect to have some of our biggest problems in the next 24 hours. And that's because of our blizzard that is making its way into this region.</p><p>Now, when we talk about, I mean, true blizzard conditions. That doesn't just mean snow. That means incredibly gusty winds as well as very poor visibility. You have over 30 million people under some type of winter weather alert from Colorado all the way over towards Michigan.</p><p>But, again, wind is also a factor with this particular storm, even for the areas that are done with the precipitation, you still have wind gusts up to 65 miles per hour that will linger throughout the day today. In terms of how much snow these areas anticipate getting, why pride amounts about 6 inches but there will be some places that could pick up over a foot of snow. Keep in mind this is a very fast moving system. So they could end up getting that foot of snow in, say, 12 hours or less.</p><p>Here is a look at the system for today, but then as we push into Monday, it begins to transition more to the great lakes region and then gradually into the northeast. So, say, you live in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York. You still want to pay very close attention to this storm because it's likely going to impact your region Monday and then into Tuesday.</p><p>So, Martin and Christi, it's not just travel today but it's likely going to be travel tomorrow as well.</p><p>SAVIDGE: I'm traveling tomorrow.</p><p>CHINCHAR: Sorry, Martin!</p><p>PAUL: Good luck.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Thanks.</p><p>PAUL: Sorry, Martin.</p><p>All righty. Let's talk about the pushback on President Trump's overhaul of the asylum process at the U.S.-Mexico border right now. The plan would require asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their applications process in the U.S. But the incoming Mexican government says it has no reached an agreement with Washington.</p><p>CNN's White House reporter Sarah Westwood is with us now.</p><p>So, Sarah, is the White House giving any clarity this morning as to the president's version and Mexico's version thus far?</p><p>SARAH WESTWOOD, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Christi, there's still a lot of uncertainty about where this deal stands. Mexican leaders are signaling that this is still in the preliminary stages, it's still something that's under negotiation.</p><p>And President Trump is touting this deal as all but a certainty. He tweeted yesterday that migrants who wish to seek asylum in the U.S., they will have to wait in Mexico while their claims are processed by U.S. courts. He said that there will be no longer be this practice of catch and release where migrants are left out of detention into the United States while they wait for their cases to be adjudicated. He described it as catch and detain. That's a phrase we've seen him used before.</p><p>[07:05:02] This deal would represent, if it did come to fruition, a major overhaul of the asylum system. Under current rules, migrants are eligible to request asylum once they are on U.S. soil. The president has already attempted to make sweeping changes to asylum policy.</p><p>In fact, just a few weeks ago, he unveiled a proposed rule change that would require migrants if they wish to seem asylum to present themselves at legal point of entry. It denied them the ability to request asylum if they're caught crossing the border illegally. But, of course, a judge blocked that proposed executive action and the president has been fixated on that decision, tweeting about the decision, tweeting about asylum and immigration as he's been spending the Thanksgiving holiday here in West Palm Beach.</p><p>So, he'll be wrapping up his travel to his property Mar-a-Lago today and then he'll be heading back to Washington before going to Mississippi on Monday for two campaign rallies in Tupelo and Biloxi, Mississippi. The president will be campaigning on behalf of embattled Republican candidate, Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith. She's in a runoff race for the Senate in Mississippi and she's drawn national attention for some controversial comments that she's made.</p><p>So, the president will be defending Senator Smith tomorrow in those campaign rallies and perhaps those appearances will give him the opportunity to clarify where this deal stands and expand a little more on why the Trump administration thinks this will be beneficial to the United States, Christi and Martin.</p><p>PAUL: Sarah Westwood, we appreciate it so much. Thank you.</p><p>SAVIDGE: And as Sarah just mentioned, Mississippi Senator Cindy Hyde- Smith is facing new criticism over a measure she supported while she was in the Mississippi state senate. It praised that Confederate soldiers to defend its homeland. It is the latest racially charged to plague Hyde-Smith's campaign.</p><p>So, this Tuesday's runoff could end up being a referendum on what critics see as her very public missteps.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAVIDGE (voice-over): Senator Cindy Hyde-smith tried to dial back the storm of criticism that Republicans sparked about joking about a public hanging.</p><p>HYDE-SMITH: If he invited me to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row --</p><p>SAVIDGE: During Tuesday's debate in a runoff campaign, Hyde-Smith apologized but also accused others of twisting her words for political gain.</p><p>HYDE-SMITH: You know, for anyone that was offended from my -- by my comments, I certainly apologize. There was no ill will, no intent whatsoever in my statements. This comment was twisted and it was turned into a weapon to be used against me, a political weapon used for nothing but personal and political gains on my opponent.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Her Democratic opponent Mike Espy said her words weren't distorted by anyone. ESPY: Well, no one twisted your comments because her comments were live. You know, it came out of mouth. But it calls out state harm. It has given our state another black eye that we don't need.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Since the public hanging remarks, a number of corporate donors to the Hyde-Smith campaign have asked for their money back, including Walmart. And a 2014 Facebook post that surfaced Tuesday showing Hyde-Smith posing with Confederate artifacts further fueled critics.</p><p>Just how much of an impact the Hyde-Smith controversy is having on voters depends on who you talk to.</p><p>JIMMY RHODES, SEN. CINDY HYDE-SMITH SUPPORTER: If people truly are understanding what she is all about, I don't think that will affect them.</p><p>JORDAN MALONE, MIKE ESPY SUPPORTER: It made it very clear both to me and to a lot of other black Mississippians that the Republican candidates do not really have our best interests at heart.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Espy, who is still considered an underdog in this deeply red state, is counting on an energized black electorate, as well as possible crossover voters now reconsidering their support of Hyde- Smith. President Trump will be in Mississippi to campaign for Hyde- Smith, and Tuesday, he seemed already working damage control.</p><p>TRUMP: She made a statement I know she feels very badly about it and it was just sort of said in jest. She is a tremendous woman and it's a shame that she has to go through this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SAVIDGE: And this is a runoff election that takes place on Tuesday and, of course, the question is going to be what kind of voter turnout will there be? That is critical to the outcome here. Many people say they are already just over the whole midterm thing. So, we'll be measuring to see how many people actually show up at the polls, Christi.</p><p>PAUL: All righty. Good point to make there.</p><p>And CNN political commentator Errol Louis is with us. He's political anchor for Spectrum News. Kelly Jane Torrance, as well, deputy managing editor for \"The Weekly Standard\".</p><p>Thank you both for being here.</p><p>President Trump in Mississippi, Errol, how potent do you think he can be for her based on everything we just saw from Marty there?</p><p>ERROL LOUIS, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: This is going to be her closing argument, frankly. Senator Hyde-Smith has not done very well for herself. She had to sort of stage manage this debate where she didn't have anybody in the room and it didn't get very much coverage. She's really just been saying Trump, Trump, Trump in state he won by a couple of dozen points and he's going to do her a lot of good.</p><p>[07:10:07] But, in the end, she's really -- look, in her closing statements, she has made reference more to Trump almost than to herself and her own record, that's how tightly tied she is to the president. She clearly thinks it's a strategy that is going to bring her across the finish line on Tuesday.</p><p>PAUL: And the thing is, Kelly Jane, I mean, when we look at Mike Espy, this is a moderate Democrat. He is fiscally conservative as I understand it. What are his chances? And does it come down to him voter turnout?</p><p>KELLY JANE TORRANCE, DEPUTY MANAGING EDITOR, THE WEEKLY STANDARD: Yes, it's a good question, Christi. You know, Errol is right about how much Cindy Hyde-Smith is tying herself to Trump. And you'll notice, we don't see a lot of clips of her talking to the media. Her campaign actually seems to be keeping her away from media. I suspect they are worried she might have another slip of the tongue as they might claim to call it.</p><p>But, you know, Mike Espy has a few of his own problems. It's a very tight race and a lot tighter really than it should be given that President Trump won Mississippi with 58 percent of the vote. So, it's very tight.</p><p>But Mike Espy has problems of his own I'm surprisingly not seeing Cindy Hyde-Smith bring up so much maybe because she is busy defending her own gaffes. One of them is that he took three quarters of a million dollars lobbying for Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo, who is accused of inciting murder and rape. So, he's got some unsavory ties himself.</p><p>I kind of feel sorry for Mississippians. There's not -- neither candidate is really that great to choose from and that might be one reason why this is such a close race.</p><p>PAUL: Well, as Martin just said, Errol, apparently, people are over the midterms but this is the last race of the midterms at the end of all the day. What are the repercussions for Washington based on what could happen there in Mississippi on Tuesday?</p><p>LOUIS: Well, you know, it's interesting. I don't know that anything is going to happen in Washington. Espy, I think he knows he has very much of uphill fight to try to flip this particular seat under these conditions.</p><p>On the other hand, there is an interesting midterm theme we have seen. The statewide races with black candidates in the Deep South try to do what hasn't been done before in Florida and in Georgia, coming much closer than anybody would have anticipated, showing a path forward, I think, for the Democratic Party if they want to try to make inroads in some of these Republican strongholds. So, at a minimum, I think we're going to see, especially if it's a very close race that Mississippi can be added to the states that are within reach for Democrats if they have the right candidate and the right pitch. PAUL: All righty. I want to switch so the situation with Mexico here. We just talked to Sarah about that. And president-elect, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the folks under him, Interior Secretary Sanchez Cordero did seem to give differing opinions. According to \"The Washington Post,\" Cordero said, oh, yes, yes, this deal is something we are looking at and we are on board. Last night, came out and said, no, no, we're not.</p><p>Kelly Jane, is there any indication why Mexico would agree to hold their own people until the U.S. gives them an okay to come across the border?</p><p>TORRANCE: Yes. You know, Christi, my first thought when I heard about this deal was that there had to be money involved, that the United States was going to be, you know, paying Mexico for the care and any money they had to spend to take care of these migrants but \"the Washington Post\" story say it's not the case.</p><p>I have to say I'm not sure the reporting that Mexican officials are denying \"The Washington Post\" report is quite right. Now the statement I saw from the incoming interior minister just said that Mexico will not become a third safe country with an agreement with the U.S. Now, what this means, the United States has this agreement with Canada. That means someone is seeking asylum, they have to seek that asylum in the first safe country they get to so they cannot say entry to the United States and then go to Canada to make an asylum claim or vice versa.</p><p>And so, she is saying Mexico is not developing that kind of deal with the United States but we don't need that kind of deal to have the kind of plan that \"The Washington Post\" reported and, of course, the Trump administration would like. It would still allow Central American migrants to apply for asylum in the United States even if they have already been in Mexico. What it means that deal is that Mexico will house those people and keep them there. They will not be permitted to stay in the United States while their claims are processed.</p><p>So, those are two very different things. And, of course, given the incoming Mexico administration is not even in power yet, you can see why they might be a little nervous about making any specific deals and announcing anything specific until they actually are in power.</p><p>PAUL: And I only have a couple of seconds. But, Errol, I wanted to ask about that. This is an incoming administration in Mexico.</p><p>[07:15:00] What is the possibility that something is already being tainted between the United States and Mexico with this back and forth before they have even taken their posts?</p><p>LOUIS: Well, I think the U.S. administration may have spoken too quickly but when the new Mexican administration comes in, there are some economic advantages to having them. There is some Mexican industrials who are saying, look. We have a hundred thousand jobs here and these Central Americans can have them in Mexico.</p><p>So, sure if they are waiting for an asylum claim, let's put them to work in the meantime. There is a possibility of a win/win here if we get lucky.</p><p>PAUL: All righty. Errol Louis and Kelly Jane Torrance, always appreciate your insight. Thank you so much.</p><p>LOUIS: Thank you.</p><p>TORRANCE: Thank you, Christi.</p><p>PAUL: Absolutely.</p><p>And today on \"STATE OF THE UNION,\" Senator Joni Ernst and Representative Adam Schiff on the show. Tune today, 9:00 a.m. Eastern, right here on CNN.</p><p>SAVIDGE: According to \"The Washington Post\", a scathing new book calling out top Washington officials as President Trump's inside enemies will hit the shelves Tuesday. It's alleging dozens of White House insiders are working to undermine Trump's presidency.</p><p>PAUL: Also, the British parliament scored a victory over Facebook, obtaining a Senate internal documents the social media giant fought for months to stop from being made public. We'll have details on that for you.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Also, right now, hundreds of stars and large amounts of dark matter swirling like a hurricane swirling around the solar system. Holy cow. More on the cosmic phenomenon ahead.</p><p>[07:20:36] SAVIDGE: There's a new book by former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former deputy campaign David Bossie and it's set to hit shelves on Tuesday.</p><p>PAUL: Yes, according to \"The Washington Post\", \"Trump's Enemies: How the Deep State is Undermining the Presidency\", that's the title, calls out top Washington officials as President Trump's inside enemies. That's a quote. It alleges dozens of White House insiders are working to undermine the president and delegitimize his presidency.</p><p>Errol and Kelly Jane are back with us now.</p><p>So, here is the thing -- first and foremost, just so people understand what's in this. They target a lot of people in this book. They call Michael Cohen, you know, President Trump's former personal attorney, and Paul Manafort, former campaign manager, rats. They accuse some of, including former press secretary Sean Spicer of being, quote, establishment Republicans who didn't fully support Trump until the day after he was elected when they began angling for powerful government jobs.</p><p>And they, quote, use colorful language to dismiss the Russia investigation, calling it, quote, a sweeping work of fiction, so complex, so audacious, so unbelievable that if they gave out awards for bad excuses, the Dems would win an Oscar, an Emmy and maybe even a Heisman Trophy, because they alleged these are excuses they made up for Dems losing in 2016.</p><p>Errol, it almost sounds like President Trump wrote this just based on his twitter feed and the things that he said because it's airing all of his grievances. Your take?</p><p>LOUIS: Yes. This is straight out of -- I mean, look, these are the truest of the true believers, right? The rest of us look at the president's controversial actions which were, in fact, ratified to a certain extent by the voters in 2016. The controversial actions like the Muslim ban, trying to get funding for a border wall on Mexico.</p><p>He is doing what he said he was going to do, that's controversial enough with 39 percent approval rating the rest of us look at that and say, okay, he is trying to do controversial things and not all that popular. We have got a struggle going on. The truest of the true believers look at it very differently and they say, the president is wildly popular and he would be succeeding more clearly if only there weren't these mysterious enemies.</p><p>So, it's conspiratorial thinking. It doesn't really square with the facts. There are plenty of people who -- take Sean Spicer.</p><p>Yes, he is from a different wing of the Republican Party. He was not a pro-Trump guy from day one. He came on and he did the best job he could and then he was fired.</p><p>I mean, that's just the way it is. It's not a conspiracy. It's called democracy.</p><p>PAUL: OK. Listen, the president, we need to point out here, according to them, the president did sit down and talk with the two authors in September, September 20th. And, at that time, the president aired some more of his frustration saying this: I should have fired him, referring to Comey, the day after I won and announced please get the hell out. The president also said, congressional Republicans let me down by not fighting harder to secure funding to construct a wall at the U.S./Mexico border.</p><p>Kelly, help us understand what is the intention of this book?</p><p>TORRANCE: I think one of the keys, Christi -- by the way, I think you're right. I mean, why would people pay money to read this book when they can go on President Trump's Twitter feed for free and see everything it says?</p><p>But I think one of the keys is one of the quotations that you read earlier when Lewandowski and Bossie were complaining about establishment Republicans angling for powerful government jobs. Well, Corey Lewandowski is still upset that he did not get one of these powerful government jobs and I think that is a part of the motivation behind this book. He is taking out his frustration that all of these other people got jobs and he didn't.</p><p>And, you know, I have to say this seems like such old news. Deep state, this is very 2017 as we are heading into 2019, don't you think? SAVIDGE: Well, I will say, Kelly Jane, it is old news but it's been effective. This is something that the Trump campaign has used and those that support the president say, hey, elect me because the president needs more people to support him either in Congress or in the Senate.</p><p>And so, this is a theme that works very well with those who support the president and those who want to glom on to his appeal.</p><p>TORRANCE: Well, that's a very good point. You notice in the interview that he did with Lewandowski and Bossie, what President Trump did. He actually says he thinks that the Mueller investigation has increased his support amongst his base.</p><p>He thinks they love -- he used the word love -- him more for it. So, as much as President Trump rails against Robert Mueller, I think you're right, Martin, he actually does see it as something that helps him amongst the base that people that he gets more support from the base.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Yes, that's why -- I mean, I find that when I go out and talk in the field.</p><p>PAUL: Well, and let's face it, there have been leaks in this administration, so to allege that there are people behind the scenes who are trying to do the president harm is not a stretch by any means.</p><p>Errol Louis, Kelly Jane Torrance, we appreciate both of you. Thank you.</p><p>TORRANCE: Thank you.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Sorry, don't mean to step in.</p><p>When we come back, Facebook's nightmare, it continues. Now, the British parliament has got hold of documents that Facebook fought to keep private, alleging little regard for user privacy and exposing the lengths they went to, to force rivals out of business. Our Brian Stelter is here to explain.</p><p>PAUL: Also, Egypt gives us this first look at an incredibly well- preserved mummy found inside a coffin that is more than 3,000 years old.</p><p>[07:30:49] CHRISTI PAUL, CNN ANCHOR: Look who is up early. Marty.</p><p>MARTIN SAVIDGE, CNN ANCHOR: Just saying.</p><p>PAUL: And we're glad you are, too. I'm Christi Paul. Thanks for being with us.</p><p>SAVIDGE: And I'm Martin Savidge, in for Victor Blackwell.</p><p>PAUL: So, the British parliament, right, has scored this victory over Facebook. They've obtained a set of internal documents the social media giant fought for months to start being made public.</p><p>SAVIDGE: And, of course, it makes you wonder what's in them. It could include correspondences between Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and company executives and stems from a lawsuit in California that outlines a litany of allegations against Facebook.</p><p>Joining me now is CNN chief media correspondent Brian Stelter.</p><p>And, Brian, tell us more about this lawsuit? And how did coming from California end up in the hands of the British?</p><p>BRIAN STELTER, CNN CHIEF MEDIA CORRESPONDENT: Yes, this is a remarkable story, because this lawsuit had been going on for a while in California between Facebook and a software developer that Facebook says misused the website. This is software developer 643, it was able to go through the discovery process. You know, normally, in a lawsuit, you have discovery process where each side gets ahold of documents that are going to be helpful for the suit.</p><p>So, this software developer, they had internal documents, correspondence for Facebook for this lawsuit in California. Well, the head of the company happened to be in London for a trip. So the U.K. parliament, the British parliament used its legal process to seize the documents. This all unfolded over the weekend.</p><p>And now, the British MP who's been leading this inquiry into Facebook says he has more to come later this week. Maybe he is hinting he is going to share some of the correspondence.</p><p>And, look, we don't know exactly what is in this accordance, whether there's emails from Zuckerberg and whether they really matter in the grand scheme of things. But it is remarkable to see the British parliament using these really unusual procedures to seize documents from a lawsuit that was happening over in California and it just goes to show how aggressive the Europeans have been about regulation and oversight of Facebook, and other technology companies.</p><p>In general, I think it's fair to say the Europeans have been more aggressive than the United States or other countries with regards to trying to police these big tech companies and try to manage what they do and understand what they do and how they affect the public. So, this is another example here in this case the British parliament trying to obtain documents from Facebook and just, once again, turn the screws on Zuckerberg. They have been trying to get Zuckerberg to testify, and they have been trying to do all sorts of things to oversee Facebook and this is one of those examples now.</p><p>PAUL: Is it -- is it maybe the first step towards some sort of accountability of social media companies? Not just Facebook, but, I mean, what really are the repercussions here?</p><p>STELTER: Right. Google has been under a lot of pressure from Europe regulators. There's been monetary fines and things like that. Now, really, the scrutiny is on Facebook and Twitter and social media giants. I actually spoke with some of these parliamentarians last year. They have been doing this wide-ranging study of fake news and misinformation and how it spreads on the Internet.</p><p>So they have been really interested in trying to understand what goes wrong and why it goes wrong on these platforms and how it can be made better. Like I said, I think some of these European regulators are two steps ahead of the U.S., but we are now seeing in America are lawmakers both on the left and the right, a bipartisan interest in regulating Facebook or at least in trying to create some consumer protections for Facebook, because, look, when we say regulation, that could mean one of a dozen different things and think all of that remains to be determined.</p><p>But I'm really curious to see when we get a Democratic House in January what it could look like, what some sort of oversight of Facebook, Google, Twitter, et cetera, could look like because for the first time, it does seem there is bipartisan interest in some oversight of these tech giants.</p><p>PAUL: Interesting. Brian Stelter, thank you so much.</p><p>STELTER: Thanks.</p><p>PAUL: He is not going away. Brian is on his show, of course, \"RELIABLE SOURCES\" today, at 11:00 a.m. Eastern, right here on CNN.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Britain's plan to leave the European Union dubbed Brexit has just been given the go-ahead by the E.U. British Prime Minister Theresa May faces an uphill battle, though, and she is going to try to sell it back home.</p><p>CNN's Erin McLaughlin is in Brussels where Theresa May just spoke on the issue.</p><p>What did she have to say, Erin?</p><p>[07:35:02] ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, she is making the case for this deal, saying that it's good for the whole of the U.K., appealing directly to the British people.</p><p>Take a listen to what she had to say.</p><p>Apparently we don't have that sound.</p><p>But she essentially says that she plans to make the case for the deal, quote, with all of her heart.</p><p>Now, after she made her statement, she did receive some questions from the British press, some of them asking her repeatedly if she would resign. She responded to those questions by saying it's not about me. They pressed again asking her on whether or not her government would collapse if this deal does not get through Westminster. Many Brexiters and remainers, both sides of the aisle, are opposed to this deal. She again, deflected those questions.</p><p>Essentially what's been approved here today by the 27th E.U. leaders are two things. The so-called divorce deal, the terms of the U.K.'s departure from the European Union. Also, the framework for the future relationship, sort of what happens after Brexit in terms of the trade talks between the U.K. and the E.U.</p><p>E.U. leaders saying they are extremely sad to see the U.K. go, but both sides at this point saying they plan on maintaining a friendship. But again, lots of uncertainty going forward as Theresa May battles to get this through British parliament.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Yes, this is a day will be a day remembered in history.</p><p>Erin McLaughlin, thank you very much for joining us.</p><p>An Alabama family demands answers after police killed their 21-year- old son after mistaking him for the gunman of a thanksgiving night mall shooting.</p><p>[07:41:10] PAUL: Well, the family of an Alabama man who was shot by police want answers now.</p><p>Emantic E.J. Bradford Jr. was killed by a police officer who thought Emantic had shot two people at a mall Thanksgiving night. But police say it later turns out Bradford was not the gunman.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Yesterday, dozens of protesters showed up at the mall saying justice for E.J. and Black Lives Matter.</p><p>CNN's Natasha Chen has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NATASHA CHEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The initial report was that two men had gotten into a fight of some kind at the mall that resulted in an 18-year-old man and a 12-year-old girl being shot. They were both taken to the hospital.</p><p>Now, police said Bradford was fleeing the scene and brandishing a weapon and that's when a Hoover police officer working as mall security shot and killed him.</p><p>But, later, Hoover police issued a statement saying Bradford may have been involved in some aspect of the altercation but he likely did not fire the rounds that injured the 18-year-old victim. So police say there is at least one gunman still at large.</p><p>Bradford's family has now retained civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. His office released a statement from the family saying they are heart broken and as we continue to grieve, rest assured that we are working diligently with our legal team to determine exactly what happened and why this police officer killed our son. We will never forget E.J. and ask for your continued prayers during this incredibly difficulty time.</p><p>I also talked to a woman at the mall who was there when it happened. She said she hear the gun shots and people ran in panic. She hid in a dressing room with others. She told me she is frustrated at how law enforcement has handled this entire situation. The officer involved with the shooting has been placed on administrative leave. And the Alabama law enforcement agency is now heading up the investigation into the shooting.</p><p>Natasha Chen, CNN.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PAUL: Another shooting to tell you about. This happened in the garden center of a Florida Walmart. Police say a man shot his female partner several times after a domestic argument and then he escaped on a bicycle.</p><p>SAVIDGE: The woman died at the hospital and police found the suspect David Johnson at the couple's home nearby. He had a self-inflicted gunshot wound and was hospitalized but authorities say he is not expected to survive.</p><p>PAUL: Still to come, a cosmic hurricane. We are talking about hundreds of stars and large amounts of dark matter circling around our solar system right now and we are caught in the middle of it. We have more on that.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Wow.</p><p>Plus, Egypt gives us the first look at an incredibly well-preserved mummy found inside a coffin that is more than 3,000 years old. Look at that.</p><p>[07:47:54] SAVIDGE: Well, at the possibility of sounding like a Hollywood thriller trailer, we can't see it and we can't feel it. But right now, our solar system is smack-dab in the middle of a cosmic hurricane.</p><p>PAUL: I would go see that movie!</p><p>SAVIDGE: According to a report paper, or a recent paper, a swarm of hundreds of stars and dark matter is blowing right past the earth.</p><p>PAUL: So, what makes these stars so interesting is they are orbiting our system in the exact opposite direction of normal stars. Don't fear. They are not going to hit us. They're not going to collide.</p><p>But retired astronaut Leroy Chiao is with us now.</p><p>Leroy, always appreciate having you on.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Hi, Leroy.</p><p>PAUL: So, this -- it sounds like a fascinating event, obviously, for the space community. But how did scientists even find this?</p><p>LEROY CHIAO, RETIRED NASA ASTRONAUT: Well, in 2013, the European space agency launched the Gaia spacecraft, and it's been producing three-dimensional maps of parts of our Milky Way galaxy. And so, looking at the data, astronomers see stream of stars passing through and this one stream in particular appears to be going in the opposite direction of the spins of the stars in the Milky Way.</p><p>And so, what they are seeing is the rotations of these stars in the galaxy, colliding galaxies if you will, and they're able to, you know, calculate how much dark matter there should be. Now, dark matter is kind of a theory. It's never actually been conclusively detected, but basically, astronomers can look at the rotation rates of these galaxies, and then calculate how much mass has to be there.</p><p>And sometimes we are seeing factors of five, ten, or even a hundred times less mass than should be there. Or, you know, should able to see more and match where they came up with the idea of this dark matter back in the late 1800s.</p><p>SAVIDGE: So, it sounds like really fascinating, but what does it really mean?</p><p>CHIAO: Well, it means that we have stars that are -- we're producing more and more detailed maps of these stars and their rotations and we are seeing increased number of black -- amount of dark matter. And hopefully, this increase will allow us to maybe detect it, actually detect either directly or indirectly the existence and prove one way or another, you now, the existence of dark matter.</p><p>[07:50:10] SAVIDGE: Yes.</p><p>PAUL: Interesting.</p><p>All right. So, tomorrow, NASA's spacecraft is going to attempt to land on Mars.</p><p>CHIAO: Right, exactly.</p><p>PAUL: How excited is the community about this and what is the hope that we're going to learn from it?</p><p>CHIAO: Oh, very exciting mission. The Insight Mission, it's a NASA mission with a lot of international collaboration, and it's going to study the inside of Mars. It's going to have sensitive seismometers to measure Mars' quakes and it's also going to measure the heat inside of the planet.</p><p>You know, going to Mars is not easy. Less than half of the probes the world has sent to Mars don't make it, historically. And so they describe six or seven minutes of terror. That's because Mars does have an atmosphere, six one-thousandths to the pressure of the earth's atmosphere.</p><p>But the spacecraft is going so fast, you need still a heat shield to come down through it, but it's been enough, parachutes can only slow you down so much. These space crafts like the Curiosity, is going to use rocket engines, what we call propulsive landing. So it's not until the spacecraft gets through the upper part of the atmosphere that they'll be able to signal back to Earth and, you know, to let the scientists know that hopefully they survived.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Hopefully, it does. It will be fascinating.</p><p>Another milestone coming up. For the first time in eight years, I guess the U.S. will be back in the space transportation. Up until now, crews have been going up to the space station on a Russian spacecraft. That's going to change, right?</p><p>CHIAO: Right. So, for the last several years, both SpaceX and Boeing have been developing spacecraft to take U.S. astronauts to and from the ISS and the U.S. has not been able to launch our own astronauts to ISS since the space shuttle which retired in the summer of 2011.</p><p>So, demo mission one for SpaceX is scheduled in early January. It won't carry a crew but it will launch the dragon spacecraft to dock to the ISS. So, it will be a full test without a crew on board. Later or a few months after that, they're going to test their launch abort system on a live test, on a rocket. If all goes well, hopefully later in the year, we'll see the first NASA astronaut as board both of those spacecraft.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Wow, that would be really cool to see.</p><p>PAUL: No doubt.</p><p>But, Leroy Chiao, thank you so much. Always good to have you here.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Yes, joking aside, I love all space stuff. It's really fascinating.</p><p>PAUL: And if you ever need somebody to voice a space movie, you know now who you can contact.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Please, think of me.</p><p>PAUL: Thanks, Leroy.</p><p>SAVIDGE: All right. Moving on with our adventure team, take a look at this historic archeological find in Egypt. An incredibly well- preserved mummy revealed inside a sarcophagus never before opened, which is more than 3,000 years old.</p><p>PAUL: Look at that, inside this tomb, they discovered five colored masks, about 1,000 statues said to be miniature figurines of servants to serve the dead in the afterlife. You got to serve the dead in the afterlife, really? That's not much of a life in either place.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Yes, that won't be easier.</p><p>PAUL: Wow.</p><p>SAVIDGE: Well, the first family will return to a Christmas decorated White House. The first lady gives us a tiny sneak peek. That will be next.</p><p>[07:57:30] PAUL: So look at what's happening at the White House. First Lady Melania Trump, giving us a sneak peek of the decorations. These are photos of volunteers working to help decorate this weekend.</p><p>SAVIDGE: She tweeted Saturday saying, quote, thank you to all of the people, the volunteers from across our great nation who are working hard to decorate the White House. Can't wait to view it all tomorrow night, of course, when they return from Florida to get to see it all.</p><p>PAUL: Absolutely.</p><p>So, France is closing one small chapter of its colonial past by returning 26 works of art to Benin.</p><p>SAVIDGE: These works of art were taken from the West African nation more than 100 years ago.</p><p>Lynda Kinkaid reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LYNDA KINKAID, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Some of Africa's most precious cultural treasures are on display in a museum a continent away from where they were created.</p><p>The Quai Branly Museum in Paris houses tens of thousands of pieces of African art, looted during France's colonial past. Now, a new report says it's time for them to go home.</p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron commissioned the report, which recommends that works taken between 1885 and 1960 should be returned to their country of origin. It's a controversial proposal. It could put pressure on other western museums to follow suit. Experts say 90 percent of African art is believed to be located in Europe. Some visitors say it's about time.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): It would perhaps mean people who live in those countries could get to know the cultural history of their countries. There's not much to provide a link to their cultural and artistic history because everything is in Europe.</p><p>KINKAID: Others have expressed hope that the art can stay where it is.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): Can't we display other works in a reciprocal arrangement in other countries and aren't there western art work which can be displayed elsewhere?</p><p>KINKAID: Western museums have often resisted repatriating art, arguing that they can take better care of it. But many countries are now challenging this.</p><p>Chile's Easter Island declared this month that it wants a prized sculpture back from the British museum, which has also had a longstanding dispute with Greece over who should own the famous Elgin Marbles. Earlier this month, the British Museum agreed to send some of the iconic Benin bronzes to Nigeria, where they'll be on display temporarily on loan at a new museum.</p><p>Lynda Kinkaid, CNN.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAVIDGE: And that it is for us.

Q3 hedge fund letters, conference, scoops etc[4]  DAVID FABER: Welcome back to \"Squawk on the Street.\" I'm David Faber here on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. I'm very excited to introduce our guest this morning, Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division: Makan Delrahim, a man I have not seen since we were together in the spring at the Milken Institute Annual Meeting. Very nice to have you for an official interview here this morning. And, Makan, let me get right to it. I can't remember a period of time, certainly, in the recent past where we've had more discussions, at least, both at the executive level by the president, but generally speaking as well, about the power of big business, in particular the power of some of our key technology companies. You're no stranger to what's going on in the news from your perch at the Department of Justice. How seriously do you think about 'the power of big,' if I could put it that simply, and what it actually means from an anti-trust perspective? MAKAN DELRAHIM: Well, we've discussed this before. You know, one of our roles in the anti-trust laws is to make sure that the - you know, when companies get big - and we want to - we don't have any problem with companies being big, it's when they get big, they behave properly. And to make sure that the markets are open; that new entrants enter in, new competitors and ultimately the consumers and businesses will benefit from that. FABER: I'm sure you may have seen this article. Interestingly -- there's been lots of good press for our interview, not to mention the president which we'll get to. But Tim Wu, a law professor that specializes in anti-trust, New York Times editorial this weekend, talked about Congress passing the Anti-Merger Act of 1950 but he also said, 'It would be understandable if you assumed [it had been] repealed. But it remains on the books. It has merely been evaded, eroded and enfeebled by the corroding effect of decades of industry pressure and ideological drift, yielding' what he says is, 'hesitant enforcers and a hostile judiciary.' How do you respond to criticisms like that? DELRAHIM: Well look I respect him quite a bit. He's great. He has been very thoughtful. He has been certainly thoughtful on the At...ime Warner Merger that we challenged. I don't think there has been much hostility. I think the laws have been pretty well calibrated. Do we have challenges? Absolutely. But I think those are good challenges and checks and balances on our powers. We go to the court system. We have to prove our case. We have to prove it with good, strong evidence. We also have to prove it with sound economics. And over the last 30, 40 years, we've had pretty strong and bipartisan consensus on the -- what the balance, and the right balance for anti-trust enforcement is. Now, are there areas that, you know -- do we wish he'd go a different way? Are there cases we lose? Absolutely. FABER: Right. But do you agree with his contention then, and I'll read here, that 'there's a direct link between the concentration of business and the distortion of the democratic process'? DELRAHIM: I don't think so. We have to be vigilant, make sure. That's why the anti-trust laws were enacted in the first place, to make sure that no single company or group of companies have the inordinate amount of power. That affects our lives. And there's been quite a bit of debate about these platforms, and what does that mean? Are they touching every aspect of our lives? Should they be this big? Should the government step in and somehow regulate their growth? And I think - you know, the anti-trust - FABER: How close do you look at that issue when it comes to, in particular -- and again, we're talking about platforms, whether it be Amazon, Facebook[5] or Alphabet, the existence of these enormous platforms and the influence they have? How seriously do you investigate it right now at the Department of Justice in terms of trying to get some answers? DELRAHIM: Well, we look at it. Whenever there's been challenges, we have -- the Justice Department brought a case on the eBooks matter not too long ago - just a couple of years ago, where some publishers and Apple had gotten together and successfully resolved that matter. We are constantly - what we look at we have to be careful in that we're just there to police the markets, we're not picking winners and losers. We are not trying to choose which technologies -- frankly, we're just not smart enough to be doing that. All we can do is make sure that markets are free for new entrants to come in and topple the old ones. FABER: And do you believe that's the case right now? I mean, we've had this discussion previously but this idea that innovation is somehow it's stymied by these giants who can conceivably presumably prevent capital flowing to new ideas because nobody wants to fund anybody getting into business to compete with them? DELRAHIM: Well, I don't know if that's true. I don't know if there's actual evidence of that. There might be in certain areas, certainly different investors. But it seems like Silicon Valley and the venture capital world, in this country in particularly, is alive and well. You're having new companies pop up, every now and then. But that's what we do. Anti-trust laws need to be there to make sure that they do not prevent the next competitor to come in. That was exactly what the justice department did in Microsoft 20 years ago. And a lot of people were worried about the power Microsoft had, and particularly when they were trying to suffocate the internet browser because it was challenging their monopoly power in the operating system. And I think that case probably led to a lot of the innovation we're seeing today. FABER: How do you respond to the president's tweets? I'm sure you hear about them if you don't read them directly. Yesterday, American Cable Association has big problems with Comcast, our parent company, by the way. They say that Comcast routinely violates anti-trust laws. When you see or hear something like that, what's your reaction? DELRAHIM: Well, look, the previous administration you know, brought an anti-trust case against Comcast when they bought NBC and settled it in a decree that just expired in September. We have been vigilant, and I think I owe that to the American consumer to continue to make sure the markets are working, despite the expiration of any consent decree. You know, I have - one of the things I've been both criticized and, I think, praised for is that I don't believe these behavioral consent decrees as a solution to these mergers. We come in and tell a company to withhold its natural tendencies, its natural incentives to make a profit and then they evaporate after five, seven, ten years. And it makes no sense. Because seven years before we're trying to guess where the market is. I believe in structural solutions. That's what we've suggested. We thought that's what it is -- FABER: -- that's why you went after AT...ime Warner, the vertical merger that it was. DELRAHIM: Exactly. Yeah. Well only portions of it, not the whole merger. But the area where there was anti-competitive concern. And that was the solution we had provided. But that is one. But I think it's great that you know, you have the Administration, you also have members of Congress who are all very vigilant about anti-trust enforcement. And Comcast in particular, as well as At...] and other media because they affect so many Americans' lives. FABER: But when the president writes, and this is from this summer, 'In my opinion, The Washington Post is nothing more than an expensive lobbyist for Amazon as it uses protection against anti-trust claims, which many feel should be brought.' Again, as the man who runs enforcement for the anti-trust division, when you hear something like that from the executive, is there a response that you have? DELRAHIM: Well, we hear that from executive and legislative. I mean, by the way, these types of concerns raised about Amazon are bipartisan. And Senators raise them, the president has raised it. It's -- again, I think it's great that we have such a debate about free markets and the anti-trust laws there to protect the free markets. As far as what we do in our enforcement, you know, we need the evidence, we need the economics, we go to court. And politics, you know, that goes on between various aspects of the government don't affect our decisions to make these cases. FABER: In the couple of minutes we have left, Makan, let me hit a couple of quick things: Time Warner/AT...when are you actually going to go to court again? DELRAHIM: The Court of Appeals in D.C. will be hearing the oral arguments December 6th. The parties, we had agreed with them to hold the Turner assets separate until the end of February and so they're supposed to be running that business a little bit separately so that in the event the court of appeals overturns the district court's decision as we argued -- and I think they should -- FABER: I know you think they should. Whether or not they will - DELRAHIM: Well, I think there's been a lot of support for our appeal. You know, you had those - the 29 or so economists, law professors, some of the country's biggest experts who supported our case because, frankly, the court's decision, and the lower court's decision had real serious flaws in economic logic. And so we'll see what happens there. If it does - but we hope there will be a decision before the end of February and then we'll take it from there. FABER: Talking about timelines. Can you give us any sense as to when the Department of Justice will complete its review of T-Mobile and Sprint's deal? DELRAHIM: A lot of times, these mergers, the parties control the timing - about the number of documents they provide. And in that particular transaction, we also - we're reviewing it, but also the Federal Communications Commission[7] has a role in that transaction and I believe there's been a -- what they call the time clock over at the FCC for 180 days that has been stopped. I don't believe that has been restarted. So our timing will coincide together. I don't know exactly when it is, but, you know, I announced a number of reforms with the hope that if the parties cooperate with us, we'll be moving things forward and we hope to get every transaction reviewed within six months. FABER: Before going to three in the most important market for most people when it comes to the bill they pay, some would say simple violation of anti-trust law. DELRAHIM: Well, yes, except for simple violations of anti-trust law require evidence and the economics. So, we're reviewing the evidence in this case and if that's what the economics and the evidence shows, that it would substantially lessen competition, we would sue to block it. But if it doesn't, I don't think we have a magical number for any particular industry, which is what I've said in the past. FABER: Does leaving an enfeebled competitor worry you to act - sort of figure into your decision making? In other words, the idea that Sprint wouldn't ever be able to compete if it was truly left independent? DELRAHIM: That would certainly be one of the considerations that goes into a number of factors we would review to see, you know, what would happen to the competitive landscape[8]. Does that -- what you're insinuating, does that mean there's only be then two competitors if this merger doesn't happen -- and one of them would fail or both of them might fail without this merger? Those would be factors we would consider. But I don't know if the evidence fully supports that. FABER: And, finally, your future. Some say, well, there's an opening now for Attorney General of the United States. Would you be interested? DELRAHIM: I have the best job, I think, in the government, running the anti-trust division. It's the job that I wanted. And I think the president has made a superb choice, as Deputy Rod Rosenstein said, in Matt Whitaker the acting Attorney General in the meantime. And I think there's gonna be a process, so I'm looking forward to see who will be the next AG. But as far me personally, I love the anti-trust division and I have the best job in the country. FABER: Well we appreciate your taking some time to talk about it with us. DELRAHIM: Thank you for having me. FABER: Makan Delrahim joining us. Back to you guys.

It has to both continue to encourage the development of these vehicles and satisfy legitimate safety concerns. Transparency of safety records will be key to doing that.</p><p>What's at stake? No less than an $800 billion business - double the current size of the smartphone industry - by 2035 and $7 trillion (yes, with a \"t\") by 2050, according to an Intel study released in June. And it's not just a financial boon. The potential for safer roads and better transportation options for an aging population is enormous.</p><p>The state Department of Motor Vehicles proposed a revised set of regulations in October. They're scheduled to be completed by the end of the year and become law in June.</p><p>California has been regulating self-driving cars since 2012 and has walked the tightrope between promoting innovation and addressing reasonable safety concerns. But so far, unlike Arizona and many other states, it has required a driver to be on board. The proposed rules would allow fully driverless cars.</p><p>California's new regulations need to require the industry to be completely transparent about safety measures, test results and the frequency and cause of accidents. This should be as valuable to the industry as to the public: At a time when Big Tech increasingly is not seen as the public's friend, it's critical for the industry to build trust with consumers at every step of the process.</p><p>Transportation experts estimate that self-driving vehicles could reduce traffic fatalities by up to 90 percent. This would be huge for California, where traffic deaths increased 13 percent in 2016 to 3,680.</p><p>But Americans have been slow to embrace the concept. A Pew Research Center survey released Oct. 4 found that 56 percent of American adults \"would not want to ride in a driverless vehicle if given the opportunity.\" There is \"a lack of confidence in robotic decision-making and general safety concerns.\"</p><p>California's proposed regulations require firms to use a standardized template for reporting \"disengagements,\" when backup drivers take over operation of the vehicle, presumably for a reason. They would require written notifications to cities and counties stating when and where driverless tests will occur in their jurisdictions.</p><p>Proposed federal legislation threatens to supersede California's laws. That would be a mistake. While there are advantages to having a national standard, allowing states the flexibility to experiment has merit. The federal proposal fails to provide adequate enforcement of required evaluations about how vehicles are responding to emergencies or technical problems.</p><p>California should use its technical expertise to set rules that both spread sunshine on safety concerns and encourage further innovation. The industry can only reach its full potential if people aren't afraid of it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bay Area News Group</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MONTCH-3159927</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MONTCH2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PXB-1CS1-F02B-Y1SG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313959</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"534\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Monterey County Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Monterey County Herald (California)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 9, 2017 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>INTC (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001745</classCode><className>TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002184</classCode><className>ROAD TRANSPORTATION SAFETY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009RLP</classCode><className>RESEARCH INSTITUTES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX000008</classCode><className>ACCIDENTAL FATALITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000DIF5</classCode><className>ADULTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000210</classCode><className>AGING TRENDS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001347</classCode><className>POLLS &amp;

We're spooked when the same set of advertisements tailgate us, yet become furious when our iPhones have no clue where we are when we search for a restaurant (Hello, I am NOT in Fort Wayne). We loathe that our data is mined and scraped, yet still we opt for Google over DuckDuckGo (never mind that Google is tracking our moves like an assassin); still we use Facebook (never mind that it harvests our personal information like so many internal organs); and we click \"I agree\" when downloading our apps, knowing full well that those apps are talking to other apps, telling them how much we eat and what music we listen to and when we ovulate.</p><p>Plus: Has it made one whit of difference that we're now alerted to the use of cookies on websites, thanks to that recent rule issued by the European Union? Speaking for myself, I would say it has not. Those alerts make me feel worse, because they reveal my impatience, my recklessness, my everyday failures of self-regulation. I seem to be forever surrendering my privacy in exchange for some short-term gain, rather than dutifully slogging through the decision tree of the cookie opt-out.</p><p>So the question becomes: Why do I -- why do many of us -- consistently act in ways that are directly at loggerheads with the privacy values we profess to hold dear? What explains this phenomenon, which experts have taken to calling \"the privacy paradox\"?</p><p>In an attempt at reconciliation -- and expiation and clarification -- I made lots of phone calls and did lots of reading on the topic in recent weeks, much of it online. By the end, I was Google-stalked almost exclusively by ads about privacy-related books and podcasts. I was that deep in a house of meta-horrors. Here, perhaps, was my most liberating discovery: Our conflicting impulses are actually quite rational. As Alessandro Acquisti, professor of information technology at Carnegie Mellon, points out, sometimes each of the contradictory beliefs in a paradox is perfectly well founded.</p><p>Let's consider, just as an example, why we are forever skating past the internet's fine print. In 2008 -- 2008! before Instagram, before Uber, before WhatsApp! -- two of Acquisti's colleagues at Carnegie Mellon calculated just how long it would take for the average internet user to read the privacy policies of all the websites he or she visited in a single year. Their answer: more than 30 workdays, at a national opportunity cost of $781 billion.</p><p>Which makes blowing off those policies seem quite reasonable. A necessity, even.</p><p>So there you have one explanation for this paradox: To fully apprehend our vulnerabilities as digital creatures would require far too much time and energy. More than that: It would require an entirely new set of instincts, a radically different cognitive framework from the one we now possess.</p><p>Joyce Searls, a privacy activist and consultant in Santa Barbara, California, is forever reminding people that we've barely begun to understand who and what we are on the internet, in part because it's a disembodied experience. We think we're alone while we're buzzing through the mists of cyberspace -- that a Google search is akin to thumbing through the Yellow Pages, because it feels just as solitary. But it isn't. We are being watched, tracked; we simply don't realize it, because we can't see it or feel it.</p><p>Which suggests another reason we're less than conscientious about our online habits: Most of us haven't paid a humiliating price for being watched and tracked. \"We've had a massive experience of walking around naked with no perceived consequences,\" Searls said. Why bother getting dressed?</p><p>So we carry on. Even though everyone is mutely collecting our queries, preferences, fetishes, anxieties.</p><p>Google. Amazon. Facebook. YouTube. Pandora. Pinterest. The Weather Channel. Reddit. Wikipedia. Major League Baseball. PornHub. Zillow. Your newspaper. Your bank. Your phone carrier. Everyone.</p><p>Danah Boyd, founder of the Data &amp; Society Research Institute, perhaps put it best when she wrote we are \"public by default, private through effort.\"</p><p>For most people, that effort -- to change how they search, how they buy stuff, how they connect with others and absorb news -- is just too great. \"There's a sense that the fight to protect your data is unwinnable,\" said Acquisti, of Carnegie Mellon. \"You'd have to learn about other tools; it's costly in time; and it might not even help, because your data is already out there.\"</p><p>Resignation also explains the privacy paradox. It's a perfectly rational response to a situation in which humans have very little agency.</p><p>If that's the case, my initial instinct -- to call our privacy habits \"neurotically contradictory\" -- is a rather ungenerous one. \"It's not a neurotic contradiction,\" Shoshana Zuboff, a professor emerita at Harvard Business School, said to me in the nicest possible way. \"It's an intolerable contradiction.\"</p><p>Zuboff is author of \"The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,\" an ambitious fright-opus that examines the new corporate trafficking in human habits and the consequences for our society. She thinks it's absurd, not to mention blaming the victim, to say that we're reckless with our privacy online. Rather, she argues, we have no choice. Online is where our individual needs get met, because they aren't being met in real life. \"The real institutional world has abandoned us,\" she said.</p><p>As she notes: We call the airlines -- or our insurance companies or our banks -- and spend 10 minutes talking to robots, then another 15 on hold, waiting to speak to an actual person. Is it any wonder we handle matters concerning our health, travel and banking online instead?</p><p>Zuboff has equal compassion for our promiscuities on social media, as compromising as they may be to our privacy. Status online has become compensation for living in an environment of economic instability. It might even pay economic dividends. Influencers online can make money. (Two words that turn my blood to ice: Instagram celebrity.)</p><p>What many of us don't realize, when we're online, is how very much the technologies we're using are reshaping our ideas about privacy without our notice. Which in turn reshapes our behaviors.</p><p>This is one of the core themes of \"Re-Engineering Humanity,\" by Brett Frischmann and Evan Selinger. It's not an accident, they argue, that we treat our privacy differently now. The tools we use have been designed with exactly this end in mind.</p><p>I think, in my own life, about the first random person whose friend request I accepted on Facebook. I no longer remember his name. I simply remember realizing that he was not, as best as I could discern, a friend of a good friend, but rather had come my way via a loopity skein of loose ties. Still, I clicked \"accept.\" Before I knew it, I was doing this pretty regularly, especially in 2014, when I had a book to sell. (Status! Visibility! Sales!) And all was fine with this freewheeling system until the day that one of those random people -- someone who'd requested my friendship, not the other way around (it was never the other way around) -- wrote me a nasty note on Facebook Messenger, letting me know he'd seen me on television and thought me a perfect idiot.</p><p>I unfriended him. But I also felt unnerved and rather furious with myself: He had, at that point, presumably seen pictures of my kid, my wedding at City Hall, my 25th high school reunion. How had I decided that such a thing was ... fine?</p><p>\"The danger that 'privacy' doesn't capture is this idea of creep,\" said Frischmann, an internet law expert at Villanova University. Like letting that random person into your Facebook circle, or -- and this happened in Frischmann's own life -- seeing your child come home from school with a fitness tracking device, which might seem like a win-win (you get free tech; the child might learn about healthy habits) until you consider what it means.</p><p>\"You're conditioning a generation of kids to accept bodily surveillance by others without question,\" he said.</p><p>Our uses of big tech are not only based on our own desires, but the desires of those who designed it. There's a frightening automaticity to them. (I accept. Click.) It's as if we're the robots.</p><p>The irony -- or maybe it isn't? -- is that the demographic most susceptible to the influence of these technologies might also be the savviest about privacy. It was Danah Boyd who set me straight about this. Her book, \"It's Complicated,\" makes it clear that teenagers care deeply about their privacy. The difference is how they go about maintaining it. Some, for instance, just post everything. \"They obfuscate,\" she explains, \"through flooding.\"</p><p>They know that our minds are inefficient threshers, slow and lousy at separating wheat from chaff. But if you tell everyone everything, no one knows where to look or what matters.</p><p>There is, of course, someone else in American life who regularly floods the zone, namely with his Twitter feed. He, too, has been able to divert and confound through this deceptively simple means. According to a recent Gallup poll, his approval rating is now at 46%. Nearly half of Americans don't think he's naked at all.

The response was firm and reassuring, repeated by others before the president rowed back. Cue a collective sigh of relief that our beloved NHS is safe from grasping American interference. Only, of course, it isn't.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sam Lowe, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, was quick to point out one area where the NHS is already \"on the table\" - American companies can bid for contracts such as Babylon Health's GP advice service - and another that is not. The United States wants the NHS to pay more for drugs and could try to incorporate a new reimbursement structure in a trade deal.</p><p>It is unlikely that any UK government would cede to such a demand, particularly when Big Pharma is battling Big Tech to be public enemy No 1 in America. The US took a similar proposal off the table in talks with Australia and New Zealand. Yet it remains a risk, especially for a weakened Britain desperate to replace lost European Union trade after Brexit.</p><p>But there is another area where the NHS is on the table, and it relates to all of us. Our patient records, a treasure trove of data for developers of next-generation medical devices, could be on the table in a trade deal and we wouldn't even know about it. US technology firms could sweep our anonymised health data back to the US, mine it with algorithms in their vastly powerful servers, develop a new set of must-have medical tools or apps and sell them back to the NHS.</p><p>It would not be privatisation in the traditional sense, but it would be an appropriation of NHS assets, only in a more sophisticated way, one more suited to the modern data economy, and the upshot would be that US companies pocket more of the UK's \u00a3170 billion annual health budget, even if they don't actually own more of the NHS.</p><p>Trade negotiations have transformed in the past few years. In recent deals, a new \"digital trade\" chapter has appeared, setting agreements on ecommerce and data access, and similar terms can be found in the White House's \"negotiating objectives\" for a UK trade deal, published in February.</p><p>One of those objectives is to prohibit local data storage, which would allow UK information to be held on servers in the US. Another is to provide full market access for US medical devices. Yet another prohibits \"disclosure of computer source code or algorithms\". Add it together and it looks like the US wants data access, powers to use that data under its own laws, full intellectual property protection for its algorithms and an unrestricted market in which to sell the final product.</p><p>In principle, it is a perfectly fair demand. The UK would get the same in return. But the playing field is not level. The arrangement favours America, particularly when it comes to health data. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Oracle and Salesforce, six giant US tech firms, are moving into the healthcare space, vacuuming up data to mine it with smart algorithms in super-powerful servers for correlations that lead to new cures. The bigger the dataset, the better the chance of discovery and no health provider holds more comprehensive and extensive data than the NHS.</p><p>To establish how important digital trade is to America, you need only look at the new Nafta, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA for short. During the talks, Canada objected to American demands on cross-border data-sharing. It had no problem with US firms building data storage \"clouds\" in Canada, where the information would be subject to Canadian law, but it was not keen for Canadian information to be held in the US, where it would be subject to US law and possibly trawled through under US Patriot Act powers.</p><p>Washington would not buckle, though, and Canada caved. The final agreement included a demand for open government data, \"to expand access to government information with a view to generating business opportunities\". For Michael Geist, a professor of ecommerce law at the University of Ottawa, \"the digital trade chapter raises many concerns, locking in rules that will hamstring online policies for decades by restricting privacy safeguards and hampering efforts to establish new regulation in the digital environment\".</p><p>Of course, digital trade is much bigger than health. Ecommerce is growing more than twice as fast as overall trade. In the UK, 70 per cent of online shoppers use American sites, according to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. Britain and the US are each other's main trading partners in online sales of goods and services and America has an $8 billion trade surplus with the UK in digitally enabled services such as banking, telecoms and accounting.</p><p>But, given the ageing demographics across wealthy economies, the potential in medical devices, apps and services is huge - promising the US an even larger digital trade surplus. For the US to grasp the opportunity, though, it needs access to data - lots of it - and, at the moment, the EU's digital privacy laws are an obstacle.</p><p>Wilbur Ross, the US commerce secretary, wrote last year that \"as currently envisioned, GDPR's implementation could create unnecessary barriers to trade\", specifically citing \"medical data\" as an example. After Brexit, Britain will be able to choose a new data protection regime. One that America would like us to have, perhaps, with \"state-of-the-art rules to ensure the UK does not impose measures that restrict cross-border data flows\", as the US negotiation objectives put it.</p><p>The USMCA clearly sets out the way America wants to go, a way of open government data and closed source codes. Legally, according to Paul Taylor, professor of health informatics at University College London, anonymised data is public, not personal, which potentially puts it up for grabs in a US trade deal.</p><p>The danger, as Annemarie Naylor, policy director at the charity Future Care Capital, says, is \"our healthcare data becoming bargaining chips\" in a bigger trade deal. Make no mistake, one way or another, the NHS is on the table.</p><p>                   Philip Aldrick is Economics Editor of The Times                 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-53484950</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W8Y-Y861-F021-61MB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1030\"/><timeReceived>4:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 7, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Our patient records, a treasure trove of data for developers of next-generation medical devices, could be on the table in a trade deal and we wouldn't even know about it. US technology firms could sweep our anonymised health data back to the US, mine it with algorithms in their vastly powerful servers, develop a new set of must-have medical tools or apps and sell them back to the NHS.</p><p>It would not be privatisation in the traditional sense, but it would be an appropriation of NHS assets, only in a more sophisticated way, one more suited to the modern data economy, and the upshot would be that US companies pocket more of the UK's \u00a3170 billion annual health budget, even if they don't actually own more of the NHS.</p><p>Trade negotiations have transformed in the past few years. In recent deals, a new \"digital trade\" chapter has appeared, setting agreements on ecommerce and data access, and similar terms can be found in the White House's \"negotiating objectives\" for a UK trade deal, published in February.</p><p>One of those objectives is to prohibit local data storage, which would allow UK information to be held on servers in the US. Another is to provide full market access for US medical devices. Yet another prohibits \"disclosure of computer source code or algorithms\". Add it together and it looks like the US wants data access, powers to use that data under its own laws, full intellectual property protection for its algorithms and an unrestricted market in which to sell the final product.</p><p>In principle, it is a perfectly fair demand. The UK would get the same in return. But the playing field is not level. The arrangement favours America, particularly when it comes to health data. Google, Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Oracle and Salesforce, six giant US tech firms, are moving into the healthcare space, vacuuming up data to mine it with smart algorithms in super-powerful servers for correlations that lead to new cures. The bigger the dataset, the better the chance of discovery and no health provider holds more comprehensive and extensive data than the NHS.</p><p>To establish how important digital trade is to America, you need only look at the new Nafta, the USMexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA for short. During the talks, Canada objected to American demands on cross-border datasharing. It had no problem with US firms building data storage \"clouds\" in Canada, where the information would be subject to Canadian law, but it was not keen for Canadian information to be held in the US, where it would be subject to US law and possibly trawled through under US Patriot Act powers.</p><p>Washington would not buckle, though, and Canada caved. The final agreement included a demand for open government data, \"to expand access to government information with a view to generating business opportunities\". For Michael Geist, a professor of ecommerce law at the University of Ottawa, \"the digital trade chapter raises many concerns, locking in rules that will hamstring online policies for decades by restricting privacy safeguards and hampering efforts to establish new regulation in the digital environment\".</p><p>Of course, digital trade is much bigger than health. Ecommerce is growing more than twice as fast as overall trade. In the UK, 70 per cent of online shoppers use American sites, according to the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. Britain and the US are each other's main trading partners in online sales of goods and services and America has an $8 billion trade surplus with the UK in digitally enabled services such as banking, telecoms and accounting.</p><p>But, given the ageing demographics across wealthy economies, the potential in medical devices, apps and services is huge - promising the US an even larger digital trade surplus. For the US to grasp the opportunity, though, it needs access to data - lots of it - and, at the moment, the EU's digital privacy laws are an obstacle.</p><p>Wilbur Ross, the US commerce secretary, wrote last year that \"as currently envisioned, GDPR's implementation could create unnecessary barriers to trade\", specifically citing \"medical data\" as an example. After Brexit, Britain will be able to choose a new data protection regime. One that America would like us to have, perhaps, with \"state-ofthe-art rules to ensure the UK does not impose measures that restrict cross-border data flows\", as the US negotiation objectives put it.</p><p>The USMCA clearly sets out the way America wants to go, a way of open government data and closed source codes. Legally, according to Paul Taylor, professor of health informatics at University College London, anonymised data is public, not personal, which potentially puts it up for grabs in a US trade deal.</p><p>The danger, as Annemarie Naylor, policy director at the charity Future Care Capital, says, is \"our healthcare data becoming bargaining chips\" in a bigger trade deal. Make no mistake, one way or another, the NHS is on the table.</p><p>Philip Aldrick is Economics Editor of The Times</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-149991474</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W93-YB91-DYTY-C070-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1024\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"06\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>June 8, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Scotland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;

Only, of course, it isn't.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'' Sam Lowe, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform, was quick to point out one area where the NHS is already \"on the table\" - American companies can bid for contracts such as Babylon Health's GP advice service - and another that is not.
