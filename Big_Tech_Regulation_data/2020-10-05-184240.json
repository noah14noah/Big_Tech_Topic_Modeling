Encouraging news about manufacturing provided an early boost, but stocks fell later after a report on the pace of home sales fell short of expectations.  </p><p>The government said before trading began that orders for long-lasting goods rose in December by 4.6 percent, helped by a 10 percent gain in orders for new aircraft. The report was a sign of strength for the manufacturing sector, a crucial driver of economic growth.<br/><br/> Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar said separately that its fourth-quarter net income exceeded analysts' expectations, after adjusting for the cost of a soured deal to buy a Chinese maker of roofing supports for mines. Caterpillar said it took a big charge in the quarter because the Chinese company had misrepresented its finances.<br/><br/>Caterpillar Inc.said it expects growth in China to improve without regaining the levels seen in 2010 or 2011. The stock was the biggest gainer in the Dow Jones industrial average, closing up $1.87, or 2 percent, at $97.45.<br/><br/> The Dow Jones transportation index, a proxy for future economic activity, edged higher, notching its tenth straight increase and its twelfth gain in the past 13 trading days.<br/><br/> A half-hour after trading began, the National Association of Realtors said that its index of pending home sales fell in December, suggesting that sales of previously occupied homes may slow in the coming months. The report, which was weaker than many economists had expected, helped push stocks lower for much of the morning. They were roughly flat by midday, and spent the afternoon swapping small bumps and dips.<br/><br/> The Dow closed down 14.05 points, or 0.1 percent, at 13,881.93. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2.78, or 0.2 percent, to 1,500.18. The Nasdaq composite index added 4.59, or 0.2 percent, to 3,154.<br/><br/> The Dow and the S&amp;P 500 are rapidly approaching their all-time closing highs, reached on Oct. 9, 2007. The Dow is about 282 points below its high of 14,164.53; the S&amp;P 500 is 65 points shy of its record of 1,565.<br/><br/> Economic data may be less likely to boost the indexes because traders have become harder to impress as the data have strengthened in recent weeks, said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist with PNC Asset Management Group.<br/><br/> \"Before, even if you came in just at expectations, that was like a victory,\" he said. Because of the market's recent upturn, he said, \"you get less of a pop for just making the numbers.\"<br/><br/> Among companies in the S&amp;P 500 that reported earnings Monday, Biogen Idec Inc. said its fourth-quarter net income slipped nearly 3 percent because of a tax charge and higher expenses. Still, the biotech drug maker rose $3.79, or 2.6 percent, to $149.99.<br/><br/>Roper Industries Inc., which makes medical and industrial equipment, said its fourth-quarter net income rose 18 percent. But the company issued mixed guidance for the current quarter and full year 2013. It fell 33 cents to $118.50.<br/><br/> Oil company Hess Inc. was the biggest gainer in the S&amp;P 500, adding 6.1 percent after the company said it plans to sell its U.S. terminal network, shutter its New Jersey refinery and continue shifting its focus to exploration and production. Hess also said that the hedge fund Elliott Associates plans to seek regulatory approval to buy a major stake in the company. Hess rose $3.58 to $62.48.<br/><br/> Several big tech companies reported their results after the market closed and saw big price swings in after-hours trading:<br/><br/> - Web portal Yahoo Inc. rose 81 cents, or 4 percent, to $21.12 after saying its fourth-quarter earnings topped analyst estimates as an upturn in its international investments helped end a three-year revenue slump.<br/><br/> - Hard disk maker Seagate Technology PLC said it beat analysts' estimates in its results for the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 28. It rose 69 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $38.10 after hours.<br/><br/> - Cloud computing provider VMWare Inc. said its net income edged higher, but the company announced guidance that was far weaker than analysts had expected. VMWare lost $10.83, or 11 percent, to $87.49 after hours.<br/><br/> Strong corporate earnings helped push the S&amp;P 500 through the 1,500 milestone Friday after several calm, relatively news-free weeks. In addition to companies' performance, traders have been encouraged by signals that housing market is improving steadily and hiring is picking up, albeit slowly.<br/><br/> There will plenty of fresh data to drive trading this week, including retail sales, economic growth and the government's report on hiring and employment in January, which is due out Friday. More than one-fifth of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 will report fourth-quarter earnings this week.<br/><br/> Stone said stocks are trading sideways in part because many investors are awaiting economic reports later this week, especially the employment report. There is agreement among economists and analysts that the economy slowed in the fourth quarter, he said, and this week's numbers will help answer the question of \"how slow, and how much did it impact employment.\"<br/><br/> The yield in the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.97 percent from 1.95 percent late Friday, reflecting lower demand for ultra-safe investments. After Monday's factory orders report, the yield rose briefly above 2 percent for the first time since April. A bond's yield rises as demand for it decreases.<br/><br/> ___<br/><br/> Daniel Wagner can be reached at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.twitter.com/wagnerreports\">www.twitter.com/wagnerreports</url> .  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>In this Friday, Jan. 25, 2013, photo, Trader Michael Urkonis, center, works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.

The Dow is about 282 points below its high of 14,164.53; the S&amp;P 500 is 65 points shy of its record of 1,565.</p><p>Economic data may be less likely to boost the indexes because traders have become harder to impress as the data have strengthened in recent weeks, said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist with PNC Asset Management Group.</p><p>\"Before, even if you came in just at expectations, that was like a victory,\" he said. Because of the market's recent upturn, he said, \"you get less of a pop for just making the numbers.\"</p><p>Among companies in the S&amp;P 500 that reported earnings Monday, Biogen Idec Inc. said its fourth-quarter net income slipped nearly 3 percent because of a tax charge and higher expenses. Still, the biotech drug maker rose $3.79, or 2.6 percent, to $149.99.</p><p>Roper Industries Inc., which makes medical and industrial equipment, said its fourth-quarter net income rose 18 percent. But the company issued mixed guidance for the current quarter and full year 2013. It fell 33 cents to $118.50.</p><p>Oil company Hess Inc. was the biggest gainer in the S&amp;P 500, adding 6.1 percent after the company said it plans to sell its U.S. terminal network, shutter its New Jersey refinery and continue shifting its focus to exploration and production. Hess also said that the hedge fund Elliott Associates plans to seek regulatory approval to buy a major stake in the company. Hess rose $3.58 to $62.48.</p><p>Several big tech companies reported their results after the market closed and saw big price swings in after-hours trading:</p><p>l Web portal Yahoo Inc. rose 81 cents, or 4 percent, to $21.12 after saying its fourth-quarter earnings topped analyst estimates as an upturn in its international investments helped end a three-year revenue slump.</p><p>l Hard disk maker Seagate Technology PLC said it beat analysts' estimates in its results for the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 28. It rose 69 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $38.10 after hours.</p><p>l Cloud computing provider VMWare Inc. said its net income edged higher, but the company announced guidance that was far weaker than analysts had expected. VMWare lost $10.83, or 11 percent, to $87.49 after hours.</p><p>Strong corporate earnings helped push the S&amp;P 500 through the 1,500 milestone Friday after several calm, relatively news-free weeks. In addition to companies' performance, traders have been encouraged by signals that housing market is improving steadily and hiring is picking up, albeit slowly.</p><p>There will plenty of fresh data to drive trading this week, including retail sales, economic growth and the government's report on hiring and employment in January, which is due out Friday. More than one-fifth of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 will report fourth-quarter earnings this week.</p><p>Stone said stocks are trading sideways in part because many investors are awaiting economic reports later this week, especially the employment report. There is agreement among economists and analysts that the economy slowed in the fourth quarter, he said, and this week's numbers will help answer the question of \"how slow, and how much did it impact employment.\"</p><p>The yield in the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.97 percent from 1.95 percent late Friday, reflecting lower demand for ultra-safe investments. After Monday's factory orders report, the yield rose briefly above 2 percent for the first time since April. A bond's yield rises as demand for it decreases.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LEWMT-012569554</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LEWMT2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:57MC-4MV1-DYWJ-N0VR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11805</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"873\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Tribune Publishing Co.

Just three months ago, investors were lamenting the end of the bull market -- and the longest economic expansion on record -- after major U.S. stock indexes lost about 35% of their value in less than six weeks. The subsequent rebound has been nearly as brisk.    Partly thanks to an unprecedented $1.6 trillion stimulus package from the Federal Reserve and Congress and a surge in trading among individual investors, the rally has lifted everything from beaten-down energy stocks to apparel retailers to big technology firms.    \"Massive stimulus by the Fed and on the fiscal side has propelled the stock market's recovery at a speed unlike we've ever seen,\" said Liz Ann Sonders, a chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab &amp; Co. \"But there's a perceived disconnect between what the market has done and the economic recovery. The reality is, the second half of the year may see a lot of choppiness.\"    The S&amp;P 500 finished the quarter up 20% at 3100, its biggest percentage gain since the fourth quarter of 1998. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 18% to 25812, its best quarter since 1987.    The rally has cut the indexes' losses for the year to 4% and 10%, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite, which is heavily weighted toward big tech stocks including Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp., has fared even better, up 31% in the past three months and 12% for this year.    The path ahead for the stock market is less clear, especially with the November presidential election now coming into view.    A Democratic sweep of the White House and Congress looms as a potential risk to the market in the months ahead. Analysts say a Democratic-controlled government would likely roll back the tax cuts Congress enacted in 2017, constraining corporate profit margins.    The other risk, analysts add, would be the potential for more regulation, which sometimes stifles business activity. Analysts credit some of the stock market's gains in recent years to the Trump administration's reversal of regulatory actions.    The market's rally has slowed lately as a resurgence in coronavirus cases in some parts of the U.S. and protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd, a Black man in police custody, have dented sentiment. After logging in April and May its biggest two-month percentage gain since 2009, the S&amp;P 500 rose just 1.8% in June.    The economic picture also remains bleak. Nearly 20 million jobs have been shed since February, and retail sales are far below prepandemic levels. Manufacturing activity in the U.S. has also contracted, albeit at a more gradual rate.    Predicting how the stock market will fare in the months ahead has never been simple, but the economic crisis wrought by coronavirus has rewritten the traditional investing playbook.    \"You have traders trying to figure out a medical problem,\" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. \"Because people will make assumptions or because there's a lack of knowledge, the one thing we can all expect is more volatility.\"    Michael Scanlon, a portfolio manager at Manulife Investment Management, said he expects stocks to be stuck in a relatively narrow trading range through the end of the year unless there is a breakthrough on a coronavirus treatment. But that hasn't damped his enthusiasm for U.S. stocks relative to equities in other parts of the world.    \"This has been the ultimate Peter Lynch market and that will continue,\" said Mr. Scanlon, referring to the former Fidelity Magellan Fund manager's often-quoted catchphrase, \"Invest in what you know.\" Mr. Scanlon's fund, the $2.6 billion John Hancock Balanced Fund, has bought stocks such as Ulta Beauty Inc. in recent months, betting the cosmetics company will thrive despite the struggles plaguing department stores.    He added the fund has maintained big positions in Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc. and other popular stocks that have rebounded sharply. Mr. Scanlon's fund is up 0.5% so far this year, beating the S&amp;P 500.    Some investors are more bearish, including famed stock picker Jeremy Grantham. Mr. Grantham said on CNBC about two weeks ago that investors buying stocks right now are \"simply playing with fire.\"    A second wave of coronavirus cases was cited as the most prominent risk facing stocks for a fourth consecutive month, according to a survey of 190 fund managers by Bank of America in June. Permanently high unemployment and a Democratic sweep of the election followed.    \"Covid is going to outweigh the presidential election at least until October unless there's some sort of shock between now and then,\" Mr. Kinahan said, referring to the possibility that former Vice President Joe Biden or President Trump releases policy proposals that roil sectors such as health care or financial services.    The stock market's performance in the months ahead of the election could have a big impact on the outcome of the race, though. Data going back to 1928 show the incumbent party has won the contest 87% of the time if the S&amp;P 500 is positive over the three months ahead of the election and lost it when it is negative, said Courtney Rosenberger, director of policy research at Strategas Securities LLC.    The expectation of near-term volatility has led some analysts and money managers to encourage investors to take a shorter-term look at their portfolios, rather than reviewing on a monthly or quarterly basis.    Ms. Sonders said rebalances should be considered as often as every few weeks depending on which sectors and assets run up quickly and which fall. Planning beyond that is difficult because so many companies have suspended their earnings guidance, she added.    More than 180 companies in the S&amp;P 500 have withdrawn their earnings guidance for 2020, according to FactSet, making it increasingly difficult for investors to value stocks. Just 49 companies have issued guidance for the coming second-quarter earnings season, the fewest since FactSet began tracking such data in 2006.    \"Valuation is a total crapshoot with a record number of companies withdrawing guidance,\" Ms. Sonders added. \"We can plug in a forward consensus, but there's no clarity around the plugs.\"    Analysts predict earnings among companies in the S&amp;P 500 will contract 21% this year from 2019, according to FactSet, before beginning to rebound next year. That is a stark reversal from their call at the beginning of the year for 9.2% growth.    The lack of visibility hasn't appeared to slow the market's rebound. Aggressive efforts by the Fed to stabilize credit markets and a massive aid package from Congress that included enhanced unemployment insurance and loans to struggling businesses gave many investors confidence to jump back into the market.    And many analysts say they have been amazed to see individual investors flocking to platforms including Robinhood Markets Inc. that offer zero-commission trades to take advantage of discounted share prices, adding further momentum to the rally.    Big Wall Street banks have revised their targets several times this year to reflect the rapidly changing outlook. The Fed's stimulus made traditional indicators, including unemployment figures and gross domestic product numbers, less reliable for forecasters, JPMorgan analysts wrote in a June research note.    Bank of America's analysts recently put a 2900 year-end price target on the S&amp;P 500, abandoning previous calls of 2600 and 3100 from earlier points in the year. Goldman lifted the low end of its three-month target to 2750 from 2400 in late May as the index hovered around its year-end projection of 3000.    Those targets suggest the stock market has topped out this year and will fall as much as 5% by December.    Others have abandoned their forecasts altogether in light of the uncertainty. BMO Capital Markets suspended its year-end price target on the S&amp;P 500 in March, instead favoring a rolling 12-month target of 3400 -- suggesting stocks will eventually break out of a narrow trading range to climb 11% from the current level.

Encouraging news about manufacturing provided an early boost, but stocks fell later after a report on the pace of home sales fell short of expectations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The government said before trading began that orders for long-lasting goods rose in December by 4.6 percent, helped by a 10 percent gain in orders for new aircraft. The report was a sign of strength for the manufacturing sector, a crucial driver of economic growth.</p><p>Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar said separately that its fourth-quarter net income exceeded analysts' expectations, after adjusting for the cost of a soured deal to buy a Chinese maker of roofing supports for mines. Caterpillar said it took a big charge in the quarter because the Chinese company had misrepresented its finances.</p><p>Caterpillar Inc.said it expects growth in China to improve without regaining the levels seen in 2010 or 2011. The stock was the biggest gainer in the Dow Jones industrial average, rising $1.82 to $97.40 in afternoon trading.</p><p>A half-hour after trading began, the National Association of Realtors said that its index of pending home sales fell in December, suggesting that sales of previously occupied homes may slow in the coming months. The report, which was weaker than many economists had expected, helped push stocks lower for much of the morning. By midday, they were roughly flat.</p><p>The Dow rose 70 points to 13,895. The S&amp;P 500 fell a fraction to 1,502. The Nasdaq composite index rose 9 to 3,159.</p><p>Economic data may have less impact on the indexes because traders have become harder to impress as the data have strengthened in recent weeks, said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist with PNC Asset Management Group.</p><p>\"Before, even if you came in just at expectations, that was like a victory,\" he said. Because of the market's recent upturn, he said, \"you get less of a pop for just making the numbers.\"</p><p>Among companies in the S&amp;P 500 that reported earnings Monday, Biogen Idec Inc.said its fourth-quarter net income slipped nearly 3 percent because of a tax charge and higher expenses. Still, the biotech drug maker was one of the top gainers in the S&amp;P 500, rising $4.29, or 2.9 percent, to $150.49.</p><p>Roper Industries Inc., which makes medical and industrial equipment, said its fourth-quarter net income rose 18 percent. But the company issued mixed guidance for the current quarter and full year 2013. It rose 36 cents to $119.19.</p><p>Hess Inc. rose after the company said it plans to sell its U.S. terminal network, shutter is New Jersey refinery and focus on its shift to exploration and production. Hess also said Elliott Associates plans to seek regulatory approval to buy a major stake in the company. The stock added 6 percent to $62.48.</p><p>Several big tech companies are set to report after the market closes, among them web portal Yahoo Inc., hard disk maker Seagate Technology PLC and cloud computing provider VMWare Inc.</p><p>Strong corporate earnings helped push the S&amp;P 500 through the 1,500 milestone Friday after several calm, relatively news-free weeks. In addition to companies' performance, traders have been encouraged by signals that housing market is improving steadily and hiring is picking up, albeit slowly.</p><p>There will plenty of fresh data to drive trading this week, including retail sales, economic growth and the government's report on hiring and employment in January, which is due out Friday. More than one-fifth of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 will report fourth-quarter earnings this week.</p><p>Stone said stocks are trading sideways in part because many investors are awaiting economic reports later this week, especially the employment report. There is agreement among economists and analysts that the economy slowed in the fourth quarter, he said, and this week's numbers will help answer the question of \"how slow, and how much did it impact employment.\"</p><p>The yield in the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.99 percent from 1.95 percent late Friday, reflecting lower demand for ultra-safe investments. After Monday's factory orders report, the yield rose briefly above 2 percent for the first time since April. A bond's yield rises as demand for it decreases.</p><p>Daniel Wagner can be reached at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.twitter.com/wagnerreports\">www.twitter.com/wagnerreports</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APFINL-US Wall Street_US stocks mixed after uneven economic signals</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APFINL2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:57M5-K0H1-DYN6-W1Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">288311</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"729\"/><timeReceived>8:02 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Financial Wire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>January 28, 2013 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Encouraging news about manufacturing provided an early boost, but stocks fell later after a report on the pace of home sales fell short of expectations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The government said before trading began that orders for long-lasting goods rose in December by 4.6 percent, helped by a 10 percent gain in orders for new aircraft. The report was a sign of strength for the manufacturing sector, a crucial driver of economic growth.</p><p>Heavy equipment maker Caterpillar said separately that its fourth-quarter net income exceeded analysts' expectations, after adjusting for the cost of a soured deal to buy a Chinese maker of roofing supports for mines. Caterpillar said it took a big charge in the quarter because the Chinese company had misrepresented its finances.</p><p>Caterpillar Inc.said it expects growth in China to improve without regaining the levels seen in 2010 or 2011. The stock was the biggest gainer in the Dow Jones industrial average, rising $1.82 to $97.40 in afternoon trading.</p><p>A half-hour after trading began, the National Association of Realtors said that its index of pending home sales fell in December, suggesting that sales of previously occupied homes may slow in the coming months. The report, which was weaker than many economists had expected, helped push stocks lower for much of the morning. By midday, they were roughly flat.</p><p>The Dow rose 70 points to 13,895. The S&amp;P 500 fell a fraction to 1,502. The Nasdaq composite index rose 9 to 3,159.</p><p>Economic data may have less impact on the indexes because traders have become harder to impress as the data have strengthened in recent weeks, said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist with PNC Asset Management Group.</p><p>\"Before, even if you came in just at expectations, that was like a victory,\" he said. Because of the market's recent upturn, he said, \"you get less of a pop for just making the numbers.\"</p><p>Among companies in the S&amp;P 500 that reported earnings Monday, Biogen Idec Inc.said its fourth-quarter net income slipped nearly 3 percent because of a tax charge and higher expenses. Still, the biotech drug maker was one of the top gainers in the S&amp;P 500, rising $4.29, or 2.9 percent, to $150.49.</p><p>Roper Industries Inc., which makes medical and industrial equipment, said its fourth-quarter net income rose 18 percent. But the company issued mixed guidance for the current quarter and full year 2013. It rose 36 cents to $119.19.</p><p>Hess Inc. rose after the company said it plans to sell its U.S. terminal network, shutter is New Jersey refinery and focus on its shift to exploration and production. Hess also said Elliott Associates plans to seek regulatory approval to buy a major stake in the company. The stock added 6 percent to $62.48.</p><p>Several big tech companies are set to report after the market closes, among them web portal Yahoo Inc., hard disk maker Seagate Technology PLC and cloud computing provider VMWare Inc.</p><p>Strong corporate earnings helped push the S&amp;P 500 through the 1,500 milestone Friday after several calm, relatively news-free weeks. In addition to companies' performance, traders have been encouraged by signals that housing market is improving steadily and hiring is picking up, albeit slowly.</p><p>There will plenty of fresh data to drive trading this week, including retail sales, economic growth and the government's report on hiring and employment in January, which is due out Friday. More than one-fifth of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 will report fourth-quarter earnings this week.</p><p>Stone said stocks are trading sideways in part because many investors are awaiting economic reports later this week, especially the employment report. There is agreement among economists and analysts that the economy slowed in the fourth quarter, he said, and this week's numbers will help answer the question of \"how slow, and how much did it impact employment.\"</p><p>The yield in the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.99 percent from 1.95 percent late Friday, reflecting lower demand for ultra-safe investments. After Monday's factory orders report, the yield rose briefly above 2 percent for the first time since April. A bond's yield rises as demand for it decreases.</p><p>Daniel Wagner can be reached at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.twitter.com/wagnerreports\">www.twitter.com/wagnerreports</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">APONL-US Wall Street</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">APONL2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:57M5-K2P1-JBKJ-D30N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">147876</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"729\"/><timeReceived>8:03 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Associated Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Associated Press Online</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>January 28, 2013 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Wall Street is opening slightly higher, Tuesday, Sept. 22, 2020, as markets recover from steep losses Monday. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File)NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Stocks are drifting in early trading on Wall Street Tuesday, with indexes mixed, a day after tumbling amid a raft of worries about the pandemic and governments' response to it. </p><p> The S&amp;#38;P 500 was 0.1% higher after giving up a healthier gain of 0.7% just after trading began. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 37 points, or 0.1%, at 27,107 after losing an earlier gain, as of 9:54 a.m. Eastern time. The Nasdaq composite was virtually flat.  Wall Street has suddenly lost momentum in September following months of powerful gains that returned the S&amp;#38;P 500 to a record. A long list of concerns for investors has caused big swings in the market, from worries that stocks have grown too expensive to frustration about Congress' refusal so far to deliver more aid to the struggling economy.  Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to give testimony before a House of Representatives committee later Tuesday, where investors expect him to press again for Congress to act. Extra weekly unemployment benefits and other stimulus that Congress approved in March have expired, and some areas of the economy have already slowed as a result. That support from Congress, along with unprecedented moves by the Federal Reserve to aid markets, helped halt the S&amp;#38;P 500's nearly 34% plummet earlier this year. Investors say it's crucial that Congress extended more support, but partisan disagreements have blocked the efforts.  The sudden vacancy on the Supreme Court following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is amping up partisanship across the country, diminishing hopes even further.  Among other concerns for investors are rising tensions between the United States and China, which could lead to a Chinese retaliation against U.S tech companies, as well as the upcoming U.S. elections and all the changes in tax policy and regulations they can create. (Ad) One very specific company has started drilling and discovered high grade gold, yet been overlooked by Wall Street. That isuntil now! All those factors combined to knock the S&amp;#38;P 500 down as much as 2.7% in Monday's trading. Early in the day, Big Tech stocks were among the weights pulling the market lower.  They have lost momentum this month on worries their stocks grew too expensive following a supersonic run through the pandemic. Apple, Amazon and others have benefited from the pandemic because it's accelerated work-from-home and other trends that boost their profits. But tech stocks staged a late-day turnaround on Monday, helping the S&amp;#38;P 500 to more than halve its losses. Tech stocks were swinging between small gains and losses in early Tuesday trading and dragging broad market indexes in their wake due to their huge size.  Apple gained 1.3%, and Microsoft rose 0.4%. Amazon climbed 2.1%.  Stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the strength of the economy clawed back some of their sharp losses from the day before, but their movements were also erratic.  Norwegian Cruise Line gained 1.8%, though it's still down 6.2% for the week so far. Energy stocks in the S&amp;#38;P 500 rose as much as 1.6% in the first 20 minutes of trading, only to give all the gains away.  European stocks recovered some of their steep losses from Monday, which were triggered in part by worries that stricter restrictions on businesses may be on the way to stem a resurgence of coronavirus cases.  U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday announced a package of new restrictions, including requiring pubs and restaurants to close between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m, but analysts said they were less extreme than some investors worried.  Germany's DAX returned 1.1%, though it's still down 3.3% for the week so far. France's CAC 40 rose 0.5%, and the FTSE 100 in London added 0.8%. In Asia, South Korea's Kospi fell 2.4%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 1% and stocks in Shanghai sank 1.3%. Treasury yields dipped slightly, and the 10-year yield slipped to 0.67% from 0.68% late Monday.  ___ AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.6 Travel Stocks That Present a Buy and Hold Opportunity[1]There is a common expression that patience is a virtue. Many investors will have their patience tested in the coming weeks and months. Many stocks are dead in the water right now. Before we know how robust an economic turnaround will be, the nation has to get to the other side of the coronavirus. The problem is that nobody knows exactly when that will be. And one reason for that is that recovery is going to be a state-by-state, household-by-household decision. Plus, it's hard to determine what 'normal' will be like without an actual vaccine. Having said that, it's more likely than not that the economy will reopen sooner rather than later. We may be wearing masks, foregoing handshakes and hugs, and otherwise socially distancing while getting back to a routine. And that includes traveling. Some of the most beaten-down stocks are from the travel industry. Entire sectors of our economy including airlines, hotels, and casinos are facing multiple quarters of extremely low revenue.

The S&amp;P 500 was 0.1% higher after giving up a healthier gain of 0.7% just after trading began. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 37 points, or 0.1%, at 27,107 after losing an earlier gain, as of 9:54 a.m. Eastern time. The Nasdaq composite was virtually flat.    Wall Street has suddenly lost momentum in September following months of powerful gains that returned the S&amp;P 500 to a record. A long list of concerns for investors has caused big swings in the market, from worries that stocks have grown too expensive to frustration about Congress\u2019 refusal so far to deliver more aid to the struggling economy.    Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to give testimony before a House of Representatives committee later Tuesday, where investors expect him to press again for Congress to act. Extra weekly unemployment benefits and other stimulus that Congress approved in March have expired, and some areas of the economy have already slowed as a result.    That support from Congress, along with unprecedented moves by the Federal Reserve to aid markets, helped halt the S&amp;P 500's nearly 34% plummet earlier this year. Investors say it\u2019s crucial that Congress extended more support, but partisan disagreements have blocked the efforts.    The sudden vacancy on the Supreme Court following the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is amping up partisanship across the country, diminishing hopes even further.    Among other concerns for investors are rising tensions between the United States and China, which could lead to a Chinese retaliation against U.S tech companies, as well as the upcoming U.S. elections and all the changes in tax policy and regulations they can create.    All those factors combined to knock the S&amp;P 500 down as much as 2.7% in Monday\u2019s trading. Early in the day, Big Tech stocks were among the weights pulling the market lower.    They have lost momentum this month on worries their stocks grew too expensive following a supersonic run through the pandemic. Apple, Amazon and others have benefited from the pandemic because it\u2019s accelerated work-from-home and other trends that boost their profits.    But tech stocks staged a late-day turnaround on Monday, helping the S&amp;P 500 to more than halve its losses. Tech stocks were swinging between small gains and losses in early Tuesday trading and dragging broad market indexes in their wake due to their huge size.    Apple gained 1.3%, and Microsoft rose 0.4%. Amazon climbed 2.1%.    Stocks of companies whose profits are most closely tied to the strength of the economy clawed back some of their sharp losses from the day before, but their movements were also erratic.    Norwegian Cruise Line gained 1.8%, though it's still down 6.2% for the week so far. Energy stocks in the S&amp;P 500 rose as much as 1.6% in the first 20 minutes of trading, only to give all the gains away.    European stocks recovered some of their steep losses from Monday, which were triggered in part by worries that stricter restrictions on businesses may be on the way to stem a resurgence of coronavirus cases.    U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday announced a package of new restrictions, including requiring pubs and restaurants to close between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m, but analysts said they were less extreme than some investors worried.    Germany\u2019s DAX returned 1.1%, though it\u2019s still down 3.3% for the week so far. France\u2019s CAC 40 rose 0.5%, and the FTSE 100 in London added 0.8%.    In Asia, South Korea\u2019s Kospi fell 2.4%, Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng lost 1% and stocks in Shanghai sank 1.3%.    Treasury yields dipped slightly, and the 10-year yield slipped to 0.67% from 0.68% late Monday.    ___    AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43136210518</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WT-WD81-JCSC-J349-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"694\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>NBC Los Angeles</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 22, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>S-Tech Corp</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.ticker\"><classificationItem><className>1NC</className><className>MUN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>1NC</className><className>BER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NCLH</className><className>WBO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>1NC</className><className>HAM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>1NC</className><className>FRA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NCLH</className><className>NYS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>0UC3</className><className>LTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>N1CL34</className><className>BSP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>1NC</className><className>DUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NCLH</className><className>MEX</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>1NC</className><className>STU</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>1584</className><className>ROCO</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Hearings &amp;

Just three months ago, investors were lamenting the end of the bull market -- and the longest economic expansion on record -- after major U.S. stock indexes lost about 35% of their value in less than six weeks. The subsequent rebound has been nearly as brisk.    Partly thanks to an unprecedented $1.6 trillion stimulus package from the Federal Reserve and Congress and a surge in trading among individual investors, the rally has lifted everything from beaten-down energy stocks to apparel retailers to big technology firms.    \"Massive stimulus by the Fed and on the fiscal side has propelled the stock market's recovery at a speed unlike we've ever seen,\" said Liz Ann Sonders, a chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab &amp; Co. \"But there's a perceived disconnect between what the market has done and the economic recovery. The reality is, the second half of the year may see a lot of choppiness.\"    The S&amp;P 500 is on track to finish the quarter up 19% at 3077, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 17% at 25670. Both benchmarks are poised for their biggest percentage gains since the fourth quarter of 1998.    The rally has cut the indexes' losses for the year to 4.7% and 10%, respectively. The Nasdaq Composite, which is heavily weighted toward big tech stocks including Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp., has fared even better, up nearly 30% in the past three months and 11% for this year. Stocks edged modestly higher in Tuesday's session.    The path ahead for the stock market is less clear, especially with the November presidential election now coming into view.    A Democratic sweep of the White House and Congress looms as a potential risk to the market in the months ahead. Analysts say a Democrat-controlled government would likely roll back the tax cuts Congress enacted in 2017, constraining corporate profit margins.    The other risk, analysts added, would be the potential for more regulation, which sometimes stifles business activity. Analysts credit some of the stock market's gains in recent years to the Trump administration's reversal of regulatory actions.    The market's rally has slowed lately as signs of a resurgence in coronavirus cases in some parts of the U.S. and protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd, a Black man in police custody, have dented sentiment. After logging in April and May its biggest two-month percentage gain since 2009, the S&amp;P 500 is up just 1.2% in June.    The economic picture also remains bleak. Nearly 20 million jobs have been shed since February, and retail sales are far below prepandemic levels. Manufacturing activity in the U.S. has also contracted, albeit at a more gradual rate.    Predicting how the stock market will fare in the months ahead has never been simple, but the economic crisis wrought by coronavirus has rewritten the traditional investing playbook.    Everything from the usual go-to economic figures on which investors rely to the source of equity demand has been upended by the pandemic, undercutting Wall Street's ability to make solid bets on where stocks go from here. One thing on which investors and analysts generally agree: Stocks are in for a rocky ride over the next six months.    \"You have traders trying to figure out a medical problem,\" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. \"Because people will make assumptions or a because there's a lack of knowledge, the one thing we can all expect is more volatility.\"    A second wave of coronavirus cases was cited as the most prominent risk facing stocks for a fourth consecutive month, according to a survey of 190 fund managers by Bank of America in June. Permanently high unemployment and a Democratic sweep of the election followed.    \"Covid is going to outweigh the presidential election at least until October unless there's some sort of shock between now and then,\" Mr. Kinahan added, referring to the possibility that former Vice President Joe Biden or President Trump releases policy proposals that roil sectors like health care or financial services.    The stock market's performance in the months ahead of the election could have a big impact on the outcome of the race, though. Data going back to 1928 show the incumbent party has won the contest 87% of the time if the S&amp;P 500 is positive over the three months ahead of the election and lost it when it is negative, said Courtney Rosenberger, director of policy research at Strategas Securities LLC.    The expectation of near-term volatility has led some analysts and money managers to encourage investors to take a shorter-term look at their portfolios, rather than reviewing on a monthly or quarterly basis.    Ms. Sonders said rebalances should be considered as often as every few weeks depending on which sectors and assets run up quickly and which fall. Planning beyond that is difficult because so many companies have suspended their earnings guidance, she added.    More than 180 companies in the S&amp;P 500 have withdrawn their earnings guidance for 2020, according to FactSet, making it increasingly difficult for investors to value stocks. Just 49 companies have issued guidance for the coming second-quarter earnings season, the fewest since FactSet began tracking such data in 2006.    \"Valuation is a total crapshoot with a record number of companies withdrawing guidance,\" Ms. Sonders added. \"We can plug in a forward consensus, but there's no clarity around the plugs.\"    Analysts predict earnings among companies in the S&amp;P 500 will contract 21% this year from 2019, according to FactSet, before beginning to rebound next year. That's a stark reversal from their call at the beginning of the year for 9.2% growth.    The lack of visibility hasn't appeared to slow the market's rebound. Aggressive efforts by the Fed to stabilize credit markets and a massive aid package from Congress that included enhanced unemployment insurance and loans to struggling businesses gave many investors confidence to jump back into the market.    And many analysts say they have been amazed to see individual investors flocking to platforms including Robinhood Markets Inc. that offer zero-commission trades to take advantage of discounted share prices, adding further momentum to the rally.    Big Wall Street banks have revised their targets several times this year to reflect the rapidly changing outlook. The Fed's stimulus made traditional indicators, including unemployment figures and gross domestic product numbers, less reliable for forecasters, JPMorgan analysts wrote in a June research note.    Bank of America's analysts recently put a 2900 year-end price target on the S&amp;P 500, abandoning previous calls of 2600 and 3100 from earlier points in the year. Goldman lifted the low end of its three-month target to 2750 from 2400 in late May as the index hovered around its year-end projection of 3000.    Those targets suggest the stock market has topped out this year and will fall as much as 5% by December.    Others have abandoned their forecasts altogether in light of the uncertainty. BMO Capital Markets suspended its year-end price target on the S&amp;P 500 in March, instead favoring a rolling 12-month target of 3400 -- suggesting stocks will eventually break out of a narrow trading range to climb 11% from the current level. Oppenheimer also shelved its year-end target.    \"It will be necessary to see some clarity and stability on the Covid-10 and economic front in order for stocks to embark on a prolonged price recovery,\" BMO Capital Markets Chief Investment Strategist Brian Belski wrote in a recent note.

Some hate it.  This is  the volatility that the market has been known for the last several months.   U.S. indices are down sharply as trading comes to a close on Wall Street.   Look at the red.  It's been like that most of the day and gathering speed.   It is Tuesday, May 17th.  Mark Cuban warns there's been red ahead for  stocks if Donald Trump takes the White House.  We'll get the traders' view.   World's largest airline says rising oil prices means it's time to hike  fares.  And swipe right to stay in the EU.  David Cameron joins Tinder.   I'm Paula Newton and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks have plunged on Wall Street as the market prepares for a rate rise  that could come much sooner than expected.  The DOW, NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500  each closed off about one percent.  As you can see there, the DOW slightly  off its lows of the day but still looking quite poorly.  It's the third  session in a row that we have seen triple digit swings for the DOW and it  comes after a double whammy of news suggesting the Federal Reserve may be  gearing up to raise interest rates.  </p><p>First strong inflation data here in the United States and then comments  from the head of the Atlanta Fed saying next month's meeting should be  considered in his words live.  Paul La Monica joins me live.  You know  Paul, this market has been searching for some other paradigm.  Just a few  days ago we heard people saying, \"Eh, you know, the Fed.  We don't have to  worry about the Fed anymore.  We've already put in a rate hike towards the  end of the year and now today this.\"  I mean, is there a new paradigm  emerging or is it just back to the same old thing?  Fed's rise rates.   Stocks go down.  </p><p>PAUL R.  LA MONICA, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT:  Yes.  I think it's the same  old thing, Paula.  We still have the absence of a lot of major economic or  earnings news this week.  So I think investors may be grasps for straws  trying to analyze every single word of the Fed members.  A Fed meeting, I  think always live no matter what they say, because it's always data  dependent some point.  My best guess is end of the year.  And maybe the new  president has, you know, an unwelcomed present of a Fed rate hike right  around November or December after the election.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  Yes.  In terms of when you look at the fundamentals of this  market, though, if we go through the earnings season here, was there a lot  to worry investors in there?  </p><p>LA MONICA:  I think that, you know, those who want to worry can find things  to worry about.  But, you know, we did have, you know, some concerning  reports from a lot of retailers, which does potentially raise questions  about the health of the U.S. consumer but outside of that you did have some  better results from some big tech companies, so it is a mixed bag.  I think  the absence of any definitive trend is what is most concerning.  It is  still very difficult to figure out if this economy is going to pick up  steam or not.  It doesn't appear as if we're going to have an answer to  that until later in the year.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  Yes, and the big spoiler could also be oil.  We'll talk about it a  little bit later.  Oil up again today.  If we really see huge volatility in  that market on the upside, do you think there's more collateral damage to  the market?  </p><p>LA MONICA:  I think so because you will have more people worried about what  that does to things like auto sales and retail sales more broadly.  The  American consumer wasn't really out there spending like gang busters when  gas prices were really cheap.  It is hard to imagine how they do that if  prices will start to rise more steadily.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  OK, Paul.  We'll continue to check in with you.  It's going to be  a wild ride, we think, until November.  We are going to actually be, Paul,  going into a lot of the election scenarios.  If you had to talk about it  now, how much more is that election sentiment creeping into market  sentiment, where they're looking at Trump and likely Hillary coming head to  head and saying, lock, there are no dramatic moves here until we know the  president we're dealing with?  </p><p>LA MONICA:  I think to a certain extent that is the case.  I still believe  that the market is expecting that Hillary Clinton will prevail.  Whether or  not that happens, obviously, we have six months before the general  election.  But I think, you know, you can't also ignore what's going to  happen with the big congressional races, as well.  I think the power of the  president, while clearly important, is somewhat muted depending on what  happens with the congressional landscape, as well.  I think investors for  the most part probably expecting more gridlock.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  So much to look forward, Paul.  </p><p>LA MONICA:  Exactly.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  Thanks so much.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>[16:05:00] Now, this volatility comes as two U.S. states go to the polls.   Now, a billionaire businessman made famous by reality TV -- sounds familiar  doesn't it -- is warning American voters don't elect a billionaire  businessman made famously reality TV.  The internet entrepreneur, Mark  Cuban, says \"If Donald Trump becomes president the stock market could  tank.\"  Cuban is a host on the show \"Shark Tank.\"  and the owner of the  Dallas Mavericks of the NBA.  He told CNN, \"Trump's unpredictability and  lack of detailed policies would cause chaos.\"  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK CUBAN, OWNER DALLAS MAVERICKS:  That uncertainty, you know,  potentially as the president of the United States, that's the last thing  Wall Street wants to hear.  And I can say with 100 percent certainty that  there's a really good chance we could see a huge, huge correction.  It  could be 20 percent.  You know?  Now with high frequency trading  accelerating, you know, strong moves in any direction, it could be worse  than that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWMAN:  Theodore Weisberg, founder and president of Seaport Securities at  the New York Stock Exchange, so how about it?  Is Mr. Cuban right?  </p><p>THEODORE P WEISBERG, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, SEAPORT SECURITIES:  Well, I  don't know if he's a lot smarter than me and certainly he's a lot richer.   But I don't know that he's right because I'm not sure that with all his  money and experience that he has crystal ball.  I'd be reluctant to make  that prediction.  I would say this.  I think that a change in Washington is  actually going to be a plus for the stock market no matter who gets elected  because I think the public wants a change.  </p><p>And I mean, if you want do get into the weeds a little bit, I think one of  the first things we're going to see happen, no matter whose president, is  that Federal Reserve monetary policy just isn't doing it for this economy.   And zero interest rates don't seem to work and I think the prospect of  perhaps a tax cut, corporate tax cut, and repatriation of all those  offshore trillions of dollars, because of some tax holiday, is probably in  the cards no matter who's going to be president.  So obviously, I don't  agree with him.  I have -- I'm reluctant to make any predictions.  But I  think the change is actually going to be positive for the market no matter  who it is.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  You know, that's an interesting perspective because you know it's  an odd one.  Most people say, look, it does matter who's in there.  You're  talking about employing more fiscal policy than monetary policy.  Do you  think that's something that the market wants?  That the market will respond  to that?  Because you know what?  When it comes to those trade deals it can  go in a completely different direction.  </p><p>WEISBERG:  I -- can you repeat the question?  </p><p>NEWMAN:  I'm saying if we get into the weeds, fiscal verse monetary policy,  the market better, you know, be careful what you wish for, right?  Because  a lot of that may deal with problems, even in the trade agreement that is  we now know, and Mr. Trump is very vocal about it.  And perhaps Hillary  Clinton may be a little bit more vocal about that.  </p><p>WEISBERG:  Well, listen.  We can't predict what the changes will be no  matter who's elected.  All I'm suggesting is that I think a new  administration in Washington, no matter whose elected, is actually going to  be a plus for the market because the U.S. economy by all definitions, you  know, has been walking in the soft sand for eight years.  And a Fed  monetary policy of zero interest rates, clearly, I guess, you know, has  worked a little, really hasn't has didn't the results that folks wanted.  </p><p>Yes, we have a better stock market and the unemployment rate improved, but  you still have all kinds of variations of that theme.  But the U.S. economy  continues to be sluggish and the world's economy too sluggish.  So I think  monetary policy has done just about all it can do.  Now we need some real  change and I think one of those possible changes is a corporate tax cut to  really, you know, get some juice into the economy and to get all of these  offshore dollars back into the U.S. now, that doesn't help the rest of the  world, but certainly could help the U.S. and that would be good for the  market.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  OK.  Excellent, Ted.  Thank you.  And thank you for getting into  the weeds.  We like the weeds here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.  It's a good  place to be in the next five months.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>WEISBERG:  OK.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  European stocks, meantime, closed mostly lower Tuesday.  Greek  bank stocks rallied while auto stocks slumped.  And in the meantime, the  British Prime Minister spelled out what he calls the horrors, that's as he  sees them, of Britain leaving the European Union.  Now with the referendum  a few weeks away, David Cameron said the Brexit is the result that would  probably please Vladimir Putin and even the leader of ISIS.  Earlier today  he was warning business leaders about the economic uncertainty it would  bring.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DAVID CAMERON, BRITISH PRIME MINISTER:  I think when very respected  organizations are saying as clearly as they are that output would be lower,  growth would be less, unemployment would be higher, prices would be higher,  we would see a hit to living standards, that there is a very clear  consensus that leaving the EU would have not just a short-term effect on  confidence and investment and growth, but actually would have a longer term  effect, as well.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWMAN:  Now, for what it's worth, a new opinion poll published in the  \"Telegraph\" newspaper, says the remain campaign is gaining ground.  </p><p>[16:10:00] Fifty-five percent of people saying they want to stay in the EU  and 40 percent in favor of the so-called Brexit.  Now sovereignty and the  power to make laws are central to the Brexit debate.  CNN London's  Correspondent, Max Foster, gains now what we see a rare access to Britain's  parliamentary archives and the one act which first tied it to the European  Union.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MAX FOSTER, CNN LONDON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Often described as the  most important room in Britain, the Acts Room.  High up in the houses of  parliament it's home to 64,000 documents covering some of the most  important moments in British history.  </p><p>(on camera):  On these shelves are stacked truly ancient documents.  Here  we have some that are 500 years old.  During the reign of Henry VII no  less.  Here we have the Weights and Measures Act of 1497.  </p><p>(voice-over):  But who currently creates new laws is at the center of the  referendum over Britain's membership of the EU.  </p><p>JOHN REDWOOD, CONSERVATIVE MEMBER OF BRITISH PARLIAMENT:  How much we raise  in tax, what taxes we impose and how we spend that tax is no longer under  the control of the British parliament.  In many respects under the control  of the European union.  </p><p>FOSTER (voice-over):  Whilst others see giving up on aspects of control is  part of a globalized world.  </p><p>VICKY PRYCE, ECONOMIST:  We have decided to do things in a certain way so  far, which gives up some of the sovereignty, pulls sovereignty for  particular reason, which are good for us and Europe as a whole.  </p><p>FOSTER (voice-over):  Remain campaigners are keen to cite that between 1993  and 2014, only 13 percent of British laws, such as the working time  directive, came from the European Union.  However, if you add up all of the  EU regulations, including the ones that don't need to go through  Parliament, like mobile phone roaming charges, those championing a Brexit  argue that 62 percent of British laws have EU origins.  But only one law  was needed to make this possible.  </p><p>(on camera):  Well, here it is.  This is the European Communities act of  1972.  And this is the piece of legislation that signed the UK up to what  was the European Economic Community and which we now know as the European  Union and this really paved the way for all of those regulations and  requirements that now apply in this country.  </p><p>(voice-over):  The UK does have an influence on those regulations.  Equally  so do the 27 other member states, which means Britain doesn't always get  what it wants.  If the country went it alone it could set its own laws but  if it wanted to be part of the single market, it would have to adhere to EU  rules with no say on how they're set.  Sovereignty becomes a tradeoff  between power and influence.  These scrolls bear witness to changes in  power and attitudes over hundreds of years but who has precedence over the  laws in the future will be decided by the British people.  Max Foster, CNN,  London.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWMAN:  Now, India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has been trying to  strengthen his country's ties with Silicon Valley and now he'll be face-to- face with the biggest name in the business.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:15:13] Tim Cook is arriving in India today for the first visit there as  the head of Apple.  He wrapped up a trip to China and the company faced one  of the worst ever financial quarters.  While Apple is facing a slowdown in  China, sales soared last quarter in India even though Apple hasn't got any  stores there yet.  CNN's new Delhi Bureau Chief, Ravi Agrawal, explains.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RAVI AGRAWAL, CNN NEW DELHI BUREAU CHIEF:  Tim Cook has been to China eight  times since he became Apple's CEO in 2011, but he hasn't visited India even  once until now.  India represents a major growth spot for Apple.  </p><p>In the last quarter Apple recorded its first decline in global sales in 13  years.  India was a rare bright spot with sales up 56 percent.  One reason  is that India has a fast growing smartphone market.  In 2010, only 100  million Indians were on the internet.  In 2015, that number jumped to 300  million.  Most of that growth is coming from Indians who are discovering  the internet not on pcs or Macs, but on smartphones, and there is still a  lot of room to grow.  </p><p>The world bank points out a billion Indians remain offline.  That's why  Apple CEO Tim Cook is bullish on India.  But it's not all smooth sailing.   Earlier this year, Apple sought government permission to sell refurbished  iPhones to appeal to a broader section of the Indian market that permission  denied.  </p><p>There is also the fact that while Apple has 32 of the flagship Apple stores  in China, it has a grand total of zero in India.  And that's because the  tech giant has struggled to comply with regulations to source a certain  percentage of each phone's components locally.  Lots for Tim Cook to mull  while he's in India.  </p><p>Among the people he's expected to meet are India's Prime Minister Narendra  Modi.  Modi has courted the support of top American CEOs as he tries to  bring jobs and foreign investment to India.  This is one meeting that any  tech watcher would love to be a fly on the wall for.  Ravi Agrawal, CNN,  New Delhi.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWMAN:  Now, China's tech scene still has a long way to catch up to the  likes of Apple, but a new generation of entrepreneurs is looking to change  that.  Now as part of \"CHINA'S TECH REVOLUTION,\" Matt Rivers visited a  state sponsored hub for company start-ups.  </p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  Playing the guitar is cool.   And yet, Zhang Bohan calls himself a geek because he developed the app that  helped teach him to play.  The app is called \"Poputar.\"  </p><p>The app is called \"Poputar\", think popular guitar.  A series of lessons on  your phone shows you what to play.  The guitar that comes with it connects  to the app and lights up spots where you're supposed to put your fingers.   And voila, you're Jimi Hendrix.</p><p>We met up with Zhang and his partner Zhao Yan in a cafE up the street from  the office.  Along with another partner, the trio hatched their plan back  in 2014 around these tables.</p><p>He says this is where people with an idea, but no money, connected friends,  or resources meet up.  The garage cafe, where the next big idea is just one  espresso away, is an incubator where people rent small space to help launch  their tech companies.  It's one of forty or so on this street alone, called  \"Innoway\", a 200-meter stretch in northwest Beijing.  More than 300 start- ups call this area home.  </p><p>The Chinese economy is undergoing a broad transition, moving away from  manufacturing and relying more now on services.  In 2013, the Chinese  government invested 36 million us dollars into this street, where startups  dominate instead of, and say, steel.  It's a sign that times are changing.</p><p>Liu Wei is at the forefront of that change.  He runs legend star, a company  that specializes in seed investment, the first round of fundraising.  In  other words, he helps start-ups actually start up.</p><p>He says 10 years ago, start-ups weren't big here because the investment  community was very conservative.  Few companies with the resources to  invest in start-ups actually did so.  But he says that's swiftly changing  as more and more people realize that technology is the key to profits in  the digital age.</p><p>He thinks the startup scene here will eventually rival and perhaps surpass  the success of Silicon Valley.  Back at Poputar, it's an exciting time.   The app just went live this week.  Zhang says he's nervous but confident.   Surprise, surprise, he plays guitar to alleviate stress.</p><p>[16:20:00] (on camera):  Teach me how to do this.  Let's see if I can  learn.  </p><p>ZHANG BOHAN, POPUTAR DEVELOPER:  Yes, My pleasure.</p><p>A few admittedly terrible notes later, it does get a bit easier.  I might  not be a star, but Poputar is aiming become one in the ultra-competitive  app world part of a growing number of Chinese start-ups hoping to strike a  chord with consumers.  Matt Rivers, CNN, Beijing.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWMAN:  Matt is clearly a braver correspondent than I.  </p><p>Now all companies start small.  Some grow into behemoths and learn about  China's tech giants and the Chinese Tech Revolution on  CNNmoney.com/Chinatech.  </p><p>Now, back here in the United States, Amazon is proving that big tech still  has room to grow.  Company held an investor meeting today and shareholders  had very little to complain about.  The stock is up more than 64 percent  over the past year.  For years, Amazon invested at the expense of profits  in cloud computing, in building its own devices and, of course, video  streaming.  It was all to get consumers into what it called the Amazon  ecosystem.  Now, the company's latest plans revolve around a little device  that could bring that ecosystem into your home.  CNN money Samuel Burke has  more.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT:  Alexa, what time is it?  </p><p>ALEXA:  The time is 1:24.  </p><p>BURKE:  Alexa, when's the meaning of life?  </p><p>ALEXA:  The meaning of life depends on the life in question.  </p><p>BURKE:  Alexa, turn the lights on.  </p><p>Apple has Siri.  Microsoft with Cortana.  Google has Now.  Those voice  systems live in your phone or tablets.  Amazon's Alexa lives in your home.  </p><p>She dwells in a series of amazon devices called Echo.  Wi-Fi connected  speakers with a microphone always listening for you to say the wake word.   Alexa -- amazon's making a huge push into two different market trends with  this device.  Artificial intelligence as well as the internet of things.   Projected to be a $14 trillion market by 2022.  And even though Amazon  doesn't disclose sales numbers investors are bullish on this sleeper hit.  </p><p>ALEXA:  Alexa, alarm off.  </p><p>BRIAN BLAIR, CO-FOUNDER, GRAYS PEAK CAPITAL:  What's interesting about this  product is that Apple doesn't have one of these yet.  There's rumor that  Google is going to actually introduce theirs in the next month or so, and  Apple may end up doing something like this.  but this is the truly first  smart home hub that we have seen that people are using, and it's getting  great reviews and it really just makes sense.  </p><p>BURKE:  What's unique about the Echo is you don't have to be nearby to hear  you.  You can be in another part of the house, or on the other side of the  room and it will still pick up your voice.  </p><p>Alexa?  Who won the Warriors game last night?  </p><p>ALEXA:  Last night the Warriors beat the Trail Blazers 125-121.  </p><p>BLAIR:  It's making the home and the family more acquainted with everything  that Amazon offers and so that's where the opportunity is.  </p><p>BURKE:  Alexa, I want to hear some Coldplay songs.  </p><p>ALEXA:  Shuffling Coldplay from Prime Music.  </p><p>BURKE:  Just like Amazon's other hardware products, they're always trying  to entice you to pay for Prime.  </p><p>Alexa, turn the volume up.  </p><p>Placing an internet connected microphone in the middle of your house may  leave some with privacy concerns.  Amazon says echo will only start  listening once you say, \"Alexa\" and the light indicates this it's all ears.  </p><p>Though a curious reporter with \"Gizmodo\" asked the FBI if it had ever  wiretapped with the Echo.  The FBI would neither confirm or deny that to  \"Gizmodo.\"  Amazon told CNN it doesn't comment on speculation.  And instead  of apps, Amazon says the Echo has skills.  Over 1,000 of them.  And  services from companies like Uber, smart home devices and news updates from  CNN.  </p><p>Alexa?  Who is CNN's Samuel Burke?  </p><p>ALEXA:  Sorry.  I can't find the answer to the question I heard.  </p><p>BURKE:  Clearly artificial intelligence still has a way to go.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWMAN:  Oh, you describe that as artificial intelligence too.  Now,  Samuel, you know that I'm a gadget phoebe and I'm holding a little speaker.   I know.  Look, look.  I'm the skeptic here.  You know that I'm always going  to say Amazon is not at great at hardware like this.  Why would this be any  different?  </p><p>BURKE:  They've had a hit with the Kindle.  Then a huge flop with the  Amazon Fire phone.  And usually when I report on the internet of things,  Paula, internet connected devices, a lot of times I just find that they're  useless.  But this is actually useful and it actually started to make sense  to me, a lot of other smart devices I reported on.  For instance, the smart  lightbulbs and never thought what will I do with a smart lightbulb?  Why  connect to the phone?  </p><p>[16:25:00] But now that I connected lightbulbs to the Alexa and I can just  walk in the room and say, \"Turn on the lights,\" as you just saw.  It really  started to make me realize why the market has that huge trillion-dollar  evaluation.  A lot of other stuff starts to makes sense and this product  really has a lot of room to grow in I think.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  Well, let's see what it actually does, because we're going to come  right back here in a few years, Samuel, and we'll see if this gadget  actually made it into people's homes.  </p><p>BURKE:  It going to have our jobs, Paula.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  If it tells me where my son's homework is, Alexa can have the job.   OK.</p><p>BURKE:  She'll do the homework for you.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  That's a good point too.  Well, we'll get into that another day,  Samuel.  Appreciate it as always.  Thanks, Samuel Burke.  </p><p>As fuel prices rebound, Delta says airfares may increase, surprise,  surprise.  We'll be back with more.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:30:00] PAULA NEWTON, CNN ANCHOR:  Hello, I'm Paula Newton.  Coming up  in the next half hour of QUEST MEANS BUSINESS, the chief executive of HP  shows me the company's brand new 3-D printer and I'll ask Royal Caribbean  about the world's largest cruise ship as it finally goes the sea.  Before  that, though, these are the top news headlines we're following this hour.  </p><p>At least 46 people have been killed in 3 attacks across Baghdad on Tuesday.   ISIS is claiming responsibility for a car bombing that killed 24 people in  the area known as Sadr City.  Follows a series of ISIS attacks in the Iraqi  capital just last week.  </p><p>The U.S. and Russia are promising to strengthen the fragile truce in Syria.   But talks in Vienna didn't do much to revitalize that peace process.  World  leaders failed to agree on a schedule of further talks.  U.S. Secretary of  State John Kerry suggested finding a way forward would be a challenge.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN KERRY, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE:  A variety of competing interests are  going to have to be reconciled and those involved in this conflict with  competing agendas are going to have to be willing to prioritize peace.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWMAN:  Some disturbing video of Kenya.  The country's chief of police  says he wants an investigation after officers were shown beating and  kicking a man after he fell to the ground.  It happened on Monday during a  protest in Nairobi.  Police had moved into the area to disperse a group of  protesters.  </p><p>Thousands of oil workers have been evacuated from northern Alberta in  Canada as huge wildfires move closer to oil sands installations there.  The  fires are likely to affect oil production in the region.  The premier of  Alberta praised the oil companies for getting their work earls to safety.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RACHEL NOTLEY, ALBERTA PREMIER:  At this point the fire's not moving north.   It is moving towards the east so we're told that it's not a significant  concern, but that being said, as we saw with the original evacuation the  oil and gas industry was remarkable in terms of their ability to air lift  15,000 residents of Fort McMurray out of their camps through air.  And so  they assure us that they're more than able to evacuate the remaining  roughly 6,000 folks who are on very temporary basis moved further north.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWMAN:  Hillary Clinton is trying to close the door on Bernie Sanders and  bring the Democrats primary contest to a close.  Now, voters in Kentucky  and Oregon are at the polls today as we speak.  Clinton is making a push to  try and hold Sanders momentum after he won a string of late-season  victories.  According to CNN estimates, even if Sanders wins all the  remaining pledge delegates it wouldn't be enough to stop Clinton from  becoming the Democratic nominee.  Still his campaign hasn't shown signs of  getting out of the race and conceding to Clinton.  </p><p>Now in this rule busting 2016 race for the White House the Democrats are  finding support in some unlikely places.  </p><p>Joining me now is Christie Todd-Whitman, the former Republican Governor of  New Jersey.  I said Republican Governor of New Jersey.  And she says she'll  vote for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump.  And Governor, you know, many  people will think that you are traitor to the Republican Party for even  thinking of it.  </p><p>CHRISTIE TODD WHITMAN, FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY:  Well, I've said I  could consider it.  I didn't say I would.  I got to wait and see what  happens.  But I have said very repeatedly I will not vote for Donald Trump.   There is a time to put your country ahead of your party.  And I believe  this is one of those times.  But I always can exercise my option to write  in and I'd write in John Kasich.  Because I think we had an opportunity to  nominate someone who is extremely able, experienced and capable of carrying  on in a way that would be representative of what this country stands for.   I do not see that Donald Trump can do that.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  But in terms of going against the will of your party, the  democratic will of your party.  They voted in these primaries.  They want  Donald Trump.  Is there a way to get behind him?  And what's the danger of  the Republican Party getting behind him?  </p><p>TODD:  Well, first of all, before Indiana, almost 60 percent of those who  voted in the Republican primary voted for someone other than Donald Trump.   And as we have seen for many of it, several of those who voted in the  Republican primary have never been Republicans before now and that could be  good.  You say bringing new people in.  How long they stay Republicans, are  their beliefs in concert with the Republican party?  I don't know.  It  wouldn't seem so because Donald Trump is a Democrat before he became a  Republican and if you listen to him I'm not sure where he is.  </p><p>I think we are going to see -- while I believe that the Democrat convention  will a whole lot more interesting than the Republican convention, I don't  see Sanders people going down easily with the number of delegates he's  gotten.  They're still going to have a contested convention, I think, even  though everyone thought it was going to be the Republicans.</p><p>But I think they'll be a real rethink of the Republican Party after this  primary.  What is it?  Where are its core values?  Is it something that was  going to -- we're going to see a third party come up.  Because right now  there's a populous movement going in the country and that's the appeal of  both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.  </p><p>They're appealing to the same basic people and elements.  People who say  the current system hasn't served us.  We're working twice as hard to stay  in the same place.  We don't feel safe.  We don't feel secure.  We don't  think anyone in Washington is listening.  And we don't want anything to do  with anybody with anything to do with the system as it is.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  But aren't they right about that?  In the sense that many people  are looking for a shake-up in Washington, and they're saying Donald Trump  is the person to shake Washington.  </p><p>TODD:  Well, Donald Trump would certainly shake Washington.  My fear is  he'll also shake the world and in a dangerous way.  I don't see him as  being someone who understands foreign policy when he takes after the  British Prime Minister and the Mayor of London, and says, well, I have a  long memory and I'll remember what they said and we may not have good  relations.  </p><p>Those are our allies.  And right now the world needs us to be a very stable  and secure entity.  And with Donald Trump, he's saying I want to keep  everybody on edge so they don't know what we'll do next.  That's not the  way ensure safety in the world.  </p><p>He called for taking out the families of ISIS followers.  He's called for  banning all Muslins.  Those are two things that are disruptive to trying to  ensure safety and security on our shores.  </p><p>And as far as some of his domestic policies go, I don't know where he is.   He's already changed his position on taxes.  Obviously, as someone who  cares deeply about the health of the environment and of human health, his  stand on things like the environment are totally counterproductive.  And in  could potentially roll back years of success that we have had while we have  seen our economy grow.  </p><p>[16:35:00] I just don't see -- there's no there either when you look at the  business record he claims is so great.  When you start to really dissect  it, there are a lot of failed businesses there, there are a lot of  bankruptcies.  He's taken businesses through.  He hasn't personally gone  through bankruptcy, but he's taken businesses through bankruptcy and got  his own money out and left other people stranded.  There's a lot of  question that makes me very uncomfortable.  He's a bully.  And he demeans  people and divides people and not healthy.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  Well, governor, thank you for coming in.  We'll continue to take a  measure of that unease with you and others in the Republican Party,  appreciate it.  </p><p>TODD:  All right.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  Delta airlines says it wants to raise ticket prices as fuel costs  climb.  I know, already.  The world's largest airline in terms of  passengers carried says it will pull back on expansion plans.  </p><p>Now, the price of crude is still way down from where it was just two years  ago, but it has been rebounding.  Fuel is the second largest expense for  airlines after staff wages.</p><p>Qatar Airways announced it's moving into Delta's turf with direct services  from DOHA to Atlanta due to start June 1st.  </p><p>And another bit of news today, there's also increasing the stake in IAG,  the parent company of British airways and Iberia.  Qatar Airways, CEO,  Akbar Al Baker, joins me now live from London.  We appreciate your time,  sir.  In terms -- oh, pardon me, you are in Atlanta.  Obviously, because  you are launching that service from Atlanta to DOHA.  We know you are  excited to do that.  In terms of you being able to capitalize this, is this  really what open skies you think will mean to you in terms of being a  player in that American market?  </p><p>AKBAR AL BAKER, CEO, QATAR AIRWAYS:  Exactly.  This is why the Americans  invented the open sky.  It is to allow airlines to operate freely between  countries and this is exactly what we are doing.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  In terms of what I was discussing with the oil prices, how much do  you concern you as an airline especially as you embark on expansion?  </p><p>AL BAKER:  As you mentioned that oil is actually the biggest single  expenditure item in our industry, we have been hedged adequately to protect  us from the oil price rising beyond certain limit.  And at the same time we  are trying to bring fuel efficient airplanes and making sure that our  pilots fly in a very robust way, so that we conserve fuel as much as we can  and make our airline very efficient.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  In terms of trying to take advantage of that open skies agreement,  what other American cities are you actively looking at right now?  </p><p>AL BAKER:  We are looking at some more American cities but unfortunately I  will not be able to give in to that question.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  OK.  Moving on then to another question, a lot of people's mind.   I mean, are you concerned about some of the blow back you may suffer in the  United States?  I know Delta isn't happy about it, but there's political  things, as well.  I know that in The Airline Association, the flight  attendants are protesting a party that you're having with Jennifer Lopez  today.  They urged Jennifer Lopez to boycott.  </p><p>And then also we had Donald Trump saying that someone like you before you  can sit there in Atlanta would need special dispensation to enter the  United States.  How much does that kind of blowback concern you in terms of  your strategic case to be made in the United States?  </p><p>AL BAKER:  Let me first answer your first question.  I think that people  have been misled and their thinking is misplaced.  The things with which  they're accusing the airline is unfounded and actually it is far from the  truth.  So I really don't want to dwell too much upon these ill-founded  demonstrators.  </p><p>As far as Donald Trump is concerned, I think that he's a businessman.  And  he will oblige with all the agreements that the United States government  has signed, especially with -- when it comes to fair competition and at the  same time allowing business to flow in and out of United States freely.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  It's interesting that you say that.  You don't think Trump  presidency will hinder you being able to take advantage of that open skies  agreement?  </p><p>AL BAKER:  Any president that is elected will always look at the interest  of the American people.  Maybe due to electioneering they are making the  false promises.  But at the end of the day everybody has to look what is  better for America.  And what is better for America is free flow of trade  and goods and services.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  OK, Mr., Al Barker, we appreciate your time there for us live from  Atlanta.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>AL BAKER:  Thank you.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  Now, Russia is one of the countries that's been hit hardest by the  fall in oil prices.  The ruble plummeted versus the dollar since the  beginning of 2014.  You can take a look at that dramatic graph.  Sanctions  are still taking a toll, as well.  But according to the Russian finance  ministry, there are signs the economic slump is beginning to ease.  Now,  the country's second largest bank, VTB, announced it turned a profit in the  first quarter.  Though it was still worse than analysts expected.  I asked  the CEO if he felt the economy was doing better.  </p><p>[16:40:00] (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDREY KOSTIN, CEO, VTB:  Yes.  I think that's the general opinion of the  expert that is the worst behind us and recently I spoke to the ministry of  economy.  He shared the view of the minister of finance.  And the  expectation even that as a result this year we'll have a positive economic  growth.  Maybe very, very little but small, but still not a negative like  we had last year.  </p><p>So definitely things are improving.  Inflation is under control.  We  probably have only half of the inflation level, which we had last year.  So  it looks like the economy's picking up.  And oil prices are a little bit  stabilizing.  So it's also good news for our economy.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  In terms of the sanctions and the way it would affect your bank,  though, I mean, obviously, you would want them lifted.  But is it  absolutely necessary in order for Russia and your bank in particular to  return to recovery point?  </p><p>KOSTIN:  You see, we somehow adjust our activity in line with the  sanctions.  And, of course, the worst influence for us that's the problem  of getting new capital.  Because, you know, VTB on course for privatization  and definitely with this kind of market there's not much opportunity for  privatization or at least that's pretty much low privatization for VTB.   But as far as liquidity is concerned, I think we feel quite comfortable.   There's enough equity inside Russia, so we're doing our business just as  normal.  </p><p>So basically, definitely would like -- we would like sanctions to be  lifted.  It will pave the way for our further growth, further expansion.   But at the moment, we somehow got used to the sanctions.  And don't feel  too much burden on this.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  And yet, when you look at oil prices rising, do you think that  will help mitigate the impact of the sanctions even if they replace in  months or more than a year?  </p><p>Well, that's for sure.  I mean, most of the experts arguing that the worst  effect we had on lower oil prices rather than sanctions, but I think both  are not good, I mean, low oil prices and sanctions.  But oil prices are  vital for Russia, at least at this stage of Russian development of our  economy.  We don't have still restructured economy and our economy still  very much depends on oil and, of course, other natural resources, raw  materials.  It's also very important.  All commodity prices are quite --</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWMAN:  In the 1980s, HP revolutionized printing with its DeskJet.  Now it  wants to do the same with 3-D printing.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>NEWMAN:  Now, imagine a printer that could print copies of itself.  HP has  revealed its first commercial 3-D printers, and says they will reinvent  manufacturing.  Still, it may be a while before you have one of these  things.  Prices will start at $130,000 when they go on sale later this  year.</p><p>[16:45:00] Deon Weisler, is the president and CEO of HP, and he joins me  now live from Palo Alto, California.  Thanks for being with us.  I mean,  what's been written up about this thing is tremendous.  It could be the  most disruptive event in manufacturing since we first heard of 3-D  printing, that's just one from engineering publication.  The expectations  are so high.  Please tell me how you expect to meet them.  </p><p>DEON WEISLER, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, HP:  Well, great.  And first of all, thank  you for having me.  Great to be here.  It's been a really exciting day for  us here at HP.  We're all about reinvention.  And today as you quite  rightly said, this is about reinventing manufacturing.  About changing and  democratizing manufacturing and bring it much closer to where customers buy  and service their products.  And we've done that through the release of  these two new products that is hit the market that have targeted the  commercial space.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  When you say, what this is going to do, though.  Can you give us a  real-life example when you want to try to employ this, trying to sell this?   How will it revolutionize manufacturing?  </p><p>WEISLER:  Well, you opened in a way that said, you know, printers that  print themselves.  And indeed, our printers, 50 percent of the parts inside  the printer are actually printed by the printer.  This is an example of one  of those parts.  You can see it's a fully flexible part.  Traditionally,  that would have to be manufactured in a very faraway place.  You have to  build inventory.  Put it on supply lanes chains.  And ship it all over the  world.  This can now be printed where wherever you're building the device.   And that enables you to have breakthrough economics.  That just isn't  possible through traditional manufacturing methods.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  Now as you were saying, these are commercial printers.  I mean, at  this point, who do you picture the first customers to be?  </p><p>WEISLER:  Well, today, we also announced some great partnerships with Nike,  with Siemens, with Johnson &amp; Johnson, with BMW.  These are all visionary  companies that understand the value of innovation and how they can leverage  3-D printing to disrupt the markets they're in to deliver excellence in  products for customers.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  In terms of when you look at entrepreneurs, and I have several  family members myself.  They run small manufacturing outlets.  This is  $130,000.  Do you think for the smaller start-ups that there will be  purpose to spending that $130,000 on that HP 3-D printer?  </p><p>WEISLER:  Well, we thought about that.  And if you're going to truly  democratize manufacturing you have to make the technology available to  everybody.  And so one of the key launch partners today is a company of  Shapeways.  And not familiar shape ways go to shapeways.com.  And what  you're able to do there is surf their broad library of 3-D designed  products or design your own.  And then send that off to a 3-D printer.   Now, in the background, many of the parts will be printed on HP 3-D  printing devices, and then they'll be shipped to you the next day.  So  those particular small businesses can indeed participate in this  democratized world a manufacturing.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  Yes.  I mean, and it really is mind bending.  I have to ask you.   HP has been through a tumultuous time in the last few years, and I think  some people may look to this invention and see some skepticism.  We were  going through org chart just to figure out what's going on with your  company.  I mean, what gives you the confidence to be telling us that,  look, this will revolutionize manufacturing?  But also, this will reinvent  HP yet again.  </p><p>WEISLER:  Well, I think we have a long history of invention.  That's what  is at the very DNA of this organization.  Whether it be Hewlett-Packard  enterprise or HP Ink, we separated these companies to enable to fuel our  innovation engines to able to drive faster.  </p><p>We changed the way offices worked when we released the DeskJet and the  LaserJet printers and we're leveraging more than 30 years of intellectual  property from our core, and bringing it across into this new world of 3-D  printing.  So when it has that HP logo on it only a company like HP can be  as disruptive in changing the way manufacturing works.  </p><p>All right.  We'll see if we can hold you to that in the months and years to  come.  Mr. Weisler, thanks so much for your time.  Appreciate it.  </p><p>WEISLER:  Great to be here.  Thanks for having me.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  Now, it has 20 restaurants, 16 decks and crew of more than 2,000.   We'll show you the world's largest cruise ship.  That's after the break.   But first, a highlight from \"MAKE, CREATE, INNOVATE.\"</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>[16:51:49] NEWMAN:  The world's largest cruise ship reached the English  Port of Southampton on Tuesday after the maiden voyage.  Harmony of the  Seas is 25th ship in the Royal Caribbean's fleet.  It's 362 meters in  length.  Stay with me here.  That's longer than the Eiffel Tower laying on  its side.  It was built using 500,000 individual parts.  The ship boasts 23  swimming pools.  And a 10-story water slide and already makes me dizzy  thinking about it.  I asked, Michael Bayler, the CEO of Royal Caribbean  International, why the world needs a ship like this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHAEL BAYLER, CEO, ROYAL CARIBBEAN INTERNATIONAL:  Well, why do you need  the ultimate family vacation?  That's exactly what Harmony of the Seas is.   It's just packed with the most amazing entertainment, adventures,  innovations.  It truly is the ultimate vacation.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  Now, I know that you're really giving it a good sell job.  I'm not  sure you really need to sell that ship to people that like cruising.  But  if you can just describe in it a sense.  When you saw this on, you know,  the drawing board as it were, and now have seen it, in the flesh being  launched, I mean, what is it like?  </p><p>BAYLER:  It's truly amazing.  I mean, I think for all of us at Royal  Caribbean it's literally like having a baby, a new child.  We've spent a  lot of time planning and thinking about this.  We have put a lot of  expertise and energy into designing it.  And I think for all of us, the  fact that now this ship has become a reality is genuinely exciting for all  of us and certainly for our customers.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  A billion-dollar investment as far as we can understand.  How are  you going to be able to make it back with this ship?  </p><p>BAYLER:  Actually, it is closer to $1.5 billion investment.  And we -- this  ship is the kind of a cross between our quantum class and oasis class ship.   It is really the next generation.  And if you look at our forward bookings  for that ship, for this summer, we're feeling pretty confident about paying  back that investment.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  OK.  But it must take away from the other ships that maybe aren't  getting the love that they're used to getting.  </p><p>BAYLER:  No, our ships are getting the love all around the world.  They  think what's great about Royal Caribbean, we have obviously been in the  business for a long time.  We deliver a great vacation.  And I think we see  the demand growing across many markets around the world for our company.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  You know, I have to ask you.  With cruising and I know you heard  it a million times, a love/hate relationship.  And for the people who don't  understand why anybody goes on a cruise.  You know, you have the issues  with illnesses that break out.  I mean, Royal Caribbean had the incident  with the rough seas a few months ago.  What can you tell us going forward  in terms of really trying to look at some of those issues?  Because those  become huge headaches for the governments involved, not just for your  company.  </p><p>BAYLER:  Yes, I think, obviously, things do happen.  Things occur.  I think  statistically when you look at the number of incidents it's relatively  small.  We spend a lot of time and energy minimizing and trying to  eliminate any of those types of situations.  </p><p>[16:55:00] This year we'll carry close to 4.4 million people on cruises  with Royal Caribbean.  And literally the number of events this happen is  almost zero.  </p><p>NEWMAN:  Well, it's not almost zero though for the people who go through  it.  What do you have for people that have an apprehension?  And as I said,  a lot of people that are just angry that, you know, whether these ships  come into port and just the headaches this they cause whether from health  perspective or safety perspective?  </p><p>BAYLER:  Yes, I think that's a negative perspective on it.  I mean, when  our ships come into port, they bring a lot of happy vacationers.  There's a  considerable economic positive economic impact in the port that is we call  in to.  I think the relationships that we have with these ports and  destinations is very, very positive.  So I think that, you know, you can  look at it from a negative or a positive perspective.  We think it's a very  positive experience.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWMAN:  All right.  Swipe right to stay in the EU.  Swipe left to leave.   What am I talking about?  We will tell you.

Users of the dating app Tinder might see ads, disguised as dating profiles,  encouraging them to come out and vote in the referendum next month.  This  isn't Tinder's first date with politics, unfortunately.  It launched a  feature called Swipe the Vote, back in March.

Some hate it. This is the volatility that the market has been known for the last several months. U.S. indices are down sharply as trading comes to a close on Wall Street. Look at the red. It's been like that most of the day and gathering speed. It is Tuesday, May 17th. <person><nameText>Mark Cuban </nameText></person>warns there's been red ahead for stocks if <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>takes the White House. We'll get the traders' view. World's largest airline says rising oil prices means it's time to hike fares. And swipe right to stay in the EU. <person><nameText>David Cameron </nameText></person>joins Tinder. I'm Paula Newton and this is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Stocks have plunged on Wall Street as the market prepares for a rate rise that could come much sooner than expected. The DOW, NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 each closed off about one percent. As you can see there, the DOW slightly off its lows of the day but still looking quite poorly. It's the third session in a row that we have seen triple digit swings for the DOW and it comes after a double whammy of news suggesting the Federal Reserve may be gearing up to raise interest rates.</p><p>First strong inflation data here in the United States and then comments from the head of the Atlanta Fed saying next month's meeting should be considered in his words live. Paul La Monica joins me live. You know Paul, this market has been searching for some other paradigm. Just a few days ago we heard people saying, \"Eh, you know, the Fed. We don't have to worry about the Fed anymore. We've already put in a rate hike towards the end of the year and now today this.\" I mean, is there a new paradigm emerging or is it just back to the same old thing? Fed's rise rates. Stocks go down.</p><p>PAUL R. LA MONICA, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT: Yes. I think it's the same old thing, Paula. We still have the absence of a lot of major economic or earnings news this week. So I think investors may be grasps for straws trying to analyze every single word of the Fed members. A Fed meeting, I think always live no matter what they say, because it's always data dependent some point. My best guess is end of the year. And maybe the new president has, you know, an unwelcomed present of a Fed rate hike right around November or December after the election.</p><p>NEWMAN: Yes. In terms of when you look at the fundamentals of this market, though, if we go through the earnings season here, was there a lot to worry investors in there?</p><p>LA MONICA: I think that, you know, those who want to worry can find things to worry about. But, you know, we did have, you know, some concerning reports from a lot of retailers, which does potentially raise questions about the health of the U.S. consumer but outside of that you did have some better results from some big tech companies, so it is a mixed bag. I think the absence of any definitive trend is what is most concerning. It is still very difficult to figure out if this economy is going to pick up steam or not. It doesn't appear as if we're going to have an answer to that until later in the year.</p><p>NEWMAN: Yes, and the big spoiler could also be oil. We'll talk about it a little bit later. Oil up again today. If we really see huge volatility in that market on the upside, do you think there's more collateral damage to the market?</p><p>LA MONICA: I think so because you will have more people worried about what that does to things like auto sales and retail sales more broadly. The American consumer wasn't really out there spending like gang busters when gas prices were really cheap. It is hard to imagine how they do that if prices will start to rise more steadily.</p><p>NEWMAN: OK, Paul. We'll continue to check in with you. It's going to be a wild ride, we think, until November. We are going to actually be, Paul, going into a lot of the election scenarios. If you had to talk about it now, how much more is that election sentiment creeping into market sentiment, where they're looking at Trump and likely Hillary coming head to head and saying, lock, there are no dramatic moves here until we know the president we're dealing with?</p><p>LA MONICA: I think to a certain extent that is the case. I still believe that the market is expecting that <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>will prevail. Whether or not that happens, obviously, we have six months before the general election. But I think, you know, you can't also ignore what's going to happen with the big congressional races, as well. I think the power of the president, while clearly important, is somewhat muted depending on what happens with the congressional landscape, as well. I think investors for the most part probably expecting more gridlock.</p><p>NEWMAN: So much to look forward, Paul.</p><p>LA MONICA: Exactly.</p><p>NEWMAN: Thanks so much. Appreciate it.</p><p>[16:05:00] Now, this volatility comes as two U.S. states go to the polls. Now, a billionaire businessman made famous by reality TV -- sounds familiar doesn't it -- is warning American voters don't elect a billionaire businessman made famously reality TV. The internet entrepreneur, <person><nameText>Mark Cuban, </nameText></person>says \"If <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>becomes president the stock market could tank.\" Cuban is a host on the show \"Shark Tank.\" and the owner of the Dallas Mavericks of the NBA. He told CNN, \"Trump's unpredictability and lack of detailed policies would cause chaos.\"</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>MARK CUBAN, </nameText></person>OWNER DALLAS MAVERICKS: That uncertainty, you know, potentially as the president of the United States, that's the last thing Wall Street wants to hear. And I can say with 100 percent certainty that there's a really good chance we could see a huge, huge correction. It could be 20 percent. You know? Now with high frequency trading accelerating, you know, strong moves in any direction, it could be worse than that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWMAN: Theodore Weisberg, founder and president of Seaport Securities at the New York Stock Exchange, so how about it? Is Mr. Cuban right?</p><p>THEODORE P WEISBERG, FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, SEAPORT SECURITIES: Well, I don't know if he's a lot smarter than me and certainly he's a lot richer. But I don't know that he's right because I'm not sure that with all his money and experience that he has crystal ball. I'd be reluctant to make that prediction. I would say this. I think that a change in Washington is actually going to be a plus for the stock market no matter who gets elected because I think the public wants a change.</p><p>And I mean, if you want do get into the weeds a little bit, I think one of the first things we're going to see happen, no matter whose president, is that Federal Reserve monetary policy just isn't doing it for this economy. And zero interest rates don't seem to work and I think the prospect of perhaps a tax cut, corporate tax cut, and repatriation of all those offshore trillions of dollars, because of some tax holiday, is probably in the cards no matter who's going to be president. So obviously, I don't agree with him. I have -- I'm reluctant to make any predictions. But I think the change is actually going to be positive for the market no matter who it is.</p><p>NEWMAN: You know, that's an interesting perspective because you know it's an odd one. Most people say, look, it does matter who's in there. You're talking about employing more fiscal policy than monetary policy. Do you think that's something that the market wants? That the market will respond to that? Because you know what? When it comes to those trade deals it can go in a completely different direction.</p><p>WEISBERG: I -- can you repeat the question?</p><p>NEWMAN: I'm saying if we get into the weeds, fiscal verse monetary policy, the market better, you know, be careful what you wish for, right? Because a lot of that may deal with problems, even in the trade agreement that is we now know, and Mr. Trump is very vocal about it. And perhaps <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>may be a little bit more vocal about that.</p><p>WEISBERG: Well, listen. We can't predict what the changes will be no matter who's elected. All I'm suggesting is that I think a new administration in Washington, no matter whose elected, is actually going to be a plus for the market because the U.S. economy by all definitions, you know, has been walking in the soft sand for eight years. And a Fed monetary policy of zero interest rates, clearly, I guess, you know, has worked a little, really hasn't has didn't the results that folks wanted.</p><p>Yes, we have a better stock market and the unemployment rate improved, but you still have all kinds of variations of that theme. But the U.S. economy continues to be sluggish and the world's economy too sluggish. So I think monetary policy has done just about all it can do. Now we need some real change and I think one of those possible changes is a corporate tax cut to really, you know, get some juice into the economy and to get all of these offshore dollars back into the U.S. now, that doesn't help the rest of the world, but certainly could help the U.S. and that would be good for the market.</p><p>NEWMAN: OK. Excellent, Ted. Thank you. And thank you for getting into the weeds. We like the weeds here on QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. It's a good place to be in the next five months. Appreciate it.</p><p>WEISBERG: OK.</p><p>NEWMAN: European stocks, meantime, closed mostly lower Tuesday. Greek bank stocks rallied while auto stocks slumped. And in the meantime, the British Prime Minister spelled out what he calls the horrors, that's as he sees them, of Britain leaving the European Union. Now with the referendum a few weeks away, <person><nameText>David Cameron </nameText></person>said the Brexit is the result that would probably please Vladimir Putin and even the leader of ISIS. Earlier today he was warning business leaders about the economic uncertainty it would bring.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DAVID CAMERON, </nameText></person>BRITISH PRIME MINISTER: I think when very respected organizations are saying as clearly as they are that output would be lower, growth would be less, unemployment would be higher, prices would be higher, we would see a hit to living standards, that there is a very clear consensus that leaving the EU would have not just a short-term effect on confidence and investment and growth, but actually would have a longer term effect, as well.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWMAN: Now, for what it's worth, a new opinion poll published in the \"Telegraph\" newspaper, says the remain campaign is gaining ground.</p><p>[16:10:00] Fifty-five percent of people saying they want to stay in the EU and 40 percent in favor of the so-called Brexit. Now sovereignty and the power to make laws are central to the Brexit debate. CNN London's Correspondent, Max Foster, gains now what we see a rare access to Britain's parliamentary archives and the one act which first tied it to the European Union.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MAX FOSTER, CNN LONDON CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Often described as the most important room in Britain, the Acts Room. High up in the houses of parliament it's home to 64,000 documents covering some of the most important moments in British history.</p><p>(on camera): On these shelves are stacked truly ancient documents. Here we have some that are 500 years old. During the reign of Henry VII no less. Here we have the Weights and Measures Act of 1497.</p><p>(voice-over): But who currently creates new laws is at the center of the referendum over Britain's membership of the EU.</p><p>JOHN REDWOOD, CONSERVATIVE MEMBER OF BRITISH PARLIAMENT: How much we raise in tax, what taxes we impose and how we spend that tax is no longer under the control of the British parliament. In many respects under the control of the European union.</p><p>FOSTER (voice-over): Whilst others see giving up on aspects of control is part of a globalized world.</p><p>VICKY PRYCE, ECONOMIST: We have decided to do things in a certain way so far, which gives up some of the sovereignty, pulls sovereignty for particular reason, which are good for us and Europe as a whole.</p><p>FOSTER (voice-over): Remain campaigners are keen to cite that between 1993 and 2014, only 13 percent of British laws, such as the working time directive, came from the European Union. However, if you add up all of the EU regulations, including the ones that don't need to go through Parliament, like mobile phone roaming charges, those championing a Brexit argue that 62 percent of British laws have EU origins. But only one law was needed to make this possible.</p><p>(on camera): Well, here it is. This is the European Communities act of 1972. And this is the piece of legislation that signed the UK up to what was the European Economic Community and which we now know as the European Union and this really paved the way for all of those regulations and requirements that now apply in this country.</p><p>(voice-over): The UK does have an influence on those regulations. Equally so do the 27 other member states, which means Britain doesn't always get what it wants. If the country went it alone it could set its own laws but if it wanted to be part of the single market, it would have to adhere to EU rules with no say on how they're set. Sovereignty becomes a tradeoff between power and influence. These scrolls bear witness to changes in power and attitudes over hundreds of years but who has precedence over the laws in the future will be decided by the British people.

He wrapped up a trip to China and the company faced one of the worst ever financial quarters. While Apple is facing a slowdown in China, sales soared last quarter in India even though Apple hasn't got any stores there yet. CNN's new Delhi Bureau Chief, Ravi Agrawal, explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RAVI AGRAWAL, CNN NEW DELHI BUREAU CHIEF: Tim Cook has been to China eight times since he became Apple's CEO in 2011, but he hasn't visited India even once until now. India represents a major growth spot for Apple.</p><p>In the last quarter Apple recorded its first decline in global sales in 13 years. India was a rare bright spot with sales up 56 percent. One reason is that India has a fast growing smartphone market. In 2010, only 100 million Indians were on the internet. In 2015, that number jumped to 300 million. Most of that growth is coming from Indians who are discovering the internet not on pcs or Macs, but on smartphones, and there is still a lot of room to grow.</p><p>The world bank points out a billion Indians remain offline. That's why <person><nameText>Apple CEO </nameText></person>Tim Cook is bullish on India. But it's not all smooth sailing. Earlier this year, Apple sought government permission to sell refurbished iPhones to appeal to a broader section of the Indian market that permission denied.</p><p>There is also the fact that while Apple has 32 of the flagship Apple stores in China, it has a grand total of zero in India. And that's because the tech giant has struggled to comply with regulations to source a certain percentage of each phone's components locally. Lots for Tim Cook to mull while he's in India.</p><p>Among the people he's expected to meet are India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Modi has courted the support of top American CEOs as he tries to bring jobs and foreign investment to India. This is one meeting that any tech watcher would love to be a fly on the wall for. Ravi Agrawal, CNN, New Delhi.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWMAN: Now, China's tech scene still has a long way to catch up to the likes of Apple, but a new generation of entrepreneurs is looking to change that. Now as part of \"CHINA'S TECH REVOLUTION,\" Matt Rivers visited a state sponsored hub for company start-ups.</p><p>MATT RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Playing the guitar is cool. And yet, Zhang Bohan calls himself a geek because he developed the app that helped teach him to play. The app is called \"Poputar.\"</p><p>The app is called \"Poputar\", think popular guitar. A series of lessons on your phone shows you what to play. The guitar that comes with it connects to the app and lights up spots where you're supposed to put your fingers. And voila, you're Jimi Hendrix.</p><p>We met up with Zhang and his partner Zhao Yan in a cafE up the street from the office. Along with another partner, the trio hatched their plan back in 2014 around these tables.</p><p>He says this is where people with an idea, but no money, connected friends, or resources meet up. The garage cafe, where the next big idea is just one espresso away, is an incubator where people rent small space to help launch their tech companies. It's one of forty or so on this street alone, called \"Innoway\", a 200-meter stretch in northwest Beijing. More than 300 start- ups call this area home.</p><p>The Chinese economy is undergoing a broad transition, moving away from manufacturing and relying more now on services. In 2013, the Chinese government invested 36 million us dollars into this street, where startups dominate instead of, and say, steel. It's a sign that times are changing.</p><p>Liu Wei is at the forefront of that change. He runs legend star, a company that specializes in seed investment, the first round of fundraising. In other words, he helps start-ups actually start up.</p><p>He says 10 years ago, start-ups weren't big here because the investment community was very conservative. Few companies with the resources to invest in start-ups actually did so. But he says that's swiftly changing as more and more people realize that technology is the key to profits in the digital age.</p><p>He thinks the startup scene here will eventually rival and perhaps surpass the success of Silicon Valley. Back at Poputar, it's an exciting time. The app just went live this week. Zhang says he's nervous but confident. Surprise, surprise, he plays guitar to alleviate stress.</p><p>[16:20:00] (on camera): Teach me how to do this. Let's see if I can learn.</p><p>ZHANG BOHAN, POPUTAR DEVELOPER: Yes, My pleasure.</p><p>A few admittedly terrible notes later, it does get a bit easier. I might not be a star, but Poputar is aiming become one in the ultra-competitive app world part of a growing number of Chinese start-ups hoping to strike a chord with consumers.

Some grow into behemoths and learn about China's tech giants and the Chinese Tech Revolution on CNNmoney.com/Chinatech.</p><p>Now, back here in the United States, Amazon is proving that big tech still has room to grow. Company held an investor meeting today and shareholders had very little to complain about. The stock is up more than 64 percent over the past year. For years, Amazon invested at the expense of profits in cloud computing, in building its own devices and, of course, video streaming. It was all to get consumers into what it called the Amazon ecosystem. Now, the company's latest plans revolve around a little device that could bring that ecosystem into your home. CNN money Samuel Burke has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN MONEY CORRESPONDENT: Alexa, what time is it?</p><p>ALEXA: The time is 1:24.</p><p>BURKE: Alexa, when's the meaning of life?</p><p>ALEXA: The meaning of life depends on the life in question.</p><p>BURKE: Alexa, turn the lights on.</p><p>Apple has Siri. Microsoft with Cortana. Google has Now. Those voice systems live in your phone or tablets. Amazon's Alexa lives in your home.</p><p>She dwells in a series of amazon devices called Echo. Wi-Fi connected speakers with a microphone always listening for you to say the wake word. Alexa -- amazon's making a huge push into two different market trends with this device. Artificial intelligence as well as the internet of things. Projected to be a $14 trillion market by 2022. And even though Amazon doesn't disclose sales numbers investors are bullish on this sleeper hit.</p><p>ALEXA: Alexa, alarm off.</p><p>BRIAN BLAIR, CO-FOUNDER, GRAYS PEAK CAPITAL: What's interesting about this product is that Apple doesn't have one of these yet. There's rumor that Google is going to actually introduce theirs in the next month or so, and Apple may end up doing something like this. but this is the truly first smart home hub that we have seen that people are using, and it's getting great reviews and it really just makes sense.</p><p>BURKE: What's unique about the Echo is you don't have to be nearby to hear you. You can be in another part of the house, or on the other side of the room and it will still pick up your voice.</p><p>Alexa? Who won the Warriors game last night?</p><p>ALEXA: Last night the Warriors beat the Trail Blazers 125-121.</p><p>BLAIR: It's making the home and the family more acquainted with everything that Amazon offers and so that's where the opportunity is.</p><p>BURKE: Alexa, I want to hear some Coldplay songs.</p><p>ALEXA: Shuffling Coldplay from Prime Music.</p><p>BURKE: Just like Amazon's other hardware products, they're always trying to entice you to pay for Prime.</p><p>Alexa, turn the volume up.</p><p>Placing an internet connected microphone in the middle of your house may leave some with privacy concerns. Amazon says echo will only start listening once you say, \"Alexa\" and the light indicates this it's all ears.</p><p>Though a curious reporter with \"Gizmodo\" asked the FBI if it had ever wiretapped with the Echo. The FBI would neither confirm or deny that to \"Gizmodo.\" Amazon told CNN it doesn't comment on speculation. And instead of apps, Amazon says the Echo has skills. Over 1,000 of them. And services from companies like Uber, smart home devices and news updates from CNN.</p><p>Alexa? Who is CNN's Samuel Burke?</p><p>ALEXA: Sorry. I can't find the answer to the question I heard.</p><p>BURKE: Clearly artificial intelligence still has a way to go.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWMAN: Oh, you describe that as artificial intelligence too. Now, Samuel, you know that I'm a gadget phoebe and I'm holding a little speaker. I know. Look, look. I'm the skeptic here. You know that I'm always going to say Amazon is not at great at hardware like this. Why would this be any different?</p><p>BURKE: They've had a hit with the Kindle. Then a huge flop with the Amazon Fire phone. And usually when I report on the internet of things, Paula, internet connected devices, a lot of times I just find that they're useless. But this is actually useful and it actually started to make sense to me, a lot of other smart devices I reported on. For instance, the smart lightbulbs and never thought what will I do with a smart lightbulb? Why connect to the phone?</p><p>[16:25:00] But now that I connected lightbulbs to the Alexa and I can just walk in the room and say, \"Turn on the lights,\" as you just saw. It really started to make me realize why the market has that huge trillion-dollar evaluation. A lot of other stuff starts to makes sense and this product really has a lot of room to grow in I think.</p><p>NEWMAN: Well, let's see what it actually does, because we're going to come right back here in a few years, Samuel, and we'll see if this gadget actually made it into people's homes.</p><p>BURKE: It going to have our jobs, Paula.</p><p>NEWMAN: If it tells me where my son's homework is, Alexa can have the job. OK.</p><p>BURKE: She'll do the homework for you.</p><p>NEWMAN: That's a good point too. Well, we'll get into that another day, Samuel. Appreciate it as always.

Before that, though, these are the top news headlines we're following this hour.</p><p>At least 46 people have been killed in 3 attacks across Baghdad on Tuesday. ISIS is claiming responsibility for a car bombing that killed 24 people in the area known as Sadr City. Follows a series of ISIS attacks in the Iraqi capital just last week.</p><p>The U.S. and Russia are promising to strengthen the fragile truce in Syria. But talks in Vienna didn't do much to revitalize that peace process. World leaders failed to agree on a schedule of further talks. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry suggested finding a way forward would be a challenge.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN KERRY, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: A variety of competing interests are going to have to be reconciled and those involved in this conflict with competing agendas are going to have to be willing to prioritize peace.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWMAN: Some disturbing video of Kenya.

The fires are likely to affect oil production in the region. The premier of Alberta praised the oil companies for getting their work earls to safety.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RACHEL NOTLEY, ALBERTA PREMIER: At this point the fire's not moving north. It is moving towards the east so we're told that it's not a significant concern, but that being said, as we saw with the original evacuation the oil and gas industry was remarkable in terms of their ability to air lift 15,000 residents of Fort McMurray out of their camps through air. And so they assure us that they're more than able to evacuate the remaining roughly 6,000 folks who are on very temporary basis moved further north.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NEWMAN: <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>is trying to close the door on Bernie Sanders and bring the Democrats primary contest to a close. Now, voters in Kentucky and Oregon are at the polls today as we speak. Clinton is making a push to try and hold Sanders momentum after he won a string of late-season victories. According to CNN estimates, even if Sanders wins all the remaining pledge delegates it wouldn't be enough to stop Clinton from becoming the Democratic nominee. Still his campaign hasn't shown signs of getting out of the race and conceding to Clinton.</p><p>Now in this rule busting 2016 race for the White House the Democrats are finding support in some unlikely places.</p><p>Joining me now is Christie Todd-Whitman, the former Republican Governor of New Jersey. I said Republican Governor of New Jersey. And she says she'll vote for <person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>over <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>And Governor, you know, many people will think that you are traitor to the Republican Party for even thinking of it.</p><p>CHRISTIE TODD WHITMAN, FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY: Well, I've said I could consider it. I didn't say I would. I got to wait and see what happens. But I have said very repeatedly I will not vote for <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>There is a time to put your country ahead of your party. And I believe this is one of those times. But I always can exercise my option to write in and I'd write in John Kasich. Because I think we had an opportunity to nominate someone who is extremely able, experienced and capable of carrying on in a way that would be representative of what this country stands for. I do not see that <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>can do that.</p><p>NEWMAN: But in terms of going against the will of your party, the democratic will of your party. They voted in these primaries. They want <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>Is there a way to get behind him? And what's the danger of the Republican Party getting behind him?</p><p>TODD: Well, first of all, before Indiana, almost 60 percent of those who voted in the Republican primary voted for someone other than <person><nameText>Donald Trump. </nameText></person>And as we have seen for many of it, several of those who voted in the Republican primary have never been Republicans before now and that could be good. You say bringing new people in. How long they stay Republicans, are their beliefs in concert with the Republican party? I don't know. It wouldn't seem so because <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is a Democrat before he became a Republican and if you listen to him I'm not sure where he is.</p><p>I think we are going to see -- while I believe that the Democrat convention will a whole lot more interesting than the Republican convention, I don't see Sanders people going down easily with the number of delegates he's gotten. They're still going to have a contested convention, I think, even though everyone thought it was going to be the Republicans.</p><p>But I think they'll be a real rethink of the Republican Party after this primary. What is it? Where are its core values? Is it something that was going to -- we're going to see a third party come up. Because right now there's a populous movement going in the country and that's the appeal of both <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>and Bernie Sanders.</p><p>They're appealing to the same basic people and elements. People who say the current system hasn't served us. We're working twice as hard to stay in the same place. We don't feel safe. We don't feel secure. We don't think anyone in Washington is listening. And we don't want anything to do with anybody with anything to do with the system as it is.</p><p>NEWMAN: But aren't they right about that? In the sense that many people are looking for a shake-up in Washington, and they're saying <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is the person to shake Washington.</p><p>TODD: Well, <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>would certainly shake Washington. My fear is he'll also shake the world and in a dangerous way. I don't see him as being someone who understands foreign policy when he takes after the British Prime Minister and the Mayor of London, and says, well, I have a long memory and I'll remember what they said and we may not have good relations.</p><p>Those are our allies. And right now the world needs us to be a very stable and secure entity. And with <person><nameText>Donald Trump, </nameText></person>he's saying I want to keep everybody on edge so they don't know what we'll do next. That's not the way ensure safety in the world.</p><p>He called for taking out the families of ISIS followers. He's called for banning all Muslins. Those are two things that are disruptive to trying to ensure safety and security on our shores.</p><p>And as far as some of his domestic policies go, I don't know where he is. He's already changed his position on taxes. Obviously, as someone who cares deeply about the health of the environment and of human health, his stand on things like the environment are totally counterproductive. And in could potentially roll back years of success that we have had while we have seen our economy grow.</p><p>[16:35:00] I just don't see -- there's no there either when you look at the business record he claims is so great. When you start to really dissect it, there are a lot of failed businesses there, there are a lot of bankruptcies. He's taken businesses through. He hasn't personally gone through bankruptcy, but he's taken businesses through bankruptcy and got his own money out and left other people stranded. There's a lot of question that makes me very uncomfortable. He's a bully. And he demeans people and divides people and not healthy.</p><p>NEWMAN: Well, governor, thank you for coming in. We'll continue to take a measure of that unease with you and others in the Republican Party, appreciate it.</p><p>TODD: All right.</p><p>NEWMAN: Delta airlines says it wants to raise ticket prices as fuel costs climb. I know, already. The world's largest airline in terms of passengers carried says it will pull back on expansion plans.</p><p>Now, the price of crude is still way down from where it was just two years ago, but it has been rebounding. Fuel is the second largest expense for airlines after staff wages.</p><p>Qatar Airwaysannounced it's moving into Delta's turf with direct services from DOHA to Atlanta due to start June 1st.</p><p>And another bit of news today, there's also increasing the stake in IAG, the parent company of British airways and Iberia. Qatar Airways, CEO, Akbar Al Baker, joins me now live from London. We appreciate your time, sir. In terms -- oh, pardon me, you are in Atlanta. Obviously, because you are launching that service from Atlanta to DOHA. We know you are excited to do that. In terms of you being able to capitalize this, is this really what open skies you think will mean to you in terms of being a player in that American market?</p><p>AKBAR AL BAKER, CEO, QATAR AIRWAYS: Exactly. This is why the Americans invented the open sky. It is to allow airlines to operate freely between countries and this is exactly what we are doing.</p><p>NEWMAN: In terms of what I was discussing with the oil prices, how much do you concern you as an airline especially as you embark on expansion?</p><p>AL BAKER: As you mentioned that oil is actually the biggest single expenditure item in our industry, we have been hedged adequately to protect us from the oil price rising beyond certain limit. And at the same time we are trying to bring fuel efficient airplanes and making sure that our pilots fly in a very robust way, so that we conserve fuel as much as we can and make our airline very efficient.</p><p>NEWMAN: In terms of trying to take advantage of that open skies agreement, what other American cities are you actively looking at right now?</p><p>AL BAKER: We are looking at some more American cities but unfortunately I will not be able to give in to that question.</p><p>NEWMAN: OK. Moving on then to another question, a lot of people's mind. I mean, are you concerned about some of the blow back you may suffer in the United States? I know Delta isn't happy about it, but there's political things, as well. I know that in The Airline Association, the flight attendants are protesting a party that you're having with Jennifer Lopez today. They urged Jennifer Lopez to boycott.</p><p>And then also we had <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>saying that someone like you before you can sit there in Atlanta would need special dispensation to enter the United States. How much does that kind of blowback concern you in terms of your strategic case to be made in the United States?</p><p>AL BAKER: Let me first answer your first question. I think that people have been misled and their thinking is misplaced. The things with which they're accusing the airline is unfounded and actually it is far from the truth. So I really don't want to dwell too much upon these ill-founded demonstrators.</p><p>As far as <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>is concerned, I think that he's a businessman. And he will oblige with all the agreements that the United States government has signed, especially with -- when it comes to fair competition and at the same time allowing business to flow in and out of United States freely.</p><p>NEWMAN: It's interesting that you say that. You don't think Trump presidency will hinder you being able to take advantage of that open skies agreement?</p><p>AL BAKER: Any president that is elected will always look at the interest of the American people. Maybe due to electioneering they are making the false promises. But at the end of the day everybody has to look what is better for America. And what is better for America is free flow of trade and goods and services.</p><p>NEWMAN: OK, Mr., Al Barker, we appreciate your time there for us live from Atlanta. Appreciate it.</p><p>AL BAKER: Thank you.</p><p>NEWMAN: Now, Russia is one of the countries that's been hit hardest by the fall in oil prices. The ruble plummeted versus the dollar since the beginning of 2014. You can take a look at that dramatic graph. Sanctions are still taking a toll, as well. But according to the Russian finance ministry, there are signs the economic slump is beginning to ease. Now, the country's second largest bank, VTB, announced it turned a profit in the first quarter. Though it was still worse than analysts expected. I asked the CEO if he felt the economy was doing better.</p><p>[16:40:00] (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDREY KOSTIN, CEO, VTB: Yes. I think that's the general opinion of the expert that is the worst behind us and recently I spoke to the ministry of economy. He shared the view of the minister of finance. And the expectation even that as a result this year we'll have a positive economic growth. Maybe very, very little but small, but still not a negative like we had last year.</p><p>So definitely things are improving. Inflation is under control. We probably have only half of the inflation level, which we had last year. So it looks like the economy's picking up. And oil prices are a little bit stabilizing. So it's also good news for our economy.</p><p>NEWMAN: In terms of the sanctions and the way it would affect your bank, though, I mean, obviously, you would want them lifted. But is it absolutely necessary in order for Russia and your bank in particular to return to recovery point?</p><p>KOSTIN: You see, we somehow adjust our activity in line with the sanctions. And, of course, the worst influence for us that's the problem of getting new capital. Because, you know, VTB on course for privatization and definitely with this kind of market there's not much opportunity for privatization or at least that's pretty much low privatization for VTB. But as far as liquidity is concerned, I think we feel quite comfortable. There's enough equity inside Russia, so we're doing our business just as normal.</p><p>So basically, definitely would like -- we would like sanctions to be lifted. It will pave the way for our further growth, further expansion. But at the moment, we somehow got used to the sanctions. And don't feel too much burden on this.</p><p>NEWMAN: And yet, when you look at oil prices rising, do you think that will help mitigate the impact of the sanctions even if they replace in months or more than a year?</p><p>Well, that's for sure. I mean, most of the experts arguing that the worst effect we had on lower oil prices rather than sanctions, but I think both are not good, I mean, low oil prices and sanctions. But oil prices are vital for Russia, at least at this stage of Russian development of our economy. We don't have still restructured economy and our economy still very much depends on oil and, of course, other natural resources, raw materials. It's also very important. All commodity prices are quite --</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWMAN: In the 1980s, HP revolutionized printing with its DeskJet. Now it wants to do the same with 3-D printing.</p><p>NEWMAN: Now, imagine a printer that could print copies of itself. HP has revealed its first commercial 3-D printers, and says they will reinvent manufacturing. Still, it may be a while before you have one of these things. Prices will start at $130,000 when they go on sale later this year.</p><p>[16:45:00] Deon Weisler, is the president and CEO of HP, and he joins me now live from Palo Alto, California. Thanks for being with us. I mean, what's been written up about this thing is tremendous. It could be the most disruptive event in manufacturing since we first heard of 3-D printing, that's just one from engineering publication. The expectations are so high. Please tell me how you expect to meet them.</p><p>DEON WEISLER, PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, HP: Well, great. And first of all, thank you for having me. Great to be here. It's been a really exciting day for us here at HP. We're all about reinvention. And today as you quite rightly said, this is about reinventing manufacturing. About changing and democratizing manufacturing and bring it much closer to where customers buy and service their products. And we've done that through the release of these two new products that is hit the market that have targeted the commercial space.</p><p>NEWMAN: When you say, what this is going to do, though. Can you give us a real-life example when you want to try to employ this, trying to sell this? How will it revolutionize manufacturing?</p><p>WEISLER: Well, you opened in a way that said, you know, printers that print themselves. And indeed, our printers, 50 percent of the parts inside the printer are actually printed by the printer. This is an example of one of those parts. You can see it's a fully flexible part. Traditionally, that would have to be manufactured in a very faraway place. You have to build inventory. Put it on supply lanes chains. And ship it all over the world. This can now be printed where wherever you're building the device. And that enables you to have breakthrough economics. That just isn't possible through traditional manufacturing methods.</p><p>NEWMAN: Now as you were saying, these are commercial printers. I mean, at this point, who do you picture the first customers to be?</p><p>WEISLER: Well, today, we also announced some great partnerships with Nike, with Siemens, with Johnson &amp; Johnson, with BMW. These are all visionary companies that understand the value of innovation and how they can leverage 3-D printing to disrupt the markets they're in to deliver excellence in products for customers.</p><p>NEWMAN: In terms of when you look at entrepreneurs, and I have several family members myself. They run small manufacturing outlets. This is $130,000. Do you think for the smaller start-ups that there will be purpose to spending that $130,000 on that HP 3-D printer?</p><p>WEISLER: Well, we thought about that. And if you're going to truly democratize manufacturing you have to make the technology available to everybody. And so one of the key launch partners today is a company of Shapeways. And not familiar shape ways go to shapeways.com. And what you're able to do there is surf their broad library of 3-D designed products or design your own. And then send that off to a 3-D printer. Now, in the background, many of the parts will be printed on HP 3-D printing devices, and then they'll be shipped to you the next day. So those particular small businesses can indeed participate in this democratized world a manufacturing.</p><p>NEWMAN: Yes. I mean, and it really is mind bending. I have to ask you. HP has been through a tumultuous time in the last few years, and I think some people may look to this invention and see some skepticism. We were going through org chart just to figure out what's going on with your company. I mean, what gives you the confidence to be telling us that, look, this will revolutionize manufacturing? But also, this will reinvent HP yet again.</p><p>WEISLER: Well, I think we have a long history of invention. That's what is at the very DNA of this organization. Whether it be Hewlett-Packard enterprise or HP Ink, we separated these companies to enable to fuel our innovation engines to able to drive faster.</p><p>We changed the way offices worked when we released the DeskJet and the LaserJet printers and we're leveraging more than 30 years of intellectual property from our core, and bringing it across into this new world of 3-D printing. So when it has that HP logo on it only a company like HP can be as disruptive in changing the way manufacturing works.</p><p>All right. We'll see if we can hold you to that in the months and years to come. Mr. Weisler, thanks so much for your time. Appreciate it.</p><p>WEISLER: Great to be here. Thanks for having me.</p><p>NEWMAN: Now, it has 20 restaurants, 16 decks and crew of more than 2,000. We'll show you the world's largest cruise ship. That's after the break. But first, a highlight from \"MAKE, CREATE, INNOVATE.\"</p><p>[16:51:49] NEWMAN: The world's largest cruise ship reached the English Port of Southampton on Tuesday after the maiden voyage. Harmony of the Seas is 25th ship in the Royal Caribbean's fleet. It's 362 meters in length. Stay with me here. That's longer than the Eiffel Tower laying on its side. It was built using 500,000 individual parts. The ship boasts 23 swimming pools. And a 10-story water slide and already makes me dizzy thinking about it. I asked, Michael Bayler, the CEO of Royal Caribbean International, why the world needs a ship like this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MICHAEL BAYLER, CEO, ROYAL CARIBBEAN INTERNATIONAL: Well, why do you need the ultimate family vacation? That's exactly what Harmony of the Seas is. It's just packed with the most amazing entertainment, adventures, innovations. It truly is the ultimate vacation.</p><p>NEWMAN: Now, I know that you're really giving it a good sell job. I'm not sure you really need to sell that ship to people that like cruising. But if you can just describe in it a sense. When you saw this on, you know, the drawing board as it were, and now have seen it, in the flesh being launched, I mean, what is it like?</p><p>BAYLER: It's truly amazing. I mean, I think for all of us at Royal Caribbean it's literally like having a baby, a new child. We've spent a lot of time planning and thinking about this. We have put a lot of expertise and energy into designing it. And I think for all of us, the fact that now this ship has become a reality is genuinely exciting for all of us and certainly for our customers.</p><p>NEWMAN: A billion-dollar investment as far as we can understand. How are you going to be able to make it back with this ship?</p><p>BAYLER: Actually, it is closer to $1.5 billion investment. And we -- this ship is the kind of a cross between our quantum class and oasis class ship. It is really the next generation. And if you look at our forward bookings for that ship, for this summer, we're feeling pretty confident about paying back that investment.</p><p>NEWMAN: OK. But it must take away from the other ships that maybe aren't getting the love that they're used to getting.</p><p>BAYLER: No, our ships are getting the love all around the world. They think what's great about Royal Caribbean, we have obviously been in the business for a long time. We deliver a great vacation. And I think we see the demand growing across many markets around the world for our company.</p><p>NEWMAN: You know, I have to ask you. With cruising and I know you heard it a million times, a love/hate relationship. And for the people who don't understand why anybody goes on a cruise. You know, you have the issues with illnesses that break out. I mean, Royal Caribbean had the incident with the rough seas a few months ago. What can you tell us going forward in terms of really trying to look at some of those issues? Because those become huge headaches for the governments involved, not just for your company.</p><p>BAYLER: Yes, I think, obviously, things do happen. Things occur. I think statistically when you look at the number of incidents it's relatively small. We spend a lot of time and energy minimizing and trying to eliminate any of those types of situations.</p><p>[16:55:00] This year we'll carry close to 4.4 million people on cruises with Royal Caribbean. And literally the number of events this happen is almost zero.</p><p>NEWMAN: Well, it's not almost zero though for the people who go through it. What do you have for people that have an apprehension? And as I said, a lot of people that are just angry that, you know, whether these ships come into port and just the headaches this they cause whether from health perspective or safety perspective?</p><p>BAYLER: Yes, I think that's a negative perspective on it. I mean, when our ships come into port, they bring a lot of happy vacationers. There's a considerable economic positive economic impact in the port that is we call in to. I think the relationships that we have with these ports and destinations is very, very positive. So I think that, you know, you can look at it from a negative or a positive perspective. We think it's a very positive experience.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NEWMAN: All right. Swipe right to stay in the EU. Swipe left to leave. What am I talking about? We will tell you. It's Prime Minister <person><nameText>David Cameron's </nameText></person>latest ploy to get out the youth vote against Brexit. We'll explain.</p><p>NEWMAN: <person><nameText>David Cameron </nameText></person>wants the U.K. to swipe right on the European Union. Users of the dating app Tinder might see ads, disguised as dating profiles, encouraging them to come out and vote in the referendum next month. This isn't Tinder's first date with politics, unfortunately. It launched a feature called Swipe the Vote, back in March. Users were able to swipe left or right to identify a candidate that matched their values. I think it's all pretty creepy.</p><p>[17:00:00] And that is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS. I'm Paula Newton and I'll be right back here again tomorrow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2016051701cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JTB-DCR1-DXH2-6447-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7932\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"05\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>May 17, 2016 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0004Z1F</classCode><className>QATAR AIRWAYS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC000A28I</classCode><className>JSC VTB BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0001QHZ</classCode><className>FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF ATLANTA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS481111 SCHEDULED PASSENGER AIR TRANSPORTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC4512 AIR TRANSPORTATION, SCHEDULED</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

There is likely to be further weakness this week unless industrial, consumer or second-quarter earnings data steer central bankers away from a tightening policy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The US economy added 222,000 jobs in June, bounding over economists' expectations, even as the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.4 per cent - though that was primarily a function of more potential workers identifying themselves as job-seekers.</p><p>\"The employment number keeps the Fed on track for a further rate hike this year and the winding-down of the Fed's balance sheet,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial.</p><p>\"Although there remains concern over the lack of movement in wages . . . the headline number suggests that we will see a push towards higher wages as employment continues to tighten.\"</p><p>\"Central banks are taking advantage of good times to normalise policies,\" said foreign exchange analysts at brokerage Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Research, in a note to clients that predicted more volatility in markets worldwide as the US Federal Reserve carried out plans outlined in the minutes from its June meeting to raise rates and begin selling off its bond holdings.</p><p>Rising Treasury rates could reduce the outlook for earnings growth, particularly in sectors that are already struggling with demand.</p><p>Two of those troubled areas - retail and health care - were the source of much of the \"up-side\" surprise in the jobs report according to another brokerage.</p><p>\"Retail rose 8,000 after falling a cumulative 79,000 over the prior four months,\" said analysts at brokerage Morgan Stanley, in a research note. Earlier in the week, another apparel company that had once been ubiquitous among teenagers - True Religion Jeans - filed for bankruptcy, the latest victim of online competition and the millennial generation's aversion to branding.</p><p>It is likely that employment in bricks-and-mortar stores will continue to fall and that those job losses will be only partly offset by hiring from fast-growing online retailers. While housing data remains strong, this strength will soon be tested by rising mortgage rates. The property market is the lynchpin of the US consumer economy.</p><p>For the health care industry, some clouds are parting even as interest rates rise. Health care stocks were among the strongest for the week, as Republicans seemed to back off their pledge to completely scrap the Affordable Care Act.</p><p>Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican Majority Leader in the Senate, said that Republicans should \"shore up the 'Obamacare' exchanges if repeal efforts did not succeed\" - the first public concession from a Republican that repeal efforts could fail after years of dominating the Republican platform.</p><p>Republicans have also retreated from threats of drug price controls, so much so that the biotechnolgy companies that were pariahs for much of 2016 and 2017 have come back into fashion. At around US$312, the iShares Nasdaq Biotech Index, a basket of the largest health care stocks has recovered about half the losses incurred after then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton pledged to rein in drug price increases. Should the protracted debate about regulations come to an end, health care could be a new driver of stock market gains.</p><p>Prudential's Ms Krosby said that there would likely be volatility as markets adjusted to the reality of coming rate hikes. While some have argued that this could spell doom for the bull market, Ms Krosby said that it could inspire a rotation.</p><p>The utility and telecom stocks that led the market for the last couple of years of the Obama presidency could fall back to make way for stocks less sensitive to higher rates, including financial stocks.</p><p>After years of being \"dead money\", the financial sector of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 has risen by almost 50 per cent in the last 12 months.</p><p>The only issues that are generating more returns than big financial stocks are big tech stocks.</p><p>Analysts at brokerage Goldman Sachs said that the \"mega cap\" tech stocks - including Facebook, Amazon.com, Apple, Microsoft and Google's parent Alphabet - are still likely to be among the fastest growing companies in the second half of the year.</p><p>But investors have become nervous about these stocks, and there is a sense that they could soon lead a slide that is as commanding as the rally that they led during the first half of the year. Another tech stock with stellar returns, which is slightly smaller than those five, had a humbling sell-off last week. Electric car maker Tesla is about 20 per cent below its peak.</p><p>After the G-20 meeting in Hamburg, US President Donald Trump's administration may move on its trade policy.</p><p>Steel makers and metals miners could benefit from extensive tariffs that the US has threatened to impose on imports. But economists warned that such protectionist measures could ultimately backfire by sparking a damaging trade war. Officials in the European Union have already vowed reprisals.</p><p>The bull market has some chance of surviving rising interest rates and a trade war - as long as a live war does not occur in the Korean peninsular first.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>US stocks were more or less flat last week as a strong jobs report forced traders to accept that ultra-low interest rates would soon be a thing of the past.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-162540</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5P05-CPF1-DYX4-018X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"894\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"07\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>July 10, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001TWF</classCode><className>MERRILL LYNCH &amp;

Stocks are rising modestly in early trading on Wall Street as a bumpy, holiday-shortened week of trading winds down. The S&amp;#38;P 500 was up 0.4% in the early going Friday, Sept. 11. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File)NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Stocks are trying for another comeback on Wall Street Friday, as a tumultuous week of big swings comes to a close. </p><p> The S&amp;#38;P 500 was up 0.4% in midday trading, but only after an earlier gain of 0.8% vanished completely. Momentum has been lightning-quick to shift on Wall Street recently, and a similar morning gain for the S&amp;#38;P 500 on Thursday gave way to a 1.8% loss for its fourth drop in five days. The Nasdaq composite, which includes many of the superstar tech stocks that have been the focus of the market's recent selling, was up 0.1% after flip-flopping earlier between gains and losses. It has swung at least 1.3% in each of the last five days, with four of those down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 195 points, or 0.7%, at 27,730, as of 11:47 a.m. Eastern time.  Analysts expect swings to continue to rattle markets for weeks, if not months, as investors wait for more clarity on several key issues. At the head of the list of uncertainties, for now at least, is what to do with Big Tech stocks. Apple, Amazon and others soared through the pandemic as their businesses boomed despite the recession. The coronavirus accelerated a shift to online life that's benefited them, and a pile-on of investors into Big Tech sent their share prices soaring to levels that critics said were simply too high.  Apple had a nearly irrepressible run this summer where it rose in 13 out of 14 weeks. Zoom Video Communications surged above $450 per share earlier this month after starting the year at less than $70.  That all came to an abrupt halt last week. Worries that the stocks had gotten overheated helped send the S&amp;#38;P 500 to its worst three-day run in nearly three months, and the Nasdaq composite slid 10%. Tech stocks and the market broadly recovered a bit on Wednesday, and they seemed to regain their stride Thursday morning, only for an afternoon swoon to batter them again. (Ad) Modern life runs on lithium-ion batteries. That's why it's so dangerous for China to control the lithium supply. But one company has an answer. It has a huge property in lithium-rich Nevada, USA. On Friday, tech stocks again swung back and forth from gains to losses. The fluctuations came even after Oracle reported stronger profit for its latest quarter than analysts expected. It also gave a forecast for profits in the current quarter that topped Wall Street's expectations. Its stock gained 2.2%. Despite its Friday gain, the S&amp;#38;P 500 remains on track for a loss of 2.2% this week. That would be its second weekly loss in a row, something that hasn't happened for nearly four months.  After rising as much as 1.5% shortly after trading began, Apple fell back to a loss of 1.3%. Apple is on pace for a loss of 7.4% this week, which would be its worst since March, when the market was still plummeting on worries about the recession caused by the pandemic. Movements for it and other Big Tech stocks matter more than ever for broad market indexes because their immense size means they can influence the S&amp;#38;P 500 almost by themselves. Five Big Tech companies make up nearly 23% of the index's entire value.  One big factor that remains in the stock market's favor is the Federal Reserve, which continues to pump aid into the economy. It has slashed short-term interest rates to record lows and bought up all kinds of bonds to support markets. It also said recently it will keep delivering stimulus even if inflation rises above its target level, as long as inflation had been well under it before then. A report on Friday showed that inflation remains low, though it was higher than economists expected. Consumer prices rose 1.3% in August from a year earlier, a shade above the 1.2% that investors were expecting.  Following the report, the yield on the 10-year Treasury gave up an earlier gain. It was at 0.67%, down from 0.68% late Thursday.  Unprecedented amounts of aid from Congress, along with the Federal Reserve, also helped the stock market halt its nearly 34% plummet in late March.  But it looks less likely by the day that Congress will approve more support for the limping economy before the November elections, even though investors say such stimulus is crucial after unemployment benefits and other stimulus has expired. Senate Democrats on Thursday shot down a scaled-back package proposed by Republicans, saying it shortchanged too many needs.  Investors are also worried about all the uncertainty that elections bring generally, which can result in big changes for tax laws and regulations that affect corporate profits. Concerns are likewise high about trade tensions between the United States and China, among other major economies, and whether the expectations building for a coming COVID-19 vaccine prove to be too optimistic.  European stock markets made modest moves. The German DAX was close to flat, and the French CAC rose 0.3%. The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.5% after data showed the British economy recouped further lost ground during July after a swath of coronavirus restrictions on businesses were lifted.  Asian markets were stronger. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.7%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed 0.8% and stocks in Shanghai added 0.8%. The Kospi in South Korea was close to flat.  Benchmark U.S. crude rose 0.6% to $37.52 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 0.2% to $40.00 per barrel.  ___ AP Business Writer Yuri Kageyama contributed. 12 Marijuana Stocks to Buy Now[1]There are now more than 50 publicly-traded companies operating in the cannabis industry.

Momentum has been lightning-quick to ...</p><p>Stocks are trying for another comeback on Wall Street Friday, as a tumultuous week of big swings comes to a close.    The S&amp;P 500 was up 0.7% in morning trading, but only after an earlier gain of 0.8% vanished completely. Momentum has been lightning-quick to shift on Wall Street recently, and a similar morning gain for the S&amp;P 500 on Thursday gave way to a 1.8% loss for its fourth drop in five days.    The Nasdaq composite, which includes many of the superstar tech stocks that have been the focus of the market\u2019s recent selling, was up 0.7% after flip-flopping earlier between gains and losses. It has swung at least 1.3% in each of the last five days, with four of those down. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 249 points, or 0.9%, at 27,784, as of 10:51 a.m. Eastern time.    Analysts expect swings to continue to rattle markets for weeks, if not months, as investors wait for more clarity on several key issues. At the head of the list of uncertainties, for now at least, is what to do with Big Tech stocks.    Apple, Amazon and others soared through the pandemic as their businesses boomed despite the recession. The coronavirus accelerated a shift to online life that\u2019s benefited them, and a pile-on of investors into Big Tech sent their share prices soaring to levels that critics said were simply too high.    Apple had a nearly irrepressible run this summer where it rose in 13 out of 14 weeks. Zoom Video Communications surged above $450 per share earlier this month after starting the year at less than $70.    That all came to an abrupt halt last week. Worries that the stocks had gotten overheated helped send the S&amp;P 500 to its worst three-day run in nearly three months, and the Nasdaq composite slid 10%. Tech stocks and the market broadly recovered a bit on Wednesday, and they seemed to regain their stride Thursday morning, only for an afternoon swoon to batter them again.    On Friday, tech stocks again swung back and forth from gains to losses. The fluctuations came even after Oracle reported stronger profit for its latest quarter than analysts expected. It also gave a forecast for profits in the current quarter that topped Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Its stock gained 3.4%.    Despite its Friday gain, the S&amp;P 500 remains on track for a loss of 1.9% this week. That would be its second weekly loss in a row, something that hasn\u2019t happened for nearly four months.    After rising as much as 1.5% shortly after trading began, Apple fell back to a loss of 0.5%. Apple is on pace for a loss of 6.6% this week, which would be its worst since March, when the market was still plummeting on worries about the recession caused by the pandemic.    Movements for it and other Big Tech stocks matter more than ever for broad market indexes because their immense size means they can influence the S&amp;P 500 almost by themselves. Five Big Tech companies make up nearly 23% of the index\u2019s entire value.    One big factor that remains in the stock market\u2019s favor is the Federal Reserve, which continues to pump aid into the economy. It has slashed short-term interest rates to record lows and bought up all kinds of bonds to support markets. It also said recently it will keep delivering stimulus even if inflation rises above its target level, as long as inflation had been well under it before then.    A report on Friday showed that inflationremains low, though it was higher than economists expected. Consumer prices rose 1.3% in August from a year earlier, a shade above the 1.2% that investors were expecting.    Following the report, the yield on the 10-year Treasury gave up an earlier gain. It was at 0.67%, down from 0.68% late Thursday.    Unprecedented amounts of aid from Congress, along with the Federal Reserve, also helped the stock market halt its nearly 34% plummet in late March.    But it looks less likely by the day that Congress will approve more support for the limping economy before the November elections, even though investors say such stimulus is crucial after unemployment benefits and other stimulus has expired. Senate Democrats on Thursday shot downa scaled-back package proposed by Republicans, saying it shortchanged too many needs.

Concerns are likewise high about trade tensions between the United States and China, among other major economies, and whether the expectations building for a coming COVID-19 vaccine prove too optimistic.    European stock markets were making only modest moves. The German DAX lost 0.2%, and the French CAC rose 0.1%. The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.3% after data showed the British economy recouped further lost ground during July after a swath of coronavirus restrictions on businesses were lifted.    Asian markets were stronger. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose 0.7%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed 0.8% and stocks in Shanghai added 0.8%. The Kospi in South Korea was close to flat.    Benchmark U.S. crude rose 0.5% to $37.50 per barrel.

The organic growth trajectories of these groups should spark similar concern. On Friday, a US economic report showed that the official American unemployment rate had shot up to 14.7 per cent and that a whopping       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dol.gov/newsroom/economicdata/empsit_05082020.pdf\"> 23.1m workers </url>were out of jobs.</p><p>The jarring juxtaposition was the Nasdaq Composite index turning positive for the year on Friday. The S&amp;P 500 is down just a tenth in 2020, despite a soaring run lasting years and the onset of what may be an economic depression.</p><p>Explanations for the shocking disconnect range from blaming central banks and fiscal authorities for propping up asset prices to pointing out that the stocks aim to predict long-term future earnings. A simpler explanation lies in what now constitutes \u201cthe stock market\u201d.</p><p>Half of the Nasdaq Composite, which is market-weighted, is accounted for by technology companies. <url normalizedValue=\"https://indexes.nasdaqomx.com/docs/FS_COMP.pdf\"> Nearly 40 per cent</url> of that index comprises Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet. All those stocks are up this year. Demand for their goods and services have proved relatively resilient, as have their cash balances. Similarly, those big tech champions are all among the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-500\"> largest 10 constituents</url> of the S&amp;P 500, though the S&amp;P 500 is more diversified across industries than Nasdaq.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Investors who believe buying \u201cmarket\u201d indices gives them diversification are fooling themselves. They are largely getting dominant tech platforms who have been on a tear for years. Microsoft, Apple and Amazon all have market capitalisations exceeding $1tn.\u00a0For contrast, take the Russell 2000 index which represents small-cap stocks: it remains down 20 per cent since the end of December.</p><p>Individual investors have been trained to stick to passive funds. This seems to have created a positive feedback loop that bids up the value of tech companies as their earnings rise. If these businesses fall out of favour, perhaps as a result of a political backlash and regulatory intervention, the drop could be symmetrically painful. Until then, we are all along for the ride.\u00a0 \u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Lex team is interested in hearing more from readers.

Googlewill also add audio and visual alerts to the app for when drivers use the turn-by-turn navigation feature.</p><p>There are about 130,000 public and 85,000 private grade, or level, crossings across the country. The number of accidents at crossings had declined more than 80 percent, to about 2,000 a year in recent years from about 12,000 a year in the 1970s. But last year, the number rose 9 percent.</p><p>This upswing has prompted the railroad agency to seek new ways to stem this longstanding hazard through technology. Last year, 270 people died in highway-rail collisions, up from 232 the previous year, and 843 people were injured, according to federal safety statistics.</p><p>Grade-crossing accidents are the second-highest cause of rail fatalities after trespassing accidents, which killed 533 people last year.</p><p>Drivers increasingly rely on their smartphones for directions, and major tech firms - including Google, Apple and Facebook - have developed location-based services that make the most of their capabilities.</p><p>Googlehas been a pioneer in mapping, and its mobile app is one of the most popular maps for Android phones and iPhones.</p><p>The partnership with Googleis likely to precede other announcements. The agency said it had also reached out to four other map makers - Apple, MapQuest, TomTom and Garmin - to include similar features on their apps or mapping devices.</p><p>Grade-crossing accidents are generally caused by driver inattention and error, according to the rail regulator. In many instances, there are no gates or blinking lights to warn drivers of an oncoming train - just a crossing sign or a crossbuck (a white ''X'' marked with the words ''railroad crossing'').</p><p>Officials and safety advocates do not have a precise explanation as to why grade accidents rose last year. A growing economy might have contributed to increasing freight train traffic and put more people on the roads. Distracted driving might be another factor.</p><p>''The vast majority of these accidents and deaths are preventable,'' said Sarah Feinberg, the Federal Railroad Administration's acting administrator. ''In some cases, maybe a driver intends to beat the train, thinks they are familiar with the route or still have time to cross. But there are many cases where drivers lack situational awareness, because it may be dark or the route is unfamiliar.''</p><p>She points out that many drivers now routinely plug their destinations into their smartphones, often to find the fastest itinerary or avoid traffic.</p><p>No date has been given for when the crossing information will be available on GoogleMaps, but Department of Transportation officials say the company has made the project a priority.</p><p>''We're happy to help the Federal Railroad Administration as we're always looking for new ways to make maps useful to our users,'' said Mara Harris, a Google spokeswoman.</p><p>The Department of Transportation has developed its own app, called the Rail Crossing Location Mobile Application, that provides drivers with a catalog of all crossing locations. But the app does not alert drivers when they are about to cross over tracks. It is also not used much. The same data found on this app would also be used by Googleand others.</p><p>''We have some really good data on these crossings, but we have to put the data where people are using it,'' Ms. Feinberg said. ''What makes sense is to take that data where people are gathering. It makes much more sense for me to share my data with Google, rather than try to get Googleusers to come to my app. For us, it makes a ton of sense to get that information out there.''</p><p>In February, a Metro-North commuter train struck a sport utility vehicle that was stuck on the tracks in Valhalla, N.Y., killing six people. That accident took place just weeks after Ms. Feinberg, formerly the chief of staff to the secretary of transportation, was named as the railroad agency's acting administrator.</p><p>The accident, along with last year's uptick in the number of fatalities, prompted Ms. Feinberg to turn to technology partners for help. Before joining the Department of Transportation, Ms. Feinberg, a former White House employee, had worked at Facebook, giving her knowledge of how big tech companies develop their products.</p><p>Joyce Rose, president of Operation Lifesaver, a rail safety educational group, welcomed the new initiative. She says that a vehicle or a person is hit by a train every three hours in the United States.</p><p>About half of those accidents happened at crossings with a gate or lights, she said.</p><p>''It's another tool in the toolbox to make the public safer,'' Ms. Rose said. ''This is going to help raise awareness about where crossings are and, hopefully, remind drivers to act safely as they approach.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-1992144</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GB4-1GG1-JC85-N3V3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"883\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>International New York Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"06\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>June 30, 2015 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001VZA</classCode><className>GARMIN LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FEDERAL RAILROAD ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>US DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

There are the US companie...</p><p>The acrimony between China and the US over technology transfers has created plenty of losers during the past year. There are the US companies which have missed out on business as a result of sanctions, and the Chinese groups that have had to find alternative supplies. But there is one group that has emerged as a winner: the security hawks who say they saw it coming and who are now pushing Beijing to be more self-sufficient.</p><p>Since the start of 2019, Washington has used sanctions to cut Chinese companies out of US supply chains, denting the telecoms group Huawei , China\u2019s supercomputer groups and eight of the country\u2019s leading artificial intelligence surveillance companies. </p><p>For many policymakers in Beijing, the inevitable trend is towards more decoupling of the two countries\u2019 tech supply chains. A truce in the trade war is unlikely to diminish the Trump administration\u2019s drive to place controls on exports of advanced technologies.</p><p>The result has been a decisive shift in China\u2019s approach to the industry. Beijing is accelerating its drive for technological \u201cautonomy\u201d to boost its control over its own supply chain in the face of political risks, such as further US embargoes.</p><p>To achieve technological autonomy, Beijing is pursuing strategies that often tread an uneasy balance between increasing its engagement with the outside world and shutting it out. For all the accusations China has faced about stealing other countries\u2019 technology, Beijing is now embracing international open-source, or free to use, collaborations.</p><p>China is also tapping overseas markets for talent, investing more in countries other than the US.</p><p>This acceleration of decoupling will not only affect US groups that rely on China\u2019s custom, it will also start to reconfigure the world\u2019s tech supply chain, as Chinese companies turn to countries they view as safer allies. The two superpowers are already bullying countries they buy from, and sell to, to take sides.</p><p>\u201cThree years ago, there may have been more people thinking that we could rely on some US technologies rather than developing our own,\u201d says Yan Ming, a director at the China Computer Federation, a research alliance. \u201cNow if someone is still saying that, I suppose they have just been sleeping for the past three years.\u201d </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Trump administration has</emphasis> justified its sanctions so far on the basis of national security concerns surrounding Huawei, as well as a foreign policy objective of preventing Chinese government repression of Uighur Muslims and others in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, which is facilitated by surveillance companies. But within China, these justifications are seen as excuses for a broader agenda: preventing the rise of China as a challenger to the US as a tech superpower.</p><p>China\u2019s fears are not unjustified. In November, the US commerce department proposed rules that would give the agency the power to review and block any transaction involving \u201cinformation and communications technology and services\u201d from a \u201cforeign adversary\u201d.</p><p>US officials have expressed national security fears over a range of Chinese companies, from software tech giants Tencent and Alibaba to the state-owned China Railway Rolling Stock Corp, which is pursuing an estimated $1bn contract with the Washington DC subway. The officials say their concern is not limited to a few tech companies, but that all Chinese companies could be seen as threats because they are potentially subject to the ruling Communist party\u2019s control.</p><p>As a result a whole host of Chinese groups are assessing their dependency on US technologies. The largest gap is in hardware, especially the design and manufacture of semiconductors and high-end chips, where China lags far behind the US. They also rely on the US for software, from Google\u2019s mobile apps for Android smartphones \u2014 which are now sorely lacking from Huawei\u2019s handsets \u2014 to Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system and its Office suite. </p><p>More broadly, the Chinese and US tech industries benefit from knowledge sharing. That includes informal discussions within industry alliances and standards-setting bodies, some of which have already been curtailed by export controls on Huawei and other companies. Although not subject to the same controls, US-origin software developed under open-source licences supports much of the basic infrastructure of the internet, and Chinese developers worry that their access may soon be blocked. </p><p>Beijing\u2019s response to the threat of decoupling dovetails with an ambition enshrined in its 2017 Cybersecurity Law, to ensure components of \u201ccritical\u201d infrastructure are \u201csecure and controllable\u201d and \u201cautonomous and controllable\u201d.</p><p>In light of US sanctions, Chinese experts now argue that the risk of supply-chain disruptions for political reasons should be taken into consideration when vetting components. That includes the knock-on impact of Washington\u2019s pressure on non-US companies. US officials have been pressuring their counterparts in Taiwan to stop its largest chipmaker from selling to Huawei. </p><p>\u201cDeveloping autonomous and controllable technology is a solution to being controlled by others,\u201d says Mr Yan. He adds that the Trump administration \u201ctaught China a lesson\u201d when it temporarily imposed sanctions on telecoms equipment maker ZTE in 2018, taking the company to the brink of collapse. The lesson was: \u201cIf you continue like this, you are controlled by others and you won\u2019t survive if I cut your supply chain,\u201d he says.</p><p>Although foreign products could in theory be certified as \u201csecure and controllable\u201d, this push largely means stripping out foreign vendors, say cyber security companies. In a confidential directive revealed by the Financial Times, the central government told its departments and public institutions to replace existing computers and software with domestically made versions.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019re being uninvited to bid. We\u2019re not being allowed to even participate any more,\u201d Cisco\u2019s chief executive Chuck Robbins told analysts in August, referring to the company\u2019s business with Chinese state-owned enterprises.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">For many countries, technology</emphasis> development nearly always requires piggybacking on international expertise. This year, China has driven engagement with open-source research collaborations \u2014 where individuals from around the world can contribute \u2014 as a way to circumvent US export sanctions.</p><p>Chips are a crucial part of China\u2019s drive for self-sufficiency because they are the building blocks for all forms of computer. In October, China\u2019s annual government-run World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, near Shanghai in eastern China, debated an open-source chip design project. Born at the University of California, Berkeley, RISC-V is a research collaboration that develops free-for-use designs for the basic architecture used in microprocessors \u2014 potentially meaning the end of reliance on Intel and Arm\u2019s proprietary designs. </p><p>Ni Guangnan, an IT industry veteran, argued at the Wuzhen conference that China has several options when it comes to chip design. Those designed by Intel and the UK-based Arm are subject to possible US sanctions, he said, while chips wholly designed in China, such as by Loongson and Sunway, are rarely used. </p><p>But, Mr Ni concluded, Chinese-made chips based on RISC-V architecture are not controlled by other countries and have a future in emerging markets.</p><p>China has faced plenty of other problems developing a competitive domestic chip industry. Companies such as Xiaomi and Huawei already use their own in-house designs for chips used in their smartphones. But designing other high-end chips, such as microprocessors used in high-speed servers that will be competitive with Intel\u2019s, could be more than a decade away, says Dan Wang, a tech analyst at the consultancy Gavekal Dragonomics in Beijing.</p><p>Chinese venture-capital investment in the US has fallen substantially over the past year as the money instead flows to countries that investors consider beyond US sanctions.</p><p>\u201cThe Chinese are scouring the world for non-US semiconductor technologies to bridge the gap,\u201d says Bas Fransen, lead analyst at the consultancy TenX2, who has helped introduce Chinese investors to Indian chip designers. \u201cParticularly in Bangalore, you come across many Chinese company reps and also government officials looking for start-ups to acquire or invest in, and to persuade to move to China.\u201d</p><p>But beyond chip design, Beijing sees open-source projects as an opportunity for China\u2019s tech sector to expand. Not only does it underpin much of the technology behind the modern internet, but open-source software is also, for now at least, exempt under US export controls.</p><p>The ministry of industry and information technology, China\u2019s tech industry regulator, has recently encouraged Microsoft\u2019s GitHub, the world\u2019s biggest code-sharing platform and host of open-source collaborations, to expand in China. GitHub\u2019s chief operating officer Erica Brescia says Chinese officials told the company that open-source projects give a \u201csense of security\u201d because of the lack of trade restrictions.</p><p>\u201c[Due to] the trade war, China\u2019s government and its big tech companies have realised it needs to push the development of its own domestic open-source ecosystem,\u201d says Mark Ma, chief executive of Open Source China.</p><p>The government is also stepping up its talent-poaching programmes to try to bring Chinese emigrants home and attract foreign expertise. Among them is the Thousand Talents Plan, which has continued despite the government telling civil servants and state media to stop mentioning it by name last year because of criticism in the US.</p><p>Headhunters in Silicon Valley describe how increased difficulties in the US, such as the tightening of visa rules for talented workers, have led to more Chinese engineers returning home after finishing their studies in the US.</p><p>\u201cSome of these [Chinese] researchers in the US do not feel fully safe [any more],\u201d says Zhang Monan, chief researcher on US and Europe at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges in Beijing, a government-sponsored think-tank. </p><p>The Chinese recruitment schemes offer a range of incentives, from tax subsidies and research grants to topping up wages in co-operation with large private sector employers. They often also provide office and laboratory space, and even help with recruiting local researchers. </p><p>Last year, the government announced a tax subsidy scheme designed to lure overseas talent to the Greater Bay area on China\u2019s south coast, giving high earners an effective tax rate as low as Hong Kong\u2019s, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://home.kpmg/cn/zh/home/insights/2019/06/china-tax-alert-18.html\"> calculations by KPMG</url>. Elsewhere, officials in Ningbo, near Shanghai, has said it will pay relocation costs of between Rmb150,000 ($21,000) and Rmb8m ($1.2m) to attract specialist tech workers. </p><p>Chinese government-backed recruiters have, over the past year, been more cautious about operating in the US. But while the Trump administration has scrutinised university staff with Chinese state funding, it does not seem that the US government is concerned about Chinese engineers leaving the country. China\u2019s private sector is still able to move quickly to mop up talent \u2014 although companies under export sanctions, such as Huawei, are careful not to hire competitors\u2019 engineers who could be accused of bringing sanctioned technical knowledge to the country.</p><p>This push for chip self-sufficiency has boosted smaller private Chinese companies in the industry, according to Charles Liu, a private equity investor formerly on the board of US semiconductor company Applied Materials. </p><p>\u201cThe drive for tech decoupling has increased demand for Chinese start-ups,\u201d says Mr Hao. \u201cThey used to be thought of as too high-risk and so had no market to sell to; now they\u2019re developing because there\u2019s demand domestically.\u201d </p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Some Chinese academics talk </emphasis>optimistically about trying to \u201crecouple\u201d rather than \u201cdecouple\u201d from the US \u2014 a reference to welcoming in more American investment and US companies, hoping this will add to the lobbying pressure in Washington from the parts of tech sector that wants to deal with China.<br/></p><p>Examples of this trend include the central bank\u2019s decision to allow PayPal to become the first foreign company to acquire payment processing licences, as well as the Foreign Investment Law, which was pushed through in March in a bid to calm overseas investors\u2019 concerns. </p><p>The law promises that all sectors are open to foreign investment unless they are named on a \u201cnegative list\u201d, flipping the previous presumption of industries being closed unless otherwise stated, and fulfilling a longstanding US demand. </p><p>Yet experts say this strategy comes into conflict with ensuring technologies China relies on are \u201csecure and controllable\u201d. Politicians abroad have compared buying Huawei\u2019s equipment to giving China an \u201coff switch\u201d for a country\u2019s telecoms network. </p><p>The Chinese government faces a similar conundrum: if it really wants to allow foreign tech companies to gain market share in China, it must recognise that Washington will have potential influence over crucial technology. Chinese policymakers increasingly believe they cannot bear the risk.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Additional reporting by Nian Liu in Beijing</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The article was updated on January 22.

Owners of business-to-consumer (B2C) titles are having to compete with the abundance of information that can be found online for free. Meanwhile, business-tobusiness (B2B) publications have faced a downturn in demand from advertisers. And can you blame them? In an age of 1.2bn Google users it's hardly surprising that companies have less desire to advertise via printed publications, which might reach a subscriber base of just 40,000 people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Advertising agencies have also been feeling the heat from changing marketing trends or what WPP's (WPP) founder and chief executive, Martin Sorrell, calls \"simultaneous discombobulating factors\". His company's shares took a 29 per cent dive in 2017 as lower corporate marketing spend caused like-for-like revenues to switch from a 0.2 per cent rise in the first quarter of the year to a 2 per cent decline in the third quarter. Worryingly, it's a trend that looks unlikely to let up, as the ease and appeal of advertising on Facebook and Google means businesses become less reliant on traditional agencies.</p><p>Meanwhile, price comparison websites are facing a Google-shaped problem of their own.

European regulators have already fined Google $2.7bn (\u00a32bn) for promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results, while Australia's competition authority recently launched an investigation into the market power of Facebook and Google. In the US, the Democrats want to alter antitrust laws to reduce the seemingly unassailable dominance of the tech groups and the Republican government could soon be under pressure to follow suit.</p><p>But until regulatory changes kick in, the best publishers can do is minimise their reliance on advertising revenues. It's a strategy that has worked well for Anglo-Dutch publishing giant Relx (RELX), which now receives just 10 per cent of its revenue from print.</p><p>Ascential (ASCL) and UBM (UBM) have also refocused in recent years and are now strictly events businesses with the opportunity to keep adding new festivals to their portfolio. The latter has recently entered merger talks with publishing peer Informa (INF) which, after extensive portfolio trimming in recent years, now wants to grow its events business.</p><p>'Owners of business-toconsumer titles are having to compete with the abundance of information that can be found online for free' Not all publishers have successfully reduced their dependence on print. After many years of strategic overhauls, profit warnings and re-planning, Pearson (PSON) is still trying to turn digital. And it appears to be selling a lot of assets to fund that strategy. Recently, the group disposed of language learning business Wall Street English (including its $150m cash pile) for a measly $300m to a consortium of funds. Management at Euromoney Institutional Investor (ERM) also appears trapped in a disposal spiral. The company described the recent sale of the Institutional Investor journals as, \"in line with Euromoney's strategy\u2026 to sell certain businesses which do not align with its strategy\".</p><p>By contrast, price comparison websites are trying to bulk up, as scale matters in the fight for customers. Property specialist ZPG recently tried to buy insurance-focused GoCompare (GOCO), while Moneysupermarket continues to diversify away from the energy market. MB Favourite High-quality Relx is a firm favourite in the media and publishing space. The group offers investors reliable, long-term top-line growth, a return on capital employed that routinely exceeds 20 per cent and a generous share buyback policy. Plus, in its risk management and business analytics division, it boasts the UK's biggest tech company. This business owns an enormous backlog of data on everything from insurance and healthcare to crime and transport and its advanced analytics software is being used by an increasing number of corporations, public bodies and government agencies.</p><p>Outsiders Pearson and Euromoney remain on the back foot. Although management at both companies seems set on turning digital, we fear it's too little too late. The expensive digitisation plans management have in place will be increasingly difficult to fund considering the continued decline in profits.</p><p/><p>'Owners of business-toconsumer titles are having to compete with the abundance of information that can be found online for free'</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVSTR-133934598</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVSTR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RGX-MPJ1-DY9P-N0JX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"831\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investors Chronicle - magazine and web content</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59206\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 26, 2018</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The federal government will also no longer regulate high-speed internet delivery as if it were a utility, like phone service.<br/> The critics say the move is against the interest of the consumers and favours big corporate companies.<br/> Pai and others in favour of the decision argued the deregulation of the internet would spur innovation, and that the Federal Trade Commission would have the authority to sue providers who abuse competition on the web.<br/> Yesterday's decision restores the longstanding, bipartisan light-touch regulatory framework that has fostered rapid Internet growth, openness, and freedom for nearly 20 years, the FCC said in a statement after the voting.<br/> Following detailed legal and economic analysis, as well as extensive examination of comments from consumers and stakeholders, the Commission reversed the FCC's 2015 heavy- handed utility-style regulation of broadband internet access service, which imposed substantial costs on the entire internet ecosystem, it said.<br/> In place of that heavy-handed framework, the FCC is returning to the traditional light-touch framework that was in place until 2015, it asserted.<br/> Moreover, the FCC also adopted robust transparency requirements that will empower consumers as well as facilitate effective government oversight of broadband providers conduct, it said.<br/> \"In particular, the FCC's action has restored the jurisdiction of the Federal Trade Commission to act when broadband providers engage in anticompetitive, unfair, or deceptive acts or practices,\" the federal commission said.<br/> It will take weeks for the repeal to go into effect, but the political and legal fight started immediately. Numerous Democrats called for a bill that would reestablish the rules, and several Democratic state attorneys general said they would file a suit to stop the change.<br/> Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said the FCC's radical, partisan decision to dismantle net neutrality \"strikes a stunning blow\" to the promise of a free and open internet.<br/> \"With this unjustified and blatant giveaway to big providers, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai is proving himself an eager executor of the <person><nameText>Trump Administration's </nameText></person>anti-consumer, anti- competition agenda,\" she said.<br/> Pelosi alleged that FCC's rule change process was marked by haste, secrecy and technical flaws from the start.<br/> \"This arbitrary decision was made without a single public hearing and over the firm opposition of Internet experts and technologists,\" she said.<br/> \"It is deeply disturbing that Pai's FCC has refused to take action to combat the threat of identity theft and fake comments in the agency record, and has refused to comply with FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) requests or requests for information from the New York Attorney General's Investigation,\" Pelosi said.<br/> Several public interest groups including Public Knowledge and the National Hispanic Media Coalition also promised to file a suit. The Internet Association, the trade group that represents big tech firms such as Google and Facebook, said it also was considering legal action.<br/> \"The Internet industry opposes Chairman Pai's repeal of the 2015 Open Internet Order,\" Michael Beckerman, president and CEO of the Internet Association, a trade group representing Amazon, Facebook, Google and other tech companies, said in a statement.<br/> \"Relying on ISPs (Internet service providers) to live up to their own 'promises' is not net neutrality and is bad for consumers.\"<br/> \"The fight isn't over. Internet Association is currently weighing our legal options in a lawsuit against today's order, and remains open to Congress enshrining strong, enforceable net neutrality protections into law.\"<br/>Netflix ripped the FCC's decision to repeal net neutrality rules, calling it \"misguided\".<br/> \"This is the beginning of a longer legal battle. Netflix stands w/ innovators, large &amp; small, to oppose this misguided FCC order,\" the company tweeted shortly after the FCC voted on the measure.<br/> \"The @FCC's vote to gut #NetNeutrality rules is a body blow to innovation and free expression. We will continue our fight to defend the open internet and reverse this misguided decision,\" Twitter Public Policy said in a tweet.<br/> Pai defended the repeal before the vote, saying the rollback of the rules would eventually benefit consumers because broadband providers like AT&amp;T and Comcast could offer them a wider variety of service options.<br/>New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, said in a statement he will lead a multi-state lawsuit to challenge the reversal.<br/>  House Speaker Paul Ryan welcomed the decision.<br/>  \"Despite its unassuming name, the <person><nameText>Obama administration's </nameText></person>net neutrality regulation threatens the free and open Internet that has done so much to advance modern society,\" he said.<br/>  The <person><nameText>Trump administration's </nameText></person>action to roll back this egregious government overreach into the most innovative space will benefit all users of the internet, he said.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n10298100</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5R6V-7T91-DYDW-701T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"931\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 FFC Information Solution All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 18, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Administrative Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0E1NTA1MzYyNkNENDIxQThFQTI0QkE2ODhDMERFMTg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTE1NDcxOEVFQ0ZGNDVGREIyN0YyMDNDQzdDRDJDMjk</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjRGMDAxMUNFODk5NDRENEEzMDk0QjVCQjNCRjQwNTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QTg4OUFCMTE4QkE1NDYxMTg2ODRDRDc4MEExRDg5MTY</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

The Internet Association, the trade group that represents big tech firms such as Google and Facebook, said it also was considering legal action.</p><p>\"The Internet industry opposes Chairman Pai's repeal of the 2015 Open Internet Order,\" Michael Beckerman, president and CEO of the Internet Association, a trade group representing Amazon, Facebook, Google and other tech companies, said in a statement.</p><p>\"Relying on ISPs (Internet service providers) to live up to their own 'promises' is not net neutrality and is bad for consumers.\"</p><p>\"The fight isn't over. Internet Association is currently weighing our legal options in a lawsuit against today's order, and remains open to Congress enshrining strong, enforceable net neutrality protections into law.\"</p><p>Netflix ripped the FCC's decision to repeal net neutrality rules, calling it \"misguided\".</p><p>\"This is the beginning of a longer legal battle. Netflix stands w/ innovators, large &amp; small, to oppose this misguided FCC order,\" the company tweeted shortly after the FCC voted on the measure.</p><p>\"The @FCC's vote to gut #NetNeutrality rules is a body blow to innovation and free expression. We will continue our fight to defend the open internet and reverse this misguided decision,\" Twitter Public Policy said in a tweet.</p><p>Pai defended the repeal before the vote, saying the rollback of the rules would eventually benefit consumers because broadband providers like AT&amp;T and Comcast could offer them a wider variety of service options.</p><p>New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, a Democrat, said in a statement he will lead a multi-state lawsuit to challenge the reversal.</p><p>House Speaker Paul Ryan welcomed the decision.</p><p>\"Despite its unassuming name, the Obama administration's net neutrality regulation threatens the free and open Internet that has done so much to advance modern society,\" he said.</p><p>The Trump administration's action to roll back this egregious government overreach into the most innovative space will benefit all users of the internet, he said.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from MetroVaartha English.

Beyond the committee's multiple hearings on the matter, tech companies have been subject to heightened scrutiny from lawmakers across the federal government for antitrust and privacy concerns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The digital sector is a rapidly evolving and dynamic environment in which competition is vigorous,\" Matt Perault, head of global policy development at Facebook, said in prepared testimony.</p><p>When the committee announced the multipart investigation in June, committee leaders said the investigation would focus on documenting competition problems in digital markets; assessing if \"dominant\" firms are engaging in anti-competitive conduct; and examining whether current antitrust laws, competition policies and enforcement are sufficient.</p><p>Much of the testimony from large tech company representatives centered on the idea that there is not an antitrust problem that needs solving.</p><p>\"Beyond competition from emerging firms, we compete against other large tech firms in a wide range of business activities,\" said Adam Cohen, director of economic policy at Google, in prepared testimony. \"Competition extends across many existing and developing fields: operating systems, mobile devices and applications, voice assistants, artificial intelligence and machine learning, virtual reality, enterprise services, cloud computing, office applications, digital advertising, mobile, video sharing, and much more.\"</p><p>Facebook's Perault, meanwhile, said the company's advertising platform not only has not harmed smaller companies but has actually benefited them.</p><p>\"Today, more than 92% of advertising happens off Facebook,\" he said in prepared testimony. \"Our advertising services have enabled small and medium-sized businesses to grow, create jobs and more effectively compete with larger companies, leading to more choice and better products for consumers.\"</p><p>A February report from the market research company eMarketer found that Facebook accounted for 21.8% of total digital ad spending in 2018.</p><p>Nate Sutton, who works as associate general counsel for litigation and regulatory matters at Amazon, attempted to quell concerns that as a retailer, Amazon is harming sales at brick and mortar stores.</p><p>\"Online is just one of many ways consumers shop for products   studies demonstrate that most consumers buy, and most sellers sell, in and from multiple locations both online and offline,\" he said in prepared testimony. \"In fact, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the vast majority of retail sales   90%   still occur in physical stores.\"</p><p>Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., the chair of the subcommittee hosting the hearing, was skeptical of Amazon's claims.</p><p>\"Despite statements from the company that it only captures a small percentage of retail in the United States, the reality is that half of American families have an Amazon Prime account   up from only 35% just three years ago   and Amazon's closest competitor, eBay Inc., controls less than 6% of the market for online commerce,\" Cicilline said in prepared testimony.</p><p>Cicilline did not call for additional legislation or regulation in his opening remarks, though he has previously said that \"it is vital for Congress to step in to determine whether existing laws are adequate to tackle abusive conduct by platform gatekeepers or if we need new legislation.\"</p><p>Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., the top Republican on the subcommittee, was far more skeptical of antitrust concerns than his Democratic colleague, however.</p><p>\"The most innovative, successful, and competitive companies often become very big   not through anti-competitive conduct, or violations of antitrust laws, but simply by providing a better service or product than the other companies in the marketplace,\" he said. \"We should not rush to amend the antitrust laws or break up companies based on false notions that being big is inherently bad or that everything a big company does should be presumed to be anticompetitive.\"</p><p>The hearing comes at a time of mounting political pressure for the major tech companies. Elizabeth Warren, a senator from Massachusetts and Democratic candidate for the 2020 U.S. presidential election, unveiled a proposal earlier this year that called for unwinding previously approved mergers from Facebook, Amazon and Google. Other Democratic presidential candidates have put forward their own plans for regulating big tech, while several Republicans have called for a regulatory crackdown on the companies over concerns about censorship and political bias.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNLKMC-52902669</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNLKMC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WKW-4CK1-JDVW-N269-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">360279</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"821\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 SNL Financial LC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SNL Kagan Media &amp;

Alphabet fell back nearly 5 per cent after quarterly sales fell for the first time in its 16 years as a public company.</p><p>The surge in the stock prices of Amazon, Facebook and Amazon sent the tech-heavy Nasdaq to near record highs and set the S&amp;P 500 on course for its fourth straight monthly gain.</p><p>Jubilant investors pushed the collective market value of the big four through the $5 trillion barrier. But for critics, the bumper profits will strengthen arguments that they should be more tightly regulated to prevent them from extracting ever greater profits from their roles as digital gatekeepers.</p><p>The day before delivering their stellar earnings, the chief executives of the four spent five hours battling policymakers in Washington, who accused them of abusing their dominant positions to squash rivals. The grilling coincided with grim figures showing that the US economy shrank by 9.5 per cent in the second quarter.</p><p>In stark contrast, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google increased profits by delivering essential goods and services and entertainment to housebound consumers.</p><p>Amazon's revenues rose 40 per cent in the period to $88.9 billion and its profits doubled to $5.2 billion, even after investing $4 billion in its distribution network and warehouse to make the Covid secure.</p><p>Analysts at Jefferies, the Wall Street broker, said the turnover figure was \"just crazy\", noting that Amazon generated more revenue in the second quarter than in the fourth, which includes the lucrative Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. Apple defied gloomy Wall Street forecasts with strong iPhone sales, helping it post record third-quarter results. The company reported revenue of $59.69 billion and profit of $2.58 per share in the three months to June 2 despite Covid-19 forcing it to shut many of its stores worldwide.</p><p>Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, admitted that the results stood in \"stark relief during a time of real economic adversity for businesses large and small, and certainly for families\".</p><p>Analysts at Baird, the broker, raised their annual revenue target for Apple by $10 billion to $275 billion, predicting strong sales of Mac computers and iPads as students return to schools and universities in September. It said Apple was \"well within reach\" of its target to have 600 million subscriptions to services such as music, cloud storage and TV streaming by the end of September.</p><p>Traders said Apple's four-for-one share split was an invitation to small investors to buy its stock. The company is expected to receive a further income boost when it launches 5G-enabled iPhones later this year.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, founder and chief executive at Facebook, used his call with Wall Street analysts to make a case for maintaining the regulatory status quo. More restrictions would \"reduce opportunities for small businesses so much that it would probably be felt at a macroeconomic level\". He asked: \"Is that really what policymakers want in the middle of pandemic and recession?\" Alphabet's revenues fell 2 per cent to $38.2 billion as advertisers reined in spending, yet it still delivered $7 billion in profits. Sundar Pichai, 48, chief executive, said the company would \"adapt\" to possible changes in regulation.</p><p>Earnings fuel drive for reform Analysis Silicon Valley's top executives spent most of Wednesday rebutting accusations that they wield too much power. It took less 24 hours for their claims to be undercut (Simon Duke writes).</p><p>Apple, Amazon and Facebook shredded Wall Street forecasts with second-quarter results that underlined their ability to mine profits in fair economic conditions and foul.</p><p>Yes, Google delivered its first ever quarterly revenue decline. Yet it was still able to report underlying profits of $7 billion.</p><p>Apple, the iPhone maker, is an even more formidable money-making machine. Housebound consumers loaded up with new Apple gadgets, generating enough cashflow for the company to return $21 billion to stockholders between April and June. That's enough to buy the online grocer Ocado or the defence group BAE Systems.</p><p>Amazon was not to be outdone. The ecommerce giant doubled its profits to more than $5 billion even after spending $4 billion to hire more staff and make its warehouses safer.</p><p>The bumper earnings will add fuel to the debate over Silicon Valley. Are the big tech companies, as they argue, all-American heroes who are being rightly rewarded for their creativity and daring? Or are they the robber barons of the 21st century, who gouge profits from customers and can squash a rival with a tweak to their algorithm? Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, left, acknowledged that its outsized earnings stood in \"stark relief\" to the pain suffered by so many \"during a time of real economic adversity\". There wasn't a flicker of contrition from Mark Zuckerberg: Facebook's founder argued that curbs on his company would reduce choice for advertisers and hurt the economy.</p><p>Even if Democratic policymakers achieve their aim of further regulation, there is no consensus on how to limit the powers and level the playing field for upstarts. Until there is agreement, the big four will continue to churn out monopoly profits.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-162018870</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GN-R6M1-JCBW-N51W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"932\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 1, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Alphabet fell back nearly 5 per cent after quarterly sales fell for the first time in its 16 years as a public company.</p><p>The surge in the stock prices of Amazon, Facebook and Amazon sent the tech-heavy Nasdaq to near record highs and set the S&amp;P 500 on course for its fourth straight monthly gain.</p><p>Jubilant investors pushed the collective market value of the big four through the $5 trillion barrier. But for critics, the bumper profits will strengthen arguments that they should be more tightly regulated to prevent them from extracting ever greater profits from their roles as digital gatekeepers.</p><p>The day before delivering their stellar earnings, the chief executives of the four spent five hours battling policymakers in Washington, who accused them of abusing their dominant positions to squash rivals. The grilling coincided with grim figures showing that the US economy shrank by 9.5 per cent in the second quarter.</p><p>In stark contrast, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google increased profits by delivering essential goods and services and entertainment to housebound consumers.</p><p>Amazon's revenues rose 40 per cent in the period to $88.9 billion and its profits doubled to $5.2 billion, even after investing $4 billion in its distribution network and warehouse to make the Covid secure.</p><p>Analysts at Jefferies, the Wall Street broker, said the turnover figure was \"just crazy\", noting that Amazon generated more revenue in the second quarter than in the fourth, which includes the lucrative Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. Apple defied gloomy Wall Street forecasts with strong iPhone sales, helping it post record third-quarter results. The company reported revenue of $59.69 billion and profit of $2.58 per share in the three months to June 2 despite Covid-19 forcing it to shut many of its stores worldwide.</p><p>Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, admitted that the results stood in \"stark relief during a time of real economic adversity for businesses large and small, and certainly for families\".</p><p>Analysts at Baird, the broker, raised their annual revenue target for Apple by $10 billion to $275 billion, predicting strong sales of Mac computers and iPads as students return to schools and universities in September. It said Apple was \"well within reach\" of its target to have 600 million subscriptions to services such as music, cloud storage and TV streaming by the end of September.</p><p>Traders said Apple's four-for-one share split was an invitation to small investors to buy its stock. The company is expected to receive a further income boost when it launches 5G-enabled iPhones later this year.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, founder and chief executive at Facebook, used his call with Wall Street analysts to make a case for maintaining the regulatory status quo. More restrictions would \"reduce opportunities for small businesses so much that it would probably be felt at a macroeconomic level\". He asked: \"Is that really what policymakers want in the middle of pandemic and recession?\" Alphabet's revenues fell 2 per cent to $38.2 billion as advertisers reined in spending, yet it still delivered $7 billion in profits. Sundar Pichai, 48, chief executive, said the company would \"adapt\" to possible changes in regulation.</p><p>Earnings fuel drive for reform Analysis Silicon Valley's top executives spent most of Wednesday rebutting accusations that they wield too much power. It took less 24 hours for their claims to be undercut (Simon Duke writes).</p><p>Apple, Amazon and Facebook shredded Wall Street forecasts with second-quarter results that underlined their ability to mine profits in fair economic conditions and foul.</p><p>Yes, Google delivered its first ever quarterly revenue decline. Yet it was still able to report underlying profits of $7 billion.</p><p>Apple, the iPhone maker, is an even more formidable money-making machine. Housebound consumers loaded up with new Apple gadgets, generating enough cashflow for the company to return $21 billion to stockholders between April and June. That's enough to buy the online grocer Ocado or the defence group BAE Systems.</p><p>Amazon was not to be outdone. The ecommerce giant doubled its profits to more than $5 billion even after spending $4 billion to hire more staff and make its warehouses safer.</p><p>The bumper earnings will add fuel to the debate over Silicon Valley. Are the big tech companies, as they argue, all-American heroes who are being rightly rewarded for their creativity and daring? Or are they the robber barons of the 21st century, who gouge profits from customers and can squash a rival with a tweak to their algorithm? Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, left, acknowledged that its outsized earnings stood in \"stark relief\" to the pain suffered by so many \"during a time of real economic adversity\". There wasn't a flicker of contrition from Mark Zuckerberg: Facebook's founder argued that curbs on his company would reduce choice for advertisers and hurt the economy.</p><p>Even if Democratic policymakers achieve their aim of further regulation, there is no consensus on how to limit the powers and level the playing field for upstarts. Until there is agreement, the big four will continue to churn out monopoly profits.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-162015031</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GN-R6N1-JCBW-N050-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"932\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 1, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But for critics, the bumper profits will strengthen arguments that they </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/googles-parent-alphabet-reports-sales-fall-for-first-time-in-history-kkpgxtgwv\">should be more tightly regulated</url></p><p> to prevent them from extracting ever greater profits from their roles as digital gatekeepers.</p><p>The day before delivering their stellar earnings, the chief executives of the four spent five hours battling policymakers in Washington, who accused them of abusing their dominant positions to squash rivals. The grilling coincided with grim figures showing that the US economy shrank by 9.5 per cent in the second quarter.</p><p>In stark contrast, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google increased profits by delivering essential goods and services and entertainment to housebound consumers.</p><p>Amazon's </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/googles-parent-alphabet-reports-sales-fall-for-first-time-in-history-kkpgxtgwv\">revenues rose 40 per cen</url></p><p>t in the period to $88.9 billion and its profits doubled to $5.2 billion, even after investing $4 billion in its distribution network and warehouse to make the Covid secure.</p><p>Analysts at Jefferies, the Wall Street broker, said the turnover figure was \"just crazy\", noting that Amazon generated more revenue in the second quarter than in the fourth, which includes the lucrative Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.</p><p>Apple defied gloomy Wall Street forecasts </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/googles-parent-alphabet-reports-sales-fall-for-first-time-in-history-kkpgxtgwv\">with strong iPhone sales</url></p><p>, helping, helping it post record third-quarter results. The company reported revenue of $59.69 billion and profit of $2.58 per share in the three months to June 2 despite Covid-19 forcing it to shut many of its stores worldwide.</p><p>Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, admitted that the results stood in \"stark relief during a time of real economic adversity for businesses large and small, and certainly for families\".</p><p>Analysts at Baird, the broker, raised their annual revenue target for Apple by $10 billion to $275 billion, predicting strong sales of Mac computers and iPads as students return to schools and universities in September. It said Apple was \"well within reach\" of its target to have 600 million subscriptions to services such as music, cloud storage and TV streaming by the end of September.</p><p>Traders said Apple's four-for-one share split was an invitation to small investors to buy its stock. The company is expected to receive a further income boost when it launches 5G-enabled iPhones later this year.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, founder and chief executive at Facebook, used his call with Wall Street analysts to make a case for maintaining the regulatory status quo. More restrictions would \"reduce opportunities for small businesses so much that it would probably be felt at a macroeconomic level\". He asked: \"Is that really what policymakers want in the middle of pandemic and recession?\"</p><p>Alphabet's revenues fell 2 per cent to $38.2 billion as advertisers reined in spending, yet it still delivered $7 billion in profits. Sundar Pichai, 48, chief executive, said the company would \"adapt\" to possible changes in regulation.</p><p>                   Results fuel drive for reform                   Analysis                   </p><p>Silicon Valley's top executives spent most of Wednesday rebutting accusations that they wield too much power. It took less 24 hours for their claims to be undercut.</p><p>Apple, Amazon and Facebook shredded Wall Street forecasts with second-quarter results that underlined their ability to mine profits in fair economic conditions and foul.</p><p>Yes, Google delivered its first ever quarterly revenue decline. Yet it was still able to report underlying profits of $7 billion.</p><p>Apple, the iPhone maker, is an even more formidable money-making machine. Housebound consumers loaded up with new Apple gadgets, generating enough cashflow for the company to return $21 billion to stockholders between April and June. That's enough to buy the online grocer Ocado or the defence group BAE Systems.</p><p>Amazon was not to be outdone. The ecommerce giant doubled its profits to more than $5 billion even after spending $4 billion to hire more staff and make its warehouses safer.</p><p>The bumper earnings will add fuel to the debate over Silicon Valley. Are the big tech companies, as they argue, all-American heroes who are being rightly rewarded for their creativity and daring? Or are they the robber barons of the 21st century, who gouge profits from customers and can squash a rival with a tweak to their algorithm?</p><p>Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, left, acknowledged that its outsized earnings stood in \"stark relief\" to the pain suffered by so many \"during a time of real economic adversity\". There wasn't a flicker of contrition from Mark Zuckerberg: Facebook's founder argued that curbs on his company would reduce choice for advertisers and hurt the economy.</p><p>Even if Democratic policymakers achieve their aim of further regulation, there is no consensus on how to limit the powers and level the playing field for upstarts. Until there is agreement, the big four will continue to churn out monopoly profits.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-64884527</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GM-X1C1-F021-63K0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"937\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 1, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Alphabet fell back 3 per cent after quarterly sales fell for the first time in its 16 years as a public company.</p><p>The surge in the stock prices of Amazon, Facebook and Amazon sent the tech-heavy Nasdaq to near record highs and set the S&amp;P 500 on course for its fourth straight monthly gain.</p><p>Jubilant investors pushed the collective market value of the big four through the $5 trillion barrier. But for critics, the bumper profits will strengthen arguments that they should be more tightly regulated to prevent them from extracting ever greater profits from their roles as digital gatekeepers.</p><p>The day before delivering their stellar earnings, the chief executives of the four spent five hours battling policymakers in Washington, who accused them of abusing their dominant positions to squash rivals. The grilling coincided with grim figures showing that the US economy shrank by 9.5 per cent in the second quarter.</p><p>In stark contrast, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google increased profits by delivering essential goods and services and entertainment to housebound consumers.</p><p>Amazon's revenues rose 40 per cent in the period to $88.9 billion and its profits doubled to $5.2 billion, even after investing $4 billion in its distribution network and warehouse to make the Covid secure.</p><p>Analysts at Jefferies, the Wall Street broker, said the turnover figure was \"just crazy\", noting that Amazon generated more revenue in the second quarter than in the fourth, which includes the lucrative Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. Apple defied gloomy Wall Street forecasts with strong iPhone sales, helping it post record third-quarter results. The company reported revenue of $59.69 billion and profit of $2.58 per share in the three months to June 2 despite Covid-19 forcing it to shut many of its stores worldwide.</p><p>Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, admitted that the results stood in \"stark relief during a time of real economic adversity for businesses large and small, and certainly for families\".</p><p>Analysts at Baird, the broker, raised their annual revenue target for Apple by $10 billion to $275 billion, predicting strong sales of Mac computers and iPads as students return to schools and universities in September. It said Apple was \"well within reach\" of its target to have 600 million subscriptions to services such as music, cloud storage and TV streaming by the end of September.</p><p>Traders said Apple's four-for-one share split was an invitation to small investors to buy its stock. The company is expected to receive a further income boost when it launches 5G-enabled iPhones later this year.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, founder and chief executive at Facebook, used his call with Wall Street analysts to make a case for maintaining the regulatory status quo. More restrictions would \"reduce opportunities for small businesses so much that it would probably be felt at a macroeconomic level\". He asked: \"Is that really what policymakers want in the middle of pandemic and recession?\" Alphabet's revenues fell 2 per cent to $38.2 billion as advertisers reined in spending, yet it still delivered $7 billion in profits. Sundar Pichai, 48, chief executive, said the company would \"adapt\" to possible changes in regulation.</p><p>Earnings fuel drive for reform Analysis Silicon Valley's top executives spent most of Wednesday rebutting accusations that they wield too much power. It took less 24 hours for their claims to be undercut (Simon Duke writes).</p><p>Apple, Amazon and Facebook shredded Wall Street forecasts with second-quarter results that underlined their ability to mine profits in fair economic conditions and foul.</p><p>Yes, Google delivered its first ever quarterly revenue decline. Yet it was still able to report underlying profits of $7 billion.</p><p>Apple, the iPhone maker, is an even more formidable money-making machine. Housebound consumers loaded up with new Apple gadgets, generating enough cashflow for the company to return $21 billion to stockholders between April and June. That's enough to buy the online grocer Ocado or the defence group BAE Systems.</p><p>Amazon was not to be outdone. The ecommerce giant doubled its profits to more than $5 billion even after spending $4 billion to hire more staff and make its warehouses safer.</p><p>The bumper earnings will add fuel to the debate over Silicon Valley. Are the big tech companies, as they argue, all-American heroes who are being rightly rewarded for their creativity and daring? Or are they the robber barons of the 21st century, who gouge profits from customers and can squash a rival with a tweak to their algorithm? Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, left, acknowledged that its outsized earnings stood in \"stark relief\" to the pain suffered by so many \"during a time of real economic adversity\". There wasn't a flicker of contrition from Mark Zuckerberg: Facebook's founder argued that curbs on his company would reduce choice for advertisers and hurt the economy.</p><p>Even if Democratic policymakers achieve their aim of further regulation, there is no consensus on how to limit the powers and level the playing field for upstarts. Until there is agreement, the big four will continue to churn out monopoly profits.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-162018461</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GN-R6N1-JCBW-N0P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"930\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Scotland</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 1, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Alphabet fell back 3 per cent after quarterly sales fell for the first time in its 16 years as a public company.</p><p>The surge in the stock prices of Amazon, Facebook and Amazon sent the tech-heavy Nasdaq to near record highs and set the S&amp;P 500 on course for its fourth straight monthly gain.</p><p>Jubilant investors pushed the collective market value of the big four through the $5 trillion barrier. But for critics, the bumper profits will strengthen arguments that they should be more tightly regulated to prevent them from extracting ever greater profits from their roles as digital gatekeepers.</p><p>The day before delivering their stellar earnings, the chief executives of the four spent five hours battling policymakers in Washington, who accused them of abusing their dominant positions to squash rivals. The grilling coincided with grim figures showing that the US economy shrank by 9.5 per cent in the second quarter.</p><p>In stark contrast, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google increased profits by delivering essential goods and services and entertainment to housebound consumers.</p><p>Amazon's revenues rose 40 per cent in the period to $88.9 billion and its profits doubled to $5.2 billion, even after investing $4 billion in its distribution network and warehouse to make the Covid secure.</p><p>Analysts at Jefferies, the Wall Street broker, said the turnover figure was \"just crazy\", noting that Amazon generated more revenue in the second quarter than in the fourth, which includes the lucrative Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. Apple defied gloomy Wall Street forecasts with strong iPhone sales, helping it post record third-quarter results. The company reported revenue of $59.69 billion and profit of $2.58 per share in the three months to June 2 despite Covid-19 forcing it to shut many of its stores worldwide.</p><p>Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, admitted that the results stood in \"stark relief during a time of real economic adversity for businesses large and small, and certainly for families\".</p><p>Analysts at Baird, the broker, raised their annual revenue target for Apple by $10 billion to $275 billion, predicting strong sales of Mac computers and iPads as students return to schools and universities in September. It said Apple was \"well within reach\" of its target to have 600 million subscriptions to services such as music, cloud storage and TV streaming by the end of September.</p><p>Traders said Apple's four-for-one share split was an invitation to small investors to buy its stock. The company is expected to receive a further income boost when it launches 5G-enabled iPhones later this year.</p><p>Mark Zuckerberg, founder and chief executive at Facebook, used his call with Wall Street analysts to make a case for maintaining the regulatory status quo. More restrictions would \"reduce opportunities for small businesses so much that it would probably be felt at a macroeconomic level\". He asked: \"Is that really what policymakers want in the middle of pandemic and recession?\" Alphabet's revenues fell 2 per cent to $38.2 billion as advertisers reined in spending, yet it still delivered $7 billion in profits. Sundar Pichai, 48, chief executive, said the company would \"adapt\" to possible changes in regulation.</p><p>Earnings fuel drive for reform Analysis Silicon Valley's top executives spent most of Wednesday rebutting accusations that they wield too much power. It took less 24 hours for their claims to be undercut (Simon Duke writes).</p><p>Apple, Amazon and Facebook shredded Wall Street forecasts with second-quarter results that underlined their ability to mine profits in fair economic conditions and foul.</p><p>Yes, Google delivered its first ever quarterly revenue decline. Yet it was still able to report underlying profits of $7 billion.</p><p>Apple, the iPhone maker, is an even more formidable money-making machine. Housebound consumers loaded up with new Apple gadgets, generating enough cashflow for the company to return $21 billion to stockholders between April and June. That's enough to buy the online grocer Ocado or the defence group BAE Systems.</p><p>Amazon was not to be outdone. The ecommerce giant doubled its profits to more than $5 billion even after spending $4 billion to hire more staff and make its warehouses safer.</p><p>The bumper earnings will add fuel to the debate over Silicon Valley. Are the big tech companies, as they argue, all-American heroes who are being rightly rewarded for their creativity and daring? Or are they the robber barons of the 21st century, who gouge profits from customers and can squash a rival with a tweak to their algorithm? Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive, left, acknowledged that its outsized earnings stood in \"stark relief\" to the pain suffered by so many \"during a time of real economic adversity\". There wasn't a flicker of contrition from Mark Zuckerberg: Facebook's founder argued that curbs on his company would reduce choice for advertisers and hurt the economy.</p><p>Even if Democratic policymakers achieve their aim of further regulation, there is no consensus on how to limit the powers and level the playing field for upstarts. Until there is agreement, the big four will continue to churn out monopoly profits.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMES-162021136</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60GN-R6N1-JCBW-N07X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10939</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"930\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30374\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 2, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 1, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Two years later, she found herself facing a moral dilemma.Clarifai was developing aerial photography and object detection tools as one of several companies working on Project Maven, a Pentagon drone surveillance program. After several conversations with friends and colleagues, O'Sullivan realized this type of technology eventually could be used for autonomous weapons.In January, she wrote to Clarifai CEO Matt Zeiler on behalf of a group of employees, seeking clarification on whether the technology would be used to create weapons and asking him to commit to a series of ethical measures. Zeiler later explained at a meeting that Clarifai likely would provide tech for autonomous weapons. </p><p>O'Sullivan quit the next day.'I was very surprised and had to follow my conscience,' she said. Zeiler and Clarifai did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. In a 2018 blog, Zeiler defended Clarifai's involvement in Project Maven, saying it aligned with the company's mission of accelerating human progress with continually improving AI.O'Sullivan, 34, considers herself part of a 'growing backlash against unethical tech,' a groundswell in the past two years in which U.S. tech employees have tried to remake the industry from the inside out \u2014 pushing for more control over how their work is used and urging better conditions, job security and wages for affiliated workers.While some speak out and others sign petitions and attend rallies, workers are collectively taking action like never before:Advertising\u2014 Amazon and Microsoft employees demanded the companies stop providing services to software company Palantir, which provides technology to federal agencies including Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the U.S. Army.\u2014 Amazon employees also have urged the company to transition to renewable energy and confronted CEO Jeff Bezos at a shareholder meeting.\u2014 Following last year's walkouts over Google's handling of sexual misconduct cases, employees signed a letter protesting Project Dragonfly, a search engine that would comply with Chinese censorship.\u2014 Staff at Salesforce, Microsoft and Google have protested their companies' ties to Customs and Border Protection, ICE and the military.Despite six-figure salaries and unlimited vacation time, many tech workers are questioning the effects of their work and joining forces with their more precarious blue-collar, service and contract-worker counterparts, pressing for better work conditions and pay.'It's unprecedented, both the magnitude of the power of these companies and the willingness of white-collar employees to shake themselves of the privilege that they have and to really see the impact of the work they're doing,' said Veena Dubal, a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law who has interviewed dozens of tech workers involved in organizing.AdvertisingThey're feeling emboldened because of national and global 'existential crises' and the realization that tech companies 'have more power than any multinational corporation has had in a long time,' Dubal said.The phenomenon is particularly strong in the San Francisco Bay Area, home to Salesforce, Google and Palantir, among others. The bastion of activism and progressive culture has been hit hard by the tech boom's housing affordability crisis.'There's a lot of power (that) people are being asked to build for the shareholders of these companies and the management of these companies,' said Ian Busher, 28, a former contract analyst for Google and an organizer with the Bay Area chapter of Democratic Socialists of America. 'If you want to make the world a better place, you should exercise judgment and democracy with the people you're working with to build these tools.' Facebook and Palantir did not respond to requests for comment.An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment on employee activism but noted the Seattle-based company is committed to sustainability and said it provides good pay and benefits and humane conditions at its warehouses. At the stakeholder meeting, Bezos didn't directly address employees' renewable energy demands but referred to some sustainability efforts already underway.A Microsoft spokesperson said the company, headquartered in the Seattle area, appreciates employee feedback, respects differing views and provides 'many avenues for all voices to be heard.'A Google spokesperson did not comment on specific incidents but emphasized that retaliation is prohibited and pointed to CEO Sundar Pichai's previous statements on worker dissent. 'There are many things good about giving employees a lot of voice,' he said at a November conference. 'There are decisions we make which they may not agree with.'Congress has begun to aggressively scrutinize the industry in recent years, and the Justice Department last month launched an investigation into big tech companies amid antitrust allegations. A recent Pew Research Center survey indicated Americans have an increasingly negative view of tech's effect on the country.'As an employee in the tech sector right now, there is a fair bit of guilt or (asking), 'What is my responsibility?'' said Kellie McElhaney, a professor at the Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley. Most Read Business Stories Amr Gaber, 32, a Google engineer, was among several tech workers at a July demonstration in front of Facebook's San Francisco office supporting cafeteria workers seeking a new contract. He said although the white-collar workers are more privileged, they're all working people.'Our fortunes are tied together,' Gaber said. 'If the (companies) can't even treat the people who work for them well, then how can we expect them to have a positive impact on society?'There's evidence companies are listening.Google and Facebook pledged to pay contract workers better and provide some benefits. Google ended forced arbitration for sexual misconduct cases after its employees walked out. Following employee outcry, Google declined to renew its contract with the Pentagon for work on Project Maven.AdvertisingWhen employees asked Microsoft to cancel its contract with ICE, CEO Satya Nadella clarified that the company was not contributing to family separations at the border but supporting email, calendar and document systems.A Salesforce spokesperson said conversations with employees led the company to create the Office of Ethical and Humane Use of Technology and 'hire a chief ethical and humane use officer to develop guidelines and evaluate situations around the ethical use and development of our technology.'In the wake of concerns about tech's impact on the Bay Area housing crisis, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff this year gave $30 million to UC San Francisco to research homelessness, after donating $6 million to the city last year to help provide supportive housing for the formerly homeless. Pichai, Google's CEO, also pledged $1 billion to build 20,000 homes over a decade. Such responsiveness is good for business and for building trust with customers and employees who are more inclined to express their demands, according to McElhaney.'Those who are not responding are missing a huge ocean liner that's already left the dock,' she said.Still, some tech workers say the companies' efforts fall short. In some cases, employees have said they've seen or experienced retaliation after they or others have spoken out.'We say that tech workers have a lot of power, but tech executives have more,' said O'Sullivan, who quit on principle and now has a job at a young tech company pursuing transparency in the use of artificial intelligence.

The companies themselves haven't quite figured out how to deal with\u00a0the hand-wringing over their power coming from politicians, regulators, academics and\u00a0corporate enemies.This backlash is one of the most serious business risks for America's tech superpowers, and they need to develop a coherent message fast. I was surprised last week when Google executives seemed awkward addressing\u00a0analysts' questions about\u00a0regulatory investigations and data-privacy policies. At one point, Google CEO Sundar Pichai sounded as if he would have preferred to be trapped in Antarctic ice rather than tackle a query that touched on the company's move to combine\u00a0data from several of its web services to improve ad\u00a0targeting. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks.[1]Mind you, the company\u00a0first announced\u00a0in 2012\u00a0that it was starting to share user information among Google\u00a0services such as search and YouTube, and privacy watchdogs have howled about all\u00a0subsequent policy changes\u00a0that further\u00a0mingle its troves of user data. When Pichai was asked whether Google's ads are more effective because of this data sharing, he vaguely talked about respecting users' privacy and being 'thoughtful.' It's also possible European antitrust czars\u00a0might eventually force Google to change its popular\u00a0shopping ads\u00a0in search results or how it\u00a0distributes\u00a0apps\u00a0on Android phones. These changes could hurt Google financially, but Pichai and Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat either deflected questions on this or said Google would be fine if it had to stop bundling many of its apps on Android smartphones. (If that's true, then why does it strike deals to ensure a number of its apps are preinstalled on Android smartphones?) I don't want to overplay a few moments on an earnings conference call. But Google and the rest of the world's biggest tech companies now have problems everywhere. Thailand's king cracked down on Facebook because he was\u00a0unhappy with images\u00a0of himself. Canada's top court wants to\u00a0change how Google search results\u00a0are displayed globally. The U.S. Treasury secretary\u00a0hinted\u00a0on Wednesday that the administration might target how Amazon handles sales\u00a0taxes on products\u00a0sold by independent merchants\u00a0through its website.Big Tech needs to\u00a0learn how to competently discuss these issues with investors and the public. Somehow even the experience of the Edward Snowden intelligence leaks \u2014 to which the tech giants were slow to respond \u2014 didn't teach them a lesson. The tricky thing is that discomfort about the tech superpowers is amorphous. There's no single policy issue or piece of legislation\u00a0for the tech companies to rally around. It's all fragmented global issues stemming\u00a0from general mistrust of companies that touch so many aspects of people's lives. It's hard to have a coherent message\u00a0about such hard-to-grasp concepts. Nevertheless, tech companies need to do better. Backlash is the cost of being successful. Figure it out.

STR/AFP/Getty Images In April, reports emerged[1] that academics at MicrosoftResearch Asia in Beijing had collaborated on artificial intelligence research with individuals affiliated with China's National University of Defense Technology\u2014an institution under the direction of China's top military body, the Central Military Commission. Revelations about this AI collaboration came on the heels of other headlines: In February, Microsoft employees protested[2] a company contract with the U.S. Defense Department, and the following month, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff remarked[3] that big tech collaborations abroad may or may not help foreign governments. Companies incorporated in democratic countries will soon find themselves forced to draw lines on whether AI collaborations with entities in China and elsewhere are acceptable\u2014especially for those firms that balk at working with the U.S. military. Artificial intelligence research is largely open, meaning code, training data, and other related findings are frequently published online for anyone to access. </p><p>This research also depends heavily[4] on connections and interdependencies between companies and academic institutions in the United States and China\u2014and many of these collaborations are beneficial[5] for all parties involved. China's largest retailer has a partnership[6] with the Stanford AI Lab, for instance, to fund work in natural language processing, robotics, and a number of other research areas. Immense quantities of information flow across borders. But this makes it extremely difficult, if not altogether impossible, to control the diffusion of sensitive AI capabilities once they're openly released. Many artificial intelligence applications are also dual-use, with potential value in both military and civilian spaces. Facial recognition AI tools, for instance, may be used to identify customers in a store on the one hand and used to target drone strikes on the other. The dual-use nature of many AI applications makes it hard to differentiate a harmful AI application from one that is purely commercial or benign. This is why broad, sweeping export controls on artificial intelligence are a terrible idea[7]. But working with someone on artificial intelligence research is different because of the deeper insight it provides into a technology's design and implementation, and it's something U.S.-incorporated companies can and should control. Collaboration on AI research gives far better insight into developing technology and its implementation than just reading a paper or downloading code online. Put another way, working directly on AI research creates an implementation advantage. Techniques that underpin modern deep learning, for instance, have existed for decades[8], yet it was the implementation\u2014in this case, how to effectively train AI systems on the right hardware\u2014that constrained AI's progress. Implementation is similarly important to the U.S. Department of Defense: Google's Project Maven contract with the Pentagon was to help implement[9] AI tools that were already published openly. One could thus argue the collaboration didn't add much value, and its termination last year didn't change anything. Yet Defense Department officials still insist that in these and other cases it hurts their AI capabilities to not have the benefits of direct collaboration with those who developed, and therefore better understand, the technology. If a company works with a given entity on AI research, the entity gains a completely different understanding than if it merely downloads a paper or code online. In the case of MicrosoftResearch Asia, to use a recent example, it doesn't matter that the AI research would have been published online anyway. The process of working with Microsoft-affiliated researchers gives the Chinese National University of Defense Technology researchers an enhanced understanding of the AI applications\u2014in ways that benefit them when it comes time to use, or further adapt and improve, the technologies. Line-drawing in this area is not new. U.S. companies sometimes sell[10] dual-use internet surveillance technology to despots, despite efforts[11] to restrict this practice. Many companies are already leveling restrictions on whom they're collaborating with and what they're collaborating on with respect to AI research. As previously mentioned, several U.S. companies did so following some employees' protests over contracts with the U.S. defense apparatus. These decisions on AI are being taken in addition to any regulatory frameworks that could emerge through the likes of a Global Network Initiative[12] that could establish voluntary corporate guidelines on AI collaborations. In the current political environment, these early attempts at collaboration restriction can in some ways be characterized as conducive to China-bashing, between the U.S.-China trade war and the U.S. government's security concerns around Huawei's 5G communications technology. A number of related\u2014and bad\u2014ideas have already arisen in this environment, such as the aforementioned AI export control proposals or discussion[13] of restricting the travel of Chinese scientists to the United States. That does not mean, however, that companies incorporated in democracies shouldn't be concerned about their collaborations with certain specific Chinese entities. Look no further than Xinjiang, where the Chinese government has built out a massive surveillance state apparatus[14]\u2014including AI applications[15]\u2014in order to scale up its perpetration of human rights abuses[16] against Uighur Muslims. The population is constantly monitored and evaluated through automated systems that decide who is put into the so-called r[17]eeducation[18] camps[19]. Chinese companies have also exported[20] dual-use AI surveillance technologies to authoritarian or authoritarian-leaning governments, including the United Arab Emirates, Zimbabwe, and Malaysia.Artificial intelligence will contribute enormously[21] to economic and military power for whoever develops and successfully implements the most powerful AI applications. Given China's expansive vision for its power in the world, this is not just a potential concern for U.S. foreign policy and national security. There are also serious human rights concerns: Beijing currently uses AI to enforce digital authoritarianism domestically and may take action to encourage the spread of digital authoritarianism abroad. Companies incorporated in democratic countries need to take a stand somewhere\u2014and while it might not always be possible to know what research to publish or not publish, companies and researchers can and should draw lines when it comes to direct collaborations with foreign military entities, or organizations known to have ties with the Chinese defense industry or domestic security system. Even if MicrosoftResearch Asia's higher-ups didn't know about, approve, or sponsor the collaboration of its researchers with a Chinese defense-affiliated group, there should be mechanisms put in place to increase visibility of and scrutiny into these kinds of partnerships. With China in particular, the challenge will be identifying these military and defense links, as, by one estimation, security-related AI firms account for the highest share[22] of the top 100 AI companies in China. These include[23] facial-recognition startups and companies that sell security and safety-monitoring platforms. It has been reported that several of these firms have assisted the government's mass surveillance in Xinjiang. Chinese defense researchers may also obscure[24] their true affiliations when seeking out partnerships, which may further complicate the process of identifying links with military and defense entities. Many collaborations between American and Chinese entities are important[25] to AI development and mutually benefit all parties involved in the collaboration\u2014as well as those who use the research once published. But as repression in Xinjiang increases, and as Beijing further boosts AI-enabled digital authoritarianism, there is a need for the U.S. and broader business community to do more than simply be passive or neutral. They must make it clear to the Chinese government that the international community will not stand by on issues of human rights and privacy.

Take Europe's and improve on it</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">AMERICA rarely looks to the bureaucrats of Brussels for guidance. Commercial freedom appeals more than dirigisme. But when it comes to data privacy, the case for copying the best bits of the European Union's approach is compelling.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is due to come into force next month. It is rules-heavy and has its flaws, but its premise that consumers should be in charge of their personal data is the right one. The law lets users gain access to, and to correct, information that firms hold on them. It gives consumers the right to transfer their data to another organisation. It requires companies to define how they keep data secure. And it lets regulators levy big fines if firms break the rules.</p><p>America has enacted privacy rules in areas such as health care. But it has never passed an overarching data-protection law. The latest attempt, the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, introduced in 2012 by the Obama administration, died a slow death in Congress. The GDPR should inspire another try.</p><p>The failings of America's self-regulatory approach are becoming clearer by the week. Large parts of the online economy are fuelled by data that consumers spray around without thought. Companies' arcane privacy policies obfuscate what they do with their users' information, which often amounts to pretty much anything they please. Facebook is embroiled in crisis after news that data on 87m users had been passed to a political-campaign firm. Identity-theft is widespread; the annual cost to American consumers exceeds $16bn, according to some estimates. On March 29th Under Armour, a clothing brand, said that hackers had gained access to information about 150m users of its MyFitnessPal app.</p><p>These scandals are changing the calculus about the benefits of self-regulation. Opponents of privacy legislation have long argued that the imposition of rules would keep technology companies from innovating. Yet as trust leaches out of the system, innovation is likely to suffer. If consumers fret about what smartphone apps may do with their data, fewer new offerings will take off--especially in artificial intelligence. It emerged this week that Grindr, a dating app aimed at gay people, had been sharing details of users' HIV status with other firms. Tim Cook, the chief executive of Apple (which, admittedly, has sold itself on the idea that its customers' data should not be a source of profit), has called privacy a \"human right\". Even Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's boss, has signalled an openness to regulation. It is striking that many of the firms preparing for the GDPR's arrival in Europe enthuse that the law has forced them to put their data house in order (see Business section).</p><p>The need to minimise legal fragmentation only adds to the case for America to adopt bits of the GDPR. One reason behind the new rules in the EU was to harmonise data-protection laws so that firms can do business across Europe more easily. America is moving in the opposite direction. States that have detected a need for greater privacy are drafting their own laws. California, for instance, has pending legislation that would establish a data-protection authority to regulate how the state's big tech firms use Californians' personal data.</p><p>Internationally, too, America is increasingly an outlier. Any American firm that serves European customers will soon have no choice but to comply with the GDPR; some firms plan to employ the rules worldwide. Other countries are adopting GDPR-style laws. A similar regime on both sides of the Atlantic would help keep data flowing across borders. The alternative, of a regulatory patchwork, would make it harder for the West to amass a shared stock of AI training data to rival China's.</p><h>Putting the personal into data</h><p>America need not adopt the GDPR wholesale. The legislation is far from perfect. At nearly 100 articles long, it is too complex and tries to achieve too many things. The compliance costs for smaller firms, in particular, look burdensome. In addition, parts of the GDPR are out of step with America's constitutional guarantee of free speech: a \"right to be forgotten\" of the kind that the new law enshrines will not fly.</p><p>But these are arguments for using the GDPR as a template, not for ignoring the issue of data protection. If America continues on today's path, it will fail to protect the privacy of its citizens and long-term health of its firms. America's data economy has thrived so far with hardly any rules. That era is over.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EIUVWS-vwvwmain20180407t1620000007xmlxml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EIUVWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S2T-6FJ1-JCDS-32TH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">253486</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"764\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2018 The Economist Intelligence Unit Ltd.

Many value-focused investors have warned during the past 12 months of the dangers of pricing these companies \"for perfection\". Given the multiples commanded by their shares (see table) it is not hard to see why there is angst.</p><p>At the end of 2017 investors may have been given their first proper taste of what an imperfect future may look like for big tech. Any problems for big tech could have significant implications for markets in general, given the dominance of these companies in the key US and world indices, coupled with the widespread adoption of passive index tracking. The past 12 months have seen growing calls for increased regulation of big tech, and midway through December the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) made its first tangible moves to rein in these companies by voting to abolish net neutrality rules. Among other things, abolishing these rules should pave the way for telecoms companies and ISPs to charge more for the heaviest users of their infrastructure: the big tech firms.</p><p>If those campaigning to check the power of big tech get their way, this will be just the first step in a trend towards tighter regulations and the creation of anti-trust laws fit for the digital age. The reasons regulation has become such a hot topic this year are multifold, ranging from the implication for suppliers and retailers of the online dominance of Amazon to accusations of tax avoidance. But pertinently, the possible influence of Russia on the 2016 US election seems to have galvanised opinion about the need to act.</p><p>\u2022 It is extremely hard to predict what will result from the growing calls for regulation of big tech. However, this first significant foray by the FCC marks an interesting point in the development of this debate and is something that is worth all investors taking note of.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVSTR-133031060</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVSTR2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RG9-NK61-DY9P-N27K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"321\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investors Chronicle - magazine and web content</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59206\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"12\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>December 29, 2017</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Officials from the Federal Trade Commission are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-03/ftc-to-oversee-antitrust-probe-of-facebook-market-practices\">reportedly</url> preparing to investigate any practices that may harm competition in the digital market.</p><p>Separately, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-03/ftc-to-oversee-antitrust-probe-of-facebook-market-practices\">Reuters reported</url> that the US justice department had taken jurisdiction for a potential investigation of Apple, as part of a broader review of whether technology giants use their size to act in an anti-competitive manner.</p><p>That inquiry comes after the streaming music leader Spotify and others complained to EU antitrust regulators that Apple charges a 30% fee for content-based service providers to use Apple's in-app purchase system.</p><p>The company has previously defended its fee structure, arguing that \"our users trust Apple - and that trust is critical to how we operate a fair, competitive store for developer app distribution\".</p><p>The increasing likelihood that Google, Facebook and Apple will be investigated represent the first signs that the Trump administration is taking seriously the potential for anti-competitive conduct among the tech giants.</p><p>\"The days of the essentially unregulated 'wild west' for big tech could be nearing an end,\" says law professor Carl Tobias at the University of Richmond. \"The developments could signal that the federal government intends to subject big tech to rigorous scrutiny. Corrective measures could limit monopoly power, open access for others and better protect critical privacy interests.\"</p><p>Under a carve-up agreement between federal regulatory bodies, the justice department had given the FTC control of any antitrust investigation into Facebook, while its own investigators will maintain oversight of Alphabet, Google and Apple.</p><p>The existence of the inquiries sent shares of Amazon down as much as 5.4% and Apple as much as 2.7%. Overall, the wave of anti-trust actions wiped $137bn from Fang (Facebook, Apple, Netflix and Google) stocks' market values.</p><p>Trade commission investigators have been looking into Facebook's handling of privacy issues related to how it handles users' data for over a year. Placing the inquiry in the hands of the FTC suggests regulators are interested in a wider review of the company beyond questions of whether the social media giant is stifling competition.</p><p>Google and Facebook dominance of the digital ad revenue market is not in question; According to the research company eMarketer, in 2018 Google commanded 38.2% of the digital ad market with revenues of $41.bn. Facebook enjoys 21.8% of the market, on revenues of 23.6bn. By 2021, Google's ad revenues are projected to rise to $61.5bn, and Facebook's to $39.4bn.</p><p>In contrast, the justice department's examination of Google's search practices, first <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-03/ftc-to-oversee-antitrust-probe-of-facebook-market-practices\">reported by the Wall Street Journal</url> last week, is probably focused on antitrust issues. A previous FTC investigation into Google was shut down in 2013 without major action against the company. Renewed US scrutiny follows EU regulatory action that led to multibillion-dollar antitrust fines.</p><p>Both inquiries comes as US tech giants face increased political heat from lawmakers who question their size and dominance. Earlier this year, the Massachusetts senator and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-03/ftc-to-oversee-antitrust-probe-of-facebook-market-practices\">called for their breakup</url>, while other candidates have called for increased scrutiny.</p><p>On the other side of the political divide, the president and senior Republicans have complained that Facebook, Google and Twitter act to suppress conservative views.</p><p>Google's rivals have long lobbied the US antitrust regulators to take action, and some former senior Facebook executives have called for tighter controls on their old company. Political pressure intensified last week when Facebook refused to take down a video of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, that had been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-03/ftc-to-oversee-antitrust-probe-of-facebook-market-practices\">slowed to make her appear intoxicated</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-53356001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W84-DF71-JCJY-G07P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"726\"/><timeReceived>7:17 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

It's an issue that has caused many a corporate innovator to come unstuck. When John D Rockefeller monopolised the oil market at the turn of the 20th century, his company was broken up into 34 pieces. Controlling America's telephones in the mid-1900s sent regulators storming into AT&amp;T (US:T), while federal antitrust laws put the brakes on Microsoft's (US:MSFT) seemingly unstoppable rise during the initial internet boom.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Similar concerns are encircling several pioneers of the latest digital age. And so, as Facebook (US:FB), Amazon (US:AMZN), Apple (US:AAPL), Netflix (US:NFLX) and Google's parent company Alphabet (US:GOOGL) - the so-called FAANG stocks - emerge from another financial reporting season, a darker horizon looms.</p><p>That's not to say the numbers weren't spectacular. Facebook nearly doubled earnings per share to $2.21 (\u00a31.55), which beat analyst expectations by 26\u023c. At Amazon, revenues leapt 38 per cent to cross the $60bn quarterly threshold for the first time, while Apple's profits hit yet another record high thanks to the iPhone X's $999 price tag. Netflix added 6.36m new subscribers in the final quarter alone, and Alphabet reported revenues up by a quarter as demand for its pricey advertising slots surged.</p><p>But these numbers no longer feel like a badge of honour as was the case for corporate America during the Obama presidency. Instead, consumers and politicians have started asking whether these giants have grown too big, and there's a sense that Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Tim Cook, Reed Hastings and Larry Page are all dousing the sparks before they turn into fires of discontent. </p><p>                     Facebook's fickle friend                    </p><p>Mr Zuckerberg has built Facebook's image as a good giant of Silicon Valley. So for his company to be under the same scrutiny as other, potentially health-damaging, industries such as tobacco and sugar is far from ideal. In response, Facebook is overhauling its newsfeed to quell the accusations of causing mental health problems in young adults, aiding the spread of fake news and promoting the activity of terrorist groups.</p><p>But these changes could lessen the amount of time users spend on the social network, which will reduce the amount of money Facebook makes from advertising. Already, the site's popularity is dwindling: in the final quarter of 2017, average revenue per user in the dominant north American market fell for the first time.</p><p>But Facebook's executives don't believe the newsfeed changes will hurt revenues. The group has plenty of other avenues from which it can make money, including offering advertising space on Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger or upping the price of marketing on the flagship site. In fact, Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer, thinks the newsfeed changes could lead to more 'monetisation' opportunities. </p><p>                     Amazon: health hero                    </p><p>Amazon and 'not for profit' in the same sentence sends shivers down the spine, and it's why news that Mr Bezos has teamed up with legendary investor Warren Buffett and JPMorgan's chief executive Jamie Dimon to create an organisation aimed at cutting healthcare bills wiped billions of dollars off the market capitalisations of global health stocks.</p><p>But buttering up politicians by taking on the most hated industry in America won't hide the fact that Amazon has become worryingly enormous. In 2017, profits doubled (partly thanks to Trump's tax cut) as revenues hit record highs, aided by a $4.5bn contribution from recently acquired grocery chain Whole Foods.</p><p>Having already toppled the book and music industries, the group has set its sights firmly on food, clothes and television. That's not to mention its hugely profitable cloud hosting division - which is believed to account for 48 per cent of all global cloud computing business - and its data centre, which has put the insurance industry on edge. Calls for a break-up of the e-commerce giant are certainly getting louder.</p><p>                     Bite of the Apple                    </p><p>Consumers' desire to own the latest gadget means every time Apple launches its latest iPhone model, throngs of people queue up outside the stores to pre-order until stock runs out. But after those initial Apple-philes have had their fill, more rational buyers also start to order iPhones. But, for the first time, these more practical customers have said Apple is asking too much at $999 for a new phone. In the final quarter, volumes of iPhone sales dropped 1 per cent, missing market expectations. The price tag ensured iPhone revenues and profits rose overall, but analysts are concerned Apple could struggle to keep attracting customers.</p><p>Allegations that the world's largest company purposely slowed down batteries to encourage customers to buy new models hasn't helped either. In the current quarter to March 2018, sales are expected to rise between 13 and 17 per cent to between $60bn and $62bn, but this falls short of the previous $68bn target.</p><p>Netflix's space                   </p><p>The one blip on an otherwise flawless set of results from the video streaming group was a $39m non-cash impairment relating to two episodes of House of Cards that Netflix commissioned but will now not air due to the sexual harassment scandal that erupted around the show's leading man, Kevin Spacey. Netflix was quick to distance itself from the disgraced actor, cutting the star from its flagship show just two days after the allegations emerged.</p><p>Maintaining a clean image is important if Netflix is going to keep attracting talent and, amid rising competition in the TV market, big names and original content are the key to survival.</p><p>Investors may have cheered the swell in subscriber numbers in 2017, but there is no hiding from the cost of ensuring viewers come back for more. The group's liabilities from content pre-payment and debt have increased fourfold in the past five years, hitting $24.2bn at the end of last year. With Amazon and Walt Disney (US:DIS) encroaching on its streaming space, Netflix is going to have to keep spending big. </p><p>                     Just Google it                   </p><p>Last year, European regulators hit Google with a (EURO)2.4bn (\u00a32.1bn) fine for prioritising its own online shopping channel via its search engine. The criticism was that too many companies had become dependent on Google to drive business.</p><p>Ironically, it was Google's own dependence on other companies that came to light following its latest earnings report. Alphabet's shares stumbled after it reported a growing portion of revenue had been spent on setting the Google search engine as the default option on products and services such as iPhones and Mozilla's Firefox browser.</p><p>But investment in these platforms is worth it. The growing use of smartphones around the world means more advertising dollars are being directed to mobile - great news for Google and Facebook, which together account for more than 60 per cent of the mobile advertising market.</p><p>                     Favourites                   </p><p>                     Apple may have encountered some operational difficulty, but its strong balance sheet more than makes up for that. Thanks to the changes to US tax laws, the group has been allowed to repatriate cash profits generated overseas. Sure, management has agreed to pay $38m to do so, but this is a drop in the ocean compared to its net cash position of $163bn (including $122bn of debt). Apple has also said it will move its cash balance to \"approximately zero\" meaning investors could be in for a hefty payday. It's also been speculated that management might accelerate acquisitions. With $163bn, it would be able to buy all but one UK listed company without having to borrow a penny. We are also reassured by the fact that Apple has enough competitors to avoid the antitrust problems that face Google, Amazon and Facebook.</p><p>                     Outsiders                   </p><p>Good feeling goes a long way in business and the fact that consumers are starting to turn on social media is a worry for Facebook. The group has fielded a lot of bad press in recent months, which will be hard for investors to forget. Plus, the duopoly in the advertising market it has shared with Google could soon be under fire from competition and regulation: Amazon and Netflix are considering putting ads around their TV content, while regulators in Europe and Australia are hoping to end the dominance of these two giants.

It's an issue that has caused many a corporate innovator to come unstuck. When John D Rockefeller monopolised the oil market at the turn of the 20th century, his company was broken up into 34 pieces. Controlling America's telephones in the mid-1900s sent regulators storming into AT&amp;T (US:T), while federal antitrust laws put the brakes on Microsoft's (US: MSFT) seemingly unstoppable rise during the initial Internet boom. Similar concerns are encircling several pioneers of the latest digital age. And so, as Facebook (US:FB), Amazon (US:AMZN), Apple (US:AAPL), Netflix (US:NFLX) and Alphabet (US:GOOGL) - the so-called FAANG stocks - emerge from another financial reporting season, a darker horizon looms.</p><p>That's not to say the numbers weren't spectacular. Facebook nearly doubled earnings per share to $2.21 (\u00a31.55), which beat analyst expectations by 26\u00a2. At Amazon, revenues leapt 38 per cent to cross the $60bn quarterly threshold for the first time, while Apple's profits hit yet another record high thanks to the iPhone X's $999 price tag. Netflix added 6.36m new subscribers in the final quarter alone, and Google's parent company Alphabet reported revenues up by a quarter as demand for its pricey advertising slots surged.</p><p>But these numbers no longer feel like a badge of honour, as was the case for corporate America during the Obama presidency. Instead, consumers and politicians have started asking whether these giants have grown too big, and there's a sense that Mark Zuckerberg, JeffBezos, Tim Cook, Reed Hastings and Larry Page are all dousing the sparks before they turn into fires of discontent.</p><p>Facebook's fickle friend Mr Zuckerberg has built Facebook's image as a good giant of Silicon Valley. So for his company to be under the same scrutiny as other, potentially health-damaging, industries such as tobacco and sugar is far from ideal. In response, Facebook is overhauling its newsfeed to quell the accusations of causing mental health problems in young adults, aiding the spread of fake news and promoting the activity of terrorist groups.</p><p>But these changes could lessen the amount of time users spend on the social network, which will reduce the amount of money Facebook makes from advertising. Already the site's popularity is dwindling: in the final quarter of 2017, average revenue per user in the dominant North American market fell for the first time.</p><p>But Facebook's executives don't believe the newsfeed changes will hurt revenues. The group has plenty of other avenues from which it can make money, including offering advertising space on Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger or upping the price of marketing on the flagship site. In fact, Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer, thinks the newsfeed changes could lead to more 'monetisation' opportunities.</p><p>Amazon: health hero Amazon and 'not for profit' in the same sentence sends shivers down the spine, and it's why news that Mr Bezos has teamed up with legendary investor Warren Buffett and JPMorgan's chief executive Jamie Dimon to create an organisation aimed at cutting healthcare bills wiped billions of dollars offthe market capitalisations of global health stocks.</p><p>But buttering up politicians by taking on the most hated industry in America won't hide the fact that Amazon has become worryingly enormous. In 2017, profits doubled (partly thanks to Trump's tax cut) as revenues hit record highs, aided by a $4.5bn contribution from recently acquired grocery chain Whole Foods.</p><p>Having already toppled the book and music industries, the group has set its sights firmly on food, clothes and television. That's not to mention its hugely profitable cloud hosting division - which is believed to account for 48 per cent of all global cloud computing business - and its data centre, which has put the insurance industry on edge. Calls for a break-up of the e-commerce giant are certainly getting louder.</p><p>Bite of the Apple Desire to own the latest gadget means every time Apple launches its latest iPhone model, throngs of people queue up outside the stores to pre-order until stock runs out. But after those initial Apple-philes have had their fill, more rational buyers also start to order iPhones. But, for the first time, these more practical customers have said Apple is asking too much at $999 for a new phone. In the final quarter, volumes of iPhone sales dropped 1 per cent, missing market expectations. The price tag ensured iPhone revenues and profits rose overall, but analysts are concerned Apple could struggle to keep attracting customers.</p><p>Allegations that the world's largest company purposely slowed down batteries to encourage customers to buy new models hasn't helped either. In the current quarter to March 2018, sales are expected to rise between 13 and 17 per cent to between $60bn and $62bn, but this falls short of the previous $68bn target.</p><p>Netflix's space The one blip on an otherwise flawless set of results from the video streaming group was a $39m non-cash impairment relating to two episodes of House of Cards that Netflix commissioned but will now not air due to the sexual harassment scandal that erupted around the show's leading man, Kevin Spacey. Netflix was quick to distance itself from the disgraced actor, cutting the star from its flagship show just two days after the allegations emerged.</p><p>Maintaining a clean image is important if Netflix is going to keep attracting talent and, amid rising competition in the TV market, big names and original content are the key to survival.</p><p>Investors may have cheered the swell in subscriber numbers in 2017, but there is no hiding from the cost of ensuring people come back for more. The group's liabilities from content pre-payment and debt have increased fourfold in the past five years, hitting $24.2bn at the end of last year. And with Amazon and Walt Disney (US:DIS) encroaching on its streaming space, Netflix is going to have to keep spending big.</p><p>Just Google it Last year, European regulators hit Google with a (EURO)2.4bn (\u00a32.1bn) fine for prioritising its own online shopping channel via its search engine. The criticism was that too many companies had become dependent on Google to drive business.</p><p>Ironically, it was Google's own dependence on other companies that came to light following its latest earnings report. Alphabet's shares stumbled after it reported a growing portion of revenue had been spent on setting the Google search engine as the default option on products and services such as iPhones and Mozilla's Firefox browser.</p><p>But investment in these platforms is worth it. The growing use of smartphones around the world means more advertising dollars are being directed to mobile - great news for Google and Facebook, which together account for more than 60 per cent of the mobile advertising market.</p><p>Big tech has led the US bull market to its longest ever run and - based on financial results alone - there are no signs of a let-up in this spectacular growth. But the rising discord among regulators is worth noting. We think it is time to be wary of the dominance that these giants have enjoyed for too long.</p><p>Favourite Apple may have encountered some operational difficulty, but its strong balance sheet more than makes up for that. Thanks to the changes to US tax laws, the group has been allowed to repatriate cash profits generated overseas. Sure, management has agreed to pay $38m to do so, but this is a drop in the ocean compared with its net cash position of $163bn (including $122bn of debt). Apple has also said it will move its cash balance to \"approximately zero\", meaning investors could be in for a hefty payday.</p><p>It's also been speculated that management might accelerate acquisitions. With $163bn, it would be able to buy all but one UK-listed company without having to borrow a penny. We are also reassured by the fact that Apple has enough competitors to avoid the antitrust problems that face Google, Amazon and Facebook.</p><p>Outsiders Good feeling goes a long way in business and the fact that consumers are starting to turn on social media is a worry for Facebook. The group has fielded a lot of bad press in recent months, which will be hard for investors to forget. Plus, the duopoly in the advertising market it has shared with Google could soon be under fire from competition and regulation - Amazon and Netflix are considering putting ads around their TV content, while regulators in Europe and Australia are hoping to end the dominance of these two giants. When Mr Zuckerberg referred to Facebook as a utility he seemed to forget that utilities that get too big end up being heavily regulated.</p><p>'Facebook is overhauling its newsfeed to quell the accusations of causing mental health problems, aiding the spread of fake news and promoting the activity of terrorist groups'  ;

While profitable, it's not profitable enough, quickly enough for Wall Street's liking. And since upgrading aging DSL lines in rural or less affluent urban[1] markets is expensive, these companies have largely decided to freeze[2] most major fiber upgrades. </p><p>Not only that, many of these companies (Windstream, Frontier, CenturyLink, AT...and Verizon) have been refusing to even repair many of the lines already in service. The problem is that as these companies exit and neglect these underserved markets, cable giants are being left with growing monopolies[3] across huge swaths of the US. Limited competition means less incentive to compete on price, or fix the cable industry's often comical customer service. And while some believe 5G will magically come in and somehow fix this problem, that's not likely to happen for the same reason fiber isn't universally deployed: companies don't want to pay for to connect fiber to the nation's rural and less affluent urban communities. .@khart[4] accurately articulates the reality around 5G that I've found from research. The ISPs aren't sure they can justify the investment to Wall Street's demand for fast returns (ie not profitable fast enough). Could stagnate like fiber to the home. <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/WaSVKnShhG\">https://t.co/WaSVKnShhG</url>[5] \u2014 Ernesto Falcon (@EFFFalcon) June 3, 2019[6]Aside from the reduction in competition, another problem with telcos just giving up on residential broadband is that many of these networks were heavily taxpayer subsidized. Regulations in many states (which telcom lobbyists have voraciously been assaulting for years) also protect the elderly and poor from having connectivity stripped away. That's not really stopping companies like CenturyLink, which recently quietly froze all network upgrades[7], and is now signaling that in may leave the residential broadband market almost entirely to focus on more immediately profitable enterprise offerings after acquiring Level 3. AT...nd Verizon have shifted all of their focus toward wireless and trying to become (however ham-handedly) the next major players in the online video advertising space. Another major telco, Windstream Communications, recently declared bankruptcy[8] after years of network neglect resulted in a flood of customers headed to the exists. There's a similar story playing out at Frontier Communications, which first gobbled up Verizon's unwanted assets in growth for growth's sake, but now is being forced to sell some territories off as it struggles with the massive debt load[9]. Again, wireless isn't going to fix this because the same rules apply: 5G needs fiber lines carriers don't want to invest in in rural or less affluent broadband markets if the ROI is low. And while many communities have turned toward building their own broadband networks instead, these very same telcos (with the help of the Pai FCC[10]) have lobbied to pass state laws banning towns or cities from building the better broadband these telcos have long refused to. It's a pretty massive problem with an exponential impact on numerous sectors that tends to get lost in mainstream tech conversations surrounding \"big tech\" giants. But it's a problem that's not going away and remains hugely important all the same.Permalink[11] | Comments[12] | Email This Story[13] [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url

The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation argued against FTC \"expanding the scope of antitrust review to incorporate how companies collect and use data.\"</p><p>Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said the FTC \"must update its insufficient enforcement efforts to prevent anti-competitive practices,\" and questioned whether agency merger review policies are \"sufficiently aggressive.\" The FTC \"must keep pace with the digital economy to protect American consumers and workers from harmful business practices and abuses,\" he said.</p><p>USTelecom CEO Jonathan Spalter said his members are optimistic the agency will develop \"uniform protections for all consumers online.\" NCTA argued for \"a uniform approach to privacy and data security\" and said the agency \"should enable consumers to enjoy transparency, choice, and security with respect to how their privacy and data is handled.\" Charter also backed a \"uniform\" set of rules, with \"focus on the core principles of consumer control and meaningful consent, transparency, parity, uniformity and security.\"</p><p>Tech's dominance makes it \"extremely difficult\" for media outlets to build \"sustainable digital business models,\" the News Media Alliance said, saying platforms achieved dominance with \"assistance of serial acquisitions and exclusionary conduct aimed at nascent competitors and technologies that threaten to supplant their positions.\" Google and Facebook account for more than 80 percent of referrals to digital news publications, said CEO David Chavern.</p><p>\u0192_&lt;\u0192_&lt;\u0192_&lt;\u0192_&lt;\u0192_&lt;\u0192_&lt;\u0192_&lt;ITIF said there's little evidence that giving users more privacy gives a platform a competitive advantage -- as seen in the lack of competitive services tailored to privacy concerns. \"Consumers generally have a lax attitude toward privacy; they say they want more of it, but they voluntarily share a lot of personal information online and generally do not support websites that cost even a little more,\" ITIF said. Big data, specifically personal information, is increasingly vital to \"some of the economy's most important innovations, including online platforms, medical diagnoses, digital assistants, language translation, urban planning, and public safety,\" ITIF said.</p><p>The FTC should use antitrust tools to protect consumer privacy where it can, but the agency also should champion comprehensive privacy legislation \"to truly protect consumers' privacy in the digital age,\" Public Knowledge said: \"The nexus between accumulated personal information and the dominance of internet platforms is properly within the scope of antitrust review, and antitrust enforcement to remedy anticompetitive uses of personal information can, and should, also strive to maximize consumer welfare in privacy.\"</p><p>Center for Digital Democracy filed joint comments\u0192_&lt;\u0192_&lt;\u0192_&lt;\u0192_&lt;\u0192_&lt;\u0192_&lt;\u0192_&lt; with Berkeley Media Studies Group and Color of Change, urging the commission to include the welfare and privacy of children and teens as a discussion topic: \"An FTC proceeding on competition and consumer welfare must include a hearing on youth, including how effectively the FTC enforces\" the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMDLY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMDLY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T35-DW71-DYRJ-00C5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">6944</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"663\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Warren Communications News, Inc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Daily</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 22, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

But critics also see it as a renewed push to compel tech companies to weaken or undo their \"warrant-proof\" encryption efforts under the guise of preventing crime and terrorism.</p><p><br/>U.S. Attorney General William Barr announced the proposals at the Justice Department on Thursday with international partners from the U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.<br/>The principles, built by the five countries and tech leaders - including Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter - aim to incentivize internet companies and social media giants to do more to prevent child sexual abuse on their platforms.<br/>Barr said he hopes that the principles \"set new norms\" across the tech industry to \"make sure there's no safe space on the internet for offenders to operate.\"<br/>The principles come ahead of anticipated bipartisan legislation to Congress - the so-called EARN IT Act, which reports say could effectively force the tech companies' hands by threatening to pull their legal immunities for what their users post if the companies fail to aggressively clamp down on online child sexual abuse.<br/>Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) announced the legislation shortly after the Justice Department presser ended.<br/>The bill got quick rebuke from Senate colleague, Ron Wyden (D-OR), calling the bill \"deeply flawed and counterproductive bill.\"<br/>\"This bill is a transparent and deeply cynical effort by a few well-connected corporations and the Trump administration to use child sexual abuse to their political advantage, the impact to free speech and the security and privacy of every single American be damned,\" said Wyden.<br/>Justice takes aim at big tech's immunitiesBarr warned that the government is \"analyzing the impact\" of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects tech platforms from legal liability for content created by their users.<br/>Under Barr, the Justice Department has taken a particular interest in dismantling Section 230. Last month, the Justice Department hosted a \"workshop\" on Section 230, arguing that the immunity it provides interferes with law enforcement and needs to be reexamined.<br/>\"We must also recognize the benefits that Section 230 and technology have brought to our society, and ensure that the proposed cure is not worse than the disease,\" Barr said last month.<br/>Any change to Section 230, widely regarded as the legal underpinning of all online platforms, could radically alter the landscape of the modern internet and give the government more power to control online speech. Privacy advocates view the government's interest in wielding Section 230 as a cudgel and existential threat to the internet as we know it.<br/>Last month, Wyden, one of Section 230's co-authors, condemned the Trump administration's scrutiny of the law and argued that repealing the law would not be a successful punishment for large tech companies. \"... The biggest tech companies have enough lawyers and lobbyists to survive virtually any regulation Congress can concoct,\" Wyden wrote. \"It's the start-ups seeking to displace Big Tech that would be hammered by the constant threat of lawsuits.\"<br/>Encryption enters the limelightU.K. Security Minister James Brokenshire lauded the initiative's existing six tech partners, encouraging the rest of the industry to fall in line. \"It's critical that others follow them by endorsing and acting on these principles.\" The minister claimed that plans to encrypt tech platforms are \"sending predators back into the darkness\" and away from \"artificial intelligence advances that can expose them.\"<br/>Barr also questioned if \"disappearing messages or certain encryption tools appropriately balance the value of privacy against the risk of safe havens for exploitation?\"<br/>But privacy groups remain wary of legislative action, fearing that any law could ultimately force the companies to weaken or break encryption, which government officials have for years claimed helps criminals and sexual predators evade prosecution.<br/>End-to-end encryption has become largely the norm in the past few years since the Edward Snowden revelations into the vast surveillance efforts by the U.S. and its Five Eyes partners.<br/>Apple, Google and Facebook have made encryption standard in its products and services, a frequent frustration for investigators and prosecutors.<br/>But last year, the Five Eyes said it would contemplate forcing the matter of encryption if tech giants wouldn't acquiesce to the pact's demands.<br/>The government has called for \"responsible encryption,\" a backdoor-like system that allows governments to access encrypted communications and devices with a key that only it possesses. But security experts have universally panned the idea, arguing that there is no way to create a \"secure backdoor\" without it somehow being vulnerable to hackers.<br/>The bill has already received heavy opposition. Facebook said that child safety is a \"top priority,\" but warned that the EARN IT Act would \"roll back encryption, which protects everyone's safety from hackers and criminals.\"<br/>It's a similar anti-encryption bill to one that Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) and Richard Burr (R-NC) introduced in 2016, which would have forced tech companies to build backdoors in its systems. The bill failed.<br/>The Electronic Frontier Foundation said the bill would \"undermine the law that undergirds free speech on the internet.\" Firefox browser maker Mozilla said the bill \"creates problems rather than offering a solution.\"<br/>\"The law enforcement community has made it clear this law is another attempt to weaken the encryption that is the bedrock of digital security,\" said Heather West, Mozilla's head of Americas policy. \"Encryption ensures our information - from our sensitive financial and medical details to emails and text messages - is protected.\"<br/>\"Without it, the world is a far more dangerous place,\" said West.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M-683330</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC6-6BJ1-DYDW-7027-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1035\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 6, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Justice Department is looking into whether large tech companies have harmed their users.The United States Justice Department said on Tuesday that it was opening a large-scale antitrust investigation of big US tech firms.The probe will look into \"whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation, or otherwise harmed consumers,\" a Justice Department statement read.It did not refer to any specific companies, but the Justice Department said the review would consider concerns raised about \"search, social media, and some retail services online\" \u2014 an apparent reference to Google's parent company Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook and Apple.\"Without the discipline of meaningful market-based competition, digital platforms may act in ways that are not responsive to consumer demands,\" said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, who is in charge of the department's antitrust division. </p><p>\"The department's antitrust review will explore these important issues.\"More scrutinyThe investigation comes as a growing number of US lawmakers have called for stricter regulation, or even breaking up of, large tech companies.Traditionally in the United States, antitrust regulators have only sought to stop major acquisitions involving two big companies, such as the lawsuit against a merger of the telecommunications companies AT...nd Time Warner.Calls for regulation have also intensified after a series of scandals involving compromised user data, the most notable one being the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which the British consulting firm harvested personal data from millions of people's Facebook accounts.Additionally, Google could be facing a hefty fine from US regulators for failing to protect children from harmful content and data collection on their YouTube video service. Amazon has also drawn criticism for its dominating role in e-commerce. Both companies have also been targeted by regulators in the European Union. The EU has handed down a total of $9.5 billion (\u20ac8.5 billion) in fines to Google over the past two years and is currently investigating whether Amazon misused merchant data to gain a competitive edge. Apple and Facebook have also been scrutinized in Europe over alleged breaches of competition, tax and data rules.dv/se (AP, Reuters)DW sends out a daily selection of hard news and quality feature journalism.

The benchmark US equity index rose for the first time in six days on Thursday, joining a global rotation back into risk assets. The S...00 rose by 0.3% to 2,078, shedding losses of as much as 1% earlier in the session. </p><p>The advance was led by so-called defensive stocks that are favoured by investors for their fat dividend yields, and are seen as a haven during times of turbulence. Telecommunications, utilities and consumer staples posted the largest gains. On the other end of the spectrum, economically-sensitive stocks lagged behind, with the energy sector notching a mild decline and technology and industrials logging the slimmest advances of the major S...00 sectors. Smaller stocks managed to pare losses, but none of the tickers went higher on the day. The S...idcap 400 was down 0.08% at 1,478, while the S...mallcap 600 dropped by 0.1% to 703 and the wider small-cap Russell 2000 shed 0.1% to 1,148. The US oil benchmark West Texas Intermediate closed down 4.14% at $46.02, setting itself up for a further fall into $45 territory in the Friday session. Unsurprisingly, midcap declines were led by energy stocks Sm Energy (NYSE:SM) and Wpx Energy Inc(NYSE:WPX). Midsession US shares were flat-to-lower at midsession on Thursday as concerns that Britons will vote in favour of quitting the European Union continued to send shockwaves while oil prices made a strident fall. Despite the protests of the Federal Reserve's Janet Yellen, as well as repeated warnings from the Bank of England today, the latest opinion poll bears out that voters are not listening to those protests. Britain's anti-EU 'Leave' campaign has increased its lead by seven points, rushing ahead of its rivals to 45%, according to a poll by Survation and IG on Thursday. With just a week before the referendum, the Leave camp increased its lead from 38%, with Remain falling two points to 42%, in a phone survey from the company carried out on June 15. It is the first time the Brexit camp has been in front since the polling began from Survation in February. The S...00 bellwether was flat at 2,071, while the S...idcap 400 lost 0.4% to 1,474, and led by weakness in Sm Energy (NYSE:SM), down 9.4% to $26.73, in the wake of weaker oil prices. Cyclical stocks took the biggest beating on the day, with the S...00 energy sector falling by more than 2%, and financials, industrials, materials, and technology all falling by more than 1%. Oil prices came off sharply. The US benchmark West Texas Intermediate was down 3.5% at $46.34. A week ago oil was closing in on $52 a barrel. The picture was gloomier still among small-cap stocks. The S...mallcap 600 lost 0.6% to 699, led by Korn Ferry International (NYSE:KFY), down 19.7% to $22.17 - a day after announcing strong Q4 earnings. The sell-off appears to be profit-taking. Korn Ferry were the placement agents for Robert Cook who will become regulator FINRA chief later in 2016, as Proactive Investors reported on Monday.\u00a0Read more.

The wave of data scandals that have hit Facebook and other online platforms has prompted growing calls for action by lawmakers looking to curb abuses of how private information is used and give consumers more clarity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Significantly, most tech companies are pledging to willingly accept new regulations to set a uniform standard in the United States following a sweeping set of rules that went into effect in the European Union in 2018, although few have offered details. Federal regulations could preempt the enforcement of legislation enacted in California, which was modeled after the EU's General Data Protection Regulation.</p><p>\"Whether big tech and little tech like it or not, 2019 will be a year of regulation,\" said Doug Clinton of the investment firm Loup Ventures, in a recent blog post. The analyst said he expects the US to consider \"the most important points\" of GDPR including consent, access, portability and erasure of personal information.</p><p>Protecting data</p><p>Senator Brian Schatz and 14 other Democrats have endorsed a bill aimed at requiring online firms to safeguard personal information and stop the misuse of data. \"People have a basic expectation that the personal information they provide to websites and apps is well-protected and won't be used against them,\" Schatz said in a statement last month. \"Just as doctors and lawyers are expected to protect and responsibly use the personal data they hold, online companies should be required to do the same.\"</p><p>Another proposal unveiled in December by the Center for Democracy &amp; Technology, a digital rights group in Washington, in consultation with industry and activist groups, covers consumer rights to access and correct data held by online firms, data portability, and limits on third-party access to data. Significantly, it limits the kinds of data that companies can collect to what is needed for their services.</p><p>\"Many apps collect your location information even if it has nothing to do with the service they are providing,\" said Michelle Richardson, head of data and privacy for the organization. \"We want to fundamentally change how companies collect and use data.\" Since the revelations over the hijacking of personal data of tens of millions of Facebook users by the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica, tech firms have come under heightened scrutiny from lawmakers and privacy activists.</p><p>Cooperation, or not?</p><p>Instead of pushing back, big tech firms have offered to cooperate with lawmakers on a national privacy bill -- although skeptics say this may be an effort to limit the reach of tougher state laws. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai told a hearing in mid-December, \"I'm of the opinion that we are better off with more of an overarching data protection framework for users, and I think that would be good to do.\" Apple CEO Tim Cook early this year called for federal privacy legislation, while assailing the \"weaponized\" used of private data that is bought and sold online.</p><p>Alan McQuinn, policy analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington think tank, said that following the passage of a California privacy law, \"the tech sector is now trying to get out in front of having segmented privacy rules.\" Yet details of any new privacy bill are likely to be complex, with battles looming on how far legislation should go. McQuinn said there may be consensus on a need to boost transparency, consumer access and enforcement over misuse of personal data, but that many other issues are thorny.</p><p>He said there may be consensus on need for more transparency, data portability and consumer access and new enforcement mechanisms for abuse of private data. But he maintained that GDPR has proven \"incredibly burdensome\" and caused some businesses to quit the EU or block their online presence. \"People don't realize that legislation doesn't just affect the internet giants, it affects your local grocery store and creates costs throughout the system,\" McQuinn said.</p><p>The analyst said requiring \"opt in\" consent for any type of data could have unintended consequences -- hurting innovation and strengthening the biggest firms that have the resources to comply. One possible solution is to create \"tiers\" of data categories requiring opt-in consent only for the most sensitive categories. Despite broad agreement on the need for privacy rules, McQuinn said a divided government and hyperpartisan political environment will mean \"this will be a difficult process.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/18/21/75/154686970095.jpg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/18/21/75/154686970095.jpg</url></p><p>US to see push to regulate Big Tech<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DATRIB-134620801</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DATRIB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V4S-GM81-F11P-X4V8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390877</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"788\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Al Ayam Publishing and Printing Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.
