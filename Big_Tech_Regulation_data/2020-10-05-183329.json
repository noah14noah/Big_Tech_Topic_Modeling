Maybe it\u2019s #FirstWorldProblems or perhaps #ThisIsWhyWeCantHaveNiceThings? I will admit a soft spot for a good GIF based on the classic Battlestar Galactica catchphrase, \u201cAll of this has happened before. All of this will happen again.\u201d Seems appropriate given how that TV show was about a technology backlash that keeps happening over and over again.  </p><p><br/>And so it is with concerns about the social consequences of media tech. The 17th-century French scholar Adrien Baillet fretted that \u201cthe multitude of books which grows every day in prodigious fashion\u201d would destroy civilization just like the \u201cfall of the Roman Empire.\u201d The early days of radio spawned fears that the \u201ccompelling excitement of the loudspeaker\u201d would distract children from their homework. In 1961, FCC Chairman Newton Minow famously complained that television was a \u201cvast wasteland,\u201d often little more than \u201ca procession of game shows, formula comedies about totally unbelievable families, blood and thunder, mayhem, violence, sadism, murder, Western bad men, Western good men, private eyes, gangsters, more violence, and cartoons.\u201d (Of course to modern sensibilities, that all probably sounds pretty good. Especially a show called Blood and Thunder.) Just recently I wrote about spurious claims that Halo 3 and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare explain why young men don\u2019t work more.  <br/>Now, a decade after the iPhone made its debut, people are discovering smartphones and apps aren\u2019t immune to the notion of trade-offs. Yes, the mobile technology revolution is a transformative event that gives billions easy access to humanity\u2019s stock of knowledge through a small pane of glass in their pockets. The data being generated will help fight crime, epidemics, and traffic. In developing nations, more mobile phones mean more connectedness and economic growth.  <br/>Sounds pretty good. But, unsurprisingly, all that enhanced power of access and collaboration has downsides. After some former Facebook executives expressed guilt for building a platform dependent on \u201cdopamine-driven feedback loops\u201d and designed to foster dependence, the company acknowledged that some types of social-media use could harm users\u2019 mental health.  <br/>And activists are now complaining that Apple doesn\u2019t do enough to give parents sufficient control over their children\u2019s iPhones. They want the company to take more seriously the potential mental-health impact of kids spending so much time on their devices. Or as a clickbait headline in a viral Atlantic piece recently put it, \u201cHave Smartphones Destroyed a Generation?\u201d The story presents some data suggesting smartphones have made the cohort between 1995 and 2012 \u2014 iGen, as the author calls them \u2014 more psychologically \u201cvulnerable\u201d and \u201cseriously unhappy.\u201d  <br/>But ultimately that headline conforms to Betteridge\u2019s law: \u201cAny headline that ends in a question mark can be answered by the word no.\u201d iGen is not yet a generation destroyed. Yes, the data show teens today are more likely to say they feel lonely than in 2007, when the iPhone was introduced. But in so many other ways they seem healthier, reporting lower rates of drug use, less violence, and safer sexual behavior. Millennials overall are also pretty optimistic about the future.  <br/>The government isn\u2019t going to ban smartphones for the under-18 crowd. The end result of this upturn in concern will probably be more intuitive phone controls and better apps for parents, as well as for those adults who have trouble staying off Twitter. And then we can return to wondering if AI-infused robots or AI-enhanced humans will gobble up all of society\u2019s jobs and wealth. That is a best-case scenario.  <br/>A less-welcome, though lower probability outcome is if the burgeoning anti-tech movement successfully weaponizes these mild health and safety concerns in its effort to dismantle or heavily regulate the mega-platforms and other large, successful tech firms, which suffered a PR annus horribilis in 2017. Big Tech\u2019s strong counterargument has until now been that they are providing customers with valued products. It\u2019s why Jeff Bezos is now a centibillionaire. But what if that product is widely thought to be bad for consumers? All that economic value suddenly looks a bit less valuable, and Big Tech just begins to resemble Big Tobacco. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USOFFN-RLPMN492557620180111</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USOFFN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RCY-NFH1-DXCW-D3T9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400469</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"743\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US Official News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"610\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 11, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0001RFI</classCode><className>AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0VJ</classCode><className>SOCIAL MEDIA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp;

But a very high corporate tax rate does.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The title of the interim report of the Senate economics committee inquiry into corporate tax avoidance released this week is You cannot tax what you cannot see.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is a rather embarrassing admission that the evidence for widespread corporate tax avoidance - which has filled so many newspaper columns, so many hyperbolic speeches in Parliament - just doesn't exist.</p><p>Imagine being pulled over by the police and told that even though you've been observed driving below the speed limit, stopping at stop signs, giving way at give way signs, indicating correctly, wearing your seatbelt and maintaining a respectable distance from the car in front, the police have a hunch you're somehow violating community expectations.</p><p>While the Senate committee feels sure there are questionable corporate tax practices going on, it doesn't actually find any. Rather, it relies very heavily on the political rhetoric of a now-discredited 2014 report by the Tax Justice Network, which claimed firms were denying the government vast sums of revenue through opaque and confusing tax arrangements.</p><p>In fact, what the committee's interim report shows is that the tax practices of the big tech firms are quite explicable.</p><p>For instance, Microsoft and Google have their regional bases in Singapore. As the committee admits, these headquarters are not shells, existing solely to avoid giving Joe Hockey money. They're real. They have real offices, real assets, and real staff doing real work. In Singapore. Not Australia. Just because those Singapore headquarters digitally export some products and services to Australia does not mean they should pay Australian corporate tax on the profits.</p><p>Even more explicable is large firms with large research and development costs deducting those costs from their taxable profits. The R&amp;D corporate tax deduction is bipartisan government policy. It seems a bit much for governments to introduce a tax incentive then get angry with firms for using it.</p><p>The lack of evidence of tax avoidance makes the committee's belief that the government should name and shame corporate tax avoiders vaguely comical.</p><p>The Australian Tax Office should be vigilant ensuring firms are paying what they owe. Firms that fail to do so should face the full consequences of the law. But that already happens. Australia has some of the strongest anti-avoidance laws on the planet. The government has the tools, right now, to deal with illegal tax evasion.</p><p>Underpinning this debate is the fact that Australia's corporate tax rate is very high. At 30 per cent, it is substantially above the OECD average of 25.3 per cent. And Australia is one of the most heavily reliant countries on corporate tax revenue in the OECD. The Senate committee admits that this heavy burden puts Australia at a \"comparative disadvantage\".</p><p>With such a disadvantage, it is no surprise that multinational companies are not lining up to establish their regional headquarters here.</p><p>But a failure to establish regional headquarters in Australia - \"avoiding permanent establishment\" in the lingo of the committee - does not constitute tax avoidance. Australia's tax and regulatory environment is not competitive. Singapore's is competitive. This ought to cause some soul-searching by the Parliament. Hand-wringing about phantom corporate tax avoidance just postpones considering the real problem.</p><p>Perhaps we might expect the sort of anti-corporate nonsense espoused at the inquiry from Labor and the Greens. What's really disappointing is the full-throated support of the corporate tax panic from the Coalition.</p><p>Government senators on the committee wrote a dissenting minority report. Yet their complaint was that the committee did not fully acknowledge all the exciting work the Abbott government was doing to clamp down on multinationals.</p><p>Earlier this year the government released its own proposed legislation to deal with corporate tax avoidance. In effect that legislation would empower the ATO to second-guess where it feels profits should be booked for tax purposes.</p><p>The consequences of such an approach would be dire. It would expose multinational firms to double taxation. It would be a huge incentive for those firms to leave Australia all together, taking jobs and economic activity with them.</p><p>All this fretting about tax avoidance makes good demagoguery. But it might seriously harm Australia's economy.</p><p>Chris Berg is a senior fellow at the Institute of Public Affairs and Sinclair Davidson is professor of institutional economics at RMIT in Melbourne.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Fruitless: Senator Sam Dastyari during a Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance in July.

Hundreds and hundreds of thinkers, academics, experts in the area and scholars of the trends of the present: technological developments, concentrated under the ownership and control of a few companies, is a challenge much more much deeper and much more structural for individual, political and functional liberations of democracies.</p><p><br/>Although in the United States, Canada, and Europe, there are constant appearances of highly qualified voices warning of ongoing dangers; although there are dozens of books published in the last three or four years that detail their analyses; although there are already numerous universities where there are groups conducting different research, in general terms, my feeling is that the majority of citizens, especially in Latin America, are far from in-house in their public affairs agenda, the real risk that companies such as Google, Facebook, Instagram, Amazon and others, represent in the personal sphere, in the citizen exercise and in the public space.<br/>It favors the technological ones that we are citizens, who, between innocent and satisfied, we deliver our data and use the services they offer us, without us end of understanding, that this data is analyzed, classified, sold and serve the most various purposes. The most obvious of all is that of its use as input to create products and services, or to design marketing campaigns. The so-called big data is, as has been said, the new oil in the world.<br/>The noun is that the study, with methods based on neurobiology, psychology and sociology, allows us to predict our decisions and behaviors, and, even more burdensome in my judgment, to influence or manipulate our feelings, to influence or manipulate our feelings, to influence or manipulate our feelings, to push us towards certain positions in the political, the social and on issues fundamental to coexistence, such as our thinkings and attitudes towards the racial, the religious and the ideological, or towards substantive problems such as migration, poverty, gender-based violence and many more. Put another way: the great technological, and also the governments of some countries, are dedicated to the surveillance of our brains, they invest enormous resources in it, focused on the purpose of increasing the knowledge and techniques to control our minds. It's what Shoshana Zuboff, an economist and professor emeritus at Harvard University, has called surveillance capitalism. In an interview published in XL Weekly magazine, he gave a categorical opinion: \"Industrial capitalism destroys the planet. Surveillance capitalism destroys human nature.\"<br/>Another fundamental issue, which also questions those responsible for social media, is the acquiescence or permissiveness towards hatred - in fact, towards the normalization of hatred as a social practice - the impoverishment of the language and towards the increasing recurrent use of networks as tools for digital lynching. The recent case of Veronica Rubio, a 32-year-old Spanish mother who chose suicide, once a video of sexual content circulated between her acquaintances and in her workplace, is an unequivocal alert to how the principle of free speech transgresses to make a perverse and destructive use of a person's reputation.<br/>The increasingly repeated point towards technological ones that allow violence with words and images, stumbles upon a considerable conceptual difficulty: that the thorny issue of freedom ofExpression. On the noun side, Democrats - and above all, those of us who have devoted our entire lives to the defense of the media - oppose regulations or obstacles to free speech. But there are fragile and complex boundaries between information and misinformation, between opinion and manipulation, between debate and digital lynching, on which society must agree - which must include legislation on this - because this is the game, nothing less than the sustainability of democracy. The more lynchings, hatreds, false news, distortions of reality and unfounded accusations circulate in the public space, the greater the fragility of the democratic model.<br/>But there is still another issue, which I know directly, which is the undermining that big tech is currently exerting on the media economy: as a result of the high traffic of users through their pages - on Google, for example, more than 3.5 billion searches a day - have achieved the concentration of advertising investment, from which they take a disproportionate advantage: they get a huge percentage of the money from advertisers, and only a marginal part goes to the companies that produce information and content. This does not happen without a dangerous result: increasingly impoverished media, which impacts their sustainability and phases out them, reducing the breadth of the offer of information and opinion, which is one of the fundamentals of Democracy.<br/>The matters to which I have referred in this article are truly key. It is substantive: the defense of democracy and individual and political freedoms, also requires agreements of society and legislation, which limit the action of the great technological. Otherwise, the risks are incalculable: fewer media, increasingly weakened media, more recurrent hate and digital lynching practices and, as a livelihood of all of the above, a citizen come to a less, manipulable, uninformed and fraught with prejudice.

The Wall Street giant didn't really say anything new, but its conclusions reinforced the notion that the oil era is winding down and that renewable energy would soak up the bulk of the entire energy industry's investment dollars.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Specifically, the report, \"Carbonomics: The green engine of economic recovery,\" said that renewable power will emerge as the No. 1 area of energy spending in 2021, usurping oil and gas spending for the first time, and that the green transition will drive US$1-trillion to US$2-trillion per year - per year! - in infrastructure investments, while generating as many as 20 million new jobs worldwide.</p><h>Texte/Text</h><p>All encouraging news, if true, and even better news for the planet. The United Nations has predicted all sorts of life-threatening calamities if carbon emissions push average global temperatures beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>When I read the Goldman Sachs report, and similar ones in recent weeks, my first thought was that we are on the verge of an investment bonanza that might make the spectacular returns seen by Big Tech (Facebook, Amazon, Tesla and others) in recent years look like a minor upward deviation in the wealth-creation norm. My second thought: Here we go - Wall Street and its glorified bucket shops, as they always do, have found another class of investments to ram down our throats. For sure we will get the good, but we will also get the bad and the ugly.</p><p>Royal Dutch Shell, one of the world's biggest oil and gas companies, is a case in point. On Thursday the company's London-listed shares hit a 25-year low. They fell again Friday, for a one-year plunge of 60 per cent.</p><p>Yes, oil companies are dying beasts, according to believers in the green revolution, but Shell recently made it clear that it had no intention of tripping headfirst into a grubby grave. It would downgrade its oil ambitions, cut costs big time, launch an ambitious decarbonization effort and dive deep into renewable and low-carbon fuels, such as hydrogen. BP, the former British Petroleum, did the same - it too would evolve into a groovy and politically correct \"energy\" company - yet its shares also kept sinking, hitting a 52-week low Friday.</p><p>The share plunge was investors' way of saying that the transformation of Big Oil into Big Energy is either unwarranted or will not succeed. Oil companies have made fortunes for a century by pumping hydrocarbons from the ground and may not be able to repeat that success by producing clean, or cleaner, forms of energy - wind, solar, hydro, biomass, hydrogen, nuclear, geothermal and technologies yet to be invented. The highly successful overhaul of Orsted, the Danish oil, gas and coal company that traded hydrocarbons for wind power, becoming the world's largest offshore wind developer remarkably fast, may not be easily cloned.</p><p>There are a lot of reasons to believe the green revolution is finally coming - and to believe that it may be less glorious and bankable for investors than advertised.</p><p>In green energy's favour is its relatively low cost of capital - the blended cost of the equity and debt required to build a new project. For a company to avoid a slow-motion suicide, project returns must exceed those costs.</p><p>The Goldman Sachs report noted that green infrastructure is far more capital- and job-intensive than traditional energy projects, but its cost of capital has plummeted as investors shy away from hydrocarbon plays and throw their money at projects that are morally safe and come with less-volatile long-term returns - the kind pension funds love. Goldman Sachs said the cost of capital for oil and gas projects is 10 per cent to 20 per cent; for green projects, it's only 3 per cent to 5 per cent. There is no contest - green wins. The point being, waning demand for oil might not kill the hydrocarbon industry, but rising costs of capital could.</p><p>That's the good news for green investments The bad news is that renewable energy projects have thrived not so much because they make business and environmental sense but because governments have been sucking fortunes out of the pockets of taxpayers to subsidize them. This is generally done through generous \"feed-in\" tariffs, in which utilities pay producers of renewable energy artificially high prices - for years.</p><p>While some of these subsidies are coming down, they are still largely in place. What happens when they disappear? Governments around the world are paying horrendous costs to fight the pandemic. At some point they will be looking for savings, and the feed-in tariffs might get the chop. Were that to happen, investors' returns might take a dive.</p><p>Even Tesla, the ultimate poster company for the green economy, is in effect subsidized through government regulations. Tesla's core electric-car manufacturing doesn't make a profit; what does is the sale of environmental credits to companies, such as Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, that can't meet the new carbon-emission rules because their fleets lack hybrid and battery-only vehicles.</p><p>Another issue is carbon pricing. If the price of carbon spewed into the atmosphere were US$50 to US$100 a ton, hydrocarbons would be effectively taxed out of existence. Goldman Sachs says the average global carbon price is only US$3 a ton, barely enough to move the needle.</p><p>Goldman Sachs and the other investment firms that are touting the green revolution are directionally right. Renewable energy momentum is building. But don't forget that Wall Street, the City of London and Bay Street exist to flog investment products to the smart and the gullible alike.

The hours of digital deadness shook its billions of users to the core.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Police in Christchurch used Twitter to get ahead of the emergency, reminding people not to call them as they had in the past, because they could obviously do nothing about the drop-out.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There were hundreds of stories published all over the world within an hour. It was huge news.</p><p>That's understandable. Facebook, with it's 2.3 billion users, Instagram with 1 billion and Gmail with 1.5 billion users are the most widely used services that have ever existed.</p><p>READ MORE: * Blayne Slabbert: Why you should delete your Facebook page * Facebook, Google and Amazon might strike out in 'the rest of the world' * Facebook, Twitter defend efforts to stop election meddling * The tech party is over</p><p>When billions of people can't access them to undertake their daily business, be that social or otherwise, it reverberates around the globe within seconds.</p><p>If the drop-out was not due to a cyber attack (as Facebook quickly moved to reassure that it wasn't), it is unlikely anyone suffered much more than inconvenience from the temporary shutdowns. Emails could not be sent, your Facebook status could not updated and pictures were not shared.</p><p>The greater impact of the glitch was that it demonstrated with a startling clarity just how reliant we have become on a handful of suppliers of technology and how enmeshed they are in our day to day lives. When one slips, we all stumble.</p><p>Facebook, Alphabet (the parent company of Google), Apple, Amazon and Microsoft are the suppliers of that technology and are also the five biggest companies in the world. They are collectively known as Big Tech but they are just as often referred to as the Frightful Five.</p><p>Quite apart from the logistical vulnerability built into relying on so few suppliers for the bulk of the tools we use to navigate our digital world, the concentration of so much power in a handful of corporations has implications we are only beginning to become aware of.</p><p>Just two years ago Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg laughed off as preposterous claims his platform had been used to influence the 2016 US election.</p><p>It didn't take him long to back-pedal on that, his initial denial an indication even he didn't fully comprehend the power 2.3 billion users gave Facebook. Or how that power could be hijacked.</p><p>Google, founded on the premise of doing no evil, is so incredibly successful it now has a virtual monopoly on controlling how we access the internet.</p><p>The algorithm that controls its search engine results is an absolute secret but that algorithm can determine the success or failure of a business or even an idea. We have to take it on trust they aren't snuffing out any competition, or opinion, they disagree with.</p><p>Apple and Amazon have also been accused of stifling competition by using their dominant positions to heavily promote their own products.

Uber disrupts public transit. Palantir augments security. SpaceX plots our exodus to Mars. And when the Defense Department modernizes its computing infrastructure by awarding its $10 billion JEDI contract to Amazon (or one of the less likely contenders), it will be another indication that Washington can't go it alone.</p><p>But Washington isn't moving toward a privatization that encourages competition, as was theoretically true of classical procurement. Big tech is building new dependencies in government and giving businesses powers over the executive branch that would make Congress salivate. In a sense, Silicon Valley is slowly becoming a potential check and balance on executive authority.</p><p>Consider what happened when a small minority of Google employees feared that working on defense-related issues might compromise their ethics. They objected to the JEDI contract and Google bowed out, in part, because it couldn't be assured the work \"would align with our AI Principles.\" These artificial intelligence principles had been written less than three months prior in response to another employee protest against a different Pentagon contract.</p><p>Up in Seattle, Amazon and Microsoft are facing an impending battle regarding the use of facial recognition software by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. After a Freedom of Information Act request revealed that Amazon was soliciting ICE as a customer, dozens of employees signed petitions decrying the possible use of Amazon's surveillance system on the southern border. No contracts have been signed yet by the company. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Post.)</p><p>The most famous policy battle happened two years ago when the world's largest company exercised control over its dominion: Apple chief executive Tim Cook refrained from helping the FBI get into a locked iPhone after a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. The phone was opened without Apple's consent, but the case is hardly settled.</p><p>These policy rebukes are not driven by lobbyists in Washington; they're groundswells inside companies in California and Washington state. Never before have a handful of companies had the power to rebuke federal policy directly in matters of security, defense and immigration. Imagine that Delta Air Lines defied Homeland Security by refusing to abide by the TSA's No Fly List. It couldn't. But if Delta were one of the few airlines in the world, traveling faster than any competitors, it might have more pull. Tech companies today often have scale and singularity in their favor.</p><p>The tradeoffs of privatization did not begin with big tech. The Harvard Business Review warned of the privatization of government in 1991 shortly after the Reagan administration decreed \"don't just stand there, undo something.\" The era of denationalization began globally and hasn't declined. City governments, too, were reliant on companies for management of services, but tech accelerated the trend. Take Altamonte Springs, Fla., for example, which recently got rid of most city buses in lieu of offering subsidized Uber rides. Or Chicago, where Elon Musk's Boring Co. is paying to build a mass transit system to O'Hare International Airport.</p><p>The previous debate over privatization was a philosophical one - is this the kind of government we want? But this new debate is more pragmatic: How do we modernize the government's crumbling digital infrastructure without giving tech too much control?</p><p>The irony of these questions is that the vast majority of tech employees do not appear to want a diminished federal government. A recent Wired analysis of the midterm elections found that of the 125,000 political contributions by employees of Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft, 23 percent went to Democratic candidates while roughly 1 percent funded Republicans. (The remainder went to issue-related causes.)  This great \"undoing\" of national government is being executed by self-proclaimed progressives who would cringe at the thought of enacting Reagan's utopia via software updates.</p><p>Still, it's clear this growing shift in power must be addressed. Some are floating the idea of a chief ethics officer at tech companies; others suggest something like the Federal Reserve Board, a body of nonpartisan experts and academics who are tasked with updating government-set standards and policies quarterly.</p><p>What's needed imminently, though, is a mind-set shift - not just by tech companies, but by elected officials who've long seen themselves as responders to disruption, not initiators of it. If companies continue to take on government functions, Washington will have to start acting more like a portfolio manager rather than a regulator, rewarding the companies that enact good practices and incentivizing tech companies to build for civic needs.</p><p>But until there's a Senate Committee on Technology Partnerships that's as active as the Foreign Relations Committee, Silicon Valley will remain a shadow capital, subsuming the roles of government as Washington slowly competes away its influence.</p><p>The writer is a venture capitalist at General Catalyst in San Francisco.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Uber disrupts public transit. Palantir augments security. SpaceX plots our exodus to Mars. And when the Defense Department modernizes its computing infrastructure by awarding its $10 billion JEDI contract to Amazon (or one of the less likely contenders), it will be another indication that Washington can't go it alone.</p><p>But Washington isn't moving toward a privatization that encourages competition, as was theoretically true of classical procurement. Big tech is building new dependencies in government and giving businesses powers over the executive branch that would make Congress salivate. In a sense, Silicon Valley is slowly becoming a potential check and balance on executive authority.</p><p>Consider what happened when a small minority of Google employees feared that working on defense-related issues might compromise their ethics. They objected to the JEDI contract and Google bowed out, in part, because it couldn't be assured the work \"would align with our AI Principles.\" These artificial intelligence principles had been written less than three months prior in response to another employee protest against a different Pentagon contract.</p><p>Up in Seattle, Amazon and Microsoft are facing an impending battle regarding the use of facial recognition software by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. After a Freedom of Information Act request revealed that Amazon was soliciting ICE as a customer, dozens of employees signed petitions decrying the possible use of Amazon's surveillance system on the southern border. No contracts have been signed yet by the company. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeffrey P. Bezos owns The Post.) </p><p>The most famous policy battle happened two years ago when the world's largest company exercised control over its dominion: Apple chief executive Tim Cook refrained from helping the FBI get into a locked iPhone after a mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. The phone was opened without Apple's consent, but the case is hardly settled.</p><p>These policy rebukes are not driven by lobbyists in Washington; they're groundswells inside companies in California and Washington state. Never before have a handful of companies had the power to rebuke federal policy directly in matters of security, defense and immigration. Imagine that Delta Air Lines defied Homeland Security by refusing to abide by the TSA's No Fly List. It couldn't. But if Delta were one of the few airlines in the world, traveling faster than any competitors, it might have more pull. Tech companies today often have scale and singularity in their favor.</p><p>The tradeoffs of privatization did not begin with big tech. The Harvard Business Review warned of the privatization of government in 1991 shortly after the Reagan administration decreed \"don't just stand there, undo something.\" The era of denationalization began globally and hasn't declined. City governments, too, were reliant on companies for management of services, but tech accelerated the trend. Take Altamonte Springs, Fla., for example, which recently got rid of most city buses in lieu of offering subsidized Uber rides. Or Chicago, where Elon Musk's Boring Co. is paying to build a mass transit system to O'Hare International Airport.          </p><p>The previous debate over privatization was a philosophical one - is this the kind of government we want? But this new debate is more pragmatic: How do we modernize the government's crumbling digital infrastructure without giving tech too much control?</p><p>The irony of these questions is that the vast majority of tech employees do not appear to want a diminished federal government. A recent Wired analysis of the midterm elections found that of the 125,000 political contributions by employees of Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft, 23 percent went to Democratic candidates while roughly 1 percent funded Republicans. (The remainder went to issue-related causes.)  This great \"undoing\" of national government is being executed by self-proclaimed progressives who would cringe at the thought of enacting Reagan's utopia via software updates.</p><p>Still, it's clear this growing shift in power must be addressed. Some are floating the idea of a chief ethics officer at tech companies; others suggest something like the Federal Reserve Board, a body of nonpartisan experts and academics who are tasked with updating government-set standards and policies quarterly.</p><p>What's needed imminently, though, is a mind-set shift - not just by tech companies, but by elected officials who've long seen themselves as responders to disruption, not initiators of it. If companies continue to take on government functions, Washington will have to start acting more like a portfolio manager rather than a regulator, rewarding the companies that enact good practices and incentivizing tech companies to build for civic needs.</p><p>But until there's a Senate Committee on Technology Partnerships that's as active as the Foreign Relations Committee, Silicon Valley will remain a shadow capital, subsuming the roles of government as Washington slowly competes away its influence.</p><p>The writer is a venture capitalist at General Catalyst in San Francisco.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

There were those who wanted no regulation - this was the future, don't spoil it with red tape. And there were those who wanted lots of it. These four-ton monsters were dangerous. Someone would get killed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 1865, after much toing and froing, the Locomotive Act was introduced. Not only did it set a 4mph speed limit, but it also made it compulsory that a person \"shall precede such locomotive on foot by not less than 60 yards, and shall carry a red flag constantly displayed, and shall warn the riders and drivers of horses of the approach of such locomotives\". Draconian, cried the nascent car lobby, a put-up job by the train lobby.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What followed, as those car lobbyists predicted, was a whole host of further regulations - brakes became standard, then brake lights, headlights, indicators, seatbelts, airbags, crumple zones, automated collision avoidance systems, windscreen wipers. Yes, people still die in car crashes, but where would the automotive industry be today if it hadn't been for regulation? The red tape didn't stop invention. It made it better.</p><p>This month, we have reached the same pivotal point in the digital world. Ahead are two discrete paths. The first lets Big Tech continue to enjoy self-regulation and to \"move fast and break things\" - as Mark Zuckerberg's strategy for Facebook innovation went. The second leads to the digital equivalent of men walking in front of cars with red flags.</p><p>Until now, Silicon Valley has resisted that second path with a combination of intransigence, promises and, quite simply, not turning up to committee meetings. Now a large swathe of that resistance looks as if it's coming to an end, thanks largely to a cross-discipline, cross-bench and cross-house crack team that includes Baroness Beeban Kidron; the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham; the children's commissioner, Anne Longfield; and Margot James, minister for digital and the creative industries.</p><p>The Age-Appropriate Design Code - or Kids' Code for short - is an extrapolation of last year's Data Protection Act, which introduced tough rules about how our data can be handled.</p><p>\"For the first time, kids have special rights in the law,\" says Denham, who is responsible for the legislation, which is currently in public consultation. \"The code translates those rights into practical standards that companies and service providers will take and build into our digital future. Ten years ago, most of the conversation was about safety and security - keeping kids off pornographic sites, making sure that they're not lured by adults online, protection from cyber-bullying. Now there's a broader conversation to have because websites have been developed in a way that really robs children of agency.\"</p><p>The 16 standards set out in the Kids' Code will amount to a comprehensive, radical change in the digital lives of children. Standard one sets the tone. It states that if children are likely to be using a service, then \"the best interests of a child should be a primary consideration\". As any parent of a YouTubing, Instagramming, Fortniteing teenager will tell you, this is not currently the case.</p><p>Tech firms will have to make their services \"suitable by default\" for all children. Adults can then decide if they want to access sections of the service that are not appropriate for children via robust age verification. In other words, the digital world arrives child-friendly and needs to be tailored to display the grown-up stuff, rather than the other way around, as it is now.</p><p>Companies will no longer be able to share a child's data. They will only be able to collect the minimum amount of data needed to \"provide the elements in which a child is actively and knowingly engaged\".</p><p>Services will be on high-privacy settings by default. Profiling options will be limited drastically. Instead of burying important information about data use in the 147th clause of the 15th page of the terms and conditions, there will have to be clear messaging at the point of entry. If any ulterior motives survive, they will have to be there, in plain sight. Not quite \"We are using your data to sell you stuff\", but not far off.</p><p>There is more. The psychological tricks used prolifically online to keep us addicted will not be allowed under the code if children are likely to be using the service. Likes on Facebook, streaks on Snapchat and games that reward regular log-ons, don't have a save option and give you bonus points if you message friends - all gone.</p><p>\"When you like or streak or share something,\" Denham says, \"you're leaving a digital footprint. And those digital footprints are what the company wants to encourage you to stay online and to deliver advertising. A larger digital footprint allows more personalisation of content, more delivery of advertising and messages that are increasingly more provocative about subjects that a child is interested in.\" All of which will stop under the Kids' Code.</p><p>Those smart devices - the interactive home hubs, the connected thermostats, vacuum cleaners and speakers, the talking teddy bears and wireless baby monitors that sit quietly in our homes gathering intel - will also have to comply with the code. If there are children in the home, Alexa, Siri and friends will no longer be able to listen in unless parents opt to downgrade settings.</p><p>Perhaps most significantly of all, the code will tackle digital rabbit holes. On social media sites and video-streaming services, algorithms are designed to keep you hooked. You found one guide to self-harm, here are 47 more. With restrictions on data-sharing, profiling and geolocating, this psychological snare will no longer be a central part of the digital world's business plan. Should the Kids' Code make it through consultation, the internet will never be the same again.</p><p>Sitting in the riverside tearoom half a corridor along from the House of Lords chamber, Baroness Beeban Kidron, the Bafta-winning filmmaker and children's rights campaigner, remembers the lightbulb moment when she first understood the degree to which children were unprotected online.</p><p>\"It was 2012 and the smartphone had just hit a price point where a parent would give it to a child,\" she says. \"They were suddenly endemic, these mobile universes, and because they were mobile, they were beyond a parent's reach. I was making a documentary [InRealLife] about kids growing up in a connected world, and I was talking to people at the heart of tech. They all held on to that founder's vision - that technology is democratising, that there is no gatekeeper, that all users are equal. Then it clicked - if all users are treated equally then, de facto, you treat a kid as if they're an adult. In no other area of life do we do that.\"</p><p>Kidron went on to spend hundreds of hours watching the way children use the internet or, more pertinently, the way the internet uses children. \"I could see that all of the decisions the kids were being asked to make, all of the critical understanding it assumed they had, was based on the assumption that they were adults.\"</p><p>Data is 21st-century gold. The more data a company can gather, the more valuable it becomes. This is why we are followed around the internet by adverts for a shirt we once considered buying. It's why you can have a conversation about pizza and then find an offer for pizza in your inbox.</p><p>When I mention that I have a smart thermostat from Nest - a company that Google acquired in 2014 - Kidron takes a long, deep breath like a teacher about to explain trigonometry for the umpteenth time. \"If you click through everyone that Nest shares your data with, that's 1,000 sets of terms and conditions you've automatically agreed to, according to research by University of London,\" she says. \"If it does not worry you that your household details are being shared with at least 1,000 companies, then fine. But if you put 1,000 people in your house and asked them to stand silently watching what you and your family were doing, you might feel different.\"</p><p>Many of us, myself included, don't fully comprehend quite how much of this data gold we give away or the myriad ways it is used to profile us and then modify our spending habits, our behaviour, even the way we vote. We are scandalised when we hear about security breaches, but agree to our personal information, tastes, habits and - in the case of robot vacuum cleaners - floorplans being spread around the ether.</p><p>After an eye-opening hour with Kidron, I'm less ignorant and less happy. Thousands of very clever people are devoted to keeping us online for as long as possible. The more Big Tech knows about us, the more it can make us do what it wants. Children need protecting from this. So, perhaps, do adults - but that's for another time.</p><p>Three years after her epiphany, Kidron founded 5Rights, to fight for the established rights of children in the analogue world to be applied to the digital world. She is very much the architect of the Kids' Code.</p><p>\"We are not killjoys,\" she says. \"We're not against tech at all. What we're saying is, 'Give us a truly marvellous new world in which you have considered whether moving fast and breaking things means you're moving fast and breaking our kids.' \"</p><p>Some in the tech lobby have claimed that regulation amounts to censorship - anathema to the core ethos of Silicon Valley. Kidron has no time for this. \"This is about data practice,\" she says. \"If a child seeks out certain things and they try really hard, they will always find it. The point is how you normatively treat them and how you uphold your own terms and conditions. There are strict rules in advertising, in medicine, in publishing. The digital world should be no different.\"</p><p>The children's commissioner, Anne Longfield, describes herself as \"the eyes and ears\" of children, sticking up for their rights. In the physical world, she tells me those rights are usually clear and understood, but it's different online. \"It's been so fast and so disorganised and, frankly, everyone has been overwhelmed by it,\" she says. \"What is clear with the free flow of content, the algorithms that encourage addictive tendencies and the business model as a whole is that they have not been designed with kids in mind.\"</p><p>She points out that children don't receive the same level of parental support online as they do in the analogue world \"because parents themselves haven't got that experience. They haven't grown up with the digital world, so they don't know as much. Children are at the forefront of this new world without protection or guidance.\"</p><p>In November 2017, Molly Russell, a 14-year-old schoolgirl, was found dead in her bedroom. Her father believes she killed herself after viewing material about anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide on social media sites including Instagram. Earlier this year, Ian Russell told BBC News that Instagram \"helped kill my daughter\". Since then, at least 30 families have contacted the suicide prevention charity Papyrus to say they believe social media was a factor in the deaths of their children.</p><p>In January, Longfield wrote an open letter to the biggest social media companies urging them to take \"a moment to reflect\" on the schoolgirl's tragic death. \"The potential disruption to all user experiences should no longer be a brake on making the safety and wellbeing of young people a top priority,\" she wrote.</p><p>Today Longfield says the imagery on self-harm and suicide were \"pushed to [Molly] by the algorithm. It understood what she asked to see and sent more of it and it became more extreme. No one else was understanding or assessing the impact that this might have on a vulnerable person.\"</p><p>Longfield herself searched for the hashtag #selfharm and was, as she puts it, \"horrified not only by the volume, but by the explicit nature of what I saw. Tech is not the cause, but it is the accelerant. Kids already have the pressure of growing up. Now they have the pressure of constant communication.\"</p><p>In a recent exercise, the Children's Commission translated the terms and conditions of five of the biggest tech companies into plain English, cutting an average 5,500-word document down to one side of A4, and then took them into schools. \"It didn't stop the children going online, but it did make them think about it differently,\" Longfield says. \"They were more careful with what they wrote and what decisions they made.\"</p><p>When the Kids' Code arrives, this level of clarity will become mandatory.</p><p>In a straw poll at our school gate, precisely 100% of parents were hugely in favour of the code. Best interests of the child? Finally. Default settings to high privacy? Of course. No profiling? \"Can we sign up for this, too?\" And this is the whole point. Most parents are worried about technology, but are relatively powerless to police it. With a lot of discussion and some argument, I managed to keep my eldest off Instagram until he was 13. Even though Instagram is for over-12s only, most of his friends already had an account, some for several years. It is a war of attrition, us versus those clever people in Silicon Valley, and it is unwinnable.</p><p>In the past, I've blamed other parents. Why let an eight-year-old on social media? But, as Kidron points out, blaming parents is a go-to dodge of Big Tech. How a child exists in the digital world is down to parents, they say. Except, in reality, it's not as easy as that. To monitor at all times is exhausting. Why not make the digital world more child-friendly in the first place?</p><p>As minister for digital and the creative industries, it is part of Margot James's brief to, as she puts it, \"foster an environment where innovation thrives\". \"This is,\" she says, \"particularly important for small and growing businesses. Otherwise you'll just concentrate more and more power in the hands of the very big companies. And we will all be the losers for that.\"</p><p>She is, however, another advocate for regulation. \"It's important that we listen to those who are opposed, but no longer will they be able to make decisions with scant regard to the unintended harms that have arisen from the very liberal environment that tech has enjoyed to date. Until now, the needs of children have been an afterthought and only in response to a big outcry.</p><p>\"I don't have children myself,\" she says, \"but I do have two great-nieces who are under the age of 12 and so I see it first-hand, the worries and concerns that parents have in this area as children get to the age when they need to be using the internet for all the benefits it offers. Parents are extremely worried, and with good reason.\"</p><p>James was \"persuaded in the space of one meeting\" that what Kidron was doing was important.</p><p>Responses from children's charities, teachers and parent organisations are resoundingly in favour of the draft code, as are some tech firms. Facebook's response has been ... lukewarm. It claims the code risks \"dumbing down controls for young people who are often highly capable in using digital services\". It invokes the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in arguing against \"barriers\" to a child's freedom of expression. Google \"agrees with the ambitions of the code\", but wants to \"maintain a degree of flexibility\". If, for example, geolocation data is restricted, how is a child going to find the quickest route to school?</p><p>\"The time for self-regulation - especially from large platforms - is over,\" Denham says. \"People want a more responsible and more human-focused way forward. We didn't expect the big tech companies to like it, but that's no reason to put it in the too-hard pile. I am laser-focused on this and it's not just because I have a young granddaughter who loves playing on her tablet. I want to leave this area of regulation in a better place so that we can truly protect the agency of our kids online.\"</p><p>Kidron is also laser-focused. She tells me the tech sector is now conscious that doing nothing is no longer an option, \"but I have been told by numerous sources that they are quietly lobbying to water down the code. This is a moment where they could stand up and make some of the pronouncements they've made recently a reality for children.\"</p><p>\"It will happen,\" Denham concludes. And when it does, I suspect, it will seem crazy that it didn't happen sooner. Almost as crazy as having cars without brakes.</p><p>                   The 16 rules set out in the Kids' Code                   1                   </p><p> The child's best interests should be the primary consideration in any services likely to be accessed by a child.</p><p>                   2                   </p><p> Age-appropriate standards must apply to all users.

Tens of billions of dollars were wiped from Facebook's value in just a few days. Other tech companies, including Google, also suffered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Amazon was spared. Earlier this week the online retailer overtook Alphabet, the parent company of Google, to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/amazon-briefly-overtakes-web-rival-alphabet-in-market-value\">become the second-highest-valued company in the world</url> : worth $768bn. The leader is Apple, with a\u00a0market capitalisation of $889bn.</p><p>The resilience of Apple and Amazon relative to Facebook reflects a market judgment that their businesses are more anchored in the analogue world. Their users acquire tangible products - phones or books. Facebook is in trouble because its users are the product. The company's most lucrative asset is the intimate self-portraits in data that people have fed into the site. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/amazon-briefly-overtakes-web-rival-alphabet-in-market-value\">The\u00a0Cambridge Analytica breach</url> shows that Facebook is\u00a0not to be trusted with that information.</p><p>But then consider how much information Amazon\u00a0has\u00a0about its users. The goods that you buy say a lot about who you are. Amazon is also in the TV streaming business. It is reported to be looking for ways into the\u00a0healthcare business. Via Alexa, its \"home\u00a0assistant\", it is in the domestic service business. Who, really, does\u00a0Alexa serve?</p><p>Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple - or Gafa as they have come to be known - represent something entirely new and all too familiar. Their penetration into the personal lives of citizens is vast, on a scale once imagined only in dystopian fictions. But they are also an old-fashioned oligopoly. Would-be challengers struggle to grow in their shadow. Many users of Instagram and WhatsApp, for example, probably do not even realise that those services belong to Facebook.</p><p>There is nothing intrinsically wicked in businesses wanting to grow and make money. It is rational behaviour by successful market players. But there is a\u00a0reason why regulations exist to stop any individual or group of players having disproportionate dominance. US antitrust laws came into existence towards the end of the 19th century as it became clear that the accumulation of power by vast conglomerates, in the oil and transport sectors, for\u00a0example, was suffocating competition. The law needed to keep up\u00a0with the changing character of industrialisation. The same is true now.</p><p>A difference is that today's corporations transcend national borders. They are not above the law but it is not always obvious which laws apply where. The government of a small or medium-sized country has limited capacity to impose its will. That is one reason why the EU's competition commission - pooling the authority of 28 nations - has been able to challenge Google over alleged abuses of its capacity to skew internet shopping searches, tilting them towards its own services. (The company was last year <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/amazon-briefly-overtakes-web-rival-alphabet-in-market-value\">fined (EURO)2.4bn.</url> ) The European commission is also looking at methods for taxing digital revenues across the EU, judging that tech giants currently avoid paying their fair share by booking profits in lenient national jurisdictions. It is notable that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-20/amazon-briefly-overtakes-web-rival-alphabet-in-market-value\">Theresa May has identified</url> competition law as an area where she envisages the UK staying closely aligned with the rest of Europe after Brexit. Global businesses listen to\u00a0continent-sized regulators.</p><p>But the Gafa challenge goes beyond the application of existing rules. It raises questions about the adequacy of protections designed for an analogue economy. The existing rules have, over time, come to be seen largely as tools of consumer protection. They still have that function, but antitrust law was also originally conceived as a device to correct big structural imbalances in the economy. The current moment requires a regulatory intervention on a vast scale: a back-to-basics approach that addresses the systemic dominance of a few titanic corporations. The nature of their businesses was not imagined when existing laws were written and their power is of an order that now rivals that of the governments that would regulate them. This is bad for the market, bad for the consumer and bad for democracy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-42495835</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RXH-1RH1-JCJY-G1XV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"685\"/><timeReceived>5:24 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

One of the successes of the dating app Tinder was that it revealed only that a user liked another when the feeling was mutual. The wealth of information that such software requests may help to home in on the perfect match, but it also raises important questions over how the data is stored and what rights one has over it. Very little, if the case we reported earlier this week is anything to go by. In that story it took months for a journalist to extract her Tinder data. More than 800 pages of her most intimate life details - volunteered when using the dating app - tumbled out.</p><p>In a world where personal data is increasingly shared and manipulated, there is an increasing risk that it might leak. The European Union, to its credit, understands that individuals might object to the way a tech company deals with their personal data. The EU's general data protection regulation (GDPR) sensibly attempts to strengthen a user's control over their data: in certain instances, companies are required to get explicit consent for how they use data. Fines for violations will be steep: up to (EURO)20m (\u00a317.5m). It also grants users access to their personal data. This is important: as our story points out, Tinder shares personal information with other tech giants which then use it to build a picture about users.</p><p>The personal data affects who you see first on Tinder but it can also be used to decide what job offers you have access to, or how much you will pay for car insurance. We found that Tinder only disclosed what it wanted to. Crucially, the company did not say how \"attractive\" the reporter had been rated - nor explained how this metric had been calculated. The Silicon Valley firm argued that as the data was always in the US, it had no legal duty to give her anything. This is wrong morally, if not in law.</p><p>In effect, US big tech is engaging in jurisdictional arbitrage - taking advantage of the discrepancies between competing regulatory systems - to shelter what it does with personal data from oversight. US firms are not processing data in Europe for fear of falling under stricter EU regulations - something that became obvious after Google found itself liable for data-handling in Spain, a case that led to the landmark \" right to be forgotten \" ruling. The GDPR is supposed to level up protections; but one of Donald Trump's first acts was to say he would give non-US citizens less data protection than US ones despite previous assurances from Washington. The result is the growth of a US-centred tech economy where sensitive data is shared with little accountability.</p><p>In the case that the Guardian highlighted it took a lawyer, a technologist and a reporter to pierce the corporate veil and work out where personal data was processed. It's a global issue: Russia has told Facebook it would block access to the social network unless it stores the personal data of Russian citizens on its soil. Britain's new data bill, supposed to incorporate the GDPR, looks badly drafted. A concern is that UK regulators will simply take tech giants at their word. We are heading to a society where personal data is ever more influential. But its collection, storage and aggregation remains opaque. Shielding it impinges on people's right to make decisions for themselves and ultimately restricts their\u00a0individualism.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-37876381</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PKD-8X91-JCJY-G18M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"574\"/><timeReceived>7:15 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

National leaders go into conclave and emerge with nominees whose connection to citizens of member states feels tenuous.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The outcome inevitably represents a complex, multilateral compromise. The new European commission president, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/03/ursula-von-der-leyen-on-mission-to-win-over-meps-in-strasbourg-european-commission\">Ursula von der Leyen</url>, is a German Christian Democrat who was few people's first choice but proved less distasteful than rivals to various caucuses. The same is true of Charles Michel, the Belgian prime minister, who replaces Donald Tusk as president of the European council. Christine Lagarde, currently leading the IMF, will be       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/03/ursula-von-der-leyen-on-mission-to-win-over-meps-in-strasbourg-european-commission\">head of the European Central Bank</url>, and Josep Borrell, Spain's foreign minister, is teed up for the role of high representative for foreign affairs.</p><p>That two of the top four are women helps to redress an imbalance that has plagued EU institutions. Less welcome is the fact that all are from the western side of the continent. This looks like \"old Europe\" keeping a grip on institutions to the exclusion of countries that acceded later. There is already a cultural divide between early adopters of the European project - who see themselves as curators of its founding ideals - and later entrants, who are more suspicious of integration. Putting Ms Von der Leyen at the commission and Ms Lagarde at the ECB also bolsters the Franco-German axis already seen as the EU's most powerful diplomatic channel. Smaller countries feel poorly served.</p><p>None of the big four was originally promoted as Spitzenkandidat - the lead candidate adopted by parties - in European elections. There is no legal or treaty obligation to give top jobs to Spitzenkandidaten, but the system does represent the aspiration to connect commission appointments to an electoral process, and its failure this time looks like a retreat for pan-continental democratisation. The counter-view is that the system simply moved the location of stitch-up to party machines and the timing of the horse-trading to before the election, which is hardly more democratic.</p><p>In the past, such frustrations have had a way of working themselves out in subsequent commissioner nominations and MEP confirmations. But these are fractious times for a union that is challenged by Donald Trump's trade confrontations, a meddlesome Kremlin, and xenophobic populism capturing the mainstream in some member states. In such conditions, the sight of a Brussels power elite sharing out top jobs makes the whole project seem defensive and remote, which in turn brings doubt on the legitimacy of policy decisions taken at the highest level. That is before any common agenda can be sustained to deal with the climate emergency, big tech regulation, migration, and economic rivalry with China - huge challenges for the next commission. And, of course, Brexit is still unresolved.</p><p>The spectacle of Nigel Farage's band of MEPs <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/03/ursula-von-der-leyen-on-mission-to-win-over-meps-in-strasbourg-european-commission\">turning their backs</url> on an opening ceremony for the European parliament this week was a reminder that petty-minded nationalism can have major strategic consequences. Mr Farage was once a marginal figure in Britain and a minor irritant in Brussels, but his relentless campaign to spread mischief and poison has wounded the project he despises. No other country is following the UK out of the EU, but many incubate their own variant strains of Faragism.</p><p>To shore up their integrity, the EU's institutions need to be places where citizens' interests are conspicuously represented, not impenetrable political labyrinths. There is always a tension between the need to manage decision-making in a multinational bloc, requiring old-fashioned haggling, and the principle of democratic accountability. There is also a growing tension between the urgency European leaders feel to find continental solutions to big strategic challenges - which encourages further integration - and the political reform agenda that should devolve power to the lowest level possible. The true test of the new commission and council presidents will be whether they understand that balance, and how capable they are of communicating it not just inside but beyond corridors in Brussels.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-54182170</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WGH-H8R1-JCJY-G0JB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"699\"/><timeReceived>6:43 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

The surveillance economy appears as an existential threat to democracy. Self-regulation is no longer enough. But it is a long way from sentiment to policy. Monday's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/fake-news-report-published-17-19/\">report</url> from the digital, culture, media and sport select committee set out a path. In this work it has had no help from the companies it believes need regulating.</p><p>Facebook, in particular, has shown itself to be arrogant and dishonest. Not only did Mark Zuckerberg refuse to present himself to the committee, as even Rupert Murdoch has done: the underlings he sent in his place gave misleading or untrue accounts. To quote the report: \"Facebook seems willing neither to be regulated nor scrutinised ... Facebook intentionally and knowingly violated both data privacy and anti-competition laws ... We consider that data transfer for value is Facebook's business model and that Mark Zuckerberg's statement that 'we've never sold anyone's data' is simply untrue.\"</p><p>But the problem is wider than just one company. Google and YouTube, which are hardly mentioned in the report, play almost as important a role in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/fake-news-report-published-17-19/\">the dissemination of misinformation</url> online and are just as happy to profit from it. As the information commissioner, Elizabeth Denham, has warned, we are now being sold political ideas online with the same techniques that are used to sell shoes and holidays. And since the cost of buying into the wrong ideas is much less immediately apparent than the pain of ill-fitting or unfashionable shoes, the political sale is much more easily made.</p><p>In her testimony to the committee, the information commissioner put her finger on one of the most important advantages that Facebook has over traditional advertising media. Not only does it know everything its users tell it about themselves; it also compiles \"shadow profiles\", which contain all the information that other users and data collectors have supplied about us. Internal emails obtained by the committee show that the company goes to great lengths to acquire such data from its advertisers. These are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/digital-culture-media-and-sport-committee/news/fake-news-report-published-17-19/\">kept secret</url> from their subjects. Ye Ms Denham argues that they are personal data and should be brought under the remit of existing privacy regulations. This is surely right.</p><p>There is a paradox at the heart of the extraordinary effectiveness of Facebook and YouTube when it comes to the dissemination of ideas. Some people trust what they find there in part because they are so disillusioned with traditional authorities. The online channels, as television did before them, seem to offer an unprecedented intimacy to their users. A smartphone is the friend you take everywhere. But this apparent intimacy is in reality a place where people can be more professionally manipulated than ever before because the advertisers know so much more about us than they could before we entered it.</p><p>Yet this concentration of power offers a paradoxical hope. When a few giant advertising companies control so much of the internet, pressure on them offers governments a means of indirect control over the consumer internet. Once Facebook was threatened with serious fines by the German government if it did not remove hate speech promptly, it discovered that this could after all be done: one in six Facebook moderators now work in Germany. Governments should never entirely control the internet but we need them there to protect society anyway.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-51853107</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFR-NBG1-JCJY-G4H3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"575\"/><timeReceived>6:32 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

As the company points out, there are more than 24,000 competing Android phones available today, from 1,300 companies. How can that possibly constitute a harmful monopoly? Besides, Google has real competition in the smartphone world from Apple. Google's search engine is something that makes our lives easier every day; this would be much less true if it charged users for every answer delivered rather than charging the advertisers for every user delivered to them.</p><p>At the same time, these are exactly the factors that make the commission's decision so interesting and significant. For Google's business to work, it must become as easy as possible for advertisers to reach users. That is the purpose of all the software that Google gives away, from the Android operating system, through to YouTube, Google search on phones and the Chrome browser. This might look like a cross-subsidy, but on the other hand it is the heart of the company's business. The software that Google gives away is not designed to make a profit on its own. It operates to draw people into the advertising ecosystem.</p><p>If Android ran on phones that did not draw people into the Google universe, it would be pointless for the company. That is one of the hinges of the commission's judgment, since there is no technical reason that Android must help Google's business. Because it is open source, anyone can build it and put it on their phones - or at least one version of it. This is why Amazon runs a variety of Android on its tablets.</p><p>This free version does not include the bits that make a phone useful for anything but making telephone calls, and this was the weak spot in Google's defence. None of the enticements - the mail, the search, the maps and the browser - are included. Neither is access to the Play store, where all the other games and apps are found. These can only be used with a proprietary chunk of software that Google controls; and manufacturers who want to use the Play store and 11 crucial Google apps must agree not to build so much as a single phone that does not include them. It is all or nothing. This licensing trick is the way in which Google has undoubtedly limited competition. The commission's decision to punish it probably comes <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/18/google-faces-record-multibillion-fine-from-eu-over-android\">too late</url> to undo the damage it has done. Technology moves too fast. But it highlights wider issues, still to be resolved.</p><p>All digital businesses tend towards a monopoly, and this is in part because in some important ways they benefit consumers more the larger they grow. Yet as customers we pay for this in other ways and as citizens even more so, not least because the companies fattened by monopoly profits grow too large to fail and too powerful to challenge. (Last year, Google spent $18m <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jul/18/google-faces-record-multibillion-fine-from-eu-over-android\">lobbying in Washington</url> alone.) There is a public interest in preventing any company from acquiring almost unlimited power. Regulation defends democracy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-45773258</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SV4-79T1-JCJY-G38M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"587\"/><timeReceived>6:59 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Jeremy Corbyn is in that respect no different from his predecessors. However, no leader has been in charge of the party when the influence of the traditional media has been so low. The internet is used by people for news <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/116529/news-consumption-2018.pdf\">far more</url> than newspapers and radio. Social media is the most popular source of online news. Mr Corbyn is well aware of the reach and influence of social media - his party produces slick videos that are       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/116529/news-consumption-2018.pdf\">instant hits</url> online. So it is surprising that in his speech at the Edinburgh TV festival on the media, the biggest questions on the subject are conspicuous by their absence.</p><p>Mr Corbyn <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/116529/news-consumption-2018.pdf\">did offer</url> some interesting and useful suggestions. There's a good case for strengthening the Freedom of Information Act by ending ministerial vetoes. Giving charitable status to local newspapers is an idea worth pursuing. Reducing the licence fee for poorer households makes sense too. These, significantly, are subjects the prime minister is silent on. But Mr Corbyn did not tackle the dysfunction of the current media market, which is dominated by two giant tech firms - Google and Facebook. While the BBC is an important part of the debate, positing it as a counter to Big Tech is flawed. As a former director of BBC news admitted, it could       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/116529/news-consumption-2018.pdf\">never have run</url> the Edward Snowden story.</p><p>Mr Corbyn does understand that digital disruption comes in many forms and sucks revenues out of print. But the Labour leader's idea that \"a windfall tax on the digital monopolies\" could \"create a public interest media fund\" is flawed. True, France and Belgium did so. Yet social media companies paid up because they feared an EU competition investigation. They were right to worry. Google has been hit with fines <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/116529/news-consumption-2018.pdf\">totalling</url> \u00a36bn in the past 18 months. If Mr Corbyn wanted to take on tech giants then he could back staying in partnership with the EU's competition directorate.</p><p>Then there is the issue of \"fake news\". Mr Corbyn should have addressed the subject much more substantially than he did in his speech. A parliamentary committee <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/116529/news-consumption-2018.pdf\">said</url> last month that fake news and the targeting of hyper-partisan views on social media put democracy at risk. Mr Corbyn could have endorsed what MPs recommended: that social networks should be legally responsible for harmful and illegal content on their platforms, and regulators should undertake an audit of the entire social media advertising industry. It was disappointing instead that he chose to attack newspapers, which, he said, people thought \"churn out fake news day in, day out\". </p><p>Mr Corbyn is seen as an heir to Michael Foot. After Mr Foot's Labour suffered its 1983 defeat he <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/116529/news-consumption-2018.pdf\">remained</url> in \"favour of protecting our newspapers, because I believe they are essential to the maintenance of our general freedom\". Mr Foot faced a vitriolic media campaign against him but it did not define his outlook on the media. Mr Corbyn ought not to let the\u00a0headlines he garners define his policy either.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-46675563</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T3J-PVR1-F021-64P5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"505\"/><timeReceived>6:52 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

The words have, of late, taken on new meaning. After years during which tech's titans could do no wrong, they are now being pulled into a vortex of regulatory woes that make headlines almost daily. Big Tech is not about to implode. But will it come out intact?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The latest burst of antitrust activity came on July 24, when Facebook said the Federal Trade Commission, an American regulatory agency, had launched an investigation into the company. The news came soon after the FTC released details of a privacy settlement with the firm.</p><p>The social network will pay a $US5 billion ($7.2bn) fine for violating a previous privacy deal with the FTC. But Facebook also agreed to formalise its privacy processes, for instance by creating a special committee on its board and by designating compliance officers. Its boss, Mark Zuckerberg, will also have to certify the firm's compliance, which could make him personally liable should Facebook fail to get its act together. A day earlier, the US Justice Department announced it would look into how big online platforms have achieved market power and whether they abuse it. The DoJ did not say which firms it had in mind, but Google is likely to be one. The department's lawyers are reportedly preparing to investigate it.</p><p>Trustbusters on the other side of the Atlantic - who have already fined Google more than \u00e2\u201a\u00ac8.2bn ($13.2bn) in recent years - are not resting on their laurels. On July 17 Margrethe Vestager, the European Union's competition regulator, announced that her department had opened an investigation into whether Amazon uses the data it collects from merchants' sales on its sites to push its own products. Insiders expect the EU's next target will be Apple, which stands accused of using its control of the app store on its iPhones to favour its own services.</p><p>All this suggests that the tech titans are in trouble both in Europe and America. Some Democrats hoping to run for the presidency have called for their break-up. William Barr, a lawyer for media and telecoms firms who became attorney-general in February, has spent years fighting them. At his confirmation hearings he agreed with a senator who said that \"dominant Silicon Valley firms could use their market power ... to -discriminate against rival products, services or viewpoints.\" This last point in particular worries Republicans. They view these giants as liberal bastions, which will discriminate against right-wing views in efforts to rid their platforms of extreme and hateful content. This month Donald Trump held a Social Media Summit where right-wing bloggers aired their grievances. In a sign of how far critics will go, Peter Thiel, a successful tech investor and sometime defender of Mr Trump, recently speculated that Google had been \"infiltrated\" by Chinese intelligence services.</p><p>Whether these are just acts of intimidation ahead of presidential elections next year remains to be seen. If Facebook's settlement with the FTC is any guide, Big Tech could still emerge mostly unscathed. The large fine and its new privacy bureaucracy notwithstanding, Facebook does not have to change its data-collection practices and is off the hook for any more claims that it violated the previous FTC settlement.</p><p>In a twist, Microsoft, the world's most valuable listed firm has hardly been touched by the tech-lash. It has learned hard lessons from going through the regulatory wringer at the turn of the century: look beyond the cash cow (Windows); rapaciousness ultimately does not pay; and work with regulators. Another Hemingway quote is less well-known among geeks: \"The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places.\"THE ECONOMIST</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-0431ca64af8811e9b2c2609644d5a3a1a903397a48ba8ee09026d922866fe69f</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNF-3Y01-JD3N-546P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"640\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"07\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>July 27, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

That's because of a special provision that enables courts to order states to reimburse lawyers on the other side of winning cases, our Washington Post colleague Dan Keating reports.</p><p>That nearly $10 million in fees - which doesn't include what taxpayers paid for the state's legal team - is poised to increase as state-level abortion restrictions face more legal challenges.\u00a0</p><p>A federal judge awarded nearly $2.3 million to lawyers in Texas last month after they helped successfully block\u00a0the state law limiting abortions. That reimbursement, as Dan's table shown below highlights,\u00a0is the largest recent reimbursement of its kind:</p><p>States are trying to limit the financial burden with novel strategies,\" Dan writes. \"Several recent abortion laws included a 'trigger'\u00a0provision that the law would not go into effect until a similar law had been upheld in another state or the Supreme Court had overturned\u00a0Roe. If the new restrictions don't go into effect, the state doesn't have to defend them in court.\"</p><p>             OOF: The National Institutes of Health, Veterans Affairs, university researchers and drug companies want to examine what leads to chronic pain.          </p><p>Pain experts will meet at NIH for two-days, determine which from a list of chronic pain predictors are most likely relevant, and then \"the Acute to Chronic Pain Signatures project will award $40 million to researchers who will study 3,600 patients over 2\u00bd years, a quick timeline as medical research goes,\" our Post colleague Lenny Bernstein reports.</p><p>The hope is to understand, amid the ongoing opioid epidemic, if there are biological, psychological and social factors that can help predict and prevent chronic pain.</p><p>             \"Finding these answers could not be more urgent. The medical blunder of casually prescribing opioids for acute and chronic pain is partly to blame for the addiction crisis that has taken more than 400,000 lives over the past 20 years,\" he writes. \"Even with a sharp downturn in narcotic prescribing over the past seven years, Americans still consume 33 percent more opioids per capita than Germans, the second-greatest users, according to the U.N. International Narcotics Control Board.\"</p><p>             OUCH: Democrats in the party's liberal faction\u00a0have recently endorsed Rep. Daniel Lipinski's (D-Ill.) primary challenger, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other leaders are\u00a0sticking with the incumbent,\u00a0the Hill's Scott Wong and Mike Lillis report.          </p><p>Lipinski is one of the only antiabortion Democrat\u00a0left in the party\u00a0as it has increasingly shifted to the left, and has born\u00a0intense pressure from his colleagues to compromise on his views.

But other Democrats backed by Pelosi\u00a0\"are urging Democrats to stick together, protect their incumbents and embrace the diversity of views - even conservative ones - that could pay dividends in battleground districts next year.\"</p><p>House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), for one, said some Democrats \"want to see the party as unified as possible.\" Meanwhile, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) urged that \"[p]rogressives have to stand for certain basic values: reproductive choice, LGBT equality, the rights for Dreamers. These things should not be places where we compromise.\"</p><p>             - Pelosi's health policy advisor Wendell Primus said during remarks at a conference hosted by America's Health Insurance Plans that he expects the speaker's\u00a0drug pricing to reach the House floor by the end of next month.          </p><p>\"I think this bill has a very good chance of becoming law,\" Primus said, according to Bloomberg's Jacquie Lee.</p><p>\u00a0The House Energy and Commerce\u00a0Health subcommittee is scheduled this week to take up the drug plan Pelosi unveiled that would allow the government to negotiate the prices of up to 250 brand-name drugs in Medicare.</p><p>             - Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar spoke at a meeting on health coverage at the United Nations General Assembly and urged world leaders to limit the use of terms like \"reproductive health and rights\" in policy documents, CNN's Jacqueline Howard reports.          </p><p> \"We do not support references to ambiguous terms and expressions, such as sexual and reproductive health and rights in UN documents, because they can undermine the critical role of the family and promote practices, like abortion, in circumstances that do not enjoy international consensus and which can be misinterpreted by UN agencies,\" Azar said.</p><p>\"The high-level meeting on universal health coverage aims to accelerate progress toward universal health coverage for everyone, including access to health care services, medicines and vaccines,\" Jacqueline writes. It was also not the first time U.S. officials have opposed the use of \"reproductive health\" by the United Nations. \"In April, the US delegation to the United Nations successfully used the threat of its veto power on the UN Security Council to demand significant changes to a resolution on sexual violence, because the resolution contained language about 'sexual and reproductive health,'\" she adds.</p><p>             - Doctors Without Borders is calling on the World Health Organization to be more transparent in how it's distributing the Ebola vaccine in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where more than 2,100 people have died in the more-than-year long outbreak.          </p><p>The organization claims WHO is limiting the vaccine's availability. \"Dr. Isabelle Defourny, MSF's director of operations, said in a statement Monday that at least 2,000 people could be receiving the vaccine each day, instead of the maximum of 1,000 who are vaccinated daily at present. She called for WHO to supply more vaccines to medical teams,\" NPR's Paola Zialcita reports.</p><p>Meanwhile, WHO announced a second Ebola vaccine will be introduced in the region in October. The vaccine, manufactured by Johnson &amp; Johnson will complement the current Merck-manufactured vaccine and \"will be provided under approved protocols to targeted at-risk populations in areas that do not have active Ebola transmission as an additional tool to extend protection against the virus.\"</p><p>             - And here are a few more good reads:\u00a0          </p><p>             Today          </p><p>             \u00a0Coming Up          </p><p>Fox News apologized to climate activist Greta Thunberg after a guest called her a \"mentally ill Swedish child\":\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPBLOG-80744d78c4334c258359a375b13002f7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPBLOG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X45-XG51-DXKP-J3VG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">409005</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1958\"/><timeReceived>11:35 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washington Post Blogs <br/></publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5072\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 24, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Our smartphones are constantly buzzing with notifications about the latest podcast upload or commercial email marketing the newest product at our favorite store. We take this for granted, but it has occurred, in part, because the internet has created a marketplace of ideas in which a highly profitable new business model dedicated to attracting our attention can flourish. In economics, this is referred to as a trade-off[2], which Business Dictionary defines asa technique of reducing or forgoing one or more desirable outcomes in exchange for increasing or obtaining other desirable outcomes in order to maximize the total return. </p><p>Trade-Offs Inherent to a Free Business Model'There are no solutions; there are only trade-offs,' said Thomas Sowell, an American economist and senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. Since the so-called 'Cambridge Analytica scandal[3]' with Facebook, politicians and media talking heads have been discussing federal privacy laws and business privacy practices. The proposed policies to alleviate these issues have included further government regulation and the use of 1900s antitrust laws to 'break up' companies. Facebook has allowed countless users to connect with lost family members, acquaintances, and even old friends. What is noticeably missing from this broader conversation is the business structure of these major technology conglomerates. Facebook and Google rely on advertisements to generate revenue from many users. As Christopher Mims writes at The Wall Street Journal[4], 'In reality, these services are anything but free. We just don't pay for them in the way we're used to.' Mims goes on to discuss how these companies generate profits. These allegedly free business models rely on companies attracting users and 'compel them to suck up our personal data.' Next time you can, check the 'Screen Time' section on your iPhone and track how much time you dedicate to social networking. It will likely be much more time than you imagine. Surely, the services these companies offer are beneficial; otherwise, we would not spend our time on their platforms. For example, Facebook has allowed countless users to connect with lost family members, acquaintances, and even old friends.How Advertisements Affect Social MediaAs I have previously explained[5], Google organizes \"information about webpages in a search index, which contains more information than 'all of the world's libraries put together.'' Many Americans have grown up in a world where Google is the ultimate source of information, replacing the encyclopedia. There were search engines prior to Google, however, they were unable to establish a high-quality product at such scale. Google and Facebook derive much of their revenue from advertisements, and according to Fortune[6], these two companies 'accounted for about 90% of all the growth in the business.'If a video is approved for monetization, then the creator can earn income from the successful dissemination of their video. In reality, this means that Google and Facebook are generating billions in revenue for attracting our attention. This 'free business model' requires no physical exchange of money for a product but instead our attention in return for use of their platform. A prime example of this business model is YouTube, a Google-owned video content platform. YouTube allows content creators to utilize the platform, and if the content creator chooses, they can request that YouTube monetize their video. YouTube outlines the requirements for monetization on a page[7] called 'YouTube Partner Program overview, application checklist, ...Qs.' This page provides the creator with the guidelines for making money off of their content. If a video is approved for monetization, then the creator can earn income from the successful dissemination of their video. This revenue is generated by the placement of advertisements by various companies, which is where controversy has been ripe.Censorship on a Private PlatformControversy has arisen due to the alleged throttling[8] of conservative content, a problem that may benefit from increased transparency, and the demonetization of content not only on YouTube but also on Facebook. Additionally, advertisers have grown concerned due to the placement of their ads on contentious videos. In general, advertisers and companies are risk-averse and seek to avoid controversy, so YouTube has established stringent guidelines on what constitutes a video eligible for monetization. These platforms often brand themselves as 'pro-free speech,' but their business model is not conducive to controversy. Inherent to the idea of freedom of speech is the presence[9] of controversy. Engagement-maximizing algorithms have unknowingly promoted disputable material such as Holocaust denialism, Sandy Hook conspiracies, and white supremacist content. According to Christopher Mims,other well-documented ills that may have been exacerbated by Facebook include the erosion of global democracy[10], the resurgence of preventable childhood diseases[11] and what the company itself acknowledges[12] may be wide-ranging deleterious effects on the mental health of millions.At Medium[13], I outlined the problems surrounding Google's manipulation of algorithms and its effects on democracy in the United States. Again, these platforms have provided our society with some of the greatest resources[14] in history. Google has democratized information. YouTube provides academics, scholars, celebrities, athletes, and everyday individuals with the opportunity to spread their knowledge and profit off of it. Facebook has connected long lost relatives, old friends, and professionals with one another. Ultimately, however, these platforms will have to decide which route they will take.No Such Thing as a Free LunchThere's no such thing as a free lunch. As any economics teacher will note, there will always be trade-offs to our choices. While these platforms have provided us with unprecedented information and content, the nature of their business model has created consequences for society at large. Another such consequence is the large-scale elimination of our consumer privacy through data mining[15]. Big Data is the fuel that artificial intelligence uses to run these algorithms. Big Data has led to these companies' possession of mass quantities of data, which they must store properly under relevant federal and state law.This is how Facebook and YouTube know which content the user may be interested in, and it is how advertisements are 'micro-targeted[16].' Big Data has led to these companies' possession of mass quantities of data, which they must store properly under relevant federal and state law. These processes can be infiltrated, as was the case in September 2018. Facebook announced[17] that 50 million accounts were known to be affected while an additional 40 million accounts may have been affected. The problem of cybersecurity incidents, also known as breaches, has grown exponentially with the large-scale use of the internet and \"cloud technologies.'Which Path? Government Regulation or Self-Regulation?Some of these issues are not entirely the result of a free business model. There remains a large question for these platforms: Can their business model be sustained given the regulatory and media scrutiny present, or must they forgo their status as 'free speech' platforms? Given that the chief executives of these major companies seem complicit[18] with further regulatory intervention, the answer is likely that these platforms will no longer remain similar to 'the public square[19].' One of the central conflicts among politicians in Washington is whether or not Section 230 immunity should continue to apply to these platforms. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act states,[20]No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.Policymakers understood that it would be 'infeasible for online intermediaries to prevent objectionable content from cropping up on their site.' This conflict centers on whether or not Facebook or YouTube are 'providers of an interactive computer service' or publishers. Few things are certain outside of death and taxes, but politicians are keen to act when an issue affects their personal electability. Democrats and Republicans alike have proposed[21] regulatory intervention to solve the ills created by the free business model, but these are not solutions. One would not propose placing a Band-Aid on a broken arm; the current business model of these platforms is at odds with their intended purpose. In order to address the unintended consequences, these platforms must look internally to solve this public relations crisis. Hopefully, these platforms find it in their long-term interest to act before the power of the state comes knocking on their door.

Op-ed.<br/><br/>The vast majority of Americans are oblivious to the fact that Silicon Valley censorship and bias against conservatives is tantamount to interference in the November presidential election. </p><p><br/>Google, Facebook, and Twitter are 100-percent trying to control the flow of information to the American public. <br/>Google is using its monopoly power to engage in a form of election interference as well as to decide what information Americans do and do not get to see by manipulating its search engine. <br/>Hollywood companies, including Walt Disney as well as Apple, Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft have allowed themselves to become pawns of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) influence. <br/>Sadly, Apple and Microsoft help censor internet information in China at the CCP direction. Wikipedia, Twitter, and Facebook are among the major websites that Chinese users can\"t access. <br/>A new report from the Senate Committee &amp;#111n Foreign Relations is warning of a \"new big brother\" emerging as the CCP expands its reach around the globe and reshapes the world\"s narratives &amp;#111n privacy and freedom \"using the pandemic to attack the fabric of the democratic system itself.\" <br/>But taken together, Big Tech bias forms a very troubling pattern -- and raises more questions about the hidden dangers of Chinese-style censorship in America. <br/>In a leaked internal video discussing the immediate aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, senior Google executives said they intended to make President Donald Trump and the populist movement that helped elect him to the White House a \"blip\" in history. <br/>Whistleblowers formerly employed at Google and Facebook are urging Congress to take action &amp;#111n Big Tech bias before it is too late. <br/>A Google whistleblower highlighted some of the material he uncovered, including the \"Machine Learning fairness\" program that transforms America\"s open internet system into a Chinese-style system of internet censorship. <br/>It is no coincidence that this wide-ranging censorship project was \"conveniently fast-tracked into Google\"s products immediately after Trump won the election.\" <br/>To add insult to injury, it\"s also not a coincidence many of the design documents for the news re-ranking documents used fired FBI director James Comey\"s Russian-Collusion investigation to inform how the algorithms at news.google.com would be changed. <br/>Today we see wide-spread censorship in the media and censorship of websites deemed \"conservative,\" along with websites that challenge the World Health Organization narrative. <br/>Twitter, Facebook, and Google\"s video-sharing platform YouTube removing several videos featuring American frontline doctors questioning the mainstream narrative &amp;#111n COVID-19 and who promoted Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) both as a preventive measure and as a cure is a classic example of a limitation of free speech. <br/>Americans must speak out and demand the medical freedom to consult their physicians and decide treatment options without government interference. <br/>Why don't Americans have the freedom to use HCQ here as in other countries? What mattered was the death toll mounts as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) denies HCQ for outpatient therapy. <br/>Approximately 48,000 more Americans have died during the FDA's 48-delay since this Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) was requested &amp;#111n July 1. <br/>The FDA's misleading statements about HCQ matters mostly because it has ignored facts of effectiveness and lack of harm for outpatients that have been established in more than 50 recent studies. <br/>Are we being conned? Were all the lies, fear and disinformation a concerted effort by Big Tech, WHO, FDA, CDC, and governors of Democrat-run states to ban HCQ and prevent its use for political gain? <br/>Although Twitter presents itself as politically neutral, its culture behind closed doors is &amp;#111ne of blatant censorship, systemic bias, and political targeting. <br/>Project Veritas exposed Twitter for \"shadow banning\" conservative profiles, meaning the users were blocked from the platform without even being notified. <br/>Perhaps the most shocking thing about Google is their willingness to cooperate with China\"s military and share its artificial intelligence (AI) intellectual property, while simultaneously ending cooperation with the Pentagon. <br/>Google\"s artificial intelligence work in China is directly benefiting the Chinese military and puts the U.S. military at a competitive disadvantage. <br/>The FBI and the CIA should investigate Google for treason if it has been infiltrated by Chinese intelligence. <br/>Facebook whistleblowers uncovered not with &amp;#111nly a few rogue content moderators, it was systemic and involved a consistent application of a convoluted and corrupt policy, all targeting conservatives which will lead to election interference. <br/>Unsurprisingly, the Facebook lobbying powerhouse continues to deny the mere existence of bias. <br/>Will Congress protect us against Big Tech biased censorship? <br/>Florida Republican congressman Matt Gaetz who described Google as the most dangerous election interference organization in the world has this message for President Trump: <br/>-Congress will not do anything &amp;#111n Big Tech because Congress was bought off by those companies. <br/>-Troves of internal company emails provide compelling evidence that tech giants Apple, Facebook, Google, and Amazon, in particular, may have violated antitrust laws while becoming market leaders in their fields. <br/>The U.S. Justice Department is moving full-tilt &amp;#111n its antitrust investigation of Google and other Big Tech giants, the role of China, and allegations that their platforms were biased against conservatives. <br/><br/>Today we see wide-spread censorship in the media and censorship of websites deemed \"conservative,\" along with websites that challenge the World Health Organization narrative. <br/>The Trump administration taking aggressive actions to ban Chinese tech and social media apps from operating in the U.S. &amp;#111n national security grounds, including its forced closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston is long overdue. <br/>The left all-out war plan\u2013 from weaponizing the pandemic to Chinese-style Big Tech censorship to unprecedented voter fraud to blaming every societal problem \u2013 especially those they created &amp;#111n Trump is amazingly stupid and reprehensible. <br/>Google is the world's biggest internet censor and master manipulator blocking access to millions of websites. <br/>It's self-serving practice of blacklisting is &amp;#111ne of many reasons Google should be regulated, just as phone companies and credit bureaus are. <br/><br/>The lords of Silicon Valley had been summoned yet again, &amp;#111nly to continue their gas-lighting of the American people after years of relentless bullying of small businesses, the totalitarian dominance of the public square, and aiding foreign enemies, terrorists, pedophiles, and insurrection. <br/><br/>Given the precedence, it could be a crying shame if Congress will ignore what Big Tech has been doing in each election years to undermine America\"s national security interests, public health, and economy. <br/><br/>Dr. Joe Tuzara, a humanitarian advocate, was a clinical research-physician-general surgeon for Saudi Arabian,

There\u2019s no denying that mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) are big business. According to Government statistics , last year M&amp;As generated \u00a383.4 billion for the UK economy (comprising \u00a353.8 billion of inward investment, \u00a320.9 billion outward investment and \u00a38.7 billion domestic). And yet, research from KMPG shows that 83% of M&amp;A deals hadn\u2019t boosted shareholder returns in the process. Why?    One of the biggest issues in the M&amp;A process is due diligence . It\u2019s so important that acquirers know exactly what they are buying, because while a deal may look attractive on the surface, any underlying risk can change the picture.    Take the acquisition of Yahoo! by Verizon as an example. After discovering an undisclosed prior data breach during its due diligence process, the purchase price was reduced by $350 million, they were fined $35 million by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , and forced to pay $80 million to disgruntled shareholders.    Over half of European tech firms see M&amp;A as key growth opportunity   DLA Piper research has found that over half (58%) of European tech firms see mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) as a key growth opportunity. Read here    Being able to perform comprehensive due diligence, which probes every area of the business in minute detail, is important because it stops the acquirer from raising any \u2018red flags\u2019 that may affect the terms of the deal, purchase price, or length of the sales process.   But what are they looking for?   The problem with due diligence is that often it\u2019s performed by people who don\u2019t necessarily understand the business, or even know what they\u2019re looking for. For example, if a lawyer doesn\u2019t have a current understanding of the cyber security threat landscape, which is highly likely given it\u2019s not their field of expertise, they\u2019re probably going to default to a set of routine questioning where certain risks could be overlooked.    And while every business is only one step away from a data breach, during the M&amp;A process, the threat increases exponentially:    \u25cf The company being acquired could bring a cyber security weakness into the business.  \u25cf Any redundancies could turn unhappy employees into internal terrorists, causing a malicious data breach.  \u25cf Data privacy could be invaded if appropriate policies aren\u2019t in place to transfer ownership of data.    In a world where every company is now a data company, privacy really matters. And just because a deal is completed, doesn\u2019t mean an organisation is safe against privacy problems. Research published on Forbes shows that an incredible 40% of acquiring companies discovered a cyber security problem during the post-acquisition integration.    Take Marriott as a very topical example. After acquiring Starwood Hotels in 2016, it was the subject of a catastrophic data breach in 2018 because it failed to discover 5 million unencrypted passwords and 8 million credit card details during the acquisition due diligence process \u2013 even though the breach had initially started in 2014, two years before the acquisition. If it had had access to the tools to discover their data and identify the risky or personal information held within it, like the encryption keys stored on the same server as the credit card numbers or the fact that passport numbers were saved unencrypted, the breach would have been avoided or at least hugely minimised. And now, besides the fines imposed by the regulators, the hotelier is now facing class action litigation from one customer on behalf of 30 million of those affected.    97% of IT leaders majorly concerned by insider data breaches   An Egress study has found that 97% of IT leaders are concerned that data will be exposed by their own employees, leading to insider breaches. Read here    Our own research at Exonar shows that 77% of IT professionals are concerned about personally identifiable information (PII) that\u2019s hidden within their organisation\u2019s data estate, and which they therefore can\u2019t find, or protect. So, it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that research from Deloitte shows 70% of organisations say that the protection of data assets in a company they are acquiring is more of a concern now than it was a year ago.    The Cyber Security Association  says : \u201cAs a result of several issues facing the safety and privacy of sensitive company data, it is imperative to find a lasting approach to tackling cyber attacks and potential hacks of vital business data.\u201d    But when our research also shows that 95% of IT professionals say it\u2019s a challenge to get visibility across their organisations\u2019 data estate, and only 39% are taking active steps to gain visibility of their data, what exactly should that \u2018approach\u2019 look like?   Data discovery tools provide visibility of the estate at scale   Specialist data discovery software is available to organisations and provides full visibility into their data estate \u2013 regardless of whether that data is based on-premise or in the cloud, stored within structured or unstructured databases, and if that data is known or unknown to the organisation.    Data discovery tools both power and protect organisations and the people they serve by giving them visibility of their data at huge scale and in one place. It\u2019s this kind of data discovery technology that should become a standard part of every M&amp;A deal, and what could have saved Marriott\u2019s bacon. Because finding unsecured and risky information in the data estates of the merging companies \u2013 particularly data the business doesn\u2019t even know it has \u2013 ensures there are no hidden surprises once the deal has been done.    Of course, data discovery has a flipside too, because data doesn\u2019t just pose a liability to a business \u2013 it can be an asset too. Data as an asset has an inherent value, so getting full visibility of what\u2019s there could affect the price of the acquisition.    Take pharmaceuticals as an example. We have one client that\u2019s been able to discover its intellectual property and evidence of ownership that was previously hidden within unstructured data in the form of emails that were buried layers deep and were over ten years old. Being able to find this information saved our client lengthy and costly legal battles, but when used in an M&amp;A situation could significantly increase the purchase price.    The rise of big tech monetising healthcare data   Nathalie Moreno, partner at Lewis Silkin, discusses the disruption and monetisation of healthcare data by big tech. Read here    Once the organisation has identified all the data within its estate, appropriate remediation actions can be taken to clean it up \u2013 whether that means taking remediation actions to move, secure or delete the data with confidence or indeed, taking no action because appropriate controls are already in place.    Integrating the data discovery tools with enforcement technologies, including document encryption, data loss prevention, access control, data remediation and content management, ensures that any risk posed by the data is minimised as much as possible. But it also significantly reduces the overall size of the combined data estate, which ultimately is going to save on storage costs in the newly merged business too.

Even in I...</p><p>Lobbying has always been a part of a moral grey area that exists within the practice of representative democracy. While there are few laws explicitly forbidding it in most nations, lobbying is still looked upon as legal bribery with another name. Even in India, there are no strict rules that prevent or limit the scope of lobbying and companies like retail powerhouse Walmart have run their own lobbying campaigns to attain a favourable climate for their business interest.   In the US, lobbying is more of a norm than an anomaly. In 2011, an investment study by the research firm Strategas showed that lobbying generally pays off quite well as an incredibly sound investment. Throwing financial support behind a US Presidential candidate not only ensures favourable disposition towards certain concerns but also increases the likelihood that the winner may even go so far as to offer positions within his administration to these backers. Indeed, Trump offered many positions of influence and official power to many of his top donors, stacking six of his cabinet positions with these donors, more than any other President before him. It is easy to see how such appointments can shape policy outcomes for a particular administration with conflict of interests being overlooked in the name of getting 'successful people' to do the job.   It is in this context that the significant support being given to the Joe Biden campaign by big tech companies is being viewed with growing trepidation. Amazon, Google and Microsoft are all part of the five biggest contributors to the Biden campaign. Coming at a time when administrations across the world and particularly at home are growing increasingly critical of big tech and its unrestricted use of data, it becomes easy to see why big tech would want a friend in the White House to shield them from an increasingly critical body of US lawmakers. Of course, it must be mentioned that big tech's relationship with the Democratic Party is not new. This long-running association resulted in President Obama taking a hands-off approach for governing tech companies, a policy position that many do not want to see repeated at a time when it is becoming clear that big tech does indeed need to be a meaningful system of government oversight into its behind closed doors working. Joe Biden made many of his connections to big tech during his time as Obama's Vice-President.   That said, it is not like cosying up with the Biden campaign offers big tech companies any guarantees. For one thing, there is increasing outrage against tech companies from both sides of the political aisle in the US with lawmakers on both sides concerned with limiting what they see as the corrupting tendency of uncontrolled big tech. Even within the Democratic Party, the more left-leaning liberals like Bernie Sanders have revealed an undisguised mistrust of big tech and its claims of self-governance. Biden himself has taken a stance against the 'abuse of power and trust' by tech companies that have dodged responsibility for their actions so far. While Biden has proposed greater regulation and a minimum federal tax that these companies should pay, at the same time he has not shown support for the true big-ticket item in regards to tech in the US \u2014 the idea of breaking up big tech companies to prevent the consolidation of monopolies. Conversely, it must be noted that Kamala Harris has, in fact, vowed to have a serious look at dismantling companies like Facebook in the future. Above all, both Trump and Biden have expressed mistrust at the way that big tech handles data, calling for more stringent data protection regulations in the United States.   And so, despite his occasionally antagonistic stands against tech companies, why is big tech donating in record numbers to the Biden campaign? Because, as most analysts put it, what they are buying is not favourable legislation but rather access to the potential President Biden's policy making circles. It isn't realistic to expect a career politician like Joe Biden to mistake the general atmosphere of mistrust regarding big tech as an invitation to allow tech companies a free hand in regulating data and paying zero federal taxes. Ultimately, as a middle of the line moderate, Biden will have to play the game of balancing all sides.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43213458138</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60YW-4MB1-F07F-820V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"762\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Millennium Post</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 1, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Opinion</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The Danish politician and digital watchdog has earned a reputation as big tech's worst nightmare, fining Google $9bn (\u00a37.6bn) for antitrust violations and Apple $14.5bn for tax avoidance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And while she was expected to vacate her post in 2019, Ursula von der Leyen, the new European Commission president, confirmed Vestager would retain the competition brief and made her more powerful than ever. Vestager now has expanded oversight on the EU's digital policy and has pledged to crack down on some of the tech industry's worse excesses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"In the last five years, some of the darker sides of digital technologies have become visible,\" she said.</p><p>With her new remit, Vestager is set to introduce the world's first regulations on artificial intelligence and has called for collective bargaining rights for workers in the gig economy - such as Uber's drivers. She will also try to make companies pay more tax in Europe and will continue investigations into alleged unfair business practices by companies such as Apple, Amazon and Facebook.</p><p>But her wishlist will face challenges such as the UK's exit from the EU, fierce opposition from Silicon Valley itself and tetchy relations with the US. President Trump said of Vestager that \"she hates the United States, perhaps worse than any person I have ever met\".</p><p>And while big tech will be Vestager's main target in 2020, she will also be looking at wider competition issues, including the recent pledge to curb Chinese state-supported companies snapping up European assets.</p><p>Tom Hoggins Bernard Looney The charismatic Irishman is set to take over from Bob Dudley as chief of oil giant BP in the new year, and will become boss at a critical juncture in the company's 100 year history.</p><p>Does it want to make money, or does it want to save the planet? Many believe it cannot do both. Looney, 49, disagrees. While he has yet to set out his agenda, all indications point to a steely focus on addressing the central dilemma: how to transition to an environmentally friendly business without destroying shareholder value.</p><p>What he says will likely shape the fortunes of one of the UK's biggest corporates for decades to come. Ed Clowes Wendy Tan White From South Kensington to Silicon Valley, Wendy Tan White is the woman behind Moonfruit (a website building business which she sold for \u00a323m in 2012).</p><p>White is settling into the sunnier climes of Mountain View, California at the highly secretive 'X' headquarters.</p><p>X is Google parent company Alphabet's moonshot department, that is responsible for incubating Waymo driverless cars, the \"Everyday Robot\" and internet balloon project Loon.</p><p>White knows how to scale a business and, as X's new vicepresident, will be working with high risk ideas and helping steer them to profitable, bona fide businesses in their own right.</p><p>Hopefully her British links will result in some Google cash flowing from across the Atlantic towards researchers and entrepreneurs in the UK, too.</p><p>Margi Murphy John Malone The \"Cable Cowboy\" John Malone is the kingmaker in the UK telecoms market in 2020. His cable group Liberty Global, the owner of Virgin Media, has more than $11bn (\u00a38.3bn) following the sale of its German business to Vodafone.</p><p>Much of the cash is likely to be returned to Liberty Global shareholders, but most industry watchers also expect Malone to buy a UK mobile operator so that Virgin Media can challenge BT in the emerging market for \"converged\" connectivity packages bundling home broadband with wireless service. O2, owned by Telefonica, is viewed as the most likely candidate.</p><p>The main question is how Malone, a fan of complex financial engineering, could structure a deal using Virgin Media's valuable tax losses - or even with a stock market listing that could allow the 78-year-old Colorado billionaire to continue what has been a gradual withdrawal from European telecoms.</p><p>Virgin Media, is also wooing Sky for a potential broadband wholesale deal that could hit BT's Openreach arm.</p><p>Malone has never been one to let his yearnings get ahead of his earnings, but his decisions this year are crucial to Britain's connected future.</p><p>Christopher Williams Alison Rose is the first female chief executive of the Royal Bank of Scotland in its 300 year history and the first woman to run any of the UK's biggest four banks - RBS, HSBC, Barclays and Lloyds.</p><p>But the 50-year old, who succeeded Ross McEwan in November, will be under pressure to make her mark on the taxpayer-controlled lender in 2020 as she embarks on her first full year on the job. She will have to steer the bank through Brexit, reduce the government's stake in the bank and increase performance at RBS's small investment banking arm Natwest Markets. The lender is still 62pcowned by the Treasury after a \u00a346bn bailout in 2008.</p><p>Rose has worked at RBS for 27 years, previously serving as deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings, the retail and commercial banking division, and running RBS's commercial and private banking business.</p><p>During her tenure, Rose has also fought to improve women's prospects in business, and was tasked by the Government with shedding light on the barriers faced by female entrepreneurs. In response to the Alison Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship, the Government pledged to increase the number of female entrepreneurs by half to nearly 600,000 women by 2030.</p><p>Lucy Burton Facebook The mystery members of Facebook's new supreme court We do not know their names. We do not know their faces. All we know is that there will be at least 20 of them - and that in 2020 they will begin deciding some of the internet's most controversial free speech cases.</p><p>These are the yet-to-be-appointed members of Facebook's new Oversight board, which will soon begin operating as an independent court of appeal for its 2.4bn users.</p><p>The board is intended to take pressure off Facebook itself, but it will likely draw down intense scrutiny upon the judges' backgrounds, biases and arguments, and the company is concerned enough about their safety that it is drawing up a special security plan.</p><p>One thing is certain: they can't please everyone.</p><p>Laurence Dodds Trevor Strain The heir apparent to David Potts to run Morrisons, the UK's third largest grocer. Strain, who spent three decades at rival Tesco before joining Morrisons in 2014, was promoted to chief operating officer in December.</p><p>He has long been tipped to succeed Potts, who previously spent 38 years at Tesco and took the helm at Morrisons in 2015.</p><p>Strain, a West Ham fan, had been finance chief since 2013. He has already had an insight into the top job when he was interim boss before Potts joined.</p><p>As chief financial officer, Strain helped Morrisons through a troubled period in which the supermarket was under pressure to sell its stores and battle the rise of cheaper European rivals Aldi and Lidl.</p><p>The turnaround under Potts has seen the retailer record three straight years of profit and sales growth.</p><p>In his new role, Strain will take over responsibility for commercial, manufacturing, supply chain, logistics, operations development, online and wholesale. This second promotion in nine months is believed to be an attempt to prepare him for the top job.</p><p>And although Potts has played down suggestions he will retire, a reshuffle at the top is likely in 2020.</p><p>Laura Onita Melinda Roylett The new UK general manager of Uber was appointed in August amid the controversy of London's ban on the ride-hailing app. A task made all the tougher by TfL's determination to see through the ban that could remove Uber drivers from the capital's streets in early 2020.</p><p>Uber said that the ban is \"extraordinary and wrong\" and Roylett's main challenge will be to get on the right side of TfL and have the ride-hailing app restored in one of its most popular cities - a task that will prove crucial to Uber's business as a whole. But Roylett, who joined the Silicon Valley firm after a stint as head of Europe at payment company Square and ten years at PayPal, also has Uber's other UK pursuits to expand.</p><p>She will be responsible for the ride-hailing app's presence in 40 cities across the UK and Ireland and will be determined to stave off any further regulatory threats, as well as competition from emerging rivals such as Bolt.</p><p>Hannah Boland Brian Chesky Airbnb's chief executive has gone from renting out his apartment and blow-up mattresses to the cusp of one of the world's hottest business floats.</p><p>The property start-up provides cheap accommodation by letting anyone rent out their spare room and after its relatively low-key beginnings in San Francisco, is active in cities worldwide, with revenues north of $2bn (\u00a31.5bn).</p><p>Chesky announced plans to go public in September, with the 38-yearold New Yorker looking to break the trend of WeWork-style calamitous listings. Chesky is worth a reported $4.2bn. But despite its success, the company is still walking a regulatory tightrope. Tom Hoggins Mike Manley The merger of FiatChrysler Automobiles (FCA) and Peugeotowner PSA Groupe could put Manley, the current chief executive of FCA, in a tricky position.</p><p>Terms of the deal will result in PSA boss Carlos Tavares heading the combined business, while the FCA chairman John Elkann will take a similar position at the enlarged entity.</p><p>This is likely to make Manley, who took the top job at FCA when Sergio Marchionne stepped down shortly before his death in 2018, superfluous to requirements.</p><p>Although Elkann has said Manley \"will be alongside\" Tavares in the merged business, whether he will remain there is up for debate.</p><p>Highly respected for his organisational and operational abilities, Kent-born Manley - the most senior Briton in the global automotive industry - is seen by many as too powerful a force to be sidelined, and one deserving to head a carmaker.</p><p>This could mean he's in the frame for the most prestigious job in the UK automotive industry - heading up JaguarLand Rover. Current chief Sir Ralf Speth is 64 and there has been speculation about how long he will remain in the job, having achieved his goal of overseeing the relaunch of the most iconic vehicle in the company's line-up: the new Defender.</p><p>It's by no means certain that Speth will go this year - he's steered JLR through good times and now rather tougher times - but, if he does, Manley could be a potential replacement.

The head of Honeywell's billion-dollar GoDirect Trade platform, which uses a permission-based blockchain to buy and sell aviation parts, declared on March 20 that American corporations had a \"walled-garden\" approach to data. \"They need to start sharing data, a huge paradigm shift\", said Lisa Butters. Only a couple of weeks ago, Honeywell had been defending the virtues of a permission-based system, saying enterprises \"needed some constraints to operate in\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What a difference a few days can make.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Historically, the aviation industry has been one of the most secretive among 'Big Tech' sectors, with its evolution tied intimately to the Second World War, and the US-Soviet Cold War rivalry that followed soon after. Concerns around China's theft of aerospace IP was among the foremost drivers behind the Obama administration's negotiation of the 2015 agreement with China to prohibit \"economic espionage\".</p><p>It is the ultimate \"winner-takes-all\" market - but Boeing, its lynchpin, has now approached the US government for an existential bailout. Honeywell's call for a \"paradigm shift\" is proof that the sector is not thinking in just hand-to-mouth terms. The aviation sector may get a lifeline for now, but as an industry forged by a global war, it knows more than most that a transformational moment for technology is upon it, which needs to be seized.</p><p>As the economist Branko Milanovic has highlighted, the correct metaphor for the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuing crisis is not the Great Recession of 2008, but the Second World War. To win WWII, and retain its military superiority, the United States pioneered technology complexes that placed innovation at the trifecta of university lab, government, and market. (The blueprint for this model was drawn up in 1945 by Vannevar Bush, founder of Raytheon and director of the Office for Scientific Research and Development, and presented to the US government. The document was titled, \"Science: The Endless Frontier\".) This was by no means a Western endeavour alone. Several countries, including India, followed suit, trying to perfect a model of \"organised science\".</p><p>In India, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research was the totem for this effort, and created a centralised network of national labs. The primary difference between Western models and ones in developing countries like India was the role of the state. In the US, the state retained regulatory agency over the process of technological innovation, but gradually ceded into the background as the Boeings, Westinghouses, GEs, Lockheed Martins, and IBMs took over. In India, the state became both the regulator and purveyor of technology.</p><p>India's attempts to create \"national champions\" in frontier technologies (think Hindustan Antibiotics Ltd, Electronics Corporation of India Ltd., Defence Research and Development Organisation, etc) failed because the state could not nimbly manufacture them at scale. Even as India pursued \"moonshots\", those businesses in the United States that were incubated or came of age during the Second World War, began to occupy pole positions in their respective technology markets.</p><p>Once those markets matured, it made little sense for America to continue creating \"organised\" technology complexes, although research collaborations between universities and the federal government continued through the National Science Foundation. The banyan-isation of the internet and Silicon Valley - both seeded by generous assistance from the US Department of Defence - into a market dominated by the FAANG companies affirms this shift.</p><p>In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, however, the tables are turning. The United States is not only shifting away from \"moonshots\" but also pivoting towards \"playgrounds\", settling on a model that India has perfected in the last decade or so.</p><p>The United States has often sought to repurpose private technologies as public utilities at key moments in its history. Communications technology was built and moulded into a public good by the American state. It was US law that enabled patent pooling by Bell Labs in the 19th century, leading to the creation of a \"great new corporate power\" in telephony. A few decades into the 20th century, American laws decreed telephone companies would be \"common carriers\", to prevent price and service discrimination by AT&amp;T.</p><p>Meanwhile, both railroads and telecommunications providers were recognised as \"interstate\" services, subject to federal regulation. This classification allowed the US government to shape the terms under which these technologies grew. It is precisely this template that Trump has now applied to tele-health technology in the US. Tele-medicine services could not previously be offered across state lines in the US, but the US government used its emergency powers last week to dissolve those boundaries.</p><p>And on March 18, President Trump invoked the Defence Production Act, a legislation adopted during the Korean War and occasionally invoked by American presidents, that would help him commandeer private production of nearly everything - from essential commodities to cutting-edge technologies.</p><p>Invoking the law is one thing, executing it is another. Rather than strong-arming businesses, the Trump administration is now trying to bring together private actors to create multiple \"playgrounds\" with an underlying public interest. The Coronavirus Task Force was the first of its kind. The Task Force brought together Walmart, Google, CVS, Target, Walgreens, LabCorp and Roche, among others to perform singular responsibilities aimed at tackling the coronavirus pandemic. Walmart would open its parking lots for testing, Google would create a self-testing platform online, Roche would develop kits, LabCorp would perform high-throughput testing, and so on.</p><p>The COVID-19 High-Performance Computing Consortium, created on March 23, is another such playground. It includes traditional, 20th century actors such as the national laboratories but is doubtless front-ended by Microsoft, IBM, Amazon and Google Cloud. The Consortium aims to use its high computational capacity to create rapid breakthroughs in vaccine development. Proposals have been given an outer limit of three months to deliver.</p><p>In some respects, the United States is turning to an approach that India has advanced. To be sure, we may not currently be in a position to develop such a playground for vaccine R&amp;D and testing at scale. But India is well-positioned to create the \"digital playgrounds\" that can help manage the devastating economic consequences of the Covid-19 epidemic. </p><p>There is universal acknowledgement that India's social safety nets need to be strengthened to mitigate the fallout. One analyst recommends \"a direct cash transfer of Rs 3,000 a month, for six months, to the 12 crore, bottom half of all Indian households. This will cost nearly Rs 2.2-lakh crore and reach 60 crore beneficiaries, covering agricultural labourers, farmers, daily wage earners, informal sector workers and others\". The same estimate suggests \"a budget of Rs 1.5- lakh crore for testing and treating at least 20 crore Indians through the private sector\".</p><p>The digital public goods India has created - Aadhaar, UPI and eKYC - offer the public infrastructure upon which these targeted transfers can be made. However, cash transfers alone will not be enough: lending has to be amplified in the months to come to kickstart small and medium businesses that would have been ravaged after weeks of lockdown. India's enervated banking sector will have meagre resources, and neither enthusiasm or infrastructure to offer unsecured loans at scale.</p><p>\"Playgrounds\" offers private actors to realign their businesses towards a public goal, and for other new ones to come up. Take the example of Target, which is an unusual addition to the Coronavirus Task Force, but one whose infrastructure and network makes it a valuable societal player. Or Amazon Web Services in the High-Performance Computing Consortium, which has been roped in for a task that is seemingly unrelated to the overall goal of vaccine development.</p><p>In the Indian scenario, a lending playground would have UPI players, account aggregators, lending service providers, technology providers and underwriter modellers, among others. Of course, it will also feature traditional interlocutors like lenders and credit bureaus, but they are the only actors who exist in this framework today! The rest of the playground is waiting to be built, but there is no need for a \"paradigm shift\" as Honeywell has sought in the US, because these digital playgrounds are not winner-take-all markets.</p><p>Account aggregators are cast as fiduciaries in India, empowered by the user to share data with other actors in the playground. The Data Empowerment and Protection Architecture (DEPA) of India Stack animates the Cash Flow-based Lending playground as well. Those who bring the players to the market by tethering them to the underlying digital infrastructure should be treated as public utilities, and their profits capped. If a Target can be part of a Coronavirus Task Force, why can't a Swiggy be a Lending Service Provider, offering low-value, short-term loans?</p><p>If digital playgrounds are so obvious a solution, why has India not embraced it sooner? None of this is to discount the deficit of trust between startup founders and the public sector in India. Founders are reluctant to use public infrastructure. It is the proverbial Damocles's sword: a platform or business' association with the public sector brings it instant legitimacy before consumers who still place a great deal of trust in the state. </p><p>On the other hand, reliance on, or utilisation of public infrastructure brings with it added responsibilities that are unpredictable and politically volatile. To illustrate, one need only look at the eleventh-hour crisis of migrating UPI handles from YES Bank in the light of a moratorium imposed on it earlier this month. On the other hand, the government retains a strong belief that the private sector is simply incapable of providing scalable solutions. In most markets where the India government is both player and regulator, this may seem a chicken-and-egg problem, but c'est la vie.</p><p>Nevertheless, there are milestones in history where seemingly insurmountable differences dissolve to reveal a convergence of goals. India is at one such moment. A leading American scientist and university administrator has called the pandemic a \"Dunkirk moment\" for his country, requiring civic action to \"step up and help\". By sheer chance and fortitude, India's digital platforms are poised to play exactly the role that small British fishing boats played in rescuing stranded countrymen on the frontline of a great war: they must re-imagine their roles as digital platforms, and align themselves to strengthen the Indian economy in the weeks to come.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">YRSTRY-0052500271</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">YRSTRY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YHN-2FN1-DXMP-K1R3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389309</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1861\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Yourstory.in, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Yourstory.in</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 27, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002T15</classCode><className>RAYTHEON CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

We discussed all of the major outstanding issues. We made some progress and we still have a good number of discussions to continue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ELIZABETH MACDONALD, HOST, FOX NEWS: No deal there. We are less than five hours from a potential government shutdown, both sides are now blaming each other even before it happened. It all hangs on the Senate and the Senate democrats.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Market averages still closed in the green. Democrats blaming republicans, republicans like Paul Ryan blame the Senate democrats, and the battle of it they are meeting. You just saw Chuck Schumer speaking after it, he was met with the president at the White House yielding no deal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Republicans now branded the Schumer shutdown. We are monitoring the minute by minute update. And republicans now demanding that the public be able to read a classified memo prepared by House intelligence that potentially details FISA surveillance abuses by the Obama Justice Department and James Comey's FBI.</p><p>And as republicans now saying they cannot believe that what they read in that memo is going on in the United States. Democrats call it misleading talking points. We've got details.</p><p>Plus, can you believe it's been a year the president is throwing a one year anniversary bash at his Mar-a-Lago property in Florida tomorrow, as critics tally his hits and misses. We've got details.</p><p>And we also have an all-star guest line up including RNC spokesperson Kayleigh McEnany, the Wall Street Journal Dan Henninger, radio host Lawrence Jones and former Trump spokesperson Katrina Pierson all here tonight.</p><p>Politics, money, we've got you covered. I'm Elizabeth MacDonald. Risk &amp; Reward starts right now.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PAUL RYAN, UNITED STATES SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Senator Schumer, you will not shutdown the federal government. Do not jeopardize funding for our military and for our national security. Do not jeopardize funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program. It is risky. It is reckless, and it is wrong.</p><p>I ask the American people to understand this. The only people standing in the way of keeping the government open are Senate democrats.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, the markets slugged it off. The Dow ending 53 points higher to 26,071. The S&amp;P 500, the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 notched record closes, again, the street ignoring the government shutdown worries in D.C. More on that in just a moment.</p><p>But first, we are just hours away from a potential government shutdown tonight at midnight. OMB Director Mick Mulvaney, he quote today at a White House press conference that democrats they, quote, \"don't oppose anything in the budget bill in that deal but democrats are opposing the bill.\"</p><p>It's DACA, the fight over DREAMers. It looks like that is holding up the deal. But now, to the bare knuckles hard ball tactics in D.C., let's get to Adam Shapiro on the ground in Capitol Hill with the latest. Adam?</p><p>ADAM SHAPIRO, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: And E-mac, we are just under seven hours from the potential shutdown of the federal government so where do we stand. First, as you have pointed out, this is an issue at least for the democrats about the DREAMers the DACA deal that they want the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.</p><p>But there's more to than just that. Take a look at what happens here at Russell Rotunda which is one of the Senate office buildings here in the Capitol. There was a protest of DREAMers and DACA students within the last 30 minutes and you can see that they were orderly but they were quite loud. They want to be heard by members of the Senate, who as far as we understand are still trying to overt this potential shutdown but it's not looking good.</p><p>As you pointed out, Mick Mulvaney, OMB preparing for the shutdown and he said that this administration would not weaponize the shutdown, meaning that parks actually would stay open but pay a little bit more attention to what Mulvaney said during the briefing a few hours ago.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICK MULVANEY, DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF MANAGEMENT AND BUDGET: There are things on this bill that they like. They have nothing in this bill that they do not like. The only reason they are not voting for it is that they want other things to be added to it and they want a shutdown. That's the only explanation we have.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO: So republicans have been calling for what they call a clean bill, a clean C.R., all along but the democrats are saying look, the republicans are in charge not only the executive branch but of the Senate and of the House and that they could have done a budget and also dealt with immigration reform and DACA long before this deadline. Here is what Ed Markey, the senator from Massachusetts had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ED MARKEY, (D) UNITED STATES SENATOR: Spare America, you crocodiles here because it is again time to sit down on a bipartisan basis and get a budget done.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHAPIRO: So keep in mind that next week, the House of Representatives was not going to be in session, so normally on a Friday like today those representatives would have been out of here by say noon. They were told to stay around this weekend, and that's what we've been told that a lot of representatives are still here in case, in case the Senate does come to some kind of agreement. Back to you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Thank you, Adam. That was a great report. Thank you so much.</p><p>California democrat Senator Dianne Feinstein ratcheting up her rhetoric against the looming government shutdown saying, people die in shutdowns. Well, that will make it seem like Dianne Feinstein is a yes vote. But the White House legislative director points out Feinstein is still undecided. Roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARC SHORT, DIRECTOR, WHITE HOUSE LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS: I asked Senator Feinstein her position and she said that government shutdown, the people will die and as a follow-up question, how is she going to vote? She said she hasn't decided yet. People are going to die, I don't know how I'm going to vote on this.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's bring in RNC spokesperson and author of the new book \"The New American Revolution\" she's Kayleigh McEnany. Good to see you, Kayleigh.</p><p>KAYLEIGH MCENANY, SPOKESPERSON, RNC: Good to see you, too.</p><p>MACDONALD: So how can the senator say that a shutdown would kill people but then say she's undecided?</p><p>MCENANY: Yes, exactly. It's hypocritical. She has the power to stop this. She's refusing to. And Liz, I want to tell your viewers this because this is so important to get out there especially now because Mick Mulvaney was asked today why if republicans have all the power they have all the cards and it's in their hands to avert this.</p><p>No, not true. We need 60 votes. That means we need nine democrats. We cannot do this without democrats, so Dianne Feinstein, if people are about to die, it's incumbent upon you to show up and vote to avert the shutdown and vote for the American people.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, to your point, Mick Mulvaney did mix it up with CNN's Jim Acosta today. Let's roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JIM ACOSTA, SENIOR WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT, CNN: This is for the Schumer shutdown. How can it be the Schumer shutdown when republicans control the White House, the House, and the Senate?</p><p>MULVANEY: Come on, you know the answer to that as well as anybody. I mean, I'll have to laugh when people say that. We control the House, the Senate and the White House why can't you get this done. You know as well as anybody that it takes 60 votes in the Senate to pass appropriations, right? You know that.</p><p>ACOSTA: I know that.</p><p>MULVANEY: OK. So when you only have 51 votes in the Senate then you have to have democrat support in order to keep the government to fund the government so that's the answer to your question.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: I mean, 51 to 49 is not really control of the Senate. We have Mick Mulvaney right, was that a fake question from Jim Acosta?</p><p>MCENANY: Yes, Mick Mulvaney was actually right. You have this reporters playing dumbs, acting like they didn't take basic civics, acting like they don't know the rules of the Senate that they don't understand filibusters when they do. They live this every day but they're playing dumb to try to further the democratic narrative.</p><p>The democratic narrative is republicans hold the cards so they can do this alone. No, we cannot. We need you democrats to show up and fund healthcare for nine million impoverished American children.</p><p>MACDONALD: It doesn't make us look good in the world stage. General Jack Keane has said that, General Mattis is saying it has a real morale impact on our military. The White House legislative director also saying today democrats are not being clear about exactly what they want. Let's roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SHORT: I don't think it's clear what the democrats are asking for. I accept that you're saying they want a solution to DACA but there is not bill text that they're asking republicans to bring up. So I think that they really believe for political reasons it's better for them to force a shutdown.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: So it looks like there's no language on DACA even being put forward. So, is this pure bare knuckle politics to embarrass Trump?</p><p>MCENANY: Liz, that's exactly what it is. As he pointed out there's not even a bill with text. If you care so much about DACA recipients where is the bill? And if you cared so much about DACA recipients you had eight years with President Obama to get this done, it didn't have to be an unconstitutional or executive order which is what Obama did. You could put a bill forward and you didn't. So this is pure politics, yes.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. To your point, President Obama enacted that 2015 executive order on DACA, allowing DACA. And you know, Matt Schlapp of the American Conservative Union he is saying democrats are doubling down. This is just pure resistance and straw. Let's roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, DIRECTOR, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: This is hashtag resistance. This is the democrats saying don't do anything to help Donald Trump or to help the Donald Trump agenda. They believe it's in their interest, democratic leaders believe it's in their democratic party's interest to do everything they can to shutdown Donald Trump's attempts to have any kind of his priorities in office. So, I mean, they want the shutdown. They think it's good politics.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: I just want to be clear for the viewer, Kayleigh. DACA, that executive order rather the action by the president, President Trump, it, expires March 5th. What the republicans, am I right, they are saying, you don't have to deal with DACA right now. Get the spending in there, deal, you know, take care of our military, take care of the government, keep the government lights open and you can deal with DACA after that, is that what's going on?</p><p>MCENANY: That's exactly right. And Donald Trump, President Trump has already said that I will give you a DACA deal so he's promised that. What this is a clean bill to fund our government tied to funding nine million children and what's called the CHIP program, nine million, healthcare for nine million impoverished children.</p><p>And as Mick Mulvaney pointed out, there is nothing in this bill that democrats oppose. Nothing. They're for CHIP, they're for funding the government, so this is pure politics.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director saying the shutdown will not be as bad as the last one under President Obama. He said President Obama weaponized that one. He was there in the government. He says he saw that firsthand. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MULVANEY: The Obama administration weaponized the shutdown in 2013. They could have made the shutdown in 2013 much less impactful but they chose to make it worse. The only conclusion I can draw is they did so for political purposes. So it will look different this time around.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. It's been accused as being petty action. The Obama administration shutdown World War II National Memorial and even though that memorial is maintained by private funds not government money, so defunding the -- or rather, the government shutdown should have had no impact. What are your thoughts here?</p><p>MCENANY: Yes, that's exactly right. That World War II Memorial, by the way, two veterans came to see it and it was closed. And as you mentioned, it was privately-funded. And in faact they had to pull seven staffers, seven government workers to put up the barriers. So it was all a ploy, all a hoax and Obama made the shutdown hurt. No doubt about it.</p><p>But Mick Mulvaney is at the helm of this one and he said we're going to transfer funding around agencies, we're going to get through this, we're not going to intentionally hurt the American people as was done during the Obama shutdown.</p><p>MACDONALD: Do you know what's really interesting, Kayleigh? Democrats ready to shutdown the government now, they sang an entirely different tune in 2013. Let's roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARACK OBAMA, FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Think about what we could do if a reckless few didn't hold the economy hostage every few months.</p><p>JAY CARNEY, FORMER WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Nobody wins when Washington is dysfunctional and one party holds the whole process hostage to demands that are unreasonable.</p><p>NANCY PELOSI, UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES MINORITY LEADER: Why should the government be and American people be held hostage.</p><p>ELIZABETH WARREN, (D) UNITED STATES SENATOR: The republicans are trying to take the government and the economy hostage.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Kayleigh, democrats like Nancy Pelosi called republicans quote, \"anarchist, arsonists with a bomb strapped to their chest\" because republicans want to shutdown the government opposing Obama's agenda. So, are they being hypocritical now?</p><p>MCENANY: Absolutely because not only did they once say it was catastrophic as Nancy Pelosi said, Schumer said it was the politics of idiocy, not only did they once say that. Now they are rejoicing at the thought of a government shutdown. Chuck Schumer came to the White House reportedly with a list not just of DACA demand but an even greater list.</p><p>They're taking joy in this and they want the government to shutdown to serve their political interest and it's the sad day and it's a pathetic day went that's the way democrats want to go.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. House Minority Leader democrat Nancy Pelosi is still going to extremes over what is going on in D.C. Let's roll tape.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PELOSI: In terms of the bonus that corporate America received versus the crumbs that they are giving to workers to kind of put the schmooze on is so pathetic. It's so pathetic.</p><p>This is like giving you a bowl of doggy doo, put a cherry on top and call it a chocolate sundae. This is nothing.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: Just the point, housekeeping, Nancy Pelosi was referring to the CHIP funding, the deal on the table now. What do you think?</p><p>MCENANY: Exactly. So, whatever she called it doggy defecation, that's what she's calling funding for nine million children in poverty. It's so sad. It's platen politics and those crumbs that the American people got, well, the council of economic advisors for the president has estimated this will rage -- raise the average American wage by $4,000 tax cuts.</p><p>Nancy Pelosi, that may be crumbs to you in California in your nice cozy big home. It's not crumbs to the American people.</p><p>MACDONALD: Kayleigh McEnany, great to see you. Thanks so much for coming on. We appreciate it.</p><p>MCENANY: Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's your money. Markets closing in the green today. The Dow up 53 points, the S&amp;P they're in record territory, the Russell 2000 as well. Let's get to Nicole Petallides on the floor of the New York Stock with the very latest. Nicole?</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, CORRESPONDENT, FOX NEWS: It was gains across the board. It was records. What government shutdown? Well, the markets didn't really seem to mind. In fact, the Dow would have had a record close if it weren't for IBM and American Express weighing on the Dow. The Dow finished up 53 points. The NASDAQ and the S&amp;P also finished higher with record closes. The Russell also at a record close as well.</p><p>For the week, we saw that the Dow and the NASDAQ were each up about 1 percent and the S&amp;P up almost 1 percent. On the weekly winners, what we saw, United Health, Merck, Nike. Nike had some great positive comments from Bernstein and Wedbush about how well they're doing selling on Amazon and just the whole idea and how it's profitable for the margins.</p><p>On the downside, General Electric, American Express and Disney weighed on the Dow, G.E. of course has had a lot of issues and also talks about breakups. That's been the big talk on Wall Street about General Electric. We'll watch for that one.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Thank you, Nicole. Now coming up, republicans calling for the public release of a classified memo prepared by the House intelligence committee that allegedly revealed widespread FISA abuse by the Obama Justice Department and James Comey's FBI. We're bringing the details, next.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK MEADOWS, (R) UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE: A clear understanding that that four-page memo has enough detail and is of enough concern for the very democracy that we love that all Americans should view it.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MATT GAETZ, (R) UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE: It is abundantly clear that the entire Mueller investigation is a lie built on a foundation of corruption. This critical intelligence information will vindicate the claims that have been made by so many and it is absolutely essential that we share it with all Americans. That's what we're fighting for in the Congress.</p><p>We can't get into the specific information but I can tell you I am as certain as ever that the claims we have been making are accurate claims, that there is intelligence information that backs it up and that there has been a real attempts to undermine this president and it has come from the scariest of places.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: That's Florida republican Matt Gaetz. He also said he thinks people will go to -- will go to jail over this story we're about to bring you.</p><p>Republicans now calling for the public release of a classified memo prepared by the House intelligence committee that suggests and reveals alleged widespread FISA abuse by the Obama-era Justice Department and James Comey's FBI.</p><p>It allegedly outlines how the anti-Trump Steele dossier, that file was used as a pretext by the FBI in order to get FISA wire taps on the Trump campaign. Now members of Congress already call it shocking and troubling.</p><p>Let's bring in Wall Street Journal editorial page deputy editor Dan Henninger. I mean, how serious is this situation with this memo?</p><p>DANIEL HENNINGER, DEPUTY EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: I think it's pretty serious, Liz. The whole thing sounds like a John Carey novel come to life. And I think what's going here is a couple of things. The whole thing originates in what I would call the Trump panic.</p><p>The Trump panic existed before the election and after the election. Those of us who are around politics remember that are even in like a city like this New York when Trump got elected people were in a panic that this guy had somehow ascended -- excuse me, to the American presidency.</p><p>It was too many people utterly unthinkable. What's going to become of the country? And the New York Times reported early last year that there was this, there were these intelligence things that were going around inside the intelligence community which the Obama administration decided to disburse widely through all 17 intelligence agencies. And the Times reported this explicitly.</p><p>Because they felt the Obama people felt there was evidence here of Trump collusion with the Russians. And somehow I'm sure even they were in a panic about this. I believe this went over into the FBI and that some of the people in the FBI crossed the line in trying to push this story in a way that would suppress the Trump presidency.</p><p>MACDONALD: We know that the DNC and the Hillary campaign helped pay for the anti-Trump file prepared by Christopher Steele. FBI former Director James Comey to this day will not answer questions whether the FBI also helped pay for it.</p><p>Remember last fall, former President Barack Obama's U.N. Ambassador Samantha Powers testified that people were unmasking in her name, in other words in her name, I'm not even sure she knew about it almost on a daily basis they were unmasking. And remember it's also Bruce Ohr at the DOJ and so forth.</p><p>HENNINGER: The FISA courts are very serious operation and there are rules about how to present evidence to them, getting evidence for warrants and so forth. And I suspect that people inside the Obama administration, inside the Obama White House, the intelligence agencies and the FBI went over the line in some instances to try to get deeper into the intelligence that they thought at the time existed about Trump and the Russians.</p><p>And I'll tell you, I'll push through, when I say John Carey not just pleadingly, but I think what's going to happen here is the FBI is going to show its document extraordinarily embarrassed by Russian intelligence. This is cold war stuff that's going on for the last 50 years...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: You think it's cold war stuff. By the way I need to correct myself. The unmasking when I said Bruce Ohr at the DOJ, I meant that Bruce Ohr's wife worked for Fusion GPS and he was let go by the Justice Department, right, for this connection?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HENNINGER: He was demoted.</p><p>MACDONALD: He was, yes. He was demoted. That's right.</p><p>HENNINGER: Yes. And I mean, and Peter Strzok and then Bruce Ohr and his wife now works for Mr. Mueller who sent out a memo saying that Sally Yates was right to oppose President Trump. I mean, these people were beside themselves over the idea that Trump was going to be president.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>HENNINGER: And the question now is whether that dossier was in no small part disinformation that was planted by the Russian FSB and they just simply played our side of the game. And so this now led to this point where I think the FBI is extremely embarrassed about what has gone on here.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, the rank and file is...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HENNINGER: And the question is, how do you discipline them for doing these sorts of things.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. Let's switch gears. We're finding out more about the testimony of Glenn Simpson, he's one of the co-heads of Fusion GPS. That's the outfit behind that so-called anti-Trump file.</p><p>Glenn Simpson disclosed for the first time in testimony that he did meet just after the election with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr, as Dan Henninger just pointed out, Ohr was demoted from his position as deputy assistant general last month after his meeting with Glenn Simpson was disclosed.</p><p>Glenn Simpson also testified that Bruce Ohr met with the author of that file Christopher Steel before the election. What's your, what's the most important revelation about this Simpson testimony?</p><p>HENNINGER: Well, that Simpson was engaged in such close contact with officials from the Department of Justice. I mean, someone like Glenn Simpson is usually involved with reporters and trying to dig stuff up but he was now developing a close relationship with the Department of Justice.</p><p>And as I say, Liz, I think there's a question here. How you discipline this kind of activity, compare that to what would go on in the military. You step over the line in the military, you get called to account and it doesn't make any difference whether you're a four-star general at the top of the chain or Bradley Manning at a private down at the bottom.</p><p>You will be disciplined. But inside the FBI, the CIA, how do they discipline the kind of behavior by people who not only push the edge of the envelope obviously, but broke through it. And I think that's kind of what the House intelligence committee is trying to come to grips with.</p><p>MACDONALD: Wow. What a story. We're staying on this for the viewer. Thank you. Good to see you, Dan Henninger. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>HENNINGER: Good to be with you, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Now after being featured on the fake news awards, CNN asked democrat Ohio voters who voted for Trump whether they regretted their vote a year later but it did not turn out the way CNN thought.</p><p>Radio host Lawrence Jones he's not surprised. That's after this. Do not go away.</p><p>MACDONALD: White House sources telling Fox News that negotiations are continuing right now with Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer and Paul Ryan to try to get a spending deal tonight. Sources say the chances for that deal appear to be improving. They now put them at better than 50-50 odds, that was Mick Mulvaney ball parking it. It's more optimistic than this morning.</p><p>And President Trump just weighing in -- breaking news, on his meeting with Minority Leader Chuck Schumer saying, quote, \"Excellent preliminary meeting in the Oval Office with Senator Schumer working on solutions for security and our great military together with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker Paul Ryan. We are making progress, a four-week extension would be best.\"</p><p>Let's bring in Lawrence Jones from the Lawrence Jones show. What do you think of that news?</p><p>LAWRENCE JONES, RADIO HOST: Well, that's interesting because when they first announced that Schumer was heading to the White House, I was wondering if the republicans were getting ready to cave on this DACA issue, but it seems like they're buying time. I think the democrats should just do what Donald Trump ask them to do is way until -- get it done before March. I think they're trying to push this up for political purposes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Get DACA?</p><p>JONES: Exactly. The president wants a deal that's why he gave them that deadline.</p><p>MACDONALD: Interesting.</p><p>JONES: And so, now they want to push up for political purposes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Let's get to this story. CNN touting the president's low approval ratings. They did a segment, they went out and they asked democrat Ohio, Ohio voters who voted for Trump what they think of the president a year in. It did not turn out the way CNN thought it would. Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: One year in. How's he doing?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Fantastic.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Phenomenal.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Great. Better than I ever would have dreamt.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm starting to get an inkling why he uses Twitter in the way he does. Because if all he had to rely on what people say about him, my God, I might not like the guy. But I love the guy and the job he's doing.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He was just a nice person and honestly if he was a racist as everyone makes paints him out to be he could have walked right past me and not even said a word.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's like tenacious sometimes and says stuff off the cuff like we do like real Americans do, you know, we're not perfect. I'm tired of swamp. I'm tired of Polish. I'm tired of the teleprompter, you know, I am. I want my country back.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: The parent company of CNNTime Warner closing the day in the green. We know that CNN has had a lot of critics that have been negative on President Trump. What did you think of that segment?</p><p>LAWRENCE JONES, RADIO HOST: It's unbelievable. First of all, I like to know they always cite the president's approval rating but the media never talks about their approval ratings. If they measure the president based on the way, you know, about his ratings they should be talking about their ratings as well.</p><p>But I also think that it's hilarious that they tried to set this up to be this Trump-bashing session and all these people are so excited because they feel the energy when you see the stock markets consumer confidence up. Not only that. People are going to have more money in their paychecks in February. Everybody is excited.</p><p>Now when you separate Donald Trump from the whole Twitter thing and all of that but these people are saying, you know, we kind of like it. It's kind of refreshing.</p><p>MACDONALD: But you've said that Trump steps on his own message.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>JONES: I think he does all the time.</p><p>MACDONALD: And it gets in the way of his own agenda?</p><p>JONES: It's problematic. But I also understand that American people when they say they're sick of the fake politicians and there's a certain bluntness about President Trump. I've been around a lot of these politicians for a while.</p><p>MACDONALD: Approval ratings are down.</p><p>JONES: They're down. And you know what? But he was down in the polls as well. I don't think this president is going to be one of those presidents that governs his policies based on approval ratings. He came in at a lower approval rating. The polls counted him out.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. He's not focus grouping.</p><p>JONES: So he's not really focused on it which is a little different.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. Focus grouping, he's not doing focus groups.</p><p>JONES: Right, but again, I do want the president to stop stepping on his message because he's doing a great job policy wise.</p><p>MACDONALD: Lawrence Jones, host of Lawrence Jones show.</p><p>JONES: Thanks, Liz.</p><p>MACDONALD: Great to see you. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>President Trump's one-year anniversary is tomorrow. Now if you'll remember the past year a lot of predictions were weighed in, that came in in 2016 supposed to be the worst of all-time, we're supposed to have collapse this year.</p><p>Former Trump 2016 campaign spokesperson Katrina Pierson on those dire predictions that did not happen. That's after this, don't go away.</p><p>MACDONALD: President Trump celebrating his one year anniversary at the winter White House this weekend, in Mar-a-Lago in Florida. If you remember the past year was supposed to be the worst of all-time according to the so- called experts back in 2016. Here's what they said.</p><p>Trump would, quote, \"cause the stock market to crash and will never recover,\" that was Paul Krugman. \"Plunge the world into recession,\" that was Simon Johnson at MIT, \"threaten the platter's health and safety, bring fascism to America, maybe even get us all killed.\"</p><p>Andrew Sullivan wrote in New York magazine, quote, \"Trump is an extension level event.\" Paul Krugman said to his New York Times readers \"America would soon turn into Trumpistan, the Trump ushering in an era of epic corruption and contempt for the rule of law no restraint whatsoever.\"</p><p>Former Trump campaign spokesperson, Katrina Pierson joins me now. What's your reaction to those headlines, Katrina?</p><p>KATRINA PIERSON, SPOKESPERSON, AMERICA FIRST POLICIES: Well, Liz, I think I slept through Armageddon but what I will say is you're here, I'm here. The world is still spinning wrong. And look, they got it wrong. I don't think anybody is surprised that they got it wrong. You have someone that came into office and in one year manage to bulldoze through the resistance and unravel decades' worth of big government policy, socialistic policies and brought back optimism and pride to Americans along with jobs and increasing wages.</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, here' the New York Times columnist warning about baseline dangers imperils. That's a direct quote. Here is what he said. \"Sustained market jitters leading to an economic slump, major civil unrest, and finally, a rapid escalation of risk and every geo-political theatre.\"</p><p>OK. The market has added about 7.9 trillion in value, economic growth set to exceed 3 percent for a third executive quarter, jobless rates at record lows for minorities for African-Americans, for Hispanics and for even people without a high school degree, Katrina.</p><p>PIERSON: That's right. We call that winning and I think we're going to win more as the president said we're going to get tired of winning at some point and right now it's just not that time. We're looking at people buying houses, young families are excited because they can upgrade their living quarters, I've experienced that myself just with individuals that are expressing their gratitude to the president. His willingness to continue to deliver on those campaign promises.</p><p>The left is going crazy because he is proving that liberal policies fail Americans and everyone is celebrating his one year.</p><p>MACDONALD: All right. What actually happened in the last year, let's take a look. We put together a little look back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We will make America great again. We want to start making our products again. We don't want to bring them in, we want to make them here.</p><p>The United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord. We must repeal and replace Obamacare now. Together, let's cut the red tape with further.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: With further amendment, the tax cuts and Jobs Act is passes.</p><p>MACDONALD: Almost a million Americans now getting special thousand dollar bonusses from their bosses, thanks to the republican tax cut. The best start of the stock market in 15 years this financial history. The Dow jumping more than 300 points, charging above 26,000 for the first time ever.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: All right, so it's a year later. What are the democrats going to go into the midterms with?</p><p>PIERSON: That's a really good question. You know, I think the president is going to have one problem and one problem only and that's to outdo himself in year two. He's been able to do so many things...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: But he's had missteps, though, Katrina, right? I mean, he has put out tweets and you know, he's got in the way of some agenda, right?</p><p>PIERSON: But do you know what, Liz, it depends.</p><p>MACDONALD: Stepping his own agenda with a tweet, right?</p><p>PIERSON: It depends on how you look at it. Sometimes and I'm a believer that sometimes you have to shake things up in order to move the ball forward and I think he's done just that.</p><p>MACDONALD: OK. Remember the New York Times accusing the president of appointing more white and males than any other cabinet since Reagan? It turns out President Trump has place more women in senior level roles in the White House than Obama, Bush or Clinton.</p><p>PIERSON: Well, it looks like his administration is a reflection of how he's always done business. He's always been very supportive and always empowered women. I happen to be one of those women, so I am very thankful and honored to have worked with President Trump because I do know his heart and I do know that he does value people that want to work hard and do well, particularly for this country.</p><p>MACDONALD: Thank you, Katrina Pierson. Good to see you. Thanks for coming in.</p><p>PIERSON: Great to be here.</p><p>MACDONALD: Breaking news. An update on Twitter's review of the 2016 U.S. election. At the request of congressional investigators, Twitter is saying as part of our review we have identified both more internet research agency and automated Russia-based accounts.</p><p>In fact, over a thousand accounts and more than 600,000 people in the U.S. followed at least one of these accounts.</p><p>Let's check, take a check of Twitter it is down slightly after-hours.</p><p>Next up, to the sanctuary state of California. Democrat attorney general pushing back against a potential immigration crackdown in Northern California. He's now warning companies and businesses that you will, company and business, face legal repercussions including $10,000 fines if you help out federal immigration authorities. Details next.</p><p>MACDONALD: So, what did blue state democrats do when the federal government takes away the state and local tax deduction? Everyone thought these states would get religion and cut spending. Nope.</p><p>New York Governor Andrew Cuomo now wants $1.5 billion in new taxes and fees.</p><p>Let's bring in the Fiscal Times columnist Liz Peek. Liz, I thought the story line was it's going to get religion and cut spending. What was your reaction when you saw that headline?</p><p>LIZ PEEK, COLUMNIST, FISCAL TIMES: My reaction was actually literally, thank heavens we have the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Broadway, et cetera, because people are leaving New York and they're going to leave at a faster clip every time they raise taxes. We have lost a million people since 2010, 190,000 just last year, and that's before this big new hit comes from the reduction of state and local state taxes.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: So you're saying you think for the museums to...</p><p>PEEK: Yes, because it's an attraction.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes.</p><p>PEEK: I mean, I think this state governance is so terrible, Liz. We are the number one state for high individual taxes, number two in terms of businesses. We are driving people away and we're going to start driving businesses away.</p><p>MACDONALD: Wow. Scary.</p><p>PEEK: If you talk to business managers in New York and they start comparing how they could manage their operation, you know, in North Carolina or some of these other states they're very attractive to millennials, I'll tell you what. It's a pretty appealing change and this budget that Cuomo has come out with is not going to help.</p><p>MACDONALD: Now, Liz, this is giving back to tax cuts to workers, it grown to 217. It's not just big tech companies like Apple or car makers, Liz, or the airlines. It's the little guys too, supermarkets, barber shops, gyms, trucking companies. And you know what, no democrat right now is calling for full repeal of the tax cuts even though you'll see a lot of negative rhetoric against tax cuts.</p><p>PEEK: This is a movement. I talk to a lot of the CEO's of companies across the country, little companies that have put in wage hikes or bonuses for their workers and they all have the same thing to say.</p><p>You know, they're basically their message is we love our employees, they've done a great job. We haven't been able to raise their wages for the last several years because of regulations and because of high taxes. Now, we have this win fall and we are going to share it with them.</p><p>Every community out there I would guarantee you by the end of the year is going to have a company that's done this. It is so powerful and for republicans running for office in the fall, their message is, you want to...</p><p>(FOREIGN LANGUAGE)</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes, but they're going to sell it.</p><p>PEEK: No, no. The message is, you know, vote in the democrats and these taxes are going to go back up and that's what republicans have...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: But you're not hearing that. The republicans won't do that.</p><p>PEEK: I know. But they are going to have to learn this lesson because this is what they have to tell people. You like what's going on, vote for me because otherwise taxes are going back up. And I think look at the polling. It's gotten better.</p><p>MACDONALD: This is not our parent's Democrat Party.</p><p>PEEK: No, it is not.</p><p>MACDONALD: Right. Now listen to this story. California's democrat attorney general, he's pushing back against the potential immigration crackdown from the Trump administration in the northern part of the state. He's now warning employers in California that do you know what, you face legal repercussions including fines up to $10,000 if you help out federal immigration authorities in a matter that violates California law.</p><p>The upcoming ICE raids aim to capture more than 1,500 illegal immigrants are being ordered not to follow.</p><p>All right. Here is what it is, Liz. You -- I come in, I'm ICE, you're the company. I ask you, do you have an illegal working there? If you say yes.</p><p>PEEK: I'm fined.</p><p>MACDONALD: You're fined.</p><p>PEEK: No, they're becoming a lawless state. California is really and truly becoming a lawless state. They now have I'm guessing around two and a half million people living in the state illegally and here's the problem. It's about 6 percent of the population. At some point that really begins to take a toll on what you can do for your legal residents right?</p><p>For example, the state university system they're giving scholarships to people in the country in the state illegally. That means some citizen probably who is there legitimately isn't getting a scholarship for their kid. At some point, California citizens are going to say this does not make sense. We've got to start.</p><p>MACDONALD: But when?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK: I don't know. I mean, I think this is unbelievable. They don't allow e-verify in the state. They really are doing nothing to just even maintain the level of this group.</p><p>MACDONALD: And half a dozen cities bankrupt.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>PEEK: It's terrible. Yes, that's exactly right.</p><p>MACDONALD: Good to see you, Liz Peek. Come back soon.</p><p>PEEK: Thank you. Thank you.</p><p>MACDONALD: Breaking news. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney now reportedly saying he does believe a deal, a budget deal will be reached in the next 24 hours to keep the lights on in the government. We're staying on that story for you.</p><p>MSNBC's Morning Joe brutally making fun of and mocking the White House doctor calling him a political hack. My next guest says Scarborough is the hack. Why? He's attacking a rear admiral in the navy. Let's bring in that guest after the break. Don't go away.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE SCARBOROUGH, HOST, MSNBC: His own words, are not the words of the physician, they're the words of a political hack.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SCARBOROUGH: He sounded like a sick and he didn't sound like a doctor. He shouldn't have sounded so Trumpian, first of all.</p><p>MIKA BRZEZINSKI, ANCHOR, MSNBC: Did he write it?</p><p>SCARBOROUGH: And secondly, he works in a White House with just about everybody who makes public statements lie.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It does seem that everyone who steps in the White House or catches the disease of over-the-top rhetoric.</p><p>SCARBOROUGH: Not a single respectable doctor in America would say what he said. Maybe he likes eating at the White House mess lobby. His own words are not the words of a physician. They're the words of a political hack.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MACDONALD: MSNBC's Morning Joe brutally mocking the White House doctor, going so far as to call him a political hack.</p><p>Just for the record, Dr. Ronny Jackson was appointed by President Barack Obama. He also served our country as a navy rear admiral; he's an Iraq war veteran. He's won several medals including a Legion of Merit, numerous navy and marine medal awards saying just a few of his accomplishments.</p><p>MSNBC's parent company Comcast closing the day in the green, ending up over a percent and a half.</p><p>Let's take this to the political panel. Independent Women's Forum Patrice Lee Onwuka, and Washington Times contributor Eric Schiffer. What do you think, Patrice about this comment about the doctor, the White House doctor being a hack?</p><p>PATRICE LEE ONWUKA, SENIOR FELLOW, INDEPENDENT WOMEN'S FORUM: I mean, it was totally off base. He was, Joe Scarborough was being, you know, like sour grapes. I mean, it was unbelievable for him to question someone who has assessed the health of previous presidents and he's never had an issue.</p><p>You know, but I think this harkens back to, you know, Joe Scarborough but other people in the -- in the -- reporters and journalists in the news media who are looking for every opportunity to try to present President Trump as unfit for office. What's ironic is that Joe Scarborough he didn't have -- he actually called out Sean Hannity for questioning Hillary Clinton's mental fitness when she was on the campaign. So why is he now able to do the same thing, I don't know.</p><p>MACDONALD: You know, Eric, are media outlets like MSNBC taking it too far, you know, with the personal attacks on gentlemen like Dr. Jackson?</p><p>ERIC SCHIFFER, CONTRIBUTOR, WASHINGTON TIMES: Well, again, it's not just them but you know, you see it across-the-board and I think that any kind of pounding that is related to anything positive on Donald Trump helps them. I mean, it helps them with ratings, it helps them with demographic...</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MACDONALD: Well, what did you think of the comment -- what did you -- Eric, what did you think of the comments from Joe Scarborough that this rear admiral is a hack.</p><p>SCHIFFER: I don't like it, you know, and I know Joe. I don't like it at all and I think it's unfair to this doctor. I think Dr. Ronny Jackson has been trashed by many in the media. He's been beaten up, he's been destroyed.</p><p>What's interesting is where you don't hear it coming from, Liz. The Obama administration, many people high up in the Obama administration say he's a terrific doctor, he's impeccable, he's a great doctor. So I find that fascinating. I think the media has carved this out because it's a way to again, get at Trump score points with their audience which is look, if that's what it's about for many.</p><p>MACDONALD: Yes. Patrice, let's get to the government shutdown. It looks like there may be a deal within the next 24 hours. What's your reaction to the D.C. fight over the shutdown?</p><p>ONWUKA: It's D.C. as usual. I mean, I think it's creating a firestorm as a way to kind of gin up support honestly for the 2018 midterms. Democrats are hoping that this will be a really strong political CHIP for them if they can say they shutdown that the government was shutdown to protect illegal young people here, and republicans are trying to say no, we're not going to blink.</p><p>Unfortunately, both sides are going to shoulder a lot of the burden and the criticism. And the Washington Post though, just found today that most of that burden is going to be held by republicans unfortunately.</p><p>MACDONALD: Eric, I'm terribly sorry we are running out of time. I hope you forgive me.</p><p>SCHIFFER: Absolutely.</p><p>MACDONALD: We got to get to the breaking news story about the government shut down, but we will have you back soon.</p><p>SCHIFFER: Absolutely.</p><p>MACDONALD: Thank you both of you for coming on. We really appreciate it.</p><p>SCHIFFER: OK.</p><p>MACDONALD: Coming up, we're still on the Schumer shut done watch, that's what republicans are calling it. We've got breaking developments coming up after this. Don't go away.</p><p>MACDONALD: Look at this. Neil Cavuto, he's got a new two-hour show every Saturday morning on the Fox News Channel beginning this weekend. Cavuto Live launches tomorrow at 10 a.m. Eastern Time. Check it out. And coming up tonight at 8 o'clock, an all-new episode of Wall Street Week, big time money manager Glenn Hutchins is with Maria tonight.</p><p>Thank you for watching. Hope you have a good weekend. Charles Payne is here now with Making Money.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RSKRWD-2018011901cb233</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RFM-F0W1-DXH2-61P9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437056</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7686\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>RISK &amp;

Thank you for joining us. I'm John Vause, you're watching CNN NEWSROOM. Ahead this hour, not a racist bone in his body claims the U.S. President and almost every Republican Congressman agrees opposing a Democrat resolution condemning Donald Trump's recent tweets as racist.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The compromise candidate is confirmed as the next leader of the E.U. and while Ursula von der Leyen shattered a glass ceiling, it's the backroom deal that got her the top job which has sparked outrage and opposition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And later, 50 years after NASA put a man on the moon, the U.S. President wants an American astronaut and the stars and stripes on Mars.</p><p>After a contentious debate, the U.S. lower House condemned President Donald Trump and his racist tweets which targeted four lawmakers, all Democrats, all women of color. The vote went mostly along party lines. At one point, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was prevented from speaking out to violating rules of decorum when she called the President's language racist.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI: Every single member of this institution Democratic and Republican to join us in condemning the president's racist tweets. To do anything less would be a shocking rejection of our values and a shameful abdication of our oath of office to protect the American people. I urge --</p><p>REP. EMANUEL CLEAVER (D-MO): The gentleman from Georgia.</p><p>PELOSI: -- a unanimous vote and --</p><p>REP. DOUG COLLINS (R-GA): Thank you. I was just going to --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Michael Genovese is the President of the Global Policy Institute at Loyola Marymount University. He joins us this hour from Los Angeles. Michael, quite a day.</p><p>MICHAEL GENOVESE, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: Quite a day indeed. And fault lines were drawn. The original sin of the United States are racism and slavery. We still haven't solved them. We still haven't settled that dispute. We still haven't healed those wounds. And you can see them coming back today in manifest form.</p><p>The President of the United States, it's unquestionably venomous racism and he tried to not walk away from those little comments. He walked towards them. He marched forward, defended his comments, doubled down, and the Republican Party was put in a terrible position.</p><p>If you go along with your president, you either accept or you embrace racism. If you go against him you run a political risk. And yet the answer I think is what will you tell your children that you defended racism or you stood up against racism.</p><p>VAUSE: And it's been more than 100 years since Congress has taken this type of measure against the sitting president. At the end of the day, like everything else, it came down to a vote which follow on party lines. Here's Trump's Housing Secretary Ben Carson during a cabinet meeting justifying his support for Donald Trump.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BEN CARSON, SECRETARY OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, UNITED STATES: Would you rather have a non-politician whose speeches unfiltered, who gets a lot of stuff done or somebody with a silver tone who gets nothing done? But as I told you before, I think God is using him.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: So the President is doing God's work. Four Republicans did vote with Democrats so too the now Independent and former Republican Justin Amash. But it does beg the question, what does this president have to do before he is held accountable by members of his own party?</p><p>GENOVESE: Well, the members of his party -- his party ring in a difficult position because politically he so controls a segment of that party that they're scared to death that they will either be primary doubt or that the support will be withdrawn in the election and the Democrat will win.</p><p>But the president's comments were odious and you know, for decades white nationalists, the Ku Klux Klan have been trying to spread their venomous hatred. They found a champion in the President and that Republicans have not stood up to him is a cheapening of the soul of the party.</p><p>They've sold their soul for four pennies for the 30 pieces of silver. And I think what's happened is the Republican Party is putting themselves in a position where they have no out on this. They either join the president or they're on the outs. And so he has put his fellow Republicans in a terrible spot.</p><p>VAUSE: And he's celebrating. He tweeted a short time ago. It's so great to see how unified the Republican Party was on today's vote concerning statements I made about four Democratic Congresswoman, 187 to four. He went on at the end, wow, he said.</p><p>So does it come a point where a price is paid by the GOP, maybe not you know in the next couple years but you know, but beyond 2020 when Republican Party lawmakers and this absolute loyalty to this president and everything that he has done and everything that he stands for will cost them? And what will that cost be?</p><p>GENOVESE: Well, with gerrymandering, there are so many safe seats that a number of Republicans know that they can say anything and support the president who does anything and they'll still be electorally viable and OK. But that's not the point.</p><p>The point is can you have a party post Trump that goes through this and comes out the other end as the party of racism, the party of bigotry, the party of hatred, the party that turns its back on many Americans and turns its back on the moral and ethical values that we're trying to live up to.</p><p>If there is a distinction, it's a partisan distinction of tribalism and that tribalism can be toxic. And this is a case when sometimes you just have to break out of that toxic mix and you have to say to yourself it's not worth it for me to go down that road. I have to have and maintain some integrity, my party has to maintain some integrity. We have to get beyond Trump. We have to move away from Trump.</p><p>[01:05:39] VAUSE: Well, earlier in the day, the president was defending his initial comments. He tweeted out this. Those tweets were not racist. I don't have a racist bone in my body. Get a list of the horrible things they have said. This refers to the four Democrat lawmakers, the four women.</p><p>The tweet goes on to say Omar is polling at eight percent, Cortez at 21 percent, Nancy Pelosi tried to push them away but now they are forever wedded to the Democrat Party. See you in 2020. Is it possible that all of this controversy, the hateful language, the national rift which has been exposed and deepened is for nothing more than it give Trump an edge in 2022 to you know, by motivating his base?</p><p>GENOVESE: Well, it's clear that there's kind of a 3H club style of campaigning in 2020 for Trump. The three Hs are hope, the economy is going well, I can -- I can make a good case for that. The second H is here. I'm the incumbent, I'm here, and I've got certain tools that I can use. And the third is hate. His base response to hatred.</p><p>His base response -- and the president's strategy is I can win with 40 some-odd percent because what I'll do is I'll make sure every one of those in my base gets out to vote and I'll try to attack my opponent. Look at the strategy. They're racist. They're the communists. They're the Socialists. They're -- they hate America.</p><p>As long as he can he can tear down and he tears down very well, he cannot build up. And so his strategy has to be to tear down the Democrats on this issue and to build up his base by saying we're OK, they're the ones were out to get us.</p><p>VAUSE: And the message from the President to these four Congresswomen -- in fact to everyone it seems, it's pretty simple it's like that old bumper sticker you see you know, usually on a Buick somewhere or a Cadillac. USA, love it or leave it. Let's listen to the president.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think it is terrible when people speak so badly about our country, when people speak so horribly.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: But here's the problem. Who decides? Who gets the call on what is horrible and bad and who gets to decide what is fair and reasonable criticism? Like this next soundbite, tell me which is it? Is this fair and reasonable criticism or is this horrible? Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: The United States has become the laughingstock in a whipping cup post for the rest of the world.</p><p>The you know, the country is doing horribly to put it mildly.</p><p>We don't win anymore. We don't win with our military. We don't win with health care. We don't win with anything.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: You know, if this is horrible criticism that that gentleman just made, the gentleman called Donald Trump, is there an argument here that perhaps he should get back to where his grandfather came from, back to Germany, he doesn't love it here?</p><p>GENOVESE: There isn't -- there is not an argument for that. That would be playing Donald Trump's game and we should not sink into that gutter. It's tempting. It's hard not to be snarky when he is so snarky. But you'd made the comment about the whole -- the love it or leave it. That came from the 1960s.</p><p>And in the 1960s, I'm old enough to have been part of the anti-war movement and we had a chant, the whole world is watching. The whole world is watching. We wanted to focus attention on the war in Vietnam and say judge us by this, by our opposition to that war, by the values that we're trying to bring to America.</p><p>The same thing is happening today. The whole world is watching. They're seeing of an America that is led by an out-and-out racist. There's no defense. There's no claim that he's not. He's gone beyond that. He keeps doubling down on this.</p><p>The question is and 2020 maybe the time we decide who are we? Who are we as the country who are we as a people? Is the original sin of America going to stay with us or are we going to work to overcome that?</p><p>VAUSE: And just -- here is an example of the dark road this administration is heading down.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Which country was he referring?</p><p>KELLYANNE CONWAY, ADVISOR TO THE PRESIDENT: What's your ethnicity?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Why is that relevant?</p><p>CONWAY: No, no, because I'm asking a question. My ancestors are from Ireland and Italy.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: My own ethnicity is not relevant to the question I'm asking.</p><p>CONWAY: No, it is. You were asking about he said originally, he's originally from.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I am asking you --</p><p>CONWAY: And you know everything is said since and to have a full conversation --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: So are you saying that the president was telling that the ousting of --</p><p>CONWAY: The President has already commented on that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: You know, Senior of White House Advisor to the President Kellyanne Conway try to minimize the impact of what she'd done. She said, I meant no disrespect in the tweet, but the exchange between Conway and the reporter, she laid bare precisely the thinking and the feelings of many within the administration.</p><p>[01:10:04] GENOVESE: Donald Trump is toxic. He spreads a disease. You see it with the people around him. You see it now with the Republican Party caving in on this issue that is indefensible. Will it infect the nation? That's the question. 2020 may decide that. I think we need to stand up and say that we're not that country. We're not the country that hates people because of their color, because of where they came from, because of the God to whom they pray.</p><p>This is a defining moment for America. We always like to say that this is the most important election in American history, rarely it is. This one may be in the top though because this will be about the definition of who we are and where we're going.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes. And it's an interesting strategy the president is using in the lead-up to 2020. I guess it worked four years ago or 2016 I should say, and we'll see if it works again. Michael, as always, thank you so much for being with us. GENOVESE: Thank you, John.</p><p>VAUSE: The margin was whisper-thin, nine votes, but enough for Ursula von der Leyen to be confirmed as the next President of the European Commission effectively the EU's most senior leadership position.</p><p>And Germany's former defense minister, mother of seven is now the first woman to lead the European Union. But it seems many outraged by the backroom deal which handed her the top job. More details now from CNN's Erin McLaughlin.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: She was the dark horse candidate. The name few saw coming. The European council's choice for the EU's top job forced upon a fractured European Parliament which had put forward a list of preferred nominees but no one could command a majority. And so unexpectedly, Ursula von der Leyen's name was put forward. Her overarching message, the need for unity.</p><p>URSULA VON DER LEYEN, PRESIDENT-ELECT, EUROPEAN COMMISSION: If we are to go down the European path, we must first rediscover our unity. If we are united on the inside, nobody will divide us from the outside.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: Von der Leyen was perhaps not the obvious choice to be the first female to lead the E.U. She just resigned as Germany's defense minister, a position widely regarded as the poisoned chalice of German politics.</p><p>The mother of seven, a doctor, educated at the London School of Economics. She was fond of singing. Her childhood nickname, the little rose. She entered local politics in 2001 positioning herself to the left of Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats.</p><p>But her candidacy for the Commission presidency was supported by Europe's hard-right yet another potential stumbling block to securing a majority within the pro-EU parliament. But little by little, Von der Leyen won over skeptical MEPs. The promises to help strengthen its hand in deciding her successor in five years' time and a commitment to new and ambitious green targets.</p><p>She didn't please everyone. Some refused to support her on principle outraged by backroom deals that led to her candidacy.</p><p>VON DER LEYEN: Are you going to be like previous Commission's, the lapdog of those Member States or are you going to be the pit bull that I would like you to be. That's what I need to hear.</p><p>MCLAUGHLIN: In the end, she crossed the line by only nine votes. And that's a very slim majority, uncomfortably close in the words of one diplomat making it that much more difficult for the Commission to push through its legislation. Von der Leyen's priority now, getting the support of more pro-EU MEPs. Erin McLaughlin CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) VAUSE: So what lies ahead now for this compromised candidate who secured confirmation with a whisper-thin majority to lead a fractured E.U. where political parties and their supporters seem more determined than ever not to compromise on their core beliefs and demands.</p><p>Jacob Kirkegaard is a Senior Fellow with the Peterson Institute for Economics. He's with us now from Washington. Jacob, thanks for coming in.</p><p>JACOB KIRKEGAARD, SENIOR FELLOW, PETERSON INSTITUTE FOR ECONOMICS: My pleasure.</p><p>VAUSE: OK, so Von der Leyen, she was confirmed with this nine vote majority. Most Euroskeptic parties, they voted against her so did many with the center-left and as well as the Greens. They saw her as the sort of end result of an old-school deal between France and Germany. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): You come here and you stand before us and you don't have legitimacy which electoral process to participate in. The agreement in Brussels is not Democratic it was a backroom deal.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: There is the sort of the sample of the feeling out there. So how does she actually lead? How does she get anything through the E.U. parliament? Does she have to essentially build a majority blocking support every time there's a vote?</p><p>KIRKEGAARD: Yes. Basically, look, she runs de facto a minority government now. She is the nominal head of the European People's Party politically at least in Brussels, but she needs a new majority every time. So how does she do it?</p><p>Well, first of all, she keeps her own group, the EPP, the center-left -- sorry center-right conservative group under control, and then she has to make a lot of concessions to the other groups, the Liberals, the Socialists, the Greens. So she has a lot of work ahead of her. But you know I quite frankly don't think she's a particularly compromise candidate. This was a secret ballot. Now she's in.</p><p>And you know, she doesn't owe anybody a big political debt or anything like that that voted for her, but she needs to win their votes every time she wants legislation passed in the future. And that's her real task.</p><p>[01:15:24] VAUSE: And that -- and that sounds like possibly the worst job in the world. And you can add that she has challenges ahead, it has to deal with the United States and the trade war with the U.S. She has to deal with Russia and China. There's you know, issues like Brexit which should have to come up. And you know, and she doesn't seem to have you know, any kind of base of support. So how will you know, countries like the United States with Donald Trump, with Vladimir Putin from Russia or China, will they see her as a tenuous or a weak leader?</p><p>KIRKEGAARD: No, I don't think so. And I mean, I think we should also recognize that she may -- you know, the fact that this vote was very close in the European Parliament doesn't really mean that much in my opinion because all that matters was that she got 50 percent plus one vote. She got 51 percent.</p><p>But there was a lot of MEP s that wanted to let off some steam. They wanted to vote against her for whatever reason and they were able to do that. She's still in. Europe avoided a constitutional crisis. And we should still remember that she was nominated unanimously by the 28 member states.</p><p>So among the leaders of them, she actually enjoys quite extensive support. So no, I do not believe that she would be viewed as a weakling. She comes from Europe's biggest member. She's a leading member of Germany's ruling party, has a long experience as a minister in Angela Merkel's government. So I don't believe for a second that she's a pushover, not at all.</p><p>VAUSE: Well, on Brexit, Von der Leyen said she was willing to delay the October 31 deadline. She wants the E.U. to recover neutral by 2050. She's in favor of gender equality. And for the leader of the Brexit party, Nigel Farage, all that was so utterly outrageous. His head exploded. Listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NIGEL FARAGE, MEMBER, EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT: What you've seen from Ursula Von der Leyen today is an attempt for the European Union to take control of every single aspect of our lives. She wants to build a centralized, undemocratic, updated form of communism that will render nation-state parliaments where the state controls everything, where nation-state parliaments -- where nation-state parliaments will cease to have any relevance at all.</p><p>I have to say from our perspective, in some ways, I'm really rather pleased because you've just made Brexit a lot more popular in the United Kingdom. Thank God we're leaving.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: At this point, the E.U. must be saying the same thing about Britain and Farage, thank God they're leaving, but what he was saying there was absolutely baseless.</p><p>KIRKEGAARD: I mean, you know, Nigel Farage is a political entrepreneur. What he says in Parliament is predominantly for YouTube feeds on far-right Web sites and other ways where he sustains himself by you know, making money that way. This is how he runs his personal party, the Brexit Party.</p><p>So actually what he says is just to create headlines, outrage. It has no content and frankly, nobody in Europe pays any attention to it. What people in Europe care about in Brexit is of course what people like Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are saying regarding Brexit.</p><p>And you know, if you look at the pound, the value of the pound today, you will see that a lot of people are worried about what coming out of London on the issue of Brexit, but Nigel Farage is irrelevant.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes. You know, if nothing else, Ursula von der Leyen, she has a unique background. Here's how the New York Times described her. She's a Gynecologist with seven children who knows just about everything about fighter jets. She says grace before dinner, believes in gay adoptions, she loves the United States and dreams of the United States of Europe someday.</p><p>And when it comes to deeper integration within the E.U., she's a lot closer to the French president Emmanuel Macron who's been pushing for these closer ties as opposed to the German Chancellor Angela Merkel who should have been reluctant to head down that road.</p><p>So will we see a significant shift you know, in how the E.U. is moving forward on integration? Does she had that sort of mandate if you like?</p><p>KIRKEGAARD: Well, there's no doubt that she is in many ways, Emmanuel Macron's pick. I think it was brilliant politics of Macron to propose a German candidate from Angela Merkel's party that quite frankly Angela Merkel for obvious reasons couldn't really refuse once her preferred candidates were voted down.</p><p>And I think there is a real chance that Ursula von der Leyen can bring the center-right conservative movement in the European Parliament as well as in Germany more towards the French position on fiscal integration, broader political integration in Europe as she certainly in that regard I believe the preferred candidate for Emmanuel Macron and many others who wants to see and wants to push Germany to go further.</p><p>So in that sense, in their -- in their eyes, they're kind of hoping that Nixon will go to China if you can use that expression with her as the head of the Commission.</p><p>[01:20:32] VAUSE: So this is the E.U. sort of the people in favor of the European project strikes back if you like.</p><p>KIRKEGAARD: Yes.</p><p>VAUSE: OK. Jacob, thank you. Good to see you.</p><p>KIRKEGAARD: My pleasure.</p><p>VAUSE: Well, Pyongyang has warned nuclear and missile tests may soon restart after breaking details on why Kim Jong-un is saber-rattling now just weeks after a surprise meeting with Donald Trump on the Demilitarized Zone. Also ahead, U.S. lawmakers grilling big tech over everything from search engine results to cryptocurrencies, to excessive market share. Details from three contentious hearings on Capitol Hill later this hour.</p><p>VAUSE: Just weeks ago, the U.S. President crossed the DMZ and met with North Korea's Kim Jong-un. Donald Trump said they'd agreed to resume talks and keep working towards denuclearization. The meeting he said was a great honor. But from a great on event what could be a great smackdown now.</p><p>The North Koreans are warning nuclear and missile test could soon restart. CNN's Brian Todd explains why.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BRIAN TODD, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: It now appears all of this --</p><p>TRUMP: Stepping across that line was a great honor.</p><p>TODD: -- may have been for not. Just two weeks after their historic meeting at the DMZ and President Trump's short stroll into North Korea, North Korea's dictator Kim Jong-un appears to be threatening to start testing his nuclear weapons again.</p><p>In a new statement, Kim's foreign ministry calls the joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises planned for next month a breach of the main spirit of what President Trump and Kim agreed to in Singapore and says we are gradually losing our justifications to follow through on the commitments we made with the U.S.</p><p>MICHAEL GREEN, CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES: Kim Jong-un has been friendly and smile with Donald Trump, but what we're seeing with these statements is a more normal North Korea negotiating technique which is to point a gun at the other guy's head and say do what we want or we will you know, launch missiles, test nuclear weapons. So it's all about leverage.</p><p>TODD: President Trump seemed unfazed about the new threat.</p><p>TRUMP: The relationship is very good. I think we've made tremendous progress on North Korea. And again, time is not of the essence but I think good things will ultimately happen.</p><p>[01:25:08] TODD: Kim's regime apparently doesn't see it that way calling those U.S.-South Korean military drills \"a rehearsal of war aimed at militarily occupying our republic by surprise attack.\" It's not the first time Kim's regime has objected to the joint military exercises. But why does the regime always frame them as practice for an invasion?</p><p>GREEN: One reason is they're paranoid. I mean, the entire North Korean regime is built on paranoia. The other reason is they want to try to use that as leverage to get the U.S. to weaken its readiness, to weaken its alliances.</p><p>TODD: Despite the pageantry and promise at the Singapore summit last year when Kim made his initial vague promise to get rid of his nuclear weapons, despite the dramatic images that the DMZ and words of friendship, by CNN's count, North Korea has made no fewer than 12 direct or implied threats since Singapore to pull out or walk back from the diplomatic process even as Kim appears to maintain his personal connection to Trump.</p><p>DEAN CHENG, RESEARCH FELLOW FOR ASIAN STUDIES, HERITAGE FOUNDATION: I think the spin that is occurring from Pyongyang is any concessions that do occur are because of their threats. Second of all, there does seem to be this belief on the part of Kim Jong-un, that he and Trump may actually have some kind of relationship.</p><p>TODD: Still, analyst say while North Korea may not be planning to get rid of its nuclear program anytime soon, the idea it could restart testing soon may be less of a solid promise and more of an empty threat.</p><p>GREEN: I think they probably won't do it. China would come down on them very, very hard. For now, they're getting a bit of a pass from the Chinese because they're engaged in a dialog.</p><p>TODD: While President Trump shows patients towards North Korea, his aides are sending a tougher signal to Pyongyang. A senior administration official tells CNN, those U.S. sanctions are going to stay in place until Kim Jong-un fulfills his commitment to completely denuclearize.</p><p>That official also telling CNN those joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises are not about to be canceled, saying there purely defensive in nature. Brian Todd, CNN, Washington.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: New development now about WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and his meddling in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election. Ecuador's former president Rafael Correa says his government knew what Assange was doing all from his small room in Ecuador's embassy in London. Assange took refuge there nearly seven years -- for nearly seven years to avoid extradition to Sweden on sexual assault allegations which he denies.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>RAFAEL CORREA, FORMER PRESIDENT, ECUADOR: I'm not accepting all the soap opera that they have made up that he asked for a high-speed internet and we gave it to him. That is nonsense. What we did notice is that WikiLeaks was interfering in the U.S. election, and that's why we suspended the internet.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: Correa's comments come a day after a CNN exclusive report, which shows surveillance records detailing how Assange transformed the Ecuadorian embassy into a command center. According to the report, Assange orchestrated a series of damaging disclosures that rocked the 2016 presidential election in the U.S. Next up on CNN NEWSROOM. A tense hearing between Facebook and lawmakers and the company's plan to launch a cryptocurrency and that's not the only tech giant facing scrutiny in Capitol Hill.</p><p>[01:30:47] VAUSE: Welcome back everybody. You're watching CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>I'm John Vause with the headlines this hour.</p><p>The U.S. House has condemned Donald Trump tweets for telling four minority lawmakers to go back to where they came from. Republicans though defended the President insisting he is not a racist. After a heated debate, the House approved the resolution mostly along party lines.</p><p>The European Commission is set to get its first female president. Ursula Von Der Leyen replaces Jean-Claude Juncker November 1st to be in charge of economic and climate policies for half a billion people. She tells parliament she'll work for a united and strong Europe.</p><p>Donald Trump insists there is progress being made with North Korea despite a new warning from Pyongyang that nuclear and missile tests may soon resume. The North is angry over plans for the U.S. and South Korea restart joint military exercises. Still Donald Trump is praising the two sides of very good communications.</p><p>Rough day on Capitol Hill for tech giants as U.S. lawmakers consider steps to limit their growing influence and market power. Executives from Apple, Amazon, Google, Facebook were in the hot seat as they were grilled by lawmakers during three contentious hearings.</p><p>Karin Caifa has details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KARIN CAIFA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Executives from the biggest names in tech and e-commerce grilled on Capitol Hill as lawmakers questioned their growing power and influence.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Facebook has two competing missions, make the world more open and connected, and make a lot of money. It is Facebook attempts to serve both these missions they wreak havoc on the rest of us.</p><p>CAIFA: In focus at one hearing Facebook's proposed cryptocurrency, Libra. The company promising to do their homework.</p><p>DAVID MARCUS, LIBRA CO-CREATER, FACEBOOK: And let me be clear and unambiguous, Facebook will not offer the Libra digital currency until we have fully addressed regulators' concerns and received appropriate approvals.</p><p>CAIFA: But after Facebook's past privacy missteps some senators skeptical of the endeavor. SENATOR MARTHA MCSALLY (R-AZ): It's one after another after another after another. So, I don't trust you guys.</p><p>CAIFA: And despite establishing Libra as a separate entity, there were questions about whether information about transactions could be shared with Facebook and monetized. I</p><p>MARCUS: I can't think of any reason right now for us to do this.</p><p>CAIFA: At another hearing, the major questions surrounded anti-trust issues whether Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple are allowing consumers enough options or stifling the competition.</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): The Internet has become increasingly concentrated, less open and grown (ph) hostile to innovation or entrepreneurship.</p><p>CAIFA: The topic of big tech has become an issue in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary race. Some, like Elizabeth Warren calling for break ups. Others calling for more regulations to rein them.</p><p>In Washington -- I'm Karin Caifa.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Scott Perry is the president and founder of Sperry Media, a marketing and consulting company. And he is with us this hour from Los Angeles. Scott -- thanks for coming in.</p><p>SCOTT PERRY, PRESIDENT AND FOUNDER, SPERRY MEDIA: Thanks for having me -- John.</p><p>VAUSE: You know, it seemed that for the most part these hearings came down to pretty much the same thing regardless of the tech company, regardless of the hearings. Lawmakers are essentially saying hey, you've got a lot of control over a lot of stuff and we don't trust you.</p><p>Again here's Democrat Senator Sherrod Brown at one of the hearings which focused on Facebook. Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR SHERROD BROWN (D), OHIO: Facebook is dangerous. Now Facebook might not intend to be dangerous but surely they don't respect the power of the technologies. They're playing like a toddler who has gotten his hands on a book of matches. Facebook has burned down the house over and over and called every arson a learning experience.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: It was a good soundbite. It was catchy but what seemed to be also here common to all of this which was not said in the most part which is we as in Congress have no clue what to do about it. PERRY: Well, you know, at least they air their concerns and the committee, the Banking Committee has a really firm grasp on how cryptocurrencies work. I was really impressed with the depth that they went to and regulation, how laws are handled. How passwords are handled. Inter-operability between other wallets allowing third parties to build upon the platform. How that information is shared. And plus how it plugs into larger things like anti-money laundering issues.</p><p>So I give Congress massive kudos of this whole thing and hopefully striking a little fear on Facebook to really think about how their past activities are bringing in in this distrust for this new endeavor.</p><p>[01:35:03] VAUSE: Yes. Ok. So, you know, to be fair the Libra thing was sort of their forte, everything else seemed to be a bit sort of muddying the waters a little bit. You know, they did not know whether -- what the regulation should be. Whether, you know, they should break it up. Different senators have different opinions of what they should do.</p><p>But the day began with the President you know, tweeting about Google in terms of treason. This is what he said. \"Billionaire tech investor\" -- and we should note him as a Trump supporter -- \"Peter Thiel believes Google should be investigated for treason. He accuses Google of working with the Chinese government. A great and brilliant guy, he knows the subject better than anyone.\"</p><p>You know, Trump then goes on to say that \"The Trump administration will look into this\" -- yada, yada, yada.</p><p>But the reality is a lot of American companies are based in China and they do work with the government in Beijing. It is not an easy relationship, but what has Google done that stands out here compared to what other U.S. companies have done?</p><p>PERRY: You know, I really don't know but you have to consider the source from where all that came from. You're talking about Peter Thiel. I mean this guy has a vested interest in Google's downfall because it does have a competing product in the form of Palantir who provides big data to governments.</p><p>So of course, he is going a stoke the fires and go hey man, check out what is going on over Google because he wants more contracts.</p><p>But yes, if there is fire there, if there's a smoke there then check into it. You know, what has Google done with China? And is it any worse than what anybody else has done in the form of like any foreign industry?</p><p>You know, I mean does Peter Thiel have a short position on Google. Is he really trying to stoke the fire so Palantir gets more government contracts? This is something I want to know.</p><p>But yes, everybody got grilled today for whatever their strengths are which also pose a big threat to the future of our economies, you know, whether it is Amazon being too big and being too big and taking too much data from their own -- their own retail partners.</p><p>You know, I mean Google -- Amazon has half of the market for e- commerce, only 4 percent of overall commerce. You know, what is Google doing with all the data they collect? What's Facebook doing with all the data they collect? And you know, what is Apple going to do with the data that they're holding on to or refusing to give to local and federal government agencies in the name of privacy?</p><p>VAUSE: This also seemed to be a (INAUDIBLE) for Republicans who are getting out their grievances about this conservative conspiracy theory that Facebook and others like Twitter actually -- and Google as well -- actually sort of censoring conservative viewpoints and that was raised by the Republican Senator John Kennedy.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY (R-LA): Isn't it true, and I really want your opinion, that Facebook has chosen to advance a set of values in which truthful reporting has been displaced by flagrant displays of (EXPLETIVE DELETED)?</p><p>MARCUS: I don't know how to answer that question -- sorry about that.</p><p>KENNEDY: Ok.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: I don't know how answer that either but, you know, much of the motivation for these hearings especially when it comes to Facebook, is this belief among conservatives that Facebook and Google, they're out to get them.</p><p>PERRY: They are all echo chambers. I mean what you see on Facebook and Google is based on what you already consume. So they're going to like bring you more of what you see already. So yes, there are theories that like they do -- you know, they may be dampening access information for things that might not so left, but is there a way to prove that? I don't know.</p><p>How do you look under the hood? I really don't know. But I will give John Kennedy kudos for calling BS on this stuff because in there, there is a kernel of truth about well, like all right, you know, can we really trust these guys to deliver, you know, what we expect to be the news?</p><p>VAUSE: Yes. Well, you know, they continually say that they are not a news organization. They continue to sort of walk away from any responsibility when it comes to journalism yet they are one of the biggest distributors of news stories on the planet. You know, (INAUDIBLE) taking no responsibility I guess.</p><p>Scott -- good to see you. Thank you.</p><p>PERRY: Always, man. Thanks a lot -- John.</p><p>VAUSE: Cheers. The largest ever modern-day slavery prosecution in Britain. Hundreds of immigrants set free after a human trafficking network is taken down. You'll meet the man who risked his life to make it happen.</p><p>[01:39:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>VAUSE: Well, there are disturbing details about the death of an American scientist in Greece. Police say a man on Crete has confessed to killing Suzanne Eaton, a highly respected scientist who attending a conference at the time.</p><p>Police say she was run down by a car driven by her confessed killer who put her in the trunk and took her to a World War II bunker. That's where, still alive, she was raped and then eventually died. The suspect's cell phone place him near the crime scene and the tire tracks matched his vehicle.</p><p>Rifles, bayonets, and air-to-air missiles -- these are just a few of the military weapons the Italian police seized along with a collection of Nazi paraphernalia from three men.</p><p>Barbie Nadeau reports now from Rome.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARBIE NADEAU, CNN CONTRIBUTOR: Italian investigators looking into potential terrorism charges for those Italians fighting alongside pro Russian fighters in the Ukraine found an incredible weapons stash on Monday night inside the house of a former parliamentary candidate for the far right Forza Nuova Party here in Italy.</p><p>Among the weapons they found was a French made air-to-air missile that had been owned by the Qatari military at one time. They also found 800 weapons. They found 300 parts of guns including sights and silencers. And they found 200 weapons among this stash.</p><p>They also found Neo-Nazi paraphernalia that included signs with Adolf Hitler's name on it, swastika signs and a number of other destroyed pieces of evidence that tie these Neo-Nazi groups to potentially the pro Russian fighters in the Ukraine.</p><p>Now the investigation is looking into whether there's a larger network and what was going to happen with these weapons. Whether they are going to be sold or the black market or whether they could have potentially been used right here in Europe.</p><p>This is Barbie Latza Nadeau for CNN -- Rome.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Britain's largest modern day slavery network has been taken down. Eight gang members made millions by trafficking hundreds of victims from Poland. They put them to work in England, taking all the money they earned.</p><p>CNN's Phil Black spent some time with one of the men who brought the gang to Justice.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL BLACK, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Peter's retro flat cap isn't a fashion choice. It's protection, a partial disguise. we can't show his face or mention his full name.</p><p>There are people who want to hurt you?</p><p>PETER, WORKS FOR ANTI-SLAVERY CHARITY, HOPE FOR JUSTICE: Yes.</p><p>BLACK: Peter's job is freeing slaves.</p><p>PETER: I have been involved in 286 rescues.</p><p>BLACK: That has made enemies and inspired threats.</p><p>PETER: They want me to spend the rest of my life in a wheelchair.</p><p>BLACK: Peter is giving us a tour of Birmingham's dark underbelly, in the U.K.'s second largest city, on regular looking roads inside ordinary looking houses. He helps uncover appalling hidden crimes, building trust with victims, moving them to safety. His stories are about real people -- enslaved, exploited, controlled with unimaginable violence.</p><p>PETER: A young female, was tied up because she refused to do what the traffickers asked her to do, which is being involved in prostitution. She was tied up with a barbed wire, and some parts of her body have been put on fire.</p><p>[01:45:07] BLACK: But one case stands out for its extraordinary scale.</p><p>This is where some of those people were rescued?</p><p>PETER: Yes, the first victims.</p><p>BLACK: The first people Peter ever rescued eventually led police to break up the U.K.'s biggest known modern slavery operation.</p><p>These gang members all came from Poland and so did their victims. They targeted people with few options and convince them to travel to the U.K. for a better life.</p><p>But this was the reality when they arrived -- filthy, slum-like conditions, threats, violence, forced labor for almost no pay.</p><p>The victims were put to work for unsuspecting businesses while the gang collected wages through bank accounts they control. Police believe they made millions of pounds. Gang members brazenly and foolishly flouted their wealth, one bought a Bentley.</p><p>Peter and his colleagues at the antislavery charity Hope for Justice worked the case from their secret operations room. Together, they and the police identified 92 victims. But the gang is suspected of trafficking hundreds more.</p><p>PETER: I'm afraid that still, so many people believe that slavery was ended 250 years ago and doesn't exist anymore.</p><p>BLACK: Peter takes us to a center that helps hundreds of homeless people in Birmingham every day. He says this is where many former slaves end up after their captors can no longer make money from them. This center has identified 45 slavery victims in the last year alone.</p><p>So this recent prosecution, this gang, it's not a one-off?</p><p>PETER: No. There are more gangs who are still operating. We won the battle, but the war is not over yet.</p><p>BLACK: British authorities believe slavery is a booming trade across the country, likely involving tens of thousands of victims. Peter says he'll continue working, defying threats, helping to free scared, vulnerable people one at a time.</p><p>PETER: Victims --</p><p>BLACK: Phil Black, CNN -- Birmingham, England.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>VAUSE: Next up on CNN NEWSROOM. 50 years ago, the world watched and waited as the crew of Apollo 11 began a historic world-changing mission -- a look back at one of the greatest moments in the history of mankind.</p><p>VAUSE: Around this time 50 years ago Apollo 11 was just over 75,000 nautical miles from earth. On board: Commander Neil Armstrong, lunar module pilot, Edwin Buzz Aldrin, and command module pilot Michael Collins were all asleep.</p><p>According to the Web site ApolloinRealtime.org which has recreated this historic space ride in incredible detail using audio from mission control, at this point in the journey, the command and lunar modules were still docked traveling at 6,500 feet per second around Mach 5.8. In six and a half hours the crew would wait for Day Two. And about 23 minutes from now Mission Control would issue a status report.</p><p>Through the magic of television, here it is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is Apollo control, 16 hours and 38 minutes around the lapsed time. Apollo 11 presently being tracked by the (INAUDIBLE) Australia tracking station. Geographically the spacecraft is practically directly over or out from the Philippine Islands.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[01:50:04] VAUSE: This Apollo mission captured the world's imagination in so many ways and never let go.</p><p>And while the past three U.S. presidents -- Trump, Obama, and Bush -- have all proposed human spaceflight missions like traveling back to the moon or more ambitiously to Mars all have floundered (ph).</p><p>In many ways the huge success of NASA's Apollo mission might just be the reason why there has been little to show in the past 50 years.</p><p>Joining us now from Detroit is a real life rocket scientist Anita Sengupta, an aerospace engineer to be fair. She spent a lot of time working with NASA at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. So Anita -- thank you for coming on with us. We appreciate your time.</p><p>ANITA SENGUPTA, AEROSPACE ENGINEER: Thank you for having me.</p><p>VAUSE: Ok. So July this year, July 4th to be precise, the U.S. President, like presidents before him, put down this marker on where he wants the U.S. space program to be heading.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We are going to be back on the moon very soon and someday soon we will plant the American flag on Mars. It's is happening. It's happening.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: And so it's happening he says. But, you know, is it really happening? And when I say happening, you know, when we talk about Mars specifically, like JFK declared, you know, that there will be a man on the moon. The U.S. will put a man on the moon and bring him home by the end of the decade.</p><p>That part was happening, you know. So NASA's budget go from $500 million a year in 1960 to $5 billion a year just five years later. That is happening.</p><p>SENGUPTA: It is happening. And it is happening in a slight different way than it happened in the 1960s. The space program now is definitely a combination of efforts from the private sector in the United States as well as a tremendous amount of work that's going on at NASA and in space agencies around the world.</p><p>So in that sense, the journey is expected. It's happening in (INAUDIBLE).</p><p>VAUSE: And you know, to be fair, there has already been -- NASA has been to Mars. They just haven't put a human being on Mars yet, right?</p><p>SENGUPTA: That is correct. Yes. So I work specifically on the Curiosity Rover missions. So robotics based exploration actually paves the way from a technology perspectives for future humans.</p><p>VAUSE: So it just does not seem to capture the, you know, the imagination obviously the same as putting, you know, Buzz Aldrin on the surface of the moon. SENGUPTA: You do have to take certain steps in order to make sure that you have those technology are safe before you send people there. But of course, being able to see yourself and see through the eyes of an astronaut is obviously the Holy Grail.</p><p>VAUSE: And one of the big differences between, you know, 2019 and 1960 or 1969, you know, we may have the technology now but there just isn't the same motivation, there is no space race with a rival power. No fear that it could mean losing a Cold War.</p><p>SENGUPTA: It is different but I think what we do see with the advent of new technologies and the advent of the private sector is that there is new reasons to go to space. So that's a new business case, whether that's from a tourism perspective, from money perspective or from a telecommunications perspective. There's a different reason to go to the space now.</p><p>VAUSE: One thing we've seen is a lot of more realistic as opposed to Mars is a return to the moon. The mission is called Artemis. Michael Collins, one of the three astronauts from Apollo 11 was asked about that on Monday. He was at the Kennedy Space Center to mark this 50th anniversary. This is what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL COLLINS, APOLLO 11 ASTRONAUT: Well I love the word \"Artemis\", the twin of Apollo. I think that's a wonderful name. And more important than the name it is a wonderful concept. But I don't want to go back to the moon, I want to go direct to Mars.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>VAUSE: U.S. President Donald Trump seems to agree with Collins. Last month he tweeted for all the money we are spending manage should not be talking about going to the moon. We did that 50 years ago. They should be focused on a much bigger things we are doing including Mars of which the Moon is part -- Defense and Science\" on and on it went.</p><p>Is a return to the moon an important step to going to Mars? You know, what are the chances NASA, you know, will maybe get to the moon and the whole Mars projects actually stalled because of lack of funding or political support?</p><p>SENGUPTA: I would say that the most difficult constraint from an engineering perspective right now is funding -- to be able to support multiple missions. So being (ph) there we could do both that I think would be the ultimate scenario but I personally would probably prefer that we go to Mars.</p><p>VAUSE: So why is the move -- coming up as a step to go to Mars? It just seems -- you know, it's being sold as oh you can go to Mars and then on to the moon, but like President says and Collins said, we've already been there.</p><p>SENGUPTA: There's two different elements to it. One is the development of technology to land people on the surface and have them survive in the surface. It's a very different environment if you go to the moon from a radiation perspective and (INAUDIBLE) environment expected when you compare it to Mars.</p><p>The other element of course, is being able to have people surviving in space for long periods of time in a partial gravity environment. So you get a lot of information from going to the moon first. But from a technology perspective, the technologies to land on Mars are quite different.</p><p>VAUSE: And the difference too, you know, a trip to the moon is what -- a couple of days? A trip to Mars is six months and that is a whole different kettle of fish, right.</p><p>SENGUPTA: Exactly. So I think it's a lot more challenging from that human longevity perspective. So that is why you do benefit from going to the moon first from that perspective.</p><p>VAUSE: You mentioned about the involvement of private industry in the space program in the United States. And NASA has always worked very closely with private industry but even more so now.</p><p>[01:55:02] There was a recent report which found the total value of U.S. public funding, you see by entrepreneurial space companies from 2000 to 2018 was just over $7 billion dollars across 67 companies.</p><p>Because there hasn't been any sort of singular event like the moon landings 50 years and there is this perception that the space program may be -- you know, it' has floundered and has not had big splashing moments like, you know, man walking on the moon. Is that money well spent? You know, what has been the benefit to the public -- all that you know, billions of dollars which went to private industry?</p><p>SENGUPTA: So -- I mean the space program actually had so much impact on our society from a telecommunication perspective and mobile communications, from the Internet. But our economy has grown by orders of magnitude because of what the space program has provided us over the course of the past several decades.</p><p>So I think people somewhat take that for granted now. In terms of the investment that we see in the private sector one of the largest cost elements to going anywhere in space is the cost of launch vehicles. If we can drive the cost per pound or per kilograms to orbit to GPO 2 (ph) or lower value, it actually facilitates more exploration in space.</p><p>So if we can get that cost down or utilize in the private sector and their cost efficiencies that benefits all future space exploration -- human or robotic.</p><p>VAUSE: And that is where SpaceX comes in with its huge groups of rockets that can be reused which is an innovation which we didn't see coming from NASA.</p><p>SENGUPTA: So we have had launch vehicles for many, many decades. Our launch vehicles have always been developed in concert with industries but this is a different model in the sense that the funding for the launch vehicle development came exclusively from the private sector. That is where I think you see the difference here.</p><p>VAUSE: Yes.</p><p>(CROSSTALKING)</p><p>VAUSE: Yes. It doesn't seem as exciting as Apollo 11 but, you know, we are moving on I guess. That's the main thing.</p><p>Anita -- thank you. Good to see you.</p><p>SENGUPTA: Thank you for having me. Appreciate it.</p><p>VAUSE: And thank you for watching CNN NEWSROOM.</p><p>I'm John Vause.</p><p>Stay with us.

The security, trade and global economic issues raised by the rise of China's telecoms superpower can and should be overcome by innovation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The National Security Committee seems likely to conclude that the security risks of working with Huawei are manageable and do not outweigh the benefits of its advanced, high quality and keenly priced equipment.</p><p>This <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2019/03/02/government-clampdown-huaweis-role-5g-network/\">newspaper reported in March last year that officials were considering imposing a cap of 50pc</url> on the proportion of Huawei equipment in mobile networks. I would be surprised if a radically different proposal emerges following the climax of the debate this week, despite the intense lobbying, aggressive diplomacy and dumb politics of the past year.</p><p>That would be the right call. There are real problems with Huawei equipment. Its development processes are not good enough and it is answerable above all else to the Communist Party of China. Allowing Huawei unfettered access to the UK market would simply be reckless and regulations to ensure some diversity of technology are eminently sensible. Yet a ban would signal nothing good about Britain.</p><p>It is impossible to escape the sense that America's worries about Huawei are as much driven by economic paranoia and Trumpian trade politics as by these genuine security concerns. There was a point where it appeared US intelligence was willing to withdraw co-operation with Britain over Huawei, but that dire threat appears to have receded.</p><p>As a result, Britain can and should forge its own path. If the Prime Minister is going to deliver his nationwide broadband upgrade in time for the next election, BT's infrastructure arm Openreach will need to buy plenty of Huawei equipment.</p><p>The Chinese giant is a leading supplier for fixed-line networks as well as the 5G mobile technology currently being rolled out by all four of our main operators. Regardless, by the time we get to 6G, the early shape of which is already emerging from the R&amp;D labs of the international telecoms industry, we should be loosening Huawei's grip anyway.</p><p>Telecoms equipment is heading towards a revolution comparable to that which occurred in large-scale computing. Where once businesses were obliged to turn to a small group of powerful sellers of proprietary technology, they now buy cheap commoditised servers from a highly competitive market. On to them they load \"free\" open-source software for which the underlying code is available to alter.</p><p>A panoply of consultancies and service providers act as suppliers, competing on quality and responsiveness. This is the nirvana that the telecoms industry aims to reach too. Operators are no more pleased by their reliance on Huawei and its two credible competitors than counter-intelligence officials on either side of the Atlantic. No business wants to depend on a shrinking pool of suppliers that could put it at risk of predatory price increases.</p><p>When Britain's decision is confirmed, it will probably give BT a boost, removing one of the uncertainties that has laid its shares so low for so long. Yet over the long term, investors should want to be rid of Chinese dominance in the supply chain as much as Donald Trump.</p><p>The shift towards commodity telecoms will take years and requires heavy investment and a radical replumbing of networks. However, initiatives such as OpenRAN, which targets the radio equipment in mobile networks, are gaining momentum and specifically intended to wrest power away from Huawei.</p><p>As well as telecoms operators, including BT, the likes of Google and Facebook are involved in this push, which is a rare example of when the interests of network infrastructure owners align with those of some of the giants of Big Tech that have been built on top of them.</p><p>There is a path away from Huawei, but outright bans are not the way.</p><p>                       I bet rivals have pricked up their ears                   </p><p>So now we know how she does it.</p><p>Bet365, the gambling empire 50pc owned by Denise Coates, Britain's best paid executive who last year took home a cool \u00a3323m, has revealed to The Sunday Telegraph the terms on which it lucratively operates in China.</p><p>While rivals have avoided the vast but tightly controlled market over fears that punters will end up in jail, Bet365 believes it is free to offer gambling services online to Chinese citizens.</p><p>In essence, the Stoke-on-Trent operator claims that because it has no partners, staff or assets in China, it is not subject to Chinese law. Or at least \"coherent arguments exist\" to that effect. Meanwhile, as long as punters are not gambling professionally, Bet365 argues, they are not committing any criminal offence.</p><p>This appears to be the first time Bet365 has confirmed, let alone offered a defence of, its activities in China, which have long been the subject of speculation. Indeed, those same accounts that disclose Coates's astonishing remuneration have refused to give geographic breakdown of revenues as it would be \"severely prejudicial to the interests of the group\".</p><p>It will be for legal minds to ponder the strength of Bet365's arguments about Chinese law. But given the company's financial success, and the fact that the Beijing authorities do not appear to have used their Great Firewall to shut it down, you can bet your last yuan that Coates's risk-averse rivals will be on the phone to their lawyers tomorrow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-59525199</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y10-6FF1-JCJY-G3VN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"911\"/><timeReceived>9:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 18, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

The security, trade and global economic issues raised by the rise of China's telecoms superpower can and should be overcome by innovation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The National Security Committee seems likely to conclude that the security risks of working with Huawei are manageable and do not outweigh the benefits of its advanced, high quality and keenly priced equipment.</p><p>This newspaper reported in March last year that officials were considering imposing a cap of 50pc on the proportion of Huawei equipment in mobile networks. I would be surprised if a radically different proposal emerges following the climax of the debate this week, despite the intense lobbying, aggressive diplomacy and dumb politics of the past year.</p><p>That would be the right call. There are real problems with Huawei equipment. Its development processes are not good enough and it is answerable above all else to the Communist Party of China. Allowing Huawei unfettered access to the UK market would simply be reckless and regulations to ensure some diversity of technology are eminently sensible.</p><p>Yet a ban would signal nothing good about Britain. It is impossible to escape the sense that America's worries about Huawei are as much driven by economic paranoia and Trumpian trade politics as by these genuine security concerns.</p><p>There was a point where it appeared US intelligence was willing to withdraw cooperation with Britain over Huawei, but that dire threat appears to have receded. As a result Britain can and should forge its own path.</p><p>If the Prime Minister is going to deliver his nationwide broadband upgrade in time for the next election, BT's infrastructure arm Openreach will need to buy plenty of Huawei equipment. The Chinese giant is a leading supplier for fixed-line networks as well as the 5G mobile technology currently being rolled out by all four of our main operators.</p><p>Investors should want to be rid of Chinese dominance as much as Trump Regardless, by the time we get to 6G, the early shape of which is already emerging from the R&amp;D labs of the international telecoms industry, we should be loosening Huawei's grip anyway.</p><p>Telecoms equipment is heading towards a revolution comparable to that which occurred in large-scale computing. Where once businesses were obliged to turn to a small group of powerful sellers of proprietary technology, they now buy cheap commoditised servers from a highly competitive market.</p><p>On to them they load \"free\" open-source software for which the underlying code is available to alter. A panoply of consultancies and service providers act as suppliers, competing on quality and responsiveness.</p><p>This is the nirvana that the telecoms industry aims to reach too. Operators are no more pleased by their reliance on Huawei and its two credible competitors than counter-intelligence officials on either side of the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.Atlantic.No\">www.Atlantic.No</url> business wants to depend on a shrinking pool of suppliers that could put it at risk of predatory price increases.</p><p>When Britain's decision is confirmed, it will probably give BT a boost, removing one of the uncertainties that has laid its shares so low for so long. Yet over the long term, investors should want to be rid of Chinese dominance in the supply chain as much as Donald Trump.</p><p>The shift towards commodity telecoms will take years and requires heavy investment and a radical replumbing of networks. However, initiatives such as OpenRAN, which targets the radio equipment in mobile networks, are gaining momentum and specifically intended to wrest power away from Huawei.</p><p>As well as telecoms operators, including BT, the likes of Google and Facebook are involved in this push, which is a rare example of when the interests of network infrastructure owners align with those of some of the giants of Big Tech that have been built on top of them.</p><p>There is a path away from Huawei, but outright bans are not the way.</p><p>Investors should want to be rid of Chinese dominance as much as Trump</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SUTELE-156661546</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUTELE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y13-J9G1-JCBW-N53G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334988</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"676\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"58170\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 19, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

We're all supposed to hate the Chinese tyranny and the tech companies it can use to serve its purposes of surveillance, control and commercial espionage, both at home and abroad.  But the Five Eyes governments of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are no better when it comes to surveillance and commercial espionage -- and control, when they want it. Indeed, we invented the practice of hoovering up personal data from tech platforms -- and Western companies invented the practice of monetising that data.  Perhaps that's why no one seems perturbed that the Trump administration intends to prise the boom social media app TikTok from the ownership of Chinese company, ByteDance.  Bytedance identified an opportunity in -- or perhaps created, or both -- young people's interest in mobile short videos. Anyone over 25 either never heard of TikTok or would be completely bewildered by what its users see in it. It's a classic case of innovation driven by connectedness, which left Western tech giants miles behind.  Now, on the pretext TikTok is a security threat due to its vacuuming up of personal data -- the very business model of Facebook and Google -- the Trump administration is going to ban it, forcing a sale to Western interests. Microsoft has put its hand up to acquire TikTok in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Trump has set a deadline of September 15 for a deal to be done. There will be a lot of haggling over the price, but Microsoft had US$136 billion in cash at the end of June.  Microsoft's acquisition might be at the exact moment TikTok loses its lustre -- or one may cause the other. Either way, the acquisition has all the characteristics of News Corp's 2005 acquisition of MySpace.  But once it is controlled by Microsoft, it means that the NSA, the Australian Signals Directorate and other Five Eyes governments will be able to use the app to vacuum up user data. And, as the Snowden revelations demonstrated over and over again, that's exactly what our governments do.  Indeed, the Australian government, in last week's melodramatic cybersecurity strategy, boasted of its ability to thwart encryption on widely used apps and devices.  The main use of such information is allegedly to fight terrorism, child abuse and organised crime. In reality it's commercial espionage and pursuing whistleblowers, journalists, lawyers and anyone else who embarrasses governments.  But that's only the start of the hypocrisy.  For the last couple of years, pretty much everyone has been railing about big tech and the need to impose limits on the monopolistic practices of Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet (owners of Google) and Apple. Microsoft, of course, was being pursued by competition regulators before Facebook and Amazon even existed. It's been one of the few causes to bring politicians together in this polarised political age.  Now Trump and the US Congress are now willing to anoint them as the national champion to grab control of the major foreign threat to big tech.  The mainstream media, eviscerated by Facebook and Google, have cheered on attempts to rein in big tech. Here, News Corp essentially dictated to the Morrison government how it should force Google and Facebook to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars allegedly for use of content. So all the more curious that the crushing of a competitor to big tech not merely in the US and Canada but here as well has been greeted with such equanimity, especially at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial Review</emphasis>, which normally adopts a \"forget China's monstrous crimes, just think about the money to be made\" editorial line.  The United States likes to impose Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions in trade deals on smaller countries, ostensibly because the legal systems of smaller countries can't be trusted to protect investment by US firms. But it's unlikely any dispute that ended up before a dodgy international ISDS forum has ever been remotely the size of what will be a forced acquisition of TikTok.  Trump has also, Mafia-style, insisted that the US government receive a large slice of any deal. This <url normalizedValue=\"https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-bid-piece-microsoft-tiktok-232008217.html?_guc_consent_skip=1597008855\">may well be unconstitutional</url>. One lawyer described it as \"akin to the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</emphasis> but on US soil, where the US government would be able to require what is tantamount to a bribe in order to obtain a regulatory approval for a business transaction\".  Imagine the outrage if the Chinese government demands that the Chinese operations of Microsoft be ceded to a local government after any TikTok deal was completed -- and takes a juicy cut of the proceeds. It would confirm what everyone has been saying about the lack of any rule of law there, and rightly so. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60JX-3341-F0NT-H00S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"838\"/><timeReceived>11:04:20 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 10, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

Perhaps that's why no one seems perturbed that the Trump administration intends to prise the boom social media app TikTok from the ownership of Chinese company, ByteDance.  Bytedance identified an opportunity in -- or perhaps created, or both -- young people's interest in mobile short videos. Anyone over 25 either never heard of TikTok or would be completely bewildered by what its users see in it. It's a classic case of innovation driven by connectedness, which left Western tech giants miles behind.  Now, on the pretext TikTok is a security threat due to its vacuuming up of personal data -- the very business model of Facebook and Google -- the Trump administration is going to ban it, forcing a sale to Western interests. Microsoft has put its hand up to acquire TikTok in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Trump has set a deadline of September 15 for a deal to be done. There will be a lot of haggling over the price, but Microsoft had US$136 billion in cash at the end of June.  Microsoft's acquisition might be at the exact moment TikTok loses its lustre -- or one may cause the other. Either way, the acquisition has all the characteristics of News Corp's 2005 acquisition of MySpace.  But once it is controlled by Microsoft, it means that the NSA, the Australian Signals Directorate and other Five Eyes governments will be able to use the app to vacuum up user data. And, as the Snowden revelations demonstrated over and over again, that's exactly what our governments do.  Indeed, the Australian government, in last week's melodramatic cybersecurity strategy, boasted of its ability to thwart encryption on widely used apps and devices.  The main use of such information is allegedly to fight terrorism, child abuse and organised crime. In reality it's commercial espionage and pursuing whistleblowers, journalists, lawyers and anyone else who embarrasses governments.  But that's only the start of the hypocrisy.  For the last couple of years, pretty much everyone has been railing about big tech and the need to impose limits on the monopolistic practices of Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet (owners of Google) and Apple. Microsoft, of course, was being pursued by competition regulators before Facebook and Amazon even existed. It's been one of the few causes to bring politicians together in this polarised political age.  Now Trump and the US Congress are now willing to anoint them as the national champion to grab control of the major foreign threat to big tech.  The mainstream media, eviscerated by Facebook and Google, have cheered on attempts to rein in big tech. Here, News Corp essentially dictated to the Morrison government how it should force Google and Facebook to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars allegedly for use of content. So all the more curious that the crushing of a competitor to big tech not merely in the US and Canada but here as well has been greeted with such equanimity, especially at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial Review</emphasis>, which normally adopts a \"forget China's monstrous crimes, just think about the money to be made\" editorial line.  The United States likes to impose Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions in trade deals on smaller countries, ostensibly because the legal systems of smaller countries can't be trusted to protect investment by US firms. But it's unlikely any dispute that ended up before a dodgy international ISDS forum has ever been remotely the size of what will be a forced acquisition of TikTok.  Trump has also, Mafia-style, insisted that the US government receive a large slice of any deal. This <url normalizedValue=\"https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-bid-piece-microsoft-tiktok-232008217.html?_guc_consent_skip=1597008855\">may well be unconstitutional</url>. One lawyer described it as \"akin to the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</emphasis> but on US soil, where the US government would be able to require what is tantamount to a bribe in order to obtain a regulatory approval for a business transaction\".  Imagine the outrage if the Chinese government demands that the Chinese operations of Microsoft be ceded to a local government after any TikTok deal was completed -- and takes a juicy cut of the proceeds. It would confirm what everyone has been saying about the lack of any rule of law there, and rightly so. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60K4-CDJ1-F0NT-H18Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"838\"/><timeReceived>11:04:20 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 10, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

We're all supposed to hate the Chinese tyranny and the tech companies it can use to serve its purposes of surveillance, control and commercial espionage, both at home and abroad.  But the Five Eyes governments of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are no better when it comes to surveillance and commercial espionage -- and control, when they want it. Indeed, we invented the practice of hoovering up personal data from tech platforms -- and Western companies invented the practice of monetising that data.  Perhaps that's why no one seems perturbed that the Trump administration intends to prise the boom social media app TikTok from the ownership of Chinese company, ByteDance.  Bytedance identified an opportunity in -- or perhaps created, or both -- young people's interest in mobile short videos. Anyone over 25 either never heard of TikTok or would be completely bewildered by what its users see in it. It's a classic case of innovation driven by connectedness, which left Western tech giants miles behind.  Now, on the pretext TikTok is a security threat due to its vacuuming up of personal data -- the very business model of Facebook and Google -- the Trump administration is going to ban it, forcing a sale to Western interests.

It would confirm what everyone has been saying about the lack of any rule of law there, and rightly so. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60KB-BK91-F0NT-H1YB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"838\"/><timeReceived>11:04:20 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 10, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC000DL4T</classCode><className>NEWS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS713210 CASINOS (EXCEPT CASINO HOTELS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS551112 OFFICES OF OTHER HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS519110 NEWS SYNDICATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC7999 AMUSEMENT &amp; RECREATION SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC6719 OFFICES OF HOLDING COMPANIES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>SIC2741 MISC.

We're all supposed to hate the Chinese tyranny and the tech companies it can use to serve its purposes of surveillance, control and commercial espionage, both at home and abroad.  But the Five Eyes governments of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are no better when it comes to surveillance and commercial espionage -- and control, when they want it. Indeed, we invented the practice of hoovering up personal data from tech platforms -- and Western companies invented the practice of monetising that data.  Perhaps that's why no one seems perturbed that the Trump administration intends to prise the boom social media app TikTok from the ownership of Chinese company, ByteDance.  Bytedance identified an opportunity in -- or perhaps created, or both -- young people's interest in mobile short videos. Anyone over 25 either never heard of TikTok or would be completely bewildered by what its users see in it. It's a classic case of innovation driven by connectedness, which left Western tech giants miles behind.  Now, on the pretext TikTok is a security threat due to its vacuuming up of personal data -- the very business model of Facebook and Google -- the Trump administration is going to ban it, forcing a sale to Western interests. Microsoft has put its hand up to acquire TikTok in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Trump has set a deadline of September 15 for a deal to be done. There will be a lot of haggling over the price, but Microsoft had US$136 billion in cash at the end of June.  Microsoft's acquisition might be at the exact moment TikTok loses its lustre -- or one may cause the other. Either way, the acquisition has all the characteristics of News Corp's 2005 acquisition of MySpace.  But once it is controlled by Microsoft, it means that the NSA, the Australian Signals Directorate and other Five Eyes governments will be able to use the app to vacuum up user data. And, as the Snowden revelations demonstrated over and over again, that's exactly what our governments do.  Indeed, the Australian government, in last week's melodramatic cybersecurity strategy, boasted of its ability to thwart encryption on widely used apps and devices.  The main use of such information is allegedly to fight terrorism, child abuse and organised crime. In reality it's commercial espionage and pursuing whistleblowers, journalists, lawyers and anyone else who embarrasses governments.  But that's only the start of the hypocrisy.  For the last couple of years, pretty much everyone has been railing about big tech and the need to impose limits on the monopolistic practices of Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet (owners of Google) and Apple. Microsoft, of course, was being pursued by competition regulators before Facebook and Amazon even existed. It's been one of the few causes to bring politicians together in this polarised political age.  Now Trump and the US Congress are now willing to anoint them as the national champion to grab control of the major foreign threat to big tech.  The mainstream media, eviscerated by Facebook and Google, have cheered on attempts to rein in big tech. Here, News Corp essentially dictated to the Morrison government how it should force Google and Facebook to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars allegedly for use of content. So all the more curious that the crushing of a competitor to big tech not merely in the US and Canada but here as well has been greeted with such equanimity, especially at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial Review</emphasis>, which normally adopts a \"forget China's monstrous crimes, just think about the money to be made\" editorial line.  The United States likes to impose Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions in trade deals on smaller countries, ostensibly because the legal systems of smaller countries can't be trusted to protect investment by US firms. But it's unlikely any dispute that ended up before a dodgy international ISDS forum has ever been remotely the size of what will be a forced acquisition of TikTok.  Trump has also, Mafia-style, insisted that the US government receive a large slice of any deal. This <url normalizedValue=\"https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-bid-piece-microsoft-tiktok-232008217.html?_guc_consent_skip=1597008855\">may well be unconstitutional</url>. One lawyer described it as \"akin to the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</emphasis> but on US soil, where the US government would be able to require what is tantamount to a bribe in order to obtain a regulatory approval for a business transaction\".

We're all supposed to hate the Chinese tyranny and the tech companies it can use to serve its purposes of surveillance, control and commercial espionage, both at home and abroad.  But the Five Eyes governments of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are no better when it comes to surveillance and commercial espionage -- and control, when they want it. Indeed, we invented the practice of hoovering up personal data from tech platforms -- and Western companies invented the practice of monetising that data.  Perhaps that's why no one seems perturbed that the Trump administration intends to prise the boom social media app TikTok from the ownership of Chinese company, ByteDance.  Bytedance identified an opportunity in -- or perhaps created, or both -- young people's interest in mobile short videos. Anyone over 25 either never heard of TikTok or would be completely bewildered by what its users see in it. It's a classic case of innovation driven by connectedness, which left Western tech giants miles behind.  Now, on the pretext TikTok is a security threat due to its vacuuming up of personal data -- the very business model of Facebook and Google -- the Trump administration is going to ban it, forcing a sale to Western interests. Microsoft has put its hand up to acquire TikTok in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Trump has set a deadline of September 15 for a deal to be done. There will be a lot of haggling over the price, but Microsoft had US$136 billion in cash at the end of June.  Microsoft's acquisition might be at the exact moment TikTok loses its lustre -- or one may cause the other. Either way, the acquisition has all the characteristics of News Corp's 2005 acquisition of MySpace.  But once it is controlled by Microsoft, it means that the NSA, the Australian Signals Directorate and other Five Eyes governments will be able to use the app to vacuum up user data. And, as the Snowden revelations demonstrated over and over again, that's exactly what our governments do.  Indeed, the Australian government, in last week's melodramatic cybersecurity strategy, boasted of its ability to thwart encryption on widely used apps and devices.  The main use of such information is allegedly to fight terrorism, child abuse and organised crime. In reality it's commercial espionage and pursuing whistleblowers, journalists, lawyers and anyone else who embarrasses governments.  But that's only the start of the hypocrisy.  For the last couple of years, pretty much everyone has been railing about big tech and the need to impose limits on the monopolistic practices of Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet (owners of Google) and Apple. Microsoft, of course, was being pursued by competition regulators before Facebook and Amazon even existed. It's been one of the few causes to bring politicians together in this polarised political age.  Now Trump and the US Congress are now willing to anoint them as the national champion to grab control of the major foreign threat to big tech.  The mainstream media, eviscerated by Facebook and Google, have cheered on attempts to rein in big tech. Here, News Corp essentially dictated to the Morrison government how it should force Google and Facebook to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars allegedly for use of content. So all the more curious that the crushing of a competitor to big tech not merely in the US and Canada but here as well has been greeted with such equanimity, especially at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial Review</emphasis>, which normally adopts a \"forget China's monstrous crimes, just think about the money to be made\" editorial line.  The United States likes to impose Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions in trade deals on smaller countries, ostensibly because the legal systems of smaller countries can't be trusted to protect investment by US firms. But it's unlikely any dispute that ended up before a dodgy international ISDS forum has ever been remotely the size of what will be a forced acquisition of TikTok.  Trump has also, Mafia-style, insisted that the US government receive a large slice of any deal. This <url normalizedValue=\"https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-bid-piece-microsoft-tiktok-232008217.html?_guc_consent_skip=1597008855\">may well be unconstitutional</url>. One lawyer described it as \"akin to the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</emphasis> but on US soil, where the US government would be able to require what is tantamount to a bribe in order to obtain a regulatory approval for a business transaction\".  Imagine the outrage if the Chinese government demands that the Chinese operations of Microsoft be ceded to a local government after any TikTok deal was completed -- and takes a juicy cut of the proceeds.

We're all supposed to hate the Chinese tyranny and the tech companies it can use to serve its purposes of surveillance, control and commercial espionage, both at home and abroad.  But the Five Eyes governments of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are no better when it comes to surveillance and commercial espionage -- and control, when they want it. Indeed, we invented the practice of hoovering up personal data from tech platforms -- and Western companies invented the practice of monetising that data.  Perhaps that's why no one seems perturbed that the Trump administration intends to prise the boom social media app TikTok from the ownership of Chinese company, ByteDance.  Bytedance identified an opportunity in -- or perhaps created, or both -- young people's interest in mobile short videos. Anyone over 25 either never heard of TikTok or would be completely bewildered by what its users see in it. It's a classic case of innovation driven by connectedness, which left Western tech giants miles behind.  Now, on the pretext TikTok is a security threat due to its vacuuming up of personal data -- the very business model of Facebook and Google -- the Trump administration is going to ban it, forcing a sale to Western interests. Microsoft has put its hand up to acquire TikTok in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Trump has set a deadline of September 15 for a deal to be done. There will be a lot of haggling over the price, but Microsoft had US$136 billion in cash at the end of June.  Microsoft's acquisition might be at the exact moment TikTok loses its lustre -- or one may cause the other. Either way, the acquisition has all the characteristics of News Corp's 2005 acquisition of MySpace.  But once it is controlled by Microsoft, it means that the NSA, the Australian Signals Directorate and other Five Eyes governments will be able to use the app to vacuum up user data. And, as the Snowden revelations demonstrated over and over again, that's exactly what our governments do.  Indeed, the Australian government, in last week's melodramatic cybersecurity strategy, boasted of its ability to thwart encryption on widely used apps and devices.  The main use of such information is allegedly to fight terrorism, child abuse and organised crime. In reality it's commercial espionage and pursuing whistleblowers, journalists, lawyers and anyone else who embarrasses governments.  But that's only the start of the hypocrisy.  For the last couple of years, pretty much everyone has been railing about big tech and the need to impose limits on the monopolistic practices of Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet (owners of Google) and Apple. Microsoft, of course, was being pursued by competition regulators before Facebook and Amazon even existed. It's been one of the few causes to bring politicians together in this polarised political age.  Now Trump and the US Congress are now willing to anoint them as the national champion to grab control of the major foreign threat to big tech.  The mainstream media, eviscerated by Facebook and Google, have cheered on attempts to rein in big tech. Here, News Corp essentially dictated to the Morrison government how it should force Google and Facebook to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars allegedly for use of content. So all the more curious that the crushing of a competitor to big tech not merely in the US and Canada but here as well has been greeted with such equanimity, especially at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial Review</emphasis>, which normally adopts a \"forget China's monstrous crimes, just think about the money to be made\" editorial line.  The United States likes to impose Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions in trade deals on smaller countries, ostensibly because the legal systems of smaller countries can't be trusted to protect investment by US firms. But it's unlikely any dispute that ended up before a dodgy international ISDS forum has ever been remotely the size of what will be a forced acquisition of TikTok.  Trump has also, Mafia-style, insisted that the US government receive a large slice of any deal. This <url normalizedValue=\"https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-bid-piece-microsoft-tiktok-232008217.html?_guc_consent_skip=1597008855\">may well be unconstitutional</url>. One lawyer described it as \"akin to the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</emphasis> but on US soil, where the US government would be able to require what is tantamount to a bribe in order to obtain a regulatory approval for a business transaction\".  Imagine the outrage if the Chinese government demands that the Chinese operations of Microsoft be ceded to a local government after any TikTok deal was completed -- and takes a juicy cut of the proceeds.

We're all supposed to hate the Chinese tyranny and the tech companies it can use to serve its purposes of surveillance, control and commercial espionage, both at home and abroad.  But the Five Eyes governments of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are no better when it comes to surveillance and commercial espionage -- and control, when they want it. Indeed, we invented the practice of hoovering up personal data from tech platforms -- and Western companies invented the practice of monetising that data.  Perhaps that's why no one seems perturbed that the Trump administration intends to prise the boom social media app TikTok from the ownership of Chinese company, ByteDance.  Bytedance identified an opportunity in -- or perhaps created, or both -- young people's interest in mobile short videos. Anyone over 25 either never heard of TikTok or would be completely bewildered by what its users see in it. It's a classic case of innovation driven by connectedness, which left Western tech giants miles behind.  Now, on the pretext TikTok is a security threat due to its vacuuming up of personal data -- the very business model of Facebook and Google -- the Trump administration is going to ban it, forcing a sale to Western interests. Microsoft has put its hand up to acquire TikTok in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Trump has set a deadline of September 15 for a deal to be done. There will be a lot of haggling over the price, but Microsoft had US$136 billion in cash at the end of June.  Microsoft's acquisition might be at the exact moment TikTok loses its lustre -- or one may cause the other. Either way, the acquisition has all the characteristics of News Corp's 2005 acquisition of MySpace.  But once it is controlled by Microsoft, it means that the NSA, the Australian Signals Directorate and other Five Eyes governments will be able to use the app to vacuum up user data. And, as the Snowden revelations demonstrated over and over again, that's exactly what our governments do.  Indeed, the Australian government, in last week's melodramatic cybersecurity strategy, boasted of its ability to thwart encryption on widely used apps and devices.  The main use of such information is allegedly to fight terrorism, child abuse and organised crime. In reality it's commercial espionage and pursuing whistleblowers, journalists, lawyers and anyone else who embarrasses governments.  But that's only the start of the hypocrisy.  For the last couple of years, pretty much everyone has been railing about big tech and the need to impose limits on the monopolistic practices of Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet (owners of Google) and Apple. Microsoft, of course, was being pursued by competition regulators before Facebook and Amazon even existed. It's been one of the few causes to bring politicians together in this polarised political age.  Now Trump and the US Congress are now willing to anoint them as the national champion to grab control of the major foreign threat to big tech.  The mainstream media, eviscerated by Facebook and Google, have cheered on attempts to rein in big tech. Here, News Corp essentially dictated to the Morrison government how it should force Google and Facebook to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars allegedly for use of content. So all the more curious that the crushing of a competitor to big tech not merely in the US and Canada but here as well has been greeted with such equanimity, especially at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial Review</emphasis>, which normally adopts a \"forget China's monstrous crimes, just think about the money to be made\" editorial line.  The United States likes to impose Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions in trade deals on smaller countries, ostensibly because the legal systems of smaller countries can't be trusted to protect investment by US firms. But it's unlikely any dispute that ended up before a dodgy international ISDS forum has ever been remotely the size of what will be a forced acquisition of TikTok.  Trump has also, Mafia-style, insisted that the US government receive a large slice of any deal. This <url normalizedValue=\"https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-bid-piece-microsoft-tiktok-232008217.html?_guc_consent_skip=1597008855\">may well be unconstitutional</url>. One lawyer described it as \"akin to the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</emphasis> but on US soil, where the US government would be able to require what is tantamount to a bribe in order to obtain a regulatory approval for a business transaction\".  Imagine the outrage if the Chinese government demands that the Chinese operations of Microsoft be ceded to a local government after any TikTok deal was completed -- and takes a juicy cut of the proceeds.

We're all supposed to hate the Chinese tyranny and the tech companies it can use to serve its purposes of surveillance, control and commercial espionage, both at home and abroad.  But the Five Eyes governments of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are no better when it comes to surveillance and commercial espionage -- and control, when they want it. Indeed, we invented the practice of hoovering up personal data from tech platforms -- and Western companies invented the practice of monetising that data.  Perhaps that's why no one seems perturbed that the Trump administration intends to prise the boom social media app TikTok from the ownership of Chinese company, ByteDance.  Bytedance identified an opportunity in -- or perhaps created, or both -- young people's interest in mobile short videos. Anyone over 25 either never heard of TikTok or would be completely bewildered by what its users see in it. It's a classic case of innovation driven by connectedness, which left Western tech giants miles behind.  Now, on the pretext TikTok is a security threat due to its vacuuming up of personal data -- the very business model of Facebook and Google -- the Trump administration is going to ban it, forcing a sale to Western interests. Microsoft has put its hand up to acquire TikTok in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Trump has set a deadline of September 15 for a deal to be done. There will be a lot of haggling over the price, but Microsoft had US$136 billion in cash at the end of June.  Microsoft's acquisition might be at the exact moment TikTok loses its lustre -- or one may cause the other. Either way, the acquisition has all the characteristics of News Corp's 2005 acquisition of MySpace.  But once it is controlled by Microsoft, it means that the NSA, the Australian Signals Directorate and other Five Eyes governments will be able to use the app to vacuum up user data. And, as the Snowden revelations demonstrated over and over again, that's exactly what our governments do.  Indeed, the Australian government, in last week's melodramatic cybersecurity strategy, boasted of its ability to thwart encryption on widely used apps and devices.  The main use of such information is allegedly to fight terrorism, child abuse and organised crime. In reality it's commercial espionage and pursuing whistleblowers, journalists, lawyers and anyone else who embarrasses governments.  But that's only the start of the hypocrisy.  For the last couple of years, pretty much everyone has been railing about big tech and the need to impose limits on the monopolistic practices of Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet (owners of Google) and Apple. Microsoft, of course, was being pursued by competition regulators before Facebook and Amazon even existed. It's been one of the few causes to bring politicians together in this polarised political age.  Now Trump and the US Congress are now willing to anoint them as the national champion to grab control of the major foreign threat to big tech.  The mainstream media, eviscerated by Facebook and Google, have cheered on attempts to rein in big tech. Here, News Corp essentially dictated to the Morrison government how it should force Google and Facebook to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars allegedly for use of content. So all the more curious that the crushing of a competitor to big tech not merely in the US and Canada but here as well has been greeted with such equanimity, especially at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial Review</emphasis>, which normally adopts a \"forget China's monstrous crimes, just think about the money to be made\" editorial line.  The United States likes to impose Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions in trade deals on smaller countries, ostensibly because the legal systems of smaller countries can't be trusted to protect investment by US firms. But it's unlikely any dispute that ended up before a dodgy international ISDS forum has ever been remotely the size of what will be a forced acquisition of TikTok.  Trump has also, Mafia-style, insisted that the US government receive a large slice of any deal. This <url normalizedValue=\"https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-bid-piece-microsoft-tiktok-232008217.html?_guc_consent_skip=1597008855\">may well be unconstitutional</url>. One lawyer described it as \"akin to the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</emphasis> but on US soil, where the US government would be able to require what is tantamount to a bribe in order to obtain a regulatory approval for a business transaction\".  Imagine the outrage if the Chinese government demands that the Chinese operations of Microsoft be ceded to a local government after any TikTok deal was completed -- and takes a juicy cut of the proceeds.

We're all supposed to hate the Chinese tyranny and the tech companies it can use to serve its purposes of surveillance, control and commercial espionage, both at home and abroad.  But the Five Eyes governments of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are no better when it comes to surveillance and commercial espionage -- and control, when they want it. Indeed, we invented the practice of hoovering up personal data from tech platforms -- and Western companies invented the practice of monetising that data.  Perhaps that's why no one seems perturbed that the Trump administration intends to prise the boom social media app TikTok from the ownership of Chinese company, ByteDance.  Bytedance identified an opportunity in -- or perhaps created, or both -- young people's interest in mobile short videos. Anyone over 25 either never heard of TikTok or would be completely bewildered by what its users see in it. It's a classic case of innovation driven by connectedness, which left Western tech giants miles behind.  Now, on the pretext TikTok is a security threat due to its vacuuming up of personal data -- the very business model of Facebook and Google -- the Trump administration is going to ban it, forcing a sale to Western interests. Microsoft has put its hand up to acquire TikTok in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Trump has set a deadline of September 15 for a deal to be done. There will be a lot of haggling over the price, but Microsoft had US$136 billion in cash at the end of June.  Microsoft's acquisition might be at the exact moment TikTok loses its lustre -- or one may cause the other. Either way, the acquisition has all the characteristics of News Corp's 2005 acquisition of MySpace.  But once it is controlled by Microsoft, it means that the NSA, the Australian Signals Directorate and other Five Eyes governments will be able to use the app to vacuum up user data. And, as the Snowden revelations demonstrated over and over again, that's exactly what our governments do.  Indeed, the Australian government, in last week's melodramatic cybersecurity strategy, boasted of its ability to thwart encryption on widely used apps and devices.  The main use of such information is allegedly to fight terrorism, child abuse and organised crime. In reality it's commercial espionage and pursuing whistleblowers, journalists, lawyers and anyone else who embarrasses governments.  But that's only the start of the hypocrisy.  For the last couple of years, pretty much everyone has been railing about big tech and the need to impose limits on the monopolistic practices of Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet (owners of Google) and Apple. Microsoft, of course, was being pursued by competition regulators before Facebook and Amazon even existed. It's been one of the few causes to bring politicians together in this polarised political age.  Now Trump and the US Congress are now willing to anoint them as the national champion to grab control of the major foreign threat to big tech.  The mainstream media, eviscerated by Facebook and Google, have cheered on attempts to rein in big tech. Here, News Corp essentially dictated to the Morrison government how it should force Google and Facebook to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars allegedly for use of content. So all the more curious that the crushing of a competitor to big tech not merely in the US and Canada but here as well has been greeted with such equanimity, especially at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial Review</emphasis>, which normally adopts a \"forget China's monstrous crimes, just think about the money to be made\" editorial line.  The United States likes to impose Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions in trade deals on smaller countries, ostensibly because the legal systems of smaller countries can't be trusted to protect investment by US firms. But it's unlikely any dispute that ended up before a dodgy international ISDS forum has ever been remotely the size of what will be a forced acquisition of TikTok.  Trump has also, Mafia-style, insisted that the US government receive a large slice of any deal. This <url normalizedValue=\"https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-bid-piece-microsoft-tiktok-232008217.html?_guc_consent_skip=1597008855\">may well be unconstitutional</url>. One lawyer described it as \"akin to the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</emphasis> but on US soil, where the US government would be able to require what is tantamount to a bribe in order to obtain a regulatory approval for a business transaction\".  Imagine the outrage if the Chinese government demands that the Chinese operations of Microsoft be ceded to a local government after any TikTok deal was completed -- and takes a juicy cut of the proceeds.

We're all supposed to hate the Chinese tyranny and the tech companies it can use to serve its purposes of surveillance, control and commercial espionage, both at home and abroad.  But the Five Eyes governments of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are no better when it comes to surveillance and commercial espionage -- and control, when they want it. Indeed, we invented the practice of hoovering up personal data from tech platforms -- and Western companies invented the practice of monetising that data.  Perhaps that's why no one seems perturbed that the Trump administration intends to prise the boom social media app TikTok from the ownership of Chinese company, ByteDance.  Bytedance identified an opportunity in -- or perhaps created, or both -- young people's interest in mobile short videos. Anyone over 25 either never heard of TikTok or would be completely bewildered by what its users see in it. It's a classic case of innovation driven by connectedness, which left Western tech giants miles behind.  Now, on the pretext TikTok is a security threat due to its vacuuming up of personal data -- the very business model of Facebook and Google -- the Trump administration is going to ban it, forcing a sale to Western interests. Microsoft has put its hand up to acquire TikTok in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Trump has set a deadline of September 15 for a deal to be done. There will be a lot of haggling over the price, but Microsoft had US$136 billion in cash at the end of June.  Microsoft's acquisition might be at the exact moment TikTok loses its lustre -- or one may cause the other. Either way, the acquisition has all the characteristics of News Corp's 2005 acquisition of MySpace.  But once it is controlled by Microsoft, it means that the NSA, the Australian Signals Directorate and other Five Eyes governments will be able to use the app to vacuum up user data. And, as the Snowden revelations demonstrated over and over again, that's exactly what our governments do.  Indeed, the Australian government, in last week's melodramatic cybersecurity strategy, boasted of its ability to thwart encryption on widely used apps and devices.  The main use of such information is allegedly to fight terrorism, child abuse and organised crime. In reality it's commercial espionage and pursuing whistleblowers, journalists, lawyers and anyone else who embarrasses governments.  But that's only the start of the hypocrisy.  For the last couple of years, pretty much everyone has been railing about big tech and the need to impose limits on the monopolistic practices of Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet (owners of Google) and Apple. Microsoft, of course, was being pursued by competition regulators before Facebook and Amazon even existed. It's been one of the few causes to bring politicians together in this polarised political age.  Now Trump and the US Congress are now willing to anoint them as the national champion to grab control of the major foreign threat to big tech.  The mainstream media, eviscerated by Facebook and Google, have cheered on attempts to rein in big tech. Here, News Corp essentially dictated to the Morrison government how it should force Google and Facebook to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars allegedly for use of content. So all the more curious that the crushing of a competitor to big tech not merely in the US and Canada but here as well has been greeted with such equanimity, especially at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial Review</emphasis>, which normally adopts a \"forget China's monstrous crimes, just think about the money to be made\" editorial line.  The United States likes to impose Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions in trade deals on smaller countries, ostensibly because the legal systems of smaller countries can't be trusted to protect investment by US firms. But it's unlikely any dispute that ended up before a dodgy international ISDS forum has ever been remotely the size of what will be a forced acquisition of TikTok.  Trump has also, Mafia-style, insisted that the US government receive a large slice of any deal. This <url normalizedValue=\"https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-bid-piece-microsoft-tiktok-232008217.html?_guc_consent_skip=1597008855\">may well be unconstitutional</url>. One lawyer described it as \"akin to the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</emphasis> but on US soil, where the US government would be able to require what is tantamount to a bribe in order to obtain a regulatory approval for a business transaction\".  Imagine the outrage if the Chinese government demands that the Chinese operations of Microsoft be ceded to a local government after any TikTok deal was completed -- and takes a juicy cut of the proceeds.

We're all supposed to hate the Chinese tyranny and the tech companies it can use to serve its purposes of surveillance, control and commercial espionage, both at home and abroad.  But the Five Eyes governments of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are no better when it comes to surveillance and commercial espionage -- and control, when they want it. Indeed, we invented the practice of hoovering up personal data from tech platforms -- and Western companies invented the practice of monetising that data.  Perhaps that's why no one seems perturbed that the Trump administration intends to prise the boom social media app TikTok from the ownership of Chinese company, ByteDance.  Bytedance identified an opportunity in -- or perhaps created, or both -- young people's interest in mobile short videos. Anyone over 25 either never heard of TikTok or would be completely bewildered by what its users see in it. It's a classic case of innovation driven by connectedness, which left Western tech giants miles behind.  Now, on the pretext TikTok is a security threat due to its vacuuming up of personal data -- the very business model of Facebook and Google -- the Trump administration is going to ban it, forcing a sale to Western interests. Microsoft has put its hand up to acquire TikTok in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Trump has set a deadline of September 15 for a deal to be done. There will be a lot of haggling over the price, but Microsoft had US$136 billion in cash at the end of June.  Microsoft's acquisition might be at the exact moment TikTok loses its lustre -- or one may cause the other. Either way, the acquisition has all the characteristics of News Corp's 2005 acquisition of MySpace.  But once it is controlled by Microsoft, it means that the NSA, the Australian Signals Directorate and other Five Eyes governments will be able to use the app to vacuum up user data. And, as the Snowden revelations demonstrated over and over again, that's exactly what our governments do.  Indeed, the Australian government, in last week's melodramatic cybersecurity strategy, boasted of its ability to thwart encryption on widely used apps and devices.  The main use of such information is allegedly to fight terrorism, child abuse and organised crime. In reality it's commercial espionage and pursuing whistleblowers, journalists, lawyers and anyone else who embarrasses governments.  But that's only the start of the hypocrisy.  For the last couple of years, pretty much everyone has been railing about big tech and the need to impose limits on the monopolistic practices of Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet (owners of Google) and Apple. Microsoft, of course, was being pursued by competition regulators before Facebook and Amazon even existed. It's been one of the few causes to bring politicians together in this polarised political age.  Now Trump and the US Congress are now willing to anoint them as the national champion to grab control of the major foreign threat to big tech.  The mainstream media, eviscerated by Facebook and Google, have cheered on attempts to rein in big tech. Here, News Corp essentially dictated to the Morrison government how it should force Google and Facebook to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars allegedly for use of content. So all the more curious that the crushing of a competitor to big tech not merely in the US and Canada but here as well has been greeted with such equanimity, especially at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial Review</emphasis>, which normally adopts a \"forget China's monstrous crimes, just think about the money to be made\" editorial line.  The United States likes to impose Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions in trade deals on smaller countries, ostensibly because the legal systems of smaller countries can't be trusted to protect investment by US firms. But it's unlikely any dispute that ended up before a dodgy international ISDS forum has ever been remotely the size of what will be a forced acquisition of TikTok.  Trump has also, Mafia-style, insisted that the US government receive a large slice of any deal. This <url normalizedValue=\"https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-bid-piece-microsoft-tiktok-232008217.html?_guc_consent_skip=1597008855\">may well be unconstitutional</url>. One lawyer described it as \"akin to the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</emphasis> but on US soil, where the US government would be able to require what is tantamount to a bribe in order to obtain a regulatory approval for a business transaction\".  Imagine the outrage if the Chinese government demands that the Chinese operations of Microsoft be ceded to a local government after any TikTok deal was completed -- and takes a juicy cut of the proceeds.

We're all supposed to hate the Chinese tyranny and the tech companies it can use to serve its purposes of surveillance, control and commercial espionage, both at home and abroad.  But the Five Eyes governments of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are no better when it comes to surveillance and commercial espionage -- and control, when they want it. Indeed, we invented the practice of hoovering up personal data from tech platforms -- and Western companies invented the practice of monetising that data.  Perhaps that's why no one seems perturbed that the Trump administration intends to prise the boom social media app TikTok from the ownership of Chinese company, ByteDance.  Bytedance identified an opportunity in -- or perhaps created, or both -- young people's interest in mobile short videos. Anyone over 25 either never heard of TikTok or would be completely bewildered by what its users see in it. It's a classic case of innovation driven by connectedness, which left Western tech giants miles behind.  Now, on the pretext TikTok is a security threat due to its vacuuming up of personal data -- the very business model of Facebook and Google -- the Trump administration is going to ban it, forcing a sale to Western interests. Microsoft has put its hand up to acquire TikTok in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Trump has set a deadline of September 15 for a deal to be done. There will be a lot of haggling over the price, but Microsoft had US$136 billion in cash at the end of June.  Microsoft's acquisition might be at the exact moment TikTok loses its lustre -- or one may cause the other. Either way, the acquisition has all the characteristics of News Corp's 2005 acquisition of MySpace.  But once it is controlled by Microsoft, it means that the NSA, the Australian Signals Directorate and other Five Eyes governments will be able to use the app to vacuum up user data. And, as the Snowden revelations demonstrated over and over again, that's exactly what our governments do.  Indeed, the Australian government, in last week's melodramatic cybersecurity strategy, boasted of its ability to thwart encryption on widely used apps and devices.  The main use of such information is allegedly to fight terrorism, child abuse and organised crime. In reality it's commercial espionage and pursuing whistleblowers, journalists, lawyers and anyone else who embarrasses governments.  But that's only the start of the hypocrisy.  For the last couple of years, pretty much everyone has been railing about big tech and the need to impose limits on the monopolistic practices of Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet (owners of Google) and Apple. Microsoft, of course, was being pursued by competition regulators before Facebook and Amazon even existed. It's been one of the few causes to bring politicians together in this polarised political age.  Now Trump and the US Congress are now willing to anoint them as the national champion to grab control of the major foreign threat to big tech.  The mainstream media, eviscerated by Facebook and Google, have cheered on attempts to rein in big tech. Here, News Corp essentially dictated to the Morrison government how it should force Google and Facebook to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars allegedly for use of content. So all the more curious that the crushing of a competitor to big tech not merely in the US and Canada but here as well has been greeted with such equanimity, especially at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial Review</emphasis>, which normally adopts a \"forget China's monstrous crimes, just think about the money to be made\" editorial line.  The United States likes to impose Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions in trade deals on smaller countries, ostensibly because the legal systems of smaller countries can't be trusted to protect investment by US firms. But it's unlikely any dispute that ended up before a dodgy international ISDS forum has ever been remotely the size of what will be a forced acquisition of TikTok.  Trump has also, Mafia-style, insisted that the US government receive a large slice of any deal. This <url normalizedValue=\"https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-bid-piece-microsoft-tiktok-232008217.html?_guc_consent_skip=1597008855\">may well be unconstitutional</url>. One lawyer described it as \"akin to the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</emphasis> but on US soil, where the US government would be able to require what is tantamount to a bribe in order to obtain a regulatory approval for a business transaction\".  Imagine the outrage if the Chinese government demands that the Chinese operations of Microsoft be ceded to a local government after any TikTok deal was completed -- and takes a juicy cut of the proceeds.

We're all supposed to hate the Chinese tyranny and the tech companies it can use to serve its purposes of surveillance, control and commercial espionage, both at home and abroad.  But the Five Eyes governments of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are no better when it comes to surveillance and commercial espionage -- and control, when they want it. Indeed, we invented the practice of hoovering up personal data from tech platforms -- and Western companies invented the practice of monetising that data.  Perhaps that's why no one seems perturbed that the Trump administration intends to prise the boom social media app TikTok from the ownership of Chinese company, ByteDance.  Bytedance identified an opportunity in -- or perhaps created, or both -- young people's interest in mobile short videos. Anyone over 25 either never heard of TikTok or would be completely bewildered by what its users see in it. It's a classic case of innovation driven by connectedness, which left Western tech giants miles behind.  Now, on the pretext TikTok is a security threat due to its vacuuming up of personal data -- the very business model of Facebook and Google -- the Trump administration is going to ban it, forcing a sale to Western interests. Microsoft has put its hand up to acquire TikTok in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Trump has set a deadline of September 15 for a deal to be done. There will be a lot of haggling over the price, but Microsoft had US$136 billion in cash at the end of June.  Microsoft's acquisition might be at the exact moment TikTok loses its lustre -- or one may cause the other. Either way, the acquisition has all the characteristics of News Corp's 2005 acquisition of MySpace.  But once it is controlled by Microsoft, it means that the NSA, the Australian Signals Directorate and other Five Eyes governments will be able to use the app to vacuum up user data. And, as the Snowden revelations demonstrated over and over again, that's exactly what our governments do.  Indeed, the Australian government, in last week's melodramatic cybersecurity strategy, boasted of its ability to thwart encryption on widely used apps and devices.  The main use of such information is allegedly to fight terrorism, child abuse and organised crime. In reality it's commercial espionage and pursuing whistleblowers, journalists, lawyers and anyone else who embarrasses governments.  But that's only the start of the hypocrisy.  For the last couple of years, pretty much everyone has been railing about big tech and the need to impose limits on the monopolistic practices of Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet (owners of Google) and Apple. Microsoft, of course, was being pursued by competition regulators before Facebook and Amazon even existed. It's been one of the few causes to bring politicians together in this polarised political age.  Now Trump and the US Congress are now willing to anoint them as the national champion to grab control of the major foreign threat to big tech.  The mainstream media, eviscerated by Facebook and Google, have cheered on attempts to rein in big tech. Here, News Corp essentially dictated to the Morrison government how it should force Google and Facebook to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars allegedly for use of content. So all the more curious that the crushing of a competitor to big tech not merely in the US and Canada but here as well has been greeted with such equanimity, especially at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial Review</emphasis>, which normally adopts a \"forget China's monstrous crimes, just think about the money to be made\" editorial line.  The United States likes to impose Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions in trade deals on smaller countries, ostensibly because the legal systems of smaller countries can't be trusted to protect investment by US firms. But it's unlikely any dispute that ended up before a dodgy international ISDS forum has ever been remotely the size of what will be a forced acquisition of TikTok.  Trump has also, Mafia-style, insisted that the US government receive a large slice of any deal. This <url normalizedValue=\"https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-bid-piece-microsoft-tiktok-232008217.html?_guc_consent_skip=1597008855\">may well be unconstitutional</url>. One lawyer described it as \"akin to the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</emphasis> but on US soil, where the US government would be able to require what is tantamount to a bribe in order to obtain a regulatory approval for a business transaction\".  Imagine the outrage if the Chinese government demands that the Chinese operations of Microsoft be ceded to a local government after any TikTok deal was completed -- and takes a juicy cut of the proceeds.

We're all supposed to hate the Chinese tyranny and the tech companies it can use to serve its purposes of surveillance, control and commercial espionage, both at home and abroad.  But the Five Eyes governments of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are no better when it comes to surveillance and commercial espionage -- and control, when they want it. Indeed, we invented the practice of hoovering up personal data from tech platforms -- and Western companies invented the practice of monetising that data.  Perhaps that's why no one seems perturbed that the Trump administration intends to prise the boom social media app TikTok from the ownership of Chinese company, ByteDance.  Bytedance identified an opportunity in -- or perhaps created, or both -- young people's interest in mobile short videos. Anyone over 25 either never heard of TikTok or would be completely bewildered by what its users see in it. It's a classic case of innovation driven by connectedness, which left Western tech giants miles behind.  Now, on the pretext TikTok is a security threat due to its vacuuming up of personal data -- the very business model of Facebook and Google -- the Trump administration is going to ban it, forcing a sale to Western interests. Microsoft has put its hand up to acquire TikTok in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Trump has set a deadline of September 15 for a deal to be done. There will be a lot of haggling over the price, but Microsoft had US$136 billion in cash at the end of June.  Microsoft's acquisition might be at the exact moment TikTok loses its lustre -- or one may cause the other. Either way, the acquisition has all the characteristics of News Corp's 2005 acquisition of MySpace.  But once it is controlled by Microsoft, it means that the NSA, the Australian Signals Directorate and other Five Eyes governments will be able to use the app to vacuum up user data. And, as the Snowden revelations demonstrated over and over again, that's exactly what our governments do.  Indeed, the Australian government, in last week's melodramatic cybersecurity strategy, boasted of its ability to thwart encryption on widely used apps and devices.  The main use of such information is allegedly to fight terrorism, child abuse and organised crime. In reality it's commercial espionage and pursuing whistleblowers, journalists, lawyers and anyone else who embarrasses governments.  But that's only the start of the hypocrisy.  For the last couple of years, pretty much everyone has been railing about big tech and the need to impose limits on the monopolistic practices of Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet (owners of Google) and Apple. Microsoft, of course, was being pursued by competition regulators before Facebook and Amazon even existed. It's been one of the few causes to bring politicians together in this polarised political age.  Now Trump and the US Congress are now willing to anoint them as the national champion to grab control of the major foreign threat to big tech.  The mainstream media, eviscerated by Facebook and Google, have cheered on attempts to rein in big tech. Here, News Corp essentially dictated to the Morrison government how it should force Google and Facebook to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars allegedly for use of content. So all the more curious that the crushing of a competitor to big tech not merely in the US and Canada but here as well has been greeted with such equanimity, especially at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial Review</emphasis>, which normally adopts a \"forget China's monstrous crimes, just think about the money to be made\" editorial line.  The United States likes to impose Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions in trade deals on smaller countries, ostensibly because the legal systems of smaller countries can't be trusted to protect investment by US firms. But it's unlikely any dispute that ended up before a dodgy international ISDS forum has ever been remotely the size of what will be a forced acquisition of TikTok.  Trump has also, Mafia-style, insisted that the US government receive a large slice of any deal. This <url normalizedValue=\"https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-bid-piece-microsoft-tiktok-232008217.html?_guc_consent_skip=1597008855\">may well be unconstitutional</url>. One lawyer described it as \"akin to the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</emphasis> but on US soil, where the US government would be able to require what is tantamount to a bribe in order to obtain a regulatory approval for a business transaction\".  Imagine the outrage if the Chinese government demands that the Chinese operations of Microsoft be ceded to a local government after any TikTok deal was completed -- and takes a juicy cut of the proceeds.

We're all supposed to hate the Chinese tyranny and the tech companies it can use to serve its purposes of surveillance, control and commercial espionage, both at home and abroad.  But the Five Eyes governments of the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are no better when it comes to surveillance and commercial espionage -- and control, when they want it. Indeed, we invented the practice of hoovering up personal data from tech platforms -- and Western companies invented the practice of monetising that data.  Perhaps that's why no one seems perturbed that the Trump administration intends to prise the boom social media app TikTok from the ownership of Chinese company, ByteDance.  Bytedance identified an opportunity in -- or perhaps created, or both -- young people's interest in mobile short videos. Anyone over 25 either never heard of TikTok or would be completely bewildered by what its users see in it. It's a classic case of innovation driven by connectedness, which left Western tech giants miles behind.  Now, on the pretext TikTok is a security threat due to its vacuuming up of personal data -- the very business model of Facebook and Google -- the Trump administration is going to ban it, forcing a sale to Western interests. Microsoft has put its hand up to acquire TikTok in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Trump has set a deadline of September 15 for a deal to be done. There will be a lot of haggling over the price, but Microsoft had US$136 billion in cash at the end of June.  Microsoft's acquisition might be at the exact moment TikTok loses its lustre -- or one may cause the other. Either way, the acquisition has all the characteristics of News Corp's 2005 acquisition of MySpace.  But once it is controlled by Microsoft, it means that the NSA, the Australian Signals Directorate and other Five Eyes governments will be able to use the app to vacuum up user data. And, as the Snowden revelations demonstrated over and over again, that's exactly what our governments do.  Indeed, the Australian government, in last week's melodramatic cybersecurity strategy, boasted of its ability to thwart encryption on widely used apps and devices.  The main use of such information is allegedly to fight terrorism, child abuse and organised crime. In reality it's commercial espionage and pursuing whistleblowers, journalists, lawyers and anyone else who embarrasses governments.  But that's only the start of the hypocrisy.  For the last couple of years, pretty much everyone has been railing about big tech and the need to impose limits on the monopolistic practices of Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet (owners of Google) and Apple. Microsoft, of course, was being pursued by competition regulators before Facebook and Amazon even existed. It's been one of the few causes to bring politicians together in this polarised political age.  Now Trump and the US Congress are now willing to anoint them as the national champion to grab control of the major foreign threat to big tech.  The mainstream media, eviscerated by Facebook and Google, have cheered on attempts to rein in big tech. Here, News Corp essentially dictated to the Morrison government how it should force Google and Facebook to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars allegedly for use of content. So all the more curious that the crushing of a competitor to big tech not merely in the US and Canada but here as well has been greeted with such equanimity, especially at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Financial Review</emphasis>, which normally adopts a \"forget China's monstrous crimes, just think about the money to be made\" editorial line.  The United States likes to impose Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) provisions in trade deals on smaller countries, ostensibly because the legal systems of smaller countries can't be trusted to protect investment by US firms. But it's unlikely any dispute that ended up before a dodgy international ISDS forum has ever been remotely the size of what will be a forced acquisition of TikTok.  Trump has also, Mafia-style, insisted that the US government receive a large slice of any deal. This <url normalizedValue=\"https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-bid-piece-microsoft-tiktok-232008217.html?_guc_consent_skip=1597008855\">may well be unconstitutional</url>. One lawyer described it as \"akin to the<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Foreign Corrupt Practices Act</emphasis> but on US soil, where the US government would be able to require what is tantamount to a bribe in order to obtain a regulatory approval for a business transaction\".  Imagine the outrage if the Chinese government demands that the Chinese operations of Microsoft be ceded to a local government after any TikTok deal was completed -- and takes a juicy cut of the proceeds.

And in light of seismic changes that affect their businesses (like Google eliminating third-party ad targeting and federal and state data privacy legislation), these companies are now piecing together an education campaign to explain the benefits they bring to the public.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This will include taking up ad space on consumer-facing websites to show how ad tech is undergoing a reboot, putting the consumer back in control. Perhaps more importantly, the campaign will tell readers how the data they collect subsequently funds online content.</p><p>The initiative forms part of the IAB Tech Lab\u2019s last-ditch efforts to reform the online advertising industry, now that all of the industry\u2019s major internet browser providers have called time on the cookie, the software at the core of ad tech.</p><p>Although no timeline for the education campaign has been laid out, the campaign is part of the trade org\u2019s plans to overhaul the very DNA of ad tech since Google planned to phase-out third-party cookies in its market-leading Chrome browser by 2022.</p><p>An outline of the planned campaign was laid out this week at the IAB Annual Leadership Meeting where executives discussed efforts to use first-party publisher data, such as hashed email addresses, as the core tool for online audience targeting.</p><p>Speaking at a town hall session at this week\u2019s IAB conference conducted under the Chatham House Rule, executives described plans to articulate themselves to the public, including how the new proposals will put consumers at the center of control.</p><p>\u201cWe have to work on the narrative as much as the solution,\u201d one executive leading these efforts said. \u201cRight now, as an industry, there\u2019s a little bit of demonization going on and it\u2019s going to get worse.\u201d</p><p>The executives who have envisaged the campaign want to downplay notions of ad-tech players invading privacy and stealing data. Instead, they want to articulate the benefits they bring to the public, especially how they help fund quality journalism.</p><p>\u201cRight now, as an industry, we have a branding problem,\u201d continued the aforementioned executive.</p><p>The public education campaign is at the latter phase of a multi-tiered strategy to convince the public as well as key industry stakeholders such as Apple, Google and Firefox-provider-Mozilla that the new means of ad targeting are user-friendly.</p><p>At this point, those involved in the plans want to assemble a global coalition of companies with aligned interest (i.e. those outside of the walled gardens) to jointly fund research and development\u2013plus ad inventory for the planned public education campaign\u2013that will result in a \u201cprivacy-first\u201d version of the \u201copen web.\u201d</p><p>Up until now, cookies (both first- and third-party) have been the nexus that helped interconnect the multitude of players involved in online audience targeting.</p><p>However, now that the internet\u2019s largest names are clamping down on practices that lawmakers deem dubious (such as fingerprinting plus certain data transfers used in online ad auctions), seismic changes are afoot. This means ad tech must reform itself. Leading voices in the space want to go public with how they operate, and the crucial role they play in funding online content.</p><p>Another executive said: \u201cOur plan is to talk to about 1,000 companies around the world in 90 days globally and get them to sign-up and support this in the form of real inventory and audience, and real dollars.\u201d</p><p>This effort to court support from the industry could come in the guise of \u201copen web\u201d players such as publishers donating media inventory, which could then be used to articulate the value exchange involved in audience profiling in exchange for free content.</p><p>The same executive went on to add: \u201cPhase three [of the process] will involve creating a consumer-facing campaign with an ideal minimum reach of 2 billion people.\u201d</p><p>Additional extensions of the proposed global campaign to champion ad tech, such as TV spots, were also discussed at the session but no firm decisions have been taken yet. Executives compared the ambitions of the campaign to iconic public service campaigns of the past such as \u201cGot Milk,\u201d or \u201cLive Aid\u201d in the hopes that it will help trigger a significant realignment in public perception and awareness.</p><p>\u201cWe want something that\u2019s friendly, something that\u2019s consistent so that my mom and all your friends and family who don\u2019t work in this industry can say \u2018okay, I get it, that\u2019s what the deal is,\u2019\u201d one session participant quipped.</p><p>Consumer-facing campaigns about the mechanics of ad tech plus the commercial incentive to partake in the value exchange are not without precedent. In 2012, UK publishers reacted to changes in the law there about cookie transparency with the launch of a campaign called YourOnlineChoices.</p><p>A recent report by BritePool found that 88% of U.S. consumers believe it\u2019s important for ad-tech companies and publishers to be transparent over how their data is used, including how this information is shared with third parties.</p><p>Amid a rising tide of separate data privacy regulation initiatives that have caused much confusion, and will likely result in a state-by-state series of contrasting laws, it is expected that advertisers will concentrate their media spend within walled gardens.</p><p>Some will argue this is against their best interests, as marketers increasingly grow to realize the dominance of Big Tech is not within their best interests. This underlines the critical importance of the success of any such ad tech education-drive, as recent study by Google found that the absence of behaviorally targeted ads could reduce publishers\u2019 ad yield by as much as 52%.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADWEEK-1123108</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADWEEK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6D-23M1-JC8H-T2J6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">7907</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"946\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Mediabistro Holdings, LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>adweek.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18987\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 12, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

People will spend money, eat food, watch (and play) sports, use phone apps and play video games, and countries around the world will engage in diplomacy \" and conflict. The details of all those things, as always, will be what make the year interesting. To get a jump on the future, we asked Washington Post beat reporters and columnists to think about the big stories, themes and questions that we'll look back on  this time next December. Here is Outlook's fourth  Year in Preview.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                                                                                TV by Steven Zeitchik                   New big streaming services will mean new big hits (and new big bills)          </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The last few months of 2019 were filled with streaming news. Buckets of it. From the nonstop marketing of Jennifer Aniston in Apple TV Plus's 'The Morning Show' to that ubiquitous Baby Yoda from Disney Plus's 'The Mandalorian,' it seemed like the spigot might never turn off.                      </p><p>And it won't, not anytime soon. This will be a year of new digital programming \" and new services to deliver it.</p><p>Just two weeks into 2020, Comcast will unveil more details about Peacock, its new service with content from across NBC Universal properties, set to launch several months later. The spring will also bring HBO Max, the prestige-branded service with all manner of TV shows and movies from the WarnerMedia empire. Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus, both of which launched in November, will add more content throughout the year, too \" as will Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post).</p><p>Viewers will have an ever-wider choice of fresh programming. Want new seasons of fan favorites 'Search Party' and 'The Boondocks'? They'll be on HBO Max. It's the final episodes of 'BoJack Horseman' you crave? Where else but Netflix. Looking for 'The Falcon and the Winter Soldier' to give you a fix between Marvel movies? Disney Plus has you covered.</p><p>Finding out when new episodes premiere, let alone whether they're worth watching, will be a task far more complicated than your Twitter feed can keep up with.</p><p>All these services know they need to offer some reliable hits to complement the new stuff. That means many popular sitcoms are migrating from Netflix. 'The Office' is headed to Peacock; 'Friends' to HBO Max.</p><p>And it will all be expensive. Turns out spending sacks of cash on new shows and movies \" Netflix alone is expected to shell out in excess of $15 billion in 2020 \" isn't easy without ad revenue. Services have to charge, whether that's the $5 a month for Apple TV Plus or the $15 for HBO Max. For consumers, that means piling on to a monthly entertainment bill or making tough choices about what to forgo.</p><p>But don't get too despondent. If some of the recent sitcoms you seek are too unwieldy or costly to find on streaming services, there's a suddenly appealing option: traditional television. Many shows, after all, will continue to air in syndication. </p><p>                                   @ZeitchikWaPo                             </p><p>         Brexit by Karla Adam </p><p>          Britain will leave Europe. And then the negotiations will continue.          </p><p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson, fresh off an election victory, has vowed to 'get Brexit done.' Brexit will probably not be 'done' in 2020, but it will \" finally \" get started.</p><p>In January, 3 1/2 years after voting narrowly in favor of Brexit, Britain will officially split from the European Union. Expect a big party and fireworks, but don't expect a big rupture in relations between London and Brussels. The status quo will largely continue as the country enters an 11-month transition period, during which Britain will attempt to negotiate a trade deal with the E.U., its largest trading partner, as well as come to agreements on issues including security and law enforcement. Analysts think this is a crazy tight timetable, especially if Johnson wants to diverge substantially from E.U. rules. If a deal isn't completed by the end of the year, it's possible Johnson could break his pledge and seek to extend the transition period. Alternatively, Britain could crash out of the E.U. without a trade pact, reviving anxieties about an abrupt, chaotic and economically damaging 'no-deal' Brexit.                      </p><p>One reason it's tricky to predict how Johnson will tack in the upcoming negotiations \" Does Britain stay closely aligned with the E.U.? Or does it tilt toward less regulation, in the spirit of Margaret Thatcher? \" is that the prime minister is hard to pin down politically.</p><p>But he could be tempted to keep Britain more in lockstep with the E.U., not least because his whopping majority means he won't be beholden to Euroskeptics in his party anymore. Plus, closer alignment could help with his political problems in Scotland and Northern Ireland: As the reality of Brexit sinks in, nationalist movements could gain momentum outside England, and a closer relationship with the E.U. could help head off those threats.</p><p>                @karlaadam             </p><p>         Food by Laura Reiley </p><p>          You will soon taste meat grown in a lab, not on a farm          </p><p>Plant-based meat was so 2019. Big Beef st(e)aked out territory, demanding legislation that put this interloper on the defensive, mostly in anticipation of what will surely be the food world's biggest game changer in the year to come: Cell-cultured meat, poultry and seafood products derived from muscle tissue grown in a lab with cells harvested from a living animal.                      </p><p>It is unclear which U.S. company will be first to market \" chicken and duck from Memphis Meats in Berkeley, Calif., with investors such as Bill Gates, Richard Branson and Tyson Foods; Wagyu beef or chicken nuggets from Just (formerly Hampton Creek), whose investors include Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff, Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund; or bluefin tuna from Finless Foods \" but Barclays analysts say 'alt meat' could in the next decade capture 10 percent of the $1.4 trillion global meat industry.</p><p>Much of it hinges on rates of adoption. The numbers of vegans and vegetarians aren't growing much. These new products are geared toward omnivores and 'flexitarians,' but as with genetically modified organisms more than a decade ago, some consumers distrust food that has been tinkered with in a laboratory.</p><p>As it happens, that will also be an issue with another trend this coming year: grocery store foods that are gene-edited with CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Romaine and white potatoes that don't brown or bruise, and a gene-edited farmed tilapia that grows quickly, are among the foods improved via tiny DNA snips, essentially accelerating the selection of desirable traits that Gregor Mendel achieved via crossbreeding his peas. Whether consumers will embrace these new foods is unknown. For now, the Food and Drug Administration has proposed overseeing gene-edited animals as drugs, something the meat industry thinks will disadvantage American producers.</p><p>                @lreiley             </p><p>Tech by Tony Romm </p><p>          Washington will try to lock down Silicon Valley          </p><p>Very few things unite President Trump and the Democrats vying to take his place in the White House, but both are readying for battle against Big Tech.</p><p>Amazon, Facebook, Google and their Silicon Valley peers could face the first major consequences in the coming year from investigations by state and federal regulators into whether they undermine privacy, mishandle sensitive online content, damage elections or quash competition.                      </p><p>Amazon is in the crosshairs for the tactics it's used to dominate e-commerce, Facebook for the way it gobbles up users' data (and its corporate rivals) and Google for its dominance of the online ad business. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Attorney General William P. Barr has said the Justice Department plans to wrap up its wide-ranging look at search, social media and online shopping in 2020. That could result in calls for new regulations and potentially punishments \" the most extreme being an attempt to break up one or more companies.</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee spent 2019 demanding internal documents from Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google. In 2020, it's expected to issue a report on whether the industry has, in effect, subverted federal antitrust protections. And if Trump loses the White House, the pressure will mount: Democratic contenders, especially Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), have promised to unwind some of the mergers that helped the giants become so big in the first place, such as Facebook's purchases of the photo-sharing app Instagram and the messaging platform WhatsApp.</p><p>Internet companies spent $55 million over the first nine months of this year to lobby Washington, and they'll throw more political weight around as the threat grows. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg hinted about a fierce counteroffensive in a talk with employees last summer. 'At the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight,' he said. That fight is about to intensify.</p><p>                @tonyromm             </p><p>Russia by Will Englund</p><p>          Putin will press his advantage in the Middle East          </p><p>If Russian President Vladimir Putin suspects that President Trump has been irretrievably weakened or distracted \" and especially if he thinks Trump will be replaced by a more mainstream alternative \" expect him to redouble his efforts to secure a deeper Russian role in the Middle East while he still has a chance.</p><p>Russia has been on a roll in the region, with a winning military intervention in Syria; a strengthening of diplomatic and commercial ties with Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Israel; a mercenary involvement in Libya; and a toe in the waters of the western Mediterranean through joint naval exercises with Algeria. But Moscow's gains have come through craft, stealth and a large measure of luck, rather than through major-power prowess, and the challenge will be to sustain and build on those achievements.                      </p><p>Potential pitfalls abound. Putin has forged a generally useful working relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but he may have to start fresh in a post-Netanyahu era, depending on Israel's third round of elections in March. Turkey and Saudi Arabia have been receptive to Russian dealmaking, but neither is a client state of Moscow by any measure. And the real key to Russia's Middle Eastern success almost certainly depends on its longtime ally Iran, now shaken by violent protests.</p><p>In Syria, the Russian military effort has come with little cost and less pain. The real fighting on the ground on behalf of the government of Bashar al-Assad has been carried out by Iran and its Hezbollah allies. But anti-Hezbollah unrest in Lebanon, anti-Iran unrest in Iraq and upheaval on the streets of Iran itself could significantly alter the calculation.</p><p>If Iran stumbles, would Putin be forced to bail out Assad, at the risk of getting ensnared in Syria and sparking disquiet at home? Could he continue to avoid a confrontation with Turkey? Would the Saudis be as friendly with Moscow if they thought Iran was distracted by its own troubles? Will the mood shift unpredictably in Washington?</p><p>In 2019, Russia demonstrated its agility in the Middle East. The real test may still lie ahead.</p><p>                @willenglund                                   </p><p>            Sports by Barry Svrluga         </p><p>          It's finally safe to believe here in the District of Champions          </p><p>Whatever awaits the rest of the country, not to mention 'official Washington,' in 2020, our little sports town occupies a fundamentally different space than it did just 20 months ago. Then, the default setting was dread. The expectation was not just for a loss, but a loss that would come in the most excruciating manner imaginable. How will I be kicked in the stomach today?                      </p><p>Now? This is new territory, with pain replaced by possibility. Think about how the following sentences would have sounded in, say, December 2017: 'The Capitals are good. Really good. They might be the best team in hockey. They could definitely win the Stanley Cup.' 'The Nationals should be good. Really good. One more offseason move, and they could be favored for a division championship. If things break right, maybe they could win the World Series.'</p><p>Two years ago, that would have seemed outlandish and preposterous. Now, it sounds reasonable. Because it actually happened.</p><p>While basketball's Wizards might not be where hockey's Capitals and baseball's Nationals are at the moment \" expecting to contend \" the environment is such that their rebuilding project seems less laborious and more fun. A slow simmer of anger about another losing season is replaced by the joy of finding hope for the future. Plus, the Mystics won the WNBA title in 2019. We know winning basketball here!</p><p>It must be noted that the football team exists in a different reality, separate from the rest. It's as if the expectations for Washington sports have been turned around \" with the football team left behind. What awaits that outfit in 2020 \" a new coach, for sure, and perhaps even new leadership above him \" will be monitored closely. But the fans who have fled the football team have other places to land.</p><p>There's no way to tell what will happen with Washington sports in the year ahead. What we know, though, is that the reality has finally met the expectations, and that completely alters what we believe is possible.</p><p>             @barrysvrluga          </p><p>          The Economy by Heather Long                     A fragile boom keeps going and going          </p><p>Although risks remain, the U.S. economy appears unlikely to fall into a recession in 2020. Another year of decent  growth will probably make it easier for even more Americans to find jobs \" and boost President Trump's chances of reelection. And the trade wars that dominated economic discussion in 2019 seem to be over, at least for now.                      </p><p>Growth is expected to be 1.8 percent next year, according to a closely watched survey of economists. That's far from the boom that Trump promised and slower than this year's pace of about 2.2 percent and last year's rate of 2.9 percent \" but the president and the Federal Reserve may have it in their power to nudge the figure upward.</p><p>Trump just reached trade agreements with China, Canada and Mexico. The deals are more modest than what he vowed he could achieve, but they signal that he is hitting pause on his trade battles, a welcome relief for Wall Street investors and many business leaders. Although consumers continue to spend at a healthy clip, companies had dramatically scaled back purchases this year because of the trade uncertainty. If Trump keeps the peace on trade, business spending could resume.                      </p><p>Economists and investors also expect the Fed to lower rates at least once more in 2020, providing another boost. Three rate cuts by the Fed in 2019 were a major reason the stock market hit record highs and recession fears abated.</p><p>Although unemployment is at a 50-year low, the position of the middle class remains precarious. Jobs that pay middle-income wages are increasingly going away, replaced by positions paying over $100,000 or under $30,000. That socially destabilizing phenomenon will be a focus of the presidential race.</p><p>Economists, meanwhile, are also keeping a vigilant eye on robots \" because firms typically accelerate the automation of jobs done by temporary and low-skilled workers in the months leading up to a significant downturn.</p><p>But the general expectation is that the longest expansion in U.S. history, which began in mid-2009, will last at least one more year.</p><p>             @byHeatherLong          </p><p>                               Hollywood by Elahe Izadi           No one will stay canceled for good          </p><p>We've had a full year of hand-wringing over 'cancel culture,' particularly as it relates to comedians. Shane Gillis, for example, hired and then fired by 'Saturday Night Live' for racist language on podcasts, was denounced on social media by celebrities \" and also defended by famous comedians.</p><p>But 2020 may be the year when we learn that no one is canceled forever.                      </p><p>The controversies will continue, yes. The society-wide reckoning with sexual harassment and assault won't abate. There will be more denounced jokes; comedy, more than most art forms, ages terribly. Norms and tastes rapidly evolve. More performers will come under fire for past or recent statements, jokes, offstage behavior or allegations of sexual misconduct.</p><p>'Getting canceled,' though, means suffering professional and personal consequences, not being permanently silenced.</p><p>Look at Aziz Ansari, who was embroiled in controversy in 2018 after Babe.net published an anonymous accusation of sexual impropriety (Ansari said that the interaction 'by all indications was completely consensual'). He retreated from the limelight for a while, but then he returned to stand-up, doing small shows to work out material before hitting the road to perform in packed theaters. He even addressed the allegation in an acclaimed Netflix special.</p><p>Louis C.K., who admitted to sexual misconduct after the New York Times published allegations from five women, lost his manager, publicist and all of the cultural cachet he had built up in his career. But he had a massive email list pre-scandal, and he can still promote himself to his diehard fans, the ones most likely to have remained as subscribers. C.K. is still performing, and as he announced to his list, he has several club and theater gigs in the United States and abroad in 2020.</p><p>Even Bill Cosby, convicted of assault, has found an audience \" albeit behind bars \" eager to listen to him opine.</p><p>Corporate entities putting together TV shows and movies will remain skittish about backing performers accused of problematic behavior or ones criticized for offensive material. But there will still be audiences willing to watch.</p><p>             @ElaheIzadi          </p><p>                               THE World by Ishaan Tharoor          Protests won't stop. Neither will government crackdowns.          </p><p>The motives of the millions who took to the streets in Santiago, La Paz, Algiers and Basra were as varied as their geography. But the demonstrators were united in what has become an epochal display of global discontent, an explosion of popular unrest that capped a decade of angst and anger. When they weren't clamoring for greater freedoms and democracy, protesters were marching against corruption, inequality and state brutality. In their wake, presidents fled, prime ministers resigned and governments fell.                      </p><p>And the movements that flared in 2019 aren't about to peter out.</p><p>            Across Latin America, a creaking social contract seems on the verge of collapse: In Chile, widely viewed as one of South America's most stable societies, weeks of protests against austerity measures compelled the center-right president to shuffle his cabinet and announce reforms. But protesters remain on the streets, demanding a wholesale remaking of the socioeconomic order. Demonstrators in Ecuador, Colombia, Argentina and Haiti echoed the call for economic justice. An uprising in Bolivia chased out a long-ruling leftist president, while autocrats in Venezuela and Nicaragua cling to power despite popular challenges. More polarization, paralysis and violence may follow.</p><p>That's all the more on view in the Arab world, where a stunning wave of protests unseated leaders in Algeria, Sudan, Lebanon and Iraq. But an entrenched and often corrupt old guard is desperately trying to stay in control. In Iraq, security forces and pro-Iran militias have killed about 500 people and are preparing for a deeper crackdown.                      </p><p>Iran hasn't been spared, either. In November, authorities cut off Internet access and killed potentially hundreds to quash protests that erupted after a rise in fuel prices. As Iran's theocratic regime enters its fifth decade, a tanking economy and widespread public anger over political elites' mismanagement and corruption only add to the sense of a brewing existential crisis.</p><p>In Hong Kong, a sustained pro-democracy movement remains grimly determined, defying the authoritarian leadership in Beijing and its local proxies. China has no intention of acceding to protesters' demands, though, and 2020 could mark a bloody tipping point for Asia's financial capital.</p><p>President Trump, known more for his coziness with autocrats than commitment to democracy struggles abroad, has been conspicuously silent about most of these displays of people power. But only in a few instances \" Hong Kong's American-flag-waving youth come to mind \" are any of these movements explicitly calling for U.S. support. The immediacy of social media still allows us to bear witness and hold repressive governments to account. There will be plenty to watch in the year to come.</p><p>             @ishaantharoor          </p><p>                    The White House by Josh Dawsey          President Trump knows you don't like him. He doesn't care.          </p><p>President Trump has begun admitting what polls have shown for three years: Many, many people hate him. And he's okay with that.</p><p>'You don't like me. You have no choice but to vote for me,' he told Wall Street bankers last month. 'You're ... not nice people at all, but you have to vote for me,' he said to a room of Jewish supporters in December. 'You have no choice ... you're not going to vote for the wealth tax!'                      </p><p>It is a rare admission from a politician. But it's key to a campaign strategy built around an awareness that Trump's favorability \" even before he was impeached by the House \" is near record lows and that he won't stop tweeting, offering bombast and insults, saying things that aren't true, or making polarizing decisions. So Trump's advisers are leaning in.</p><p>'He's no Mr. Nice Guy,' said the narrator in a $1 million-plus ad that ran during the World Series, highlighting some of the president's accomplishments while admitting that voters might not like him. 'But sometimes it takes a Donald Trump to change Washington.'</p><p>The idea is to talk more about his record and less about his personality \" while slashing and burning Democratic opponents. At a briefing with reporters in mid-December, campaign manager Brad Parscale and senior adviser Jared Kushner showed data from 2016 indicating that people who said they disapproved of Trump still voted for him. They said many people don't want to publicly admit that they back Trump, but they ultimately will. Their targets are primarily suburban women and independents.</p><p>Essentially, Trump's bet is: If your paycheck is better, and we can make you hate the other candidate, you will vote for the president, even if you find him detestable.                      </p><p>The campaign expects to send surrogates who are less bombastic, such as Ivanka Trump, into areas where suburban women might be persuaded to vote for him.</p><p>Officials point to statistics that cut in the president's favor. For example, a recent Quinnipiac poll showed that 57 percent of voters nationally say they are better off than before Trump's presidency. He regularly scores high marks on the economy, which has continued to improve.</p><p>That same poll, though, found Trump losing to Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Mike Bloomberg, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. And his approval ratings are  mired below 50 percent.</p><p>But to Trump's team, that's no reason for panic: On Election Day in 2016, 61 percent of the country rated Trump unfavorably. Now he's running for a second term.</p><p>             @jdawsey1          </p><p>          Gaming by Gene Park           The newest celebrities will play video games          </p><p>With $152 billion in revenue expected in 2019, gaming has become the dominant entertainment medium of the past decade. And if gaming is this century's rock-and-roll, its biggest personalities are becoming a new class of rock stars.                      </p><p>These celebrities are much closer to the irreverence of rock and rap icons than any of the Hollywood guard: They're younger, have little interest in social filters and are mostly unimpressed by the lingering sheen of 20th-century stardom. But they're still causing 'utter              destruction' in hotel rooms across the world, like the famous troublemakers who came before them.</p><p>Tyler 'Ninja' Blevins, the most visible such star recently, has been at the forefront, with an unprecedented exclusive contract with Microsoft's Mixer streaming platform. Others have followed suit, signing lucrative (and secretive) contracts. PewDiePie, arguably the most powerful person on the Internet, hit two milestones in 2019: becoming the first YouTuber to accumulate 100 million subscribers and marrying his longtime girlfriend, Marzia, in a royal wedding for the meme generation. And Dr. Disrespect, who brings the pomp and panache of pro wrestling to Twitch, just signed a TV deal, another first for a pro gamer.</p><p>Besides building careers as gamers, they also share brushes with controversy \" which may have been inevitable, given the challenges of communicating to an always-online, always-posting, always-angry audience. Celebrities have had to watch what they say for generations. But gamers grew up with social media, which often rewards the loudest in the room, no matter what.</p><p>All signs point to a messy integration between the populist media darlings of Gen Z and the existing power structure for politically correct pop. Ready or not, this clash of cultures is looming \" and Player One is determined to win the game at any cost.</p><p>             @genepark          </p><p>          The Supreme Court by Robert Barnes                              Impeachment will land squarely on the chief justice          </p><p>Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist added the famous Gilbert-and-Sullivan-inspired gold stripes to his black robe long before he wielded the gavel at President Bill Clinton's Senate impeachment trial in 1999.</p><p>But he did borrow from the operetta 'Iolanthe' in describing his role at the trial: 'I did nothing in particular, and I did it very well,' he told a television interviewer two years later.                      </p><p>Now on deck: Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. The man who made judge-as-umpire his credo during his confirmation hearing would be only the third chief justice to preside at a presidential impeachment trial. It would also be the first trial of any kind where the lawyer turned appellate judge has been in charge.</p><p>Roberts was a law clerk to Rehnquist and shares with his predecessor the goal \" perhaps only aspirational, probably unobtainable \" of convincing the public that he and his fellow justices are impartial to outcomes and immune to partisan influence and bias.</p><p>Although the Supreme Court itself has no formal role in President Trump's impeachment, Trump has, perhaps wishfully, imagined that it might. He tweeted this month: 'Shouldn't even be allowed. Can we go to Supreme Court to stop?' Trump has also asked the court to protect his financial records from prosecutors and members of Congress, separate from impeachment; the justices will review that question in the spring.</p><p>But it is the chief justice, usually just one of nine, who by constitutional design plays the lone judicial role in presidential impeachment.</p><p>Like Rehnquist, Roberts is a student of history and the Constitution. Rehnquist wrote a book on impeachment; those who've studied the Clinton trial say he was reluctant to make broad rulings that could be overruled by a simple majority of senators. He left it to lawmakers to work out details over motions and witnesses. Roberts, who has chided Trump for suggesting that judges' views are more political bias than studied reasoning, will be looking to preserve his own reputation in a process that by design is more political than legal.</p><p>             @scotusreporter          </p><p>                      Politics by Michael SchereR                   The billionaires are coming          </p><p>Call it influence inflation: Back when Bill Clinton was president, $100,000 was enough to get a political donor invited to sleep over in the Lincoln Bedroom. These days, top political benefactors dole out $100 million or more to elect favored candidates. The amount of money spent on presidential campaigns by independent groups rose from almost $129 million in 2008 to nearly $670 million in 2016, according to the Campaign Finance Institute. And essential functions like collecting and analyzing voter data, voter registration drives and spending on political ads are increasingly funded by America's 607 billionaires, outside the direct control of politicians or parties. (One of the richest, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post, and in the 2018 cycle, donated $10.1 million to a super PAC supporting military veterans running for office, as well as $52,400 to five other federal PACs and campaigns, according to public records.)                      </p><p>Next year will set new records, reaffirming the return of a gilded age for political money. What Brookings Institution scholar Darrell West calls the 'wealthification' of American politics is changing the players as well as the game. Two Democratic billionaires, Mike Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, are self-funding presidential campaigns to dethrone the billionaire president, Donald Trump (and to replace his Cabinet, the wealthiest in modern history, including billionaire Education Secretary Betsy DeVos). A co-chair of the Republican National Committee, Thomas Hicks Jr., is the son of one of the country's wealthiest families, as is the party's finance chairman, Todd Ricketts, while Linda McMahon, a former head of the Small Business Administration whose husband is a billionaire, chairs the top pro-Trump super PAC.</p><p>Polls have shown for years that strong majorities of voters think there is too much money in politics. But that hasn't changed the bottom line: The exceedingly wealthy increasingly fund the political world. You just vote in it.</p><p>             @michaelscherer          </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WPCOM-1ec4c178280b11eab2ca2e72667c1741</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WPCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVM-6S61-DYX1-H2J8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">265544</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5056\"/><timeReceived>9:18 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Washington Post All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Washingtonpost.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33547\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 29, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0002JR3</classCode><className>NBC UNIVERSAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS532282 VIDEO TAPE &amp;

The details of all those things, as always, will be what make the year interesting. To get a jump on the future, we asked Washington Post beat reporters and columnists to think about the big stories, themes and questions that we'll look back on  this time next December.

Buckets of it. From the nonstop marketing of Jennifer Aniston in Apple TV Plus's 'The Morning Show' to that ubiquitous Baby Yoda from Disney Plus's 'The Mandalorian,' it seemed like the spigot might never turn off.                      </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And it won't, not anytime soon. This will be a year of new digital programming \" and new services to deliver it.</p><p>Just two weeks into 2020, Comcast will unveil more details about Peacock, its new service with content from across NBC Universal properties, set to launch several months later. The spring will also bring HBO Max, the prestige-branded service with all manner of TV shows and movies from the WarnerMedia empire. Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus, both of which launched in November, will add more content throughout the year, too \" as will Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post).</p><p>Viewers will have an ever-wider choice of fresh programming. Want new seasons of fan favorites 'Search Party' and 'The Boondocks'? They'll be on HBO Max. It's the final episodes of 'BoJack Horseman' you crave? Where else but Netflix. Looking for 'The Falcon and the Winter Soldier' to give you a fix between Marvel movies? Disney Plus has you covered.</p><p>Finding out when new episodes premiere, let alone whether they're worth watching, will be a task far more complicated than your Twitter feed can keep up with.</p><p>All these services know they need to offer some reliable hits to complement the new stuff. That means many popular sitcoms are migrating from Netflix. 'The Office' is headed to Peacock; 'Friends' to HBO Max.</p><p>And it will all be expensive. Turns out spending sacks of cash on new shows and movies \" Netflix alone is expected to shell out in excess of $15 billion in 2020 \" isn't easy without ad revenue. Services have to charge, whether that's the $5 a month for Apple TV Plus or the $15 for HBO Max. For consumers, that means piling on to a monthly entertainment bill or making tough choices about what to forgo.</p><p>But don't get too despondent. If some of the recent sitcoms you seek are too unwieldy or costly to find on streaming services, there's a suddenly appealing option: traditional television. Many shows, after all, will continue to air in syndication. </p><p>@ZeitchikWaPo</p><p>         Brexit by Karla Adam </p><h>Britain will leave Europe. And then the negotiations will continue.</h><p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson, fresh off an election victory, has vowed to 'get Brexit done.' Brexit will probably not be 'done' in 2020, but it will \" finally \" get started.</p><p>In January, 3 1/2 years after voting narrowly in favor of Brexit, Britain will officially split from the European Union. Expect a big party and fireworks, but don't expect a big rupture in relations between London and Brussels. The status quo will largely continue as the country enters an 11-month transition period, during which Britain will attempt to negotiate a trade deal with the E.U., its largest trading partner, as well as come to agreements on issues including security and law enforcement. Analysts think this is a crazy tight timetable, especially if Johnson wants to diverge substantially from E.U. rules. If a deal isn't completed by the end of the year, it's possible Johnson could break his pledge and seek to extend the transition period. Alternatively, Britain could crash out of the E.U. without a trade pact, reviving anxieties about an abrupt, chaotic and economically damaging 'no-deal' Brexit.                      </p><p>One reason it's tricky to predict how Johnson will tack in the upcoming negotiations \" Does Britain stay closely aligned with the E.U.? Or does it tilt toward less regulation, in the spirit of Margaret Thatcher? \" is that the prime minister is hard to pin down politically.</p><p>But he could be tempted to keep Britain more in lockstep with the E.U., not least because his whopping majority means he won't be beholden to Euroskeptics in his party anymore. Plus, closer alignment could help with his political problems in Scotland and Northern Ireland: As the reality of Brexit sinks in, nationalist movements could gain momentum outside England, and a closer relationship with the E.U. could help head off those threats.</p><p>@karlaadam</p><p>         Food by Laura Reiley </p><h>You will soon taste meat grown in a lab, not on a farm</h><p>Plant-based meat was so 2019. Big Beef st(e)aked out territory, demanding legislation that put this interloper on the defensive, mostly in anticipation of what will surely be the food world's biggest game changer in the year to come: Cell-cultured meat, poultry and seafood products derived from muscle tissue grown in a lab with cells harvested from a living animal.                      </p><p>It is unclear which U.S. company will be first to market \" chicken and duck from Memphis Meats in Berkeley, Calif., with investors such as Bill Gates, Richard Branson and Tyson Foods; Wagyu beef or chicken nuggets from Just (formerly Hampton Creek), whose investors include Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff, Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund; or bluefin tuna from Finless Foods \" but Barclays analysts say 'alt meat' could in the next decade capture 10 percent of the $1.4 trillion global meat industry.</p><p>Much of it hinges on rates of adoption. The numbers of vegans and vegetarians aren't growing much. These new products are geared toward omnivores and 'flexitarians,' but as with genetically modified organisms more than a decade ago, some consumers distrust food that has been tinkered with in a laboratory.</p><p>As it happens, that will also be an issue with another trend this coming year: grocery store foods that are gene-edited with CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Romaine and white potatoes that don't brown or bruise, and a gene-edited farmed tilapia that grows quickly, are among the foods improved via tiny DNA snips, essentially accelerating the selection of desirable traits that Gregor Mendel achieved via crossbreeding his peas. Whether consumers will embrace these new foods is unknown. For now, the Food and Drug Administration has proposed overseeing gene-edited animals as drugs, something the meat industry thinks will disadvantage American producers.</p><p>@lreiley</p><p>Tech by Tony Romm </p><h>Washington will try to lock down Silicon Valley</h><p>Very few things unite President Trump and the Democrats vying to take his place in the White House, but both are readying for battle against Big Tech.</p><p>Amazon, Facebook, Google and their Silicon Valley peers could face the first major consequences in the coming year from investigations by state and federal regulators into whether they undermine privacy, mishandle sensitive online content, damage elections or quash competition.                      </p><p>Amazon is in the crosshairs for the tactics it's used to dominate e-commerce, Facebook for the way it gobbles up users' data (and its corporate rivals) and Google for its dominance of the online ad business. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Attorney General William P. Barr has said the Justice Department plans to wrap up its wide-ranging look at search, social media and online shopping in 2020. That could result in calls for new regulations and potentially punishments \" the most extreme being an attempt to break up one or more companies.</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee spent 2019 demanding internal documents from Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google. In 2020, it's expected to issue a report on whether the industry has, in effect, subverted federal antitrust protections. And if Trump loses the White House, the pressure will mount: Democratic contenders, especially Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), have promised to unwind some of the mergers that helped the giants become so big in the first place, such as Facebook's purchases of the photo-sharing app Instagram and the messaging platform WhatsApp.</p><p>Internet companies spent $55 million over the first nine months of this year to lobby Washington, and they'll throw more political weight around as the threat grows. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg hinted about a fierce counteroffensive in a talk with employees last summer. 'At the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight,' he said. That fight is about to intensify.</p><p>@tonyromm</p><p>Russia by Will Englund</p><h>Putin will press his advantage in the Middle East</h><p>If Russian President Vladimir Putin suspects that President Trump has been irretrievably weakened or distracted \" and especially if he thinks Trump will be replaced by a more mainstream alternative \" expect him to redouble his efforts to secure a deeper Russian role in the Middle East while he still has a chance.</p><p>Russia has been on a roll in the region, with a winning military intervention in Syria; a strengthening of diplomatic and commercial ties with Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Israel; a mercenary involvement in Libya; and a toe in the waters of the western Mediterranean through joint naval exercises with Algeria. But Moscow's gains have come through craft, stealth and a large measure of luck, rather than through major-power prowess, and the challenge will be to sustain and build on those achievements.                      </p><p>Potential pitfalls abound. Putin has forged a generally useful working relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but he may have to start fresh in a post-Netanyahu era, depending on Israel's third round of elections in March. Turkey and Saudi Arabia have been receptive to Russian dealmaking, but neither is a client state of Moscow by any measure. And the real key to Russia's Middle Eastern success almost certainly depends on its longtime ally Iran, now shaken by violent protests.</p><p>In Syria, the Russian military effort has come with little cost and less pain. The real fighting on the ground on behalf of the government of Bashar al-Assad has been carried out by Iran and its Hezbollah allies. But anti-Hezbollah unrest in Lebanon, anti-Iran unrest in Iraq and upheaval on the streets of Iran itself could significantly alter the calculation.</p><p>If Iran stumbles, would Putin be forced to bail out Assad, at the risk of getting ensnared in Syria and sparking disquiet at home? Could he continue to avoid a confrontation with Turkey? Would the Saudis be as friendly with Moscow if they thought Iran was distracted by its own troubles? Will the mood shift unpredictably in Washington?</p><p>In 2019, Russia demonstrated its agility in the Middle East.

Then, the default setting was dread. The expectation was not just for a loss, but a loss that would come in the most excruciating manner imaginable. How will I be kicked in the stomach today?                      </p><p>Now? This is new territory, with pain replaced by possibility. Think about how the following sentences would have sounded in, say, December 2017: 'The Capitals are good. Really good. They might be the best team in hockey. They could definitely win the Stanley Cup.' 'The Nationals should be good. Really good. One more offseason move, and they could be favored for a division championship. If things break right, maybe they could win the World Series.'</p><p>Two years ago, that would have seemed outlandish and preposterous. Now, it sounds reasonable. Because it actually happened.</p><p>While basketball's Wizards might not be where hockey's Capitals and baseball's Nationals are at the moment \" expecting to contend \" the environment is such that their rebuilding project seems less laborious and more fun. A slow simmer of anger about another losing season is replaced by the joy of finding hope for the future. Plus, the Mystics won the WNBA title in 2019. We know winning basketball here!</p><p>It must be noted that the football team exists in a different reality, separate from the rest. It's as if the expectations for Washington sports have been turned around \" with the football team left behind. What awaits that outfit in 2020 \" a new coach, for sure, and perhaps even new leadership above him \" will be monitored closely. But the fans who have fled the football team have other places to land.</p><p>There's no way to tell what will happen with Washington sports in the year ahead. What we know, though, is that the reality has finally met the expectations, and that completely alters what we believe is possible.</p><p>@barrysvrluga</p><h>The Economy by Heather Long           </h><h>A fragile boom keeps going and going</h><p>Although risks remain, the U.S. economy appears unlikely to fall into a recession in 2020. Another year of decent  growth will probably make it easier for even more Americans to find jobs \" and boost President Trump's chances of reelection. And the trade wars that dominated economic discussion in 2019 seem to be over, at least for now.                      </p><p>Growth is expected to be 1.8 percent next year, according to a closely watched survey of economists. That's far from the boom that Trump promised and slower than this year's pace of about 2.2 percent and last year's rate of 2.9 percent \" but the president and the Federal Reserve may have it in their power to nudge the figure upward.</p><p>Trump just reached trade agreements with China, Canada and Mexico. The deals are more modest than what he vowed he could achieve, but they signal that he is hitting pause on his trade battles, a welcome relief for Wall Street investors and many business leaders. Although consumers continue to spend at a healthy clip, companies had dramatically scaled back purchases this year because of the trade uncertainty. If Trump keeps the peace on trade, business spending could resume.                      </p><p>Economists and investors also expect the Fed to lower rates at least once more in 2020, providing another boost. Three rate cuts by the Fed in 2019 were a major reason the stock market hit record highs and recession fears abated.</p><p>Although unemployment is at a 50-year low, the position of the middle class remains precarious. Jobs that pay middle-income wages are increasingly going away, replaced by positions paying over $100,000 or under $30,000. That socially destabilizing phenomenon will be a focus of the presidential race.</p><p>Economists, meanwhile, are also keeping a vigilant eye on robots \" because firms typically accelerate the automation of jobs done by temporary and low-skilled workers in the months leading up to a significant downturn.</p><p>But the general expectation is that the longest expansion in U.S. history, which began in mid-2009, will last at least one more year.</p><p>@byHeatherLong</p><h>                     Hollywood by Elahe Izadi </h><h>No one will stay canceled for good</h><p>We've had a full year of hand-wringing over 'cancel culture,' particularly as it relates to comedians. Shane Gillis, for example, hired and then fired by 'Saturday Night Live' for racist language on podcasts, was denounced on social media by celebrities \" and also defended by famous comedians.</p><p>But 2020 may be the year when we learn that no one is canceled forever.                      </p><p>The controversies will continue, yes. The society-wide reckoning with sexual harassment and assault won't abate. There will be more denounced jokes; comedy, more than most art forms, ages terribly. Norms and tastes rapidly evolve. More performers will come under fire for past or recent statements, jokes, offstage behavior or allegations of sexual misconduct.</p><p>'Getting canceled,' though, means suffering professional and personal consequences, not being permanently silenced.</p><p>Look at Aziz Ansari, who was embroiled in controversy in 2018 after Babe.net published an anonymous accusation of sexual impropriety (Ansari said that the interaction 'by all indications was completely consensual'). He retreated from the limelight for a while, but then he returned to stand-up, doing small shows to work out material before hitting the road to perform in packed theaters. He even addressed the allegation in an acclaimed Netflix special.</p><p>Louis C.K., who admitted to sexual misconduct after the New York Times published allegations from five women, lost his manager, publicist and all of the cultural cachet he had built up in his career. But he had a massive email list pre-scandal, and he can still promote himself to his diehard fans, the ones most likely to have remained as subscribers. C.K. is still performing, and as he announced to his list, he has several club and theater gigs in the United States and abroad in 2020.</p><p>Even Bill Cosby, convicted of assault, has found an audience \" albeit behind bars \" eager to listen to him opine.</p><p>Corporate entities putting together TV shows and movies will remain skittish about backing performers accused of problematic behavior or ones criticized for offensive material.

Neither will government crackdowns.</h><p>The motives of the millions who took to the streets in Santiago, La Paz, Algiers and Basra were as varied as their geography. But the demonstrators were united in what has become an epochal display of global discontent, an explosion of popular unrest that capped a decade of angst and anger. When they weren't clamoring for greater freedoms and democracy, protesters were marching against corruption, inequality and state brutality. In their wake, presidents fled, prime ministers resigned and governments fell.                      </p><p>And the movements that flared in 2019 aren't about to peter out.</p><p>            Across Latin America, a creaking social contract seems on the verge of collapse: In Chile, widely viewed as one of South America's most stable societies, weeks of protests against austerity measures compelled the center-right president to shuffle his cabinet and announce reforms. But protesters remain on the streets, demanding a wholesale remaking of the socioeconomic order. Demonstrators in Ecuador, Colombia, Argentina and Haiti echoed the call for economic justice. An uprising in Bolivia chased out a long-ruling leftist president, while autocrats in Venezuela and Nicaragua cling to power despite popular challenges. More polarization, paralysis and violence may follow.</p><p>That's all the more on view in the Arab world, where a stunning wave of protests unseated leaders in Algeria, Sudan, Lebanon and Iraq. But an entrenched and often corrupt old guard is desperately trying to stay in control. In Iraq, security forces and pro-Iran militias have killed about 500 people and are preparing for a deeper crackdown.                      </p><p>Iran hasn't been spared, either. In November, authorities cut off Internet access and killed potentially hundreds to quash protests that erupted after a rise in fuel prices. As Iran's theocratic regime enters its fifth decade, a tanking economy and widespread public anger over political elites' mismanagement and corruption only add to the sense of a brewing existential crisis.</p><p>In Hong Kong, a sustained pro-democracy movement remains grimly determined, defying the authoritarian leadership in Beijing and its local proxies. China has no intention of acceding to protesters' demands, though, and 2020 could mark a bloody tipping point for Asia's financial capital.</p><p>President Trump, known more for his coziness with autocrats than commitment to democracy struggles abroad, has been conspicuously silent about most of these displays of people power. But only in a few instances \" Hong Kong's American-flag-waving youth come to mind \" are any of these movements explicitly calling for U.S. support. The immediacy of social media still allows us to bear witness and hold repressive governments to account.

He doesn't care.</h><p>President Trump has begun admitting what polls have shown for three years: Many, many people hate him. And he's okay with that.</p><p>'You don't like me. You have no choice but to vote for me,' he told Wall Street bankers last month. 'You're \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 not nice people at all, but you have to vote for me,' he said to a room of Jewish supporters in December. 'You have no choice \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 you're not going to vote for the wealth tax!'                      </p><p>It is a rare admission from a politician. But it's key to a campaign strategy built around an awareness that Trump's favorability \" even before he was impeached by the House \" is near record lows and that he won't stop tweeting, offering bombast and insults, saying things that aren't true, or making polarizing decisions. So Trump's advisers are leaning in.</p><p>'He's no Mr. Nice Guy,' said the narrator in a $1 million-plus ad that ran during the World Series, highlighting some of the president's accomplishments while admitting that voters might not like him. 'But sometimes it takes a Donald Trump to change Washington.'</p><p>The idea is to talk more about his record and less about his personality \" while slashing and burning Democratic opponents. At a briefing with reporters in mid-December, campaign manager Brad Parscale and senior adviser Jared Kushner showed data from 2016 indicating that people who said they disapproved of Trump still voted for him. They said many people don't want to publicly admit that they back Trump, but they ultimately will. Their targets are primarily suburban women and independents.</p><p>Essentially, Trump's bet is: If your paycheck is better, and we can make you hate the other candidate, you will vote for the president, even if you find him detestable.                      </p><p>The campaign expects to send surrogates who are less bombastic, such as Ivanka Trump, into areas where suburban women might be persuaded to vote for him.</p><p>Officials point to statistics that cut in the president's favor. For example, a recent Quinnipiac poll showed that 57 percent of voters nationally say they are better off than before Trump's presidency. He regularly scores high marks on the economy, which has continued to improve.</p><p>That same poll, though, found Trump losing to Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Mike Bloomberg, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. And his approval ratings are  mired below 50 percent.</p><p>But to Trump's team, that's no reason for panic: On Election Day in 2016, 61 percent of the country rated Trump unfavorably.

He tweeted this month: 'Shouldn't even be allowed. Can we go to Supreme Court to stop?' Trump has also asked the court to protect his financial records from prosecutors and members of Congress, separate from impeachment; the justices will review that question in the spring.</p><p>But it is the chief justice, usually just one of nine, who by constitutional design plays the lone judicial role in presidential impeachment.</p><p>Like Rehnquist, Roberts is a student of history and the Constitution. Rehnquist wrote a book on impeachment; those who've studied the Clinton trial say he was reluctant to make broad rulings that could be overruled by a simple majority of senators. He left it to lawmakers to work out details over motions and witnesses.

These days, top political benefactors dole out $100 million or more to elect favored candidates. The amount of money spent on presidential campaigns by independent groups rose from almost $129 million in 2008 to nearly $670 million in 2016, according to the Campaign Finance Institute. And essential functions like collecting and analyzing voter data, voter registration drives and spending on political ads are increasingly funded by America's 607 billionaires, outside the direct control of politicians or parties. (One of the richest, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post, and in the 2018 cycle, donated $10.1 million to a super PAC supporting military veterans running for office, as well as $52,400 to five other federal PACs and campaigns, according to public records.)                      </p><p>Next year will set new records, reaffirming the return of a gilded age for political money.

Two Democratic billionaires, Mike Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, are self-funding presidential campaigns to dethrone the billionaire president, Donald Trump (and to replace his Cabinet, the wealthiest in modern history, including billionaire Education Secretary Betsy DeVos). A co-chair of the Republican National Committee, Thomas Hicks Jr., is the son of one of the country's wealthiest families, as is the party's finance chairman, Todd Ricketts, while Linda McMahon, a former head of the Small Business Administration whose husband is a billionaire, chairs the top pro-Trump super PAC.</p><p>Polls have shown for years that strong majorities of voters think there is too much money in politics.

That idea has come up every so often for at least the last six years, but Amazon Web Services CEO Andy Jassy has repeatedly dismissed such a move as unnecessary. The business case for a spinout largely hinges on the notion that some customers are reluctant to sign on with Amazon's cloud, given that they compete with the company in markets like retail. AWS already runs largely independently, and has its own CEO and chief financial officer. </p><p>But a spinout would introduce new logistical and operational headaches as it had to staff up in fields like accounting and hire a new board of directors. That's not to mention that Amazon.com itself is hosted on Amazon Web Services, making the two difficult to separate. Most experts say that the headaches aren't worth the upside, and that despite the rhetoric of antitrust crusaders like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Amazon and CEO Jeff Bezos aren't likely to give into political pressure. NYU Professor Scott Galloway, who correctly predicted that Amazon would buy Whole Foods, takes the stance that a spinout is coming: \"I predict by 2025, the most valuable company in the world will be AWS.\" Amazon is slated to report earnings on Thursday after the bell. Wall Street is expecting the company to post revenues of $68.8 billion on earnings per share of $4.6, which would be a nearly 22 percent increase over the same period of 2018. Click here for more BI Prime stories[1] For years, Amazon has been asked the same question - will the retail giant spin off Amazon Web Services, its market-dominating cloud computing subsidiary, into a separate business? First, the calls came from Wall Street, as many analysts and investors believed the growing cloud computing business would be worth more on its own than it is as a smaller piece of the Amazon empire. Now, as Amazon faces heightened antitrust scrutiny and calls to break up Big Tech, the question has been raised again \u2014 and could be an issue this week, as Amazon reports earnings. The company is slated to report quarterly earnings on Thursday after the bell. Wall Street is expecting Amazon to post earnings per share of $4.60 on revenues of $68.8 billion, which would be a nearly 22 percent increase over the same period of 2018. AWS is typically a big profit driver for Amazon, but analysts at Bank of America say that Amazon Web Services revenue will likely see some kind of slowdown, in a note to clients cited by MarketWatch. Most recently, a writer for The Atlantic who recently profiled Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said last week he believes the forward-looking executive will spin off AWS[2] to preempt the rising tide of antitrust rhetoric coming from Washington, DC, and especially from Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) amid her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. \"Bezos, who is seeing around corners, is going to break up his own company,\" Franklin Foer told CNBC's Squawk Box. \"AWS exists as its own fantastically profitable business. There's no reason that it needs to be connected to Amazon the e-retailer.\" Scott Galloway, the NYU professor who predicted Amazon would buy Whole Foods, in December said he expects Amazon will make AWS a separate business to placate regulators and achieve hundreds of millions of dollars more in market value[3]. AWS is important for Amazon. Research firm Morningstar recently estimated AWS is worth more than $550 billion on its own \u2014 more than half of Amazon's $873 billion market cap, at the time of writing. AWS is also the most profitable part of Amazon's business. At the same time, however, those expecting a spinoff shouldn't hold their breath. While Amazon Web Services is better poised than most other Amazon subsidiaries to stand on its own, both financially and operationally, most experts say that the company may just not have enough incentive to make such a dramatic move. Indeed, AWS CEO Andy Jassy has repeatedly said over the years that he doesn't see any advantages to splitting off from the Amazon mothership. Amazon Web Services declined to comment for this story.Antitrust scrutinyThe antitrust scrutiny of Amazon to date mainly revolves around the company's e-commerce business, where it is both a seller and a marketplace. The big question is whether Amazon unfairly uses data it collects from third-party sellers as a marketplace to gain an advantage as a seller that then competes with those sellers. Spinning off AWS wouldn't directly address that concern, but it may help to relieve concerns about Amazon's size. Senator Warren has promised that, if elected president, she would break up big technology companies including Amazon \u2014 but hasn't specifically singled AWS out as a target. Warren's campaign has not responded to a request about whether any of her plans include AWS. Warren in March revealed a plan which would require Amazon to spin out its private label brand from the rest of the company. She also pledged to appoint regulators to reverse mergers, including Amazon's Whole Foods buy, Facebook's acquisition of Instagram and the sale of Waze to Google. The potential use of AWS data in other parts of Amazon's business is the subject of scrutiny. The House Judiciary committee on Sept. 13 sent Amazon a letter[4] requesting information including on the use of AWS data by non-AWS teams or divisions, and whether Amazon has or plans any policies about how those teams and divisions can use AWS data. Still, Amazon doesn't typically make business decisions based on political pressure, saidMatt McIlwain, managing director at Madrona Venture Group, the Seattle-based venture firm founded by early Amazon investor and longtime board member Tom Alberg. McIlwain has worked closely with AWS over the years and meets regularly with the division's CEO Andy Jassy. \"Jeff has said for many years they are comfortable being misunderstood,\" McIlwain said. \"My sense of the culture is that's not how Amazon makes decisions.\"How a spin-off would workAmazon Web Services already practically runs on its own. It's answerable to Amazon execs like CEO Jeff Bezos and CFO Brian Olsavsky, to be sure \u2014 but AWS has its own CEO, in the form of Jassy, and its own CFO, Sean Boyle. That eliminates some, but not nearly all, of the operational hurdles that would come with creating an independent AWS. This hypothetical company would have to hire its own board of directors, not to mention that it would likely have to staff up in fields like accounting and legal, where it could previously lean on Amazon. It's also unclear how many of Amazon's 650,000 employees (as of the end of 2018) work specifically for AWS, and how much office space the subsidiary takes up on its own. For a ballpark figure, over 45,000 LinkedIn users list AWS as their current employer, though those profiles aren't always accurate. In America, AWS has dedicated offices in Seattle, San Francisco, New York and the Washington, DC area, according to the company's website, but it has workers elsewhere and in other Amazon offices, too. The biggest challenge in such a split could be creating an operating agreement for Amazon to continue using AWS services, Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy said. The two sides of the business are more intertwined than people think because Amazon.com is actually hosted on AWS, he said, and making AWS an Amazon vendor would be tricky. A spin-off is an unlikely event, Hottovy said, but \"incrementally slightly more likely to happen now\" as more people in government call for breaking up Amazon.The business case for a spin-offSpinning off AWS would be difficult, but not unheard of, Galloway - the NYU professor and marketing expert who famously predicted Amazon's Whole Foods acquisition - said. PayPal used to be the main payments provider for eBay and the companies figured out how to make it work when they split in 2015, he said. \"No doubt it would be a complex undertaking, but when the upside is tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, the incentive is present,\" Galloway said. \"I predict by 2025, the most valuable company in the world will be AWS.\" A major business case for such a spinout would be the elimination of perceived conflicts of interest between AWS and its customers, both current and future. A common refrain in the tech industry is that retailers, and anybody else who competes with Amazon, are reticent to sign on with AWS, given that the two are otherwise rivals. Those concerns have proved a boon to competitors: Walmart in 2018, for example, signed a major cloud deal with Microsoft after reportedly telling technology vendors not to use AWS services if they want to partner with Walmart. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at the time of the tie-up said the companies' rivalry with Amazon was \"absolutely core to\" their partnership[5].Time is a flat circleThe idea of spinning off AWS has come up often throughout the years. Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein may have been among the first when, in 2013, he said an AWS spin-off was \"inevitable\"[6] because potential AWS customers might compete with Amazon and not want to use the company's cloud service. Helfstein has a different view now. Back then, he said he felt AWS was more valuable than the market was giving it credit for, but Amazon has since helped solve that by changing the way it reports earnings. He also thought the potential customer conflicts would become too significant, but said, as of now, that doesn't seem to be the case. Given the subsidiary's success, Helfstein said it's hard to say whether things would be any different if AWS spun out years ago, but that doing so would have put pressure on Amazon's balance sheet to find new funding sources for other parts of its business. While AWS has struggled to pick up retailer clients because a lot of clients feel they're giving enough information to Amazon as it is, Hottovy, the Morningstar analyst, said, that dynamic is unlikely to change just because AWS officially splits from the retail side. He expects retailers would still be reluctant to work with AWS, even though a name change would be likely. \"Culturally, it would run against the core principles Amazon has,\" McIlwain, the Seattle-based VC, said. \"They are much more focused on trying to do three things: consistently delivering great products at a good price in a convenient way. It's going to be really hard to make the case they are harming the consumer.\"NOW WATCH: 7 lesser-known benefits of Amazon Prime[7]See Also: Larry Ellison and insiders say that these 5 execs are on

This plan aims to help smaller firms.</p><p>There's a common thread running through these independent engagements. That is the attempt of lawmakers everywhere to find ways to separate positive spin-offs of the evolution of the digital market from developments which throttle potential competitors.To place these efforts in context, it is necessary to consider the peculiarities of the digital economy.</p><p>A report brought out last year by the European Union, 'Competition policy for the digital era', makes an attempt to highlight the unique characteristics of the digital economy. The need to re-visit competition law in many countries stems from these peculiar characteristics.</p><p>The three key characteristics of the digital economy are:</p><p>1. Extreme Returns to Scale: Even in traditional manufacturing an increase in size leads to better returns. As the volume of output increases, many costs get spread out. This lowers the cost incurred to produce an additional unit of output. It's this characteristic that allows firms with large production capacities to be more cost competitive than smaller ones.</p><p>In the digital economy, the returns to scale are extreme when compared to traditional manufacturing. To illustrate, a search engine may have very high initial costs to design and run. But after a point, catering to additional user results in negligible costs.</p><p>2. Network Effects: This characteristic implies that the use of a network or a platform for a user goes up as more people use it. For example, a matchmaking site acquires greater salience to a user as more and more people join up.</p><p>This aspect of the digital economy makes it rather difficult for potential competitors as even if they have a better product, it's of little use to a user unless they are able to attract enough people to it. Network effects can result in an unusual degree of user stickiness to social media platforms.</p><p>3. Data: This is the essential input in Artificial Intelligence. The digital economy is churning out huge amounts of data which can be mined. Therefore, it fairly common to hear people describe data as the new oil.</p><p>The EU report on competition policy concluded that the combined impact of these three characteristics leads to 'economies of scope'.</p><p>This makes regulating the digital economy rather tricky and most certainly calls for an approach which is different from the existing templates.</p><p>The one thing we can be sure about is that we will have a lot more lobbying by tech giants as they seek to steer lawmakers in a direction they find more comfortable.</p><p>The digital economy and its regulation will be in the news frequently over the next couple of years.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIET-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60F5-FFJ1-JB3N-T0KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382885</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"512\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Bruce Hoffman (keynote), Bill Kovacic, Nicolas Petit, and Christine Caffarra also spoke. If we're lucky Bruce will post his remarks on the FTC website; they were very good. </p><p>(NB: Some of these comments were adapted (or lifted outright) from a forthcoming Cato Policy Report cover story co-authored with Gus Hurwitz, so Gus shares some of the credit/blame.)  The urge to treat antitrust as a legal Swiss Army knife capable of correcting all manner of social and economic ills is apparently difficult for some to resist. Conflating size with market power, and market power with political power, many recent calls for regulation of industry \u2014 and the tech industry in particular \u2014 are framed in antitrust terms. Take Senator Elizabeth Warren, for example[2]: [T]oday, in America, competition is dying. Consolidation and concentration are on the rise in sector after sector. Concentration threatens our markets, threatens our economy, and threatens our democracy. And she is not alone[3]. A growing chorus[4] of advocates are now calling for invasive, 'public-utility-style' regulation[5] or even the dissolution[6] of some of the world's most innovative companies essentially because they are 'too big.'  According to critics, these firms impose all manner of alleged harms \u2014 from fake news, to the demise of local retail, to low wages, to the veritable destruction of democracy \u2014 because of their size. What is needed, they say[7], is industrial policy that shackles large companies or effectively mandates smaller firms in order to keep their economic and political power in check. But consider the relationship between firm size and political power and democracy.  Say you're successful in reducing the size of today's largest tech firms and in deterring the creation of new, very-large firms: What effect might we expect this to have on their political power and influence?  For the critics, the effect is obvious[8]: A re-balancing of wealth and thus the reduction of political influence away from Silicon Valley oligarchs and toward the middle class \u2014 the 'rudder that steers American democracy on an even keel.' But consider a few (and this is by no means all) countervailing points: To begin, at the margin, if you limit firm growth as a means of competing with rivals, you make correspondingly more important competition through political influence. Erecting barriers to entry and raising rivals' costs through regulation are time-honored American political traditions[9], and rent-seeking by smaller firms could both be more prevalent, and, paradoxically, ultimately lead to increased concentration.  Next, by imbuing antitrust with an ill-defined set of vague political objectives, you also make antitrust into a sort of 'meta-legislation[10].' As a result, the return on influencing a handful of government appointments with authority over antitrust becomes huge \u2014 increasing the ability and the incentive to do so. And finally, if the underlying basis for antitrust enforcement is extended beyond economic welfare effects, how long can we expect to resist calls to restrain enforcement precisely to further those goals? All of a sudden the effort and ability to get exemptions will be massively increased as the persuasiveness of the claimed justifications for those exemptions, which already encompass non-economic goals[11], will be greatly enhanced. We might even find, again, that we end up with even more concentration because the exceptions could subsume the rules. All of which of course highlights the fundamental, underlying problem: If you make antitrust more political, you'll get less democratic, more politically determined, results \u2014 precisely the opposite of what proponents claim to want.  Then there's democracy, and calls to break up tech in order to save it. Calls to do so are often made[12] with reference to the original intent of the Sherman Act and Louis Brandeis and his 'curse of bigness.' But intentional or not, these are rallying cries for the assertion, not the restraint, of political power. The Sherman Act's origin was ambivalent: although it was intended to proscribe business practices that harmed consumers, it was also intended to allow politically-preferred firms to maintain high prices in the face of competition from politically-disfavored businesses.  The years leading up to the adoption of the Sherman Act in 1890 were characterized by dramatic growth in the efficiency-enhancing, high-tech industries of the day. For many, the purpose of the Sherman Act was to stem this growth: to prevent low prices \u2014 and, yes, large firms \u2014 from 'driving out of business the small dealers and worthy men whose lives have been spent therein,' in the words of Trans-Missouri Freight[13], one of the early Supreme Court decisions applying the Act.  Left to the courts, however, the Sherman Act didn't quite do the trick. By 1911 (in Standard Oil and American Tobacco) \u2014 and reflecting consumers' preferences for low prices over smaller firms \u2014 only 'unreasonable' conduct was actionable under the Act. As one of the prime intellectual engineers behind the Clayton Antitrust Act and the Federal Trade Commission in 1914, Brandeis played a significant role in the (partial) legislative and administrative overriding of the judiciary's excessive support for economic efficiency.  Brandeis was motivated by the belief that firms could become large only by illegitimate means and by deceiving consumers. But Brandeis was no advocate for consumer sovereignty. In fact, consumers, in Brandeis' view, needed to be saved from themselves because they were, at root, 'servile, self-indulgent, indolent, ignorant.' There's a lot that today we (many of us, at least) would find anti-democratic in the underpinnings of progressivism in US history: anti-consumerism; racism; elitism; a belief in centrally planned, technocratic oversight of the economy; promotion of social engineering, including through eugenics; etc. The aim of limiting economic power was manifestly about stemming the threat it posed to powerful people's conception of what political power could do: to mold and shape the country in their image \u2014 what economist Thomas Sowell calls 'the vision of the anointed[14].' That may sound great when it's your vision being implemented, but today's populist antitrust resurgence comes while Trump is in the White House. It's baffling to me that so many would expand and then hand over the means to design the economy and society in their image to antitrust enforcers in the executive branch and presidentially appointed technocrats.  Throughout US history, it is the courts that have often been the bulwark against excessive politicization of the economy, and it was the courts that shepherded the evolution of antitrust away from its politicized roots toward rigorous, economically grounded policy. And it was progressives like Brandeis who worked to take antitrust away from the courts. Now, with efforts like Senator Klobuchar's merger bill[15], the 'New Brandeisians' want to rein in the courts again \u2014 to get them out of the way of efforts to implement their 'big is bad' vision. But the evidence that big is actually bad, least of all on those non-economic dimensions, is thin and contested.  While Zuckerberg is grilled in Congress over perceived, endemic privacy problems, politician after politician and news article after news article rushes to assert that the real problem is Facebook's size. Yet there is no convincing analysis (maybe no analysis of any sort) that connects its size with the problem, or that evaluates whether the asserted problem would actually be cured by breaking up Facebook. Barry Lynn claims[16] that the origins of antitrust are in the checks and balances of the Constitution, extended to economic power. But if that's right, then the consumer welfare standard and the courts are the only things actually restraining the disruption of that order. If there may be gains to be had from tweaking the minutiae of the process of antitrust enforcement and adjudication, by all means we should have a careful, lengthy discussion about those tweaks.  But throwing the whole apparatus under the bus for the sake of an unsubstantiated, neo-Brandeisian conception of what the economy should look like is a terrible idea.

Had the FBI received the records, the killer would have been barred from buying the weapons used in the massacre.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While the Air Force case may appear unique, federal records management failures are behind some of the biggest national headlines in recent years. The largest breach of government systems in the history of the United States in 2015 was quantified specifically by the number of records stolen from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)-21.5 million. Similar failures figured in the scandal of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) selectively auditing conservative groups and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of an unauthorized private email server.</p><p>Rather than being an anomaly, the preventable failures that contributed to the Sutherland Springs, Texas, massacre are a symptom of a vast problem spanning the entire federal government, according to two experts with decades of experience with the electronic records management application standard that undergirds virtually all records management software deployed in agencies across the government.</p><p>A task force at the Pentagon's Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) created the standard, the 5015.2 Electronic Records Management Software Applications Design Criteria, in 1995. Three years later, the National Archives endorsed the standard for use by all government agencies. Over the more than two deYou cades that followed, the government has spent billions of taxpayer dollars on records management applications certified under that standard.</p><p>But the money has largely been wasted, since the applications became unusable at the turn of the century as technological advances enabled a new era of interconnected digital workspaces bursting with records to manage. The 1990s-era applications require each government employee to declare every record manually. As both the amount and the types of records ballooned, the task became unmanageable.</p><p>Daryll Prescott led the DISA task force that drafted the records management application standard from 1993 to 1995. He became aware of the issues in the early 2000s.</p><p>\"People are busy. They don't have time to be dragging and dropping things,\" Prescott said. \"Billions have been spent on records management applications, which are not working and people are not using them. It's a disservice to the citizens of the United States and a disservice to the people of this industry.\"</p><p>Don Lueders, a former federal contractor for IBM and other software companies, spent two decades developing and selling records management applications based on the Department of Defense (DOD) standard. He was often in a position to witness firsthand whether the applications bought by the government were actually put to use.</p><p>And, according to Lueders, they never were, including at the Department of Justice, the Department of State, the Department of Treasury, the IRS, and multiple components of the DOD, such as the White House Communications Agency.</p><p>\"I trained on it. I consulted on it. I made a great deal of money off of that thing,\" Lueders said. \"About seven or eight years ago, I came to the conclusion that I couldn't support it anymore. And I couldn't support it anymore because I knew that not only had I never seen one record in a production environment enter into a DOD-certified repository, I've never even seen any of those applications successfully deployed. So they're empty.\"</p><p>A former senior Pentagon official told The Epoch Times that he had never used a records management application during his decadeslong tenure at the DOD. The official's records management practice consisted entirely of placing files in folders on drives on the government-issued computer, a far cry from the exacting declaration, storage, retention, and destruction processes built into the records management applications the Pentagon mandated each official to use.</p><p>\"People are not rewarded for records management,\" the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said. \"I've never seen a bonus for properly doing records management. You are rewarded for production on the hot topic for management. When I retired and left government service, my records probably didn't get preserved.\"</p><p>Marc Ruskin, a former FBI special agent, likewise confirmed to The Epoch Times that he had never used a dedicated application to manage any of the records he created or received over the course of his two decades at the bureau.</p><p>He recalled a failed attempt to bring on a records management application in 2004 and 2005 during the tenure of FBI Director Robert Mueller. After the software was scrapped, the FBI began working on deploying a new system. Ruskin never used the new software, despite being trained on it, right up until he left the bureau seven years later.</p><p>\"There was a big paperless failure during Mueller's tenure,\" said Ruskin, who is also a contributor to The Epoch Times. \"He was pushing aggressively to digitize everything. The FBI went ahead to transition to a system that was not fully developed, sort of a beta system, not ready for use. No one had the [courage] to tell the director they couldn't meet his deadline.\"</p><p>Heart of Accountability</p><p>Despite its stuffy title, records management cuts to the core of the relationship between the government and the American people, who fund it. The ongoing contract is based on accountability and transparency, neither of which are possible without records. The explosion in records that accompanied the information technology boom has greatly diminished the government's ability to be accountable and transparent.</p><p>In theory, the Pentagon-certified applications were meant to address the issue. Instead, they provide little more than the illusion of records management, as the vast majority of these applications are never implemented.</p><p>\"You don't have a democracy without accountability and transparency,\" Lueders said. \"You don't have accountability and transparency without records management.\"</p><p>Without an effective system to preserve, protect, track, and-when required by law-destroy records, the ensuing chaos hands the power over the government's records to career administrators, who can choose which records see the light of day and which simply disappear.</p><p>\"That's been going on for almost a quarter-century,\" Lueders said. \"And it doesn't matter who's in the White House. I've seen it with my own eyes at these agencies. Information is the most valuable currency in the world now, and they control the information.</p><p>\"So they can do and say whatever they want with absolute impunity. That's a terrifying thought.\"</p><p>Solution Ignored</p><p>After developing the DOD 5015.2 standard, Prescott had largely walked away from the records management industry when he received a call from John Carlin, the archivist of the United States, in 2003. Under one of President George W. Bush's initiatives, the National Archives was seeking to create and implement policies to regulate the maintenance of federal electronic records. Prescott interviewed for the job and began working as a detailee to the National Archives in 2004. He led an interagency effort to create a new standard for records management based on services, which would allow the government to catch up with the rapid advances in technology.</p><p>After 4 1/2 years, a collaborative effort between 19 cabinet-level agencies led by Prescott resulted in the creation of a new standard. It spelled out the requirements for records management services (RMS), which would handle the insurmountable burden of manual tasks imposed on end-users by the DOD-certified applications.</p><p>When the National Archives endorsed the DOD 5015.2 standard in 1998, big tech companies instantly had the business case to develop products to meet the government's criteria since sales would be assured. Prescott knew this would also be the case if the National Archives endorsed the new RMS standard. Expecting an endorsement, two tech companies had approached his team with prototypes based on their services.</p><p>But before a working solution was built, the National Archives walked away from the new standard.</p><p>\"The question remains: Why?\" Prescott said.</p><p>Prescott handed the new standard</p><p>to the Object Management Group (OMG), an international technology standards consortium. The OMG used the standard to create high-level models that could be used to create RMS software for any system.</p><p>After the OMG published the standard in November 2011, Larry Johnson, who is now on the board of directors at the OMG, presented it to the National Archives. Johnson was surprised the agency again didn't endorse the standard.</p><p>\"I was kind of shocked,\" Johnson said.</p><p>At the time, the National Archives was looking for ways to comply with the presidential memorandum on managing government records, issued by President Barack Obama in late 2011. The RMS standard addressed almost all of Obama's requirements. However, the National Archives showed no interest.</p><p>\"I was a little bit taken aback by the glassy-eyed response,\" Johnson said.</p><p>The National Archives didn't respond to a request for comment on why the RMS standard was never endorsed.</p><p>Despite spending billions on records management applications, today the federal government is stuck with unusable software.</p><p>\"The standard is not wrong. The systems are not wrong,\" Prescott said. \"The applications are just not viable for the current environment.\"</p><p>The Whistleblower</p><p>Lueders initially aired his concerns on his industry blog and social media several years ago. He then sounded the alarm at IBM, where he worked on a team selling records management software to the government.</p><p>Seeing that IBM wouldn't budge, Lueders filed a formal whistleblower complaint with the DOD inspector general (IG) in May 2017. The DOD IG relayed the complaint to the DISA IG, which interviewed Lueders a month later. The DISA IG declined to investigate and forwarded the complaint to the Joint Interoperability Test Command as a business issue.</p><p>IBM didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>In July 2017, Lueders submitted another whistleblower complaint to the Intelligence Community (IC) IG, but never heard back. Suspecting that the IC IG wouldn't investigate the complaint, he initiated contact with the office of his congresswoman at the time, Rep. Barbara Comstock (R-Va.), and stayed in touch before Comstock's staff abruptly cut ties. Comstock lost her seat in November 2018. Comstock didn't respond to a request for comment.</p><p>Applications built to meet the Pentagon's standard include crucial functionality for government transparency and accountability. They require every government employee to declare records into a certified system, where the record is secured so it can't be deleted or altered.</p><p>Records that should be destroyed after a certain time are forensically deleted by the application so they can't be recovered. This should have been the case for a significant portion of the 21.5 million records stolen from the OPM beginning in 2015, according to both Lueders and Prescott. If the records were in a DOD-certified records management repository or managed by the RMS standard, the software would have wiped out a significant portion in compliance with federal laws and regulations, long before a cyberattack, reported to have originated in China, breached the OPM systems.</p><p>Records that shouldn't be destroyed or altered are secured and made immutable ifthey are declared in the application. This should have been the case with the emails of Lois Lerner, the IRS official at the center ofthe controversy surrounding the IRS's targeting of conservative groups. Instead, the IRS claimed that the emails, which were under subpoena from Congress, were lost due to a computer crash. The IRS later claimed that the emails for five more officials were missing due to computer crashes. Those emails wouldn't have been lost if Lerner and the other officials used a records management application.</p><p>Unviable Standard</p><p>The government's failure to use the certified applications is rooted in the nature of the DOD standard itself. Prescott developed the standard at the office of the assistant secretary of defense for command, control, communications, and intelligence in the 1990s, in response to the records management failures exposed when the federal government attempted to collect data on troops who suffered from Gulf War syndrome. Prescott worked on the standard from 1993 to 1995. The DOD released the first version in 1997.</p><p>In the 23 years since then, the standard was updated twice, but none of the changes adjusted the standard to the staggering advances in technology made since 1995. The core ofthe problem is that the standard guides the creation of applications that require manual input rather than services, which would handle this work in the background. The vast majority of the electronic records management applications at government agencies sit unused because the work required to manually enter each record into them is unsustainable.</p><p>\"You have the appearance [of records management] and you have the reality,\" Prescott said. \"That is not responsive to our republic.\"</p><p>The DOD standard doesn't include a usability requirement. Legal teams vetted the standard to determine that it would satisfy the records management mandates imposed by Congress and adhere to the regulations of the executive branch. Usability and viability weren't part of the process.</p><p>\"Nobody-including the task force-tested these solutions to see if they would really work in a production environment,\" Lueders said. \"And they don't.\"</p><p>Prescott, during his time on detail to the National Archives, noted in a presentation that records management applications \"must be inserted in uncountable places in the business process\" and have \"never met requirements originally documented in the 1990s.\"</p><p>As an example of the work involved to declare a single record, a government official who sends an email would have to determine, based on records management training, whether the email even constitutes a record. The official would then have to drag the email from his or her outbox and drop itinto the records management application and fill in the metadata, such as the classification level and a date for when the record should be deleted. This should be done for every record, be it an email, text message, social media post, text document, spreadsheet, calendar entry, or any other document so recognized.</p><p>\"You're alwayspressedfortime to do a lot of action. If you're sayingyou can't do that because you're following the records standard, you'd be viewed as crazy,\" said the former senior Defense Department official.</p><p>IBM hired Lueders in 2015 after he became a vocal critic of the failures stemming from the limitations of the applications. Lueders says he agreed to come aboard because IBM claimed to be interested in developing a solution unbound from the DOD's standard. He said that when he discovered that IBM was still selling the software based on the same standard, he complained and was eventually pushed out.</p><p>'The Nation's Recordskeeper'</p><p>Despite endorsing the DOD standard for all federal agencies since 1998, the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), which describes itself as \"the nation's recordskeeper,\" uses a DOD-certified application only for its email records.</p><p>\"NARA recognizes that a one-sizefits-all solution that addresses all of an agency's electronic records management needs is generally not practical,\" a spokesperson for the National Archives told The Epoch Times in an email.</p><p>The National Archives said it manages the rest of its records \"in the system in which they are created, with dispositions being applied in manual or automated methods.\" The agency didn't respond to a request to explain what processes and policies are in place to meet extensive federal electronic records management requirements, including how the records are declared, made immutable, managed through their retention schedule, and, when required, forensically destroyed.</p><p>In 2017, the National Archives issued guidance clarifying that only the DOD is governed by the 5015.2 standard. In 2018, the agency issued its own set of universal electronic records management requirements.</p><p>\"These requirements do not depend on a particular approach or tool, which gives agencies and vendors more flexibility to find records management solutions that meet NARA requirements,\" the spokesperson added.</p><p>Despite the recent changes at the National Archives, DOD-certified applications remain the go-to software most government agencies carry, in part because the standard is the only one specifically listed in the federal regulation governing electronic records management and the only solution that bears a DOD certification.</p><p>Cost to Taxpayers</p><p>The total cost to taxpayers after two decades of deploying the unviable records management software is hard to estimate, due in part to poor federal contract award record management. A non-exhaustive search for DOD-certified products turned up contracts worth tens of millions of dollars. According to Lueders, the tab easily could run into the billions.</p><p>\"If you add up all the contracts that were awarded because the software included a DOD-certified repository and the services provided to support those contracts, you get into the billions pretty quickly,\" Lueders said.</p><p>The records management application industry in the United States was valued at $17 billion to $19 billion in 2016, according to GEP, a procurement and supply chain consulting firm. The General Services Administration recently rebid a contract for Defense Enterprise Office Solutions-a cloud office package that includes a DODcertified component-for $7.6 billion.</p><p>But the true cost ofthe chaos caused by poor record-keeping could be exponentially greater. In 2016, the DOD IG found that the Pentagon had insufficient records to account for $6.5 trillion in expenses.</p><p>'Tragic Consequences'</p><p>The cost of the opportunities lost due to insufficient records, as in the cases of those suffering from Gulf War syndrome, is likewise significant. Beyond the money, records management failures have more tragic consequences. The families of the victims of the 2017 Texas church massacre filed several lawsuits against the government, claiming that the Air Force's records management negligence allowed the killer to purchase the weapons used in the killings. The lawsuits have since been consolidated into a single case. The families cleared a major hurdle last year when federal Judge Xavier Rodriguez allowed some ofthe charges in the case to proceed. The trial starts on Sept. 8.</p><p>In the ruling, Rodriguez noted that the Pentagon has long been aware of its records management failures, specifically when it comes to notifying the FBI about personnel being investigated, prosecuted, and convicted. In 2014, the DOD IG found that the Air Force Security Forces failed to submit fingerprint cards and final disposition reports to the FBI in 60 percent of cases. In 2015, the DOD IG examined the issue across several branches of the military and found that the Air Force failed to submit criminal conviction records to the appropriate computer databases 30 percent of the time.</p><p>The Air Force didn't remedy its records management failures by 2017 when the watchdog found deficiencies in reporting criminal convictions to the FBI in 94 percent of cases. The report stated, \"Any missing fingerprint card and final disposition report can have serious, even tragic consequences, as may have occurred in the recent church shooting in Texas.\"</p><p>None of the IG reports from 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2018 include a single mention ofthe DOD's 5015.2 standard, which formally guides the handling of the electronic records examined in each report. In Kelley's case, Air Force personnel were, in some instances, simply unable to find the documents that would have been preserved ifthey had used a DOD-certified application.</p><p>By the time the Air Force had its third opportunity to send Kelley's records to the FBI on June 8, 2012, the FBI no longer accepted hard-copy fingerprint cards. As a result, the fingerprint cards should have been scanned and declared as electronic records into a DOD-certified application. The Pentagon took two more years to notify its personnel about the FBI's new requirement.</p><p>The Air Force and the Air Force IG declined to answer a question on why a review of compliance with the DOD 5015.2 standard was omitted from the reports.</p><p>The DOD, the Air Force, and the Air Force IG declined to comment, citing the pending litigation by the Sutherland Springs families.</p><p>An attorney for the Holcombe family, which lost nine family members in the massacre, also declined to comment due to the pending litigation.</p><p>IBM, the OPM, the DOJ, the State Department, the Treasury, the Patent and Trade Office, and the White House Communications Agency didn't respond to requests for comment.</p><p>Unlike the compliance failures uncovered in the Air Force IG reports, the records management failures related to the DOD-certified applications are connected to more than the federal government. In IBM's case, Lueders was vocal about the software being unused. He said the company kept on selling it.</p><p>Other tech giants have long been aware their records management software is unviable in current electronic environments, according to Prescott.</p><p>In a first for IBM's DOD 5015.2-certified products, the company announced it would discontinue support for one of its records management products in April.</p><p>You don't have a democracy without accountability and transparency. You don't have accountability and transparency without records management.</p><p>Don Lueders, former government contractor and certified records manager</p><p>Despite spending billions on records management applications, today the federal government is stuck with unusable software.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2366666582</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">1576348ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBB-37R1-DYR7-80P1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3698\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Epoch Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Epoch Times</publicationName><issueNumber>No. 640</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 13, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English UK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DIRC</classCode><className>US AIR FORCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>Department of Defense</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Internal Revenue Service--IRS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Federal Bureau of Investigation--FBI</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Epoch Times</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Texas</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States--US</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Software</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Transparency</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Electronic records</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Task forces</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government archives</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Records management</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Tenure</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Endorsements</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Accountability</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company-number\"><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 928110</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 921130</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 922120</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>NAICS: 511110</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;
