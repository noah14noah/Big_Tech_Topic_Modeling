Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer. Many billions of dollars. P.O. leaders don't have a clue (or do they?)!</p><p>??? Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/981168344924536832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 3, 2018</url></p><p>Meanwhile, the Supreme Court (which is entirely independent of Trump, yet currently dominated by conservative leaning justices) is considering <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/amazoncom-trump-court/trump-adviser-ties-amazon-criticism-to-u-s-supreme-court-case-idUSL1N1RB1OZ\">whether to hear a case</url> that could see state sales taxes imposed upon Amazon and other e-commerce companies.</p><p>Facebook has incurred the wrath of legislators (chief executive Mark Zuckerberg was recently hauled before Congress) after it emerged that data of millions of users had been harvested by Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy that worked for the Trump campaign in 2016.</p><p>The social media behemoth is also being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission, a key competition agency, over this episode.</p><p>Google's YouTube business was last hit year by an advertiser backlash after it failed to deal with hate speech and extremist content. Even Apple has not been immune from the backlash after some of its own investors called on it to do more to stop smartphone addiction.</p><p>As I have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/the-techlash-against-google-facebook-and-amazon-is-finally-upon-us-20170914-gyh8bw.html\">written previously</url>, the tech sector, which not long ago enjoyed broad bipartisan support in its home market, is suddenly looking politically isolated in the US.</p><p>Republicans don't trust it- most people who work in tech are ultra-progressive on social issues; and Democrats have been turned off by the industry's growing stranglehold over vast swathes of the economy, and the questionable practises of some of its participants.</p><p>Despite this changing political climate, Congress is still plagued by paralysis - its doubtful whether it can get anything done. As a result, it may fall to institutions removed from the short term political process, such as the FTC or the Supreme Court, to act.</p><p>In Europe, the climate for big American tech companies is even frostier. Competition laws in Europe are different to America's - they are less narrowly focused on impacts to prices paid by consumers, and unlike the US don't assume that markets ultimately work.</p><p>Google was last year hit with a record ???2.4 billion ($A3.84 billion) fine by European competition regulators for (trivial sounding) breaches of rules relating to online shopping ads. The stakes are much higher now.</p><p>Europe is also being much more aggressive on regulating privacy issues. The EU's GDPR (General Data Production Regulation) regime comes into effect next month. It will affect any industry that collects data on its customers.</p><p>For the the likes of Google and Facebook it will require users to \"opt-in\" to allow their data be used for various purposes. Under a worst case scenario, Goldman estimates that Google's advertising revenue could be hit by 2 per cent, and Facebook's by as much as 7 per cent, due to GDPR.</p><p>Notably, other analysts have argued GDPR could actually benefit the tech giants, as complying with it will prove burdensome for many smaller companies.</p><p>For instance, Credit Suisse has described GDPR as an \"unambiguous positive for operators such as Facebook\", arguing it has a higher likelihood of receiving approval from users than other internet firms who might interact with customers less frequently.</p><p>Anyone with a rudimentary grasp of recent business history will recognise the significance of Wall Street firms increasingly fixating on the question of regulating big tech.</p><p>Goldman, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-great-american-bubble-machine-20100405\">famously described by Rolling Stone</url> a \"great vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity\", was itself the centre of consumer anger, and regulatory scrutiny, only a short while ago.</p><p>It's barely a decade since Wall Street plunged the world's biggest economy (and the world economy) into the worst recession since the Great Depression of the 1920s and 1930s.</p><p>Australia, through a combination of luck and skill, dodged the worst of the that crisis. As a result, our financial institutions didn't really suffer the kind of backlash they are only just beginning to witness now as a result of the scandals exposed by the royal commission.</p><p>America's biggest financial firms, Goldman included, know all too well what a populist backlash, and ensuing regulation, looks and feels like. It's something the country's tech sector will be desperate to avoid.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNBTOL-1520021558</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNBTOL2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S6X-YK71-JBJ7-N16Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437139</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-04-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"917\"/><timeReceived>09:38 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Enjoy ! \u00bb</emphasis>La Bourse am\u00e9ricaine, c'est Donald Trump qui en parle le mieux. Chaque jour ou presque ces derni\u00e8res semaines, le pr\u00e9sident am\u00e9ricain a salu\u00e9 les performances de Wall Street sur Twitter. La Bourse am\u00e9ricaine a de fait vol\u00e9 de record en record en fin d'ann\u00e9e. Le S&amp;P 500 a bondi de plus de 3 % sur un mois, tandis que le Dow Jones et le Nasdaq, les deux autres indicateurs phares des valeurs cot\u00e9es \u00e0 Wall Street, ont enregistr\u00e9 de fortes hausses. Depuis le d\u00e9but de l'ann\u00e9e, les indices phares de la cote ont respectivement grimp\u00e9 de 29,25 % et 22,80 %. L'indice des valeurs technologiques s'est pour sa part appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 de 35,74 % \u00e0 9.006,61 points. Le Nasdaq a franchi la barre symbolique des 9.000 points jeudi soir, pour la premi\u00e8re fois de son histoire.</p><h>Croissance et taux bas</h><p>Ces derni\u00e8res semaines, les march\u00e9s ont surtout salu\u00e9 la perspective d'un accord commercial entre la Chine et les Etats-Unis. Apr\u00e8s dix-huit mois de tensions et d'escalade qui ont frein\u00e9 les \u00e9changes entre les deux g\u00e9ants, P\u00e9kin et Washington se sont accord\u00e9s sur une premi\u00e8re phase de d\u00e9tente. Wall Street a aussi profit\u00e9 ces derniers mois de la r\u00e9sistance de l'\u00e9conomie am\u00e9ricaine. La croissance \u00e9volue encore sur un rythme sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 2 %, et l'emploi continue \u00e0 bien se porter. La baisse des imp\u00f4ts pour les entreprises am\u00e9ricaines en 2018 avait permis de doper les r\u00e9sultats, et l'argent a \u00e9t\u00e9 largement redistribu\u00e9 aux actionnaires, tandis que plusieurs mariages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 c\u00e9l\u00e9br\u00e9s comme le rachat de TD Ameritrade par Charles Schwab ou celui de Tiffany par LVMH.

La baisse des imp\u00f4ts pour les entreprises am\u00e9ricaines en 2018 avait permis de doper les r\u00e9sultats, et l'argent a \u00e9t\u00e9 largement redistribu\u00e9 aux actionnaires, tandis que plusieurs mariages ont \u00e9t\u00e9 c\u00e9l\u00e9br\u00e9s comme le rachat de TD Ameritrade par Charles Schwab ou celui de Tiffany par LVMH. Les Etats-Unis continuent ainsi \u00e0 faire mieux que la plupart des autres zones \u00e9conomiques, attirant l'\u00e9pargne des fonds et des m\u00e9nages.</p><p>Les cours de Bourse ont aussi \u00e9t\u00e9 soutenus par la politique accommodante de la banque centrale. Depuis fin juillet, la R\u00e9serve f\u00e9d\u00e9rale a r\u00e9duit \u00e0 trois reprises son taux directeur, \u00e0 chaque fois d'un quart de point. De quoi conforter l'activit\u00e9 \u00e9conomique en permettant aux entreprises d'investir ou aux m\u00e9nages d'emprunter, mais de quoi aussi doper les cours de Bourse, les placements alternatifs comme les obligations devenant moins attractifs.</p><p>Certains nouveaux venus ou aspirants \u00e0 la cotation n'ont toutefois pas profit\u00e9 de ces vents porteurs, et l'ann\u00e9e 2019 a \u00e9t\u00e9 marqu\u00e9e par un certain retour au r\u00e9alisme des investisseurs, inquiets de pertes abyssales. Le sp\u00e9cialiste des bureaux partag\u00e9s en a fait l'exp\u00e9rience la plus am\u00e8re, son introduction en Bourse s'\u00e9tantfinalement mu\u00e9e en un sauvetage in extremis par Softbank, son actionnaire de r\u00e9f\u00e9rence. Uber et Lyft ont de leur c\u00f4t\u00e9 connu des d\u00e9buts difficiles.</p><h>Election pr\u00e9sidentielle en ligne de mire</h><p>Pour l'ann\u00e9e 2020, Bank of America pariait d\u00e9but d\u00e9cembre sur un indice S &amp; P 500 \u00e0 3.300 points \u00e0 horizon d'un an, mais il d\u00e9passe d\u00e9j\u00e0 3.200 points. \u00ab L'ann\u00e9e 2020 marque le d\u00e9but de changements importants qui entra\u00eeneront des changements d'actifs, de secteurs et de styles \u00bb, note Savita Subramanian, responsable de la strat\u00e9gie Actions pour le march\u00e9 am\u00e9ricain. \u00ab Nous maintenons une position haussi\u00e8re \u00e0 long terme sur les actions am\u00e9ricaines, tout en restant agile autour de mouvements tactiques \u00bb, note-t-elle, pariant sur quelques grandes tendances comme la pr\u00e9dominance du local sur le global, de la guerre technologique sur la guerre commerciale et du stimulus fiscal sur le soutien mon\u00e9taire.</p><p>L'\u00e9lection pr\u00e9sidentielle le 3 novembre prochain - qui pourrait voir la r\u00e9\u00e9lection de Donald Trump, l'arriv\u00e9e \u00e0 la Maison Blanche d'un d\u00e9mocrate mod\u00e9r\u00e9 ou celle d'un candidat plus radical (Elizabeth Warren ou Bernie Sanders)- pourrait faire bouger les cours. Avec deux secteurs qui seront particuli\u00e8rement scrut\u00e9s : les valeurs de la \u00ab Big Tech \u00bb, en proie \u00e0 de multiples enqu\u00eates des r\u00e9gulateurs et du l\u00e9gislateur, et celles de la sant\u00e9, un secteur cl\u00e9 pour les Am\u00e9ricains.</p><p>Contributor: Bureau de New York</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LECHFR-0602462730732</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LECHFR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVD-2Y91-F066-M4B8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344678</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"651\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Groupe Les Echos tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s</copyright><publicationName>Les Echos.fr</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"42896\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>vendredi 27 d\u00e9cembre 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Publication internet</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>FRENCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.native\"><className>FRAN\u00c7AIS</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0001Y2C</classCode><className>DOW JONES &amp;

Wall Street is easing off its knee-jerk reaction to sell after President Donald Trump tested positive for the coronavirus, and stocks are clawing back much of their sharp losses from earlier in the morning on Friday.      After slumping as much as 1.7% after trading began, the S&amp;P 500 wavered through the day before cutting its loss to 0.5% by the afternoon. Most stocks across the market were higher, including two out of three in the S&amp;P 500.      The paring of losses came as optimism rose that Washington may be able to get past its partisanship to deliver more support for the economy. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told airlines in the afternoon to stop furloughing workers because aid for them is imminent. She said a wider rescue package for the economy, one that investors have long been agitating for, could also perhaps be on the way.      The Dow Jones Industrial Average swung from a loss of 433 points to a gain of as much as 44 points. It was up 2 points, or less than 0.1%, at 27,819, as of 2:08 p.m. Eastern time. Smaller stocks were rallying more than the rest of the market, and the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks was up 0.3%.      RELATED: President Trump and first lady test positive for COVID-19      RELATED: US hiring slows for 3rd month but jobless rate falls to 7.9%      Big technology stocks remained weak, though, and the Nasdaq composite was down 1.6%. It's a sharp departure from much of the summer, when Big Tech stocks carried the market higher, though their remarkable ascent left critics calling them too expensive.      Earlier Friday morning, markets appeared set for much sharper declines. Stock futures and Treasury yields tumbled after Trump tweeted overnight that he and First Lady Melania Trump had tested positive for COVID-19.      Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!  \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2020     Analysts said some of the market\u2019s movements could be explained by investors building up expectations for a Joe Biden victory of the White House, with Election Day a little more than a month away. That could mean higher tax rates and tighter regulations on companies, which would limit profits and hurt stock prices, but it could also raise the odds of more stimulus for the economy.      \u201cTo say this potentially could be a big deal is an understatement,\u201d Rabobank said in a commentary. \u201cAnyway, everything now takes a backseat to the latest incredible twist in this US election campaign.\u201d      Trump\u2019s positive COVID-19 test also highlights the continued spread of the pandemic. The White House physician said the president is expected to continue carrying out his duties \u201cwithout disruption\u201d while recovering.      But the potential for a further ramp up in infections as the weather turns colder is raising worries that governments may put some more restrictions on businesses.      RELATED: READ: Statement from Trump's doctor on president's COVID-19 diagnosis      Also stirring up the market\u2019s movements Friday was the latest report on U.S. jobs growth, which is usually the headline economic data of each month. Employers  added fewer jobs last month than economists expected, the third straight month of slowing hiring.      The slowdown is yet another sign that the recovery is trailing off, said Mike Zigmont, director of trading and research at Harvest Volatility Management. The numbers don't inspire bullishness, but they could be a brighter signal for more help from Congress.      \u201cIf the conclusion is that the economic data disappoints, Wall Street may say that\u2019s added incentive for the next stimulus deal to eventually go through and more quickly,\u201d he said.      Other reports on the economy were more mixed. Consumer sentiment was stronger for September than economists expected, which is key because their spending drives the bulk of the economy. Orders for machinery and other long-lasting goods also strengthened by more than expected in August, but growth in factory orders fell short of forecasts.      All the uncertainty is making an already shaky market even more so. Stocks have swung through turbulent trading recently amid a raft of open questions for investors: Who will win the election, and what will it mean for the economy? Will the relationship between the world\u2019s two largest economies, the United States and China, keep worsening? Did stocks get too expensive after their 60% surge to record heights through the summer, Big Tech in particular?      In recent days, the dominant question has been whether Washington will be able to get past its partisanship to deliver more aid to the economy.      Extra benefits for laid-off workers and other support for the economy that Congress approved in March has expired, and investors have been clamoring for more assistance. Layoffs have remained stubbornly high across the country, and parts of the economy have slowed with the support from Congress gone.      The House of Representatives passed a Democratic  $2.2 trillion package Thursday night, but it has little chance of getting through the Republican Senate. Talks between Democrats and Republicans on a compromise are continuing, but skepticism is high.      Airlines have announced the furloughs of tens of thousands of workers, saying they need more support from Washington as demand for travel has vanished. After Pelosi said in the afternoon that some kind of aid was imminent, their shares shook off earlier losses to climb. American Airlines was up 2.1%, Delta Air Lines rose 1.7% and United Airlines climbed 1.6%.      The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.69% from 0.68% late Thursday, after pulling back from an earlier loss.      In Europe, stocks also trimmed their losses as the day progressed. Germany\u2019s DAX lost 0.3%, and France\u2019s CAC 40 rose less than 0.1%. The FTSE 100 in London edged up 0.4%.      Trading in Asia was thin, with markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong closed. The Nikkei 225 index shed strong early gains to lose 0.7% after the Tokyo Stock Exchange resumed trading following an all-day outage due to a technical failure.      Reports that the Japanese government is preparing new stimulus measures to help the economy recover from a prolonged downturn worsened by the coronavirus pandemic provided only a temporary lift. Prices fell further after Trump\u2019s announcement.

Wall Street is easing off its knee-jerk reaction to sell after President Donald Trump tested positive for the coronavirus, and stocks are clawing back much of their sharp losses from earlier in the morning on Friday.      After slumping as much as 1.7% after trading began, the S&amp;P 500 wavered through the day before cutting its loss to 0.5% by the afternoon. Most stocks across the market were higher, including two out of three in the S&amp;P 500.      The paring of losses came as optimism rose that Washington may be able to get past its partisanship to deliver more support for the economy. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told airlines in the afternoon to stop furloughing workers because aid for them is imminent. She said a wider rescue package for the economy, one that investors have long been agitating for, could also perhaps be on the way.

Stock futures and Treasury yields tumbled after Trump tweeted overnight that he and First Lady Melania Trump had tested positive for COVID-19.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2020     Analysts said some of the market\u2019s movements could be explained by investors building up expectations for a Joe Biden victory of the White House, with Election Day a little more than a month away. That could mean higher tax rates and tighter regulations on companies, which would limit profits and hurt stock prices, but it could also raise the odds of more stimulus for the economy.      \u201cTo say this potentially could be a big deal is an understatement,\u201d Rabobank said in a commentary. \u201cAnyway, everything now takes a backseat to the latest incredible twist in this US election campaign.\u201d      Trump\u2019s positive COVID-19 test also highlights the continued spread of the pandemic. The White House physician said the president is expected to continue carrying out his duties \u201cwithout disruption\u201d while recovering.      But the potential for a further ramp up in infections as the weather turns colder is raising worries that governments may put some more restrictions on businesses.

Employers  added fewer jobs last month than economists expected, the third straight month of slowing hiring.      The slowdown is yet another sign that the recovery is trailing off, said Mike Zigmont, director of trading and research at Harvest Volatility Management.

Other reports on the economy were more mixed. Consumer sentiment was stronger for September than economists expected, which is key because their spending drives the bulk of the economy. Orders for machinery and other long-lasting goods also strengthened by more than expected in August, but growth in factory orders fell short of forecasts.      All the uncertainty is making an already shaky market even more so. Stocks have swung through turbulent trading recently amid a raft of open questions for investors: Who will win the election, and what will it mean for the economy? Will the relationship between the world\u2019s two largest economies, the United States and China, keep worsening? Did stocks get too expensive after their 60% surge to record heights through the summer, Big Tech in particular?      In recent days, the dominant question has been whether Washington will be able to get past its partisanship to deliver more aid to the economy.      Extra benefits for laid-off workers and other support for the economy that Congress approved in March has expired, and investors have been clamoring for more assistance. Layoffs have remained stubbornly high across the country, and parts of the economy have slowed with the support from Congress gone.      The House of Representatives passed a Democratic  $2.2 trillion package Thursday night, but it has little chance of getting through the Republican Senate. Talks between Democrats and Republicans on a compromise are continuing, but skepticism is high.      Airlines have announced the furloughs of tens of thousands of workers, saying they need more support from Washington as demand for travel has vanished. After Pelosi said in the afternoon that some kind of aid was imminent, their shares shook off earlier losses to climb. American Airlines was up 2.1%, Delta Air Lines rose 1.7% and United Airlines climbed 1.6%.      The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.69% from 0.68% late Thursday, after pulling back from an earlier loss.      In Europe, stocks also trimmed their losses as the day progressed. Germany\u2019s DAX lost 0.3%, and France\u2019s CAC 40 rose less than 0.1%. The FTSE 100 in London edged up 0.4%.      Trading in Asia was thin, with markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong closed. The Nikkei 225 index shed strong early gains to lose 0.7% after the Tokyo Stock Exchange resumed trading following an all-day outage due to a technical failure.      Reports that the Japanese government is preparing new stimulus measures to help the economy recover from a prolonged downturn worsened by the coronavirus pandemic provided only a temporary lift. Prices fell further after Trump\u2019s announcement.

Did stocks get too expensive after their 60% surge to record heights through the summer, Big Tech in particular?  In recent days, the dominant question has been whether Washington will be able to get past its partisanship to deliver more aid to the economy. Extra benefits for laid-off workers and other support for the economy that Congress approved in March has expired, and investors have been clamoring for more assistance. Layoffs have remained stubbornly high across the country, and parts of the economy have slowed with the support from Congress gone. The House of Representatives passed a Democratic $2.2 trillion package Thursday night, but it has little chance of getting through the Republican Senate. Talks between Democrats and Republicans on a compromise are continuing, but skepticism is high. Airlines have announced the furloughs of tens of thousands of workers, saying they need more support from Washington as demand for travel has vanished. After Pelosi said in the afternoon that some kind of aid was imminent, their shares shook off earlier losses to climb. American Airlines was up 2.1%, Delta Air Lines rose 1.7% and United Airlines climbed 1.6%.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.69% from 0.68% late Thursday, after pulling back from an earlier loss.  In Europe, stocks also trimmed their losses as the day progressed. Germany's DAX lost 0.3%, and France's CAC 40 rose less than 0.1%. The FTSE 100 in London edged up 0.4%.  Trading in Asia was thin, with markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong closed. The Nikkei 225 index shed strong early gains to lose 0.7% after the Tokyo Stock Exchange resumed trading following an all-day outage due to a technical failure.  Reports that the Japanese government is preparing new stimulus measures to help the economy recover from a prolonged downturn worsened by the coronavirus pandemic provided only a temporary lift. Prices fell further after Trump's announcement.  ___ AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.

In 2019, sales of video games were nearly $150 billion worldwide according to the research firm Newzoo. That marked a 7.2% growth from the previous year. And, at the time of the report Newzoo estimated that global video game sales would rise to nearly $160 billion in 2020. But in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, things may be changing. The video game industry is undergoing profound changes. Consumers truly have an a la carte model for gaming. Do they want to use a traditional console? They can. How about their laptop? Check. And they can also use their mobile device. But it's not just the hardware they use. Multiplayer games are now the rage as is the ability to play online versus other competitors. And then there's the whole movement towards esports which is helping to inspire a service like Twitch that allows people to watch other people play video games. As investors, the growth of digital downloads and cloud-based streaming is playing a significant role in the way video game stocks are perceived. And it's a big reason why many video game stocks are among the best investments at the moment. In this special presentation, we'll look at pure-play video game stocks as well as technology companies that are leveraging their strengths to get a share of this growing pie.

After slumping as much as 1.7% after trading began, the S&amp;P 500 wavered through the day before cutting its loss to 0.5% by the afternoon. Most stocks across the market were higher, including two out of three in the S&amp;P 500.    The paring of losses came as optimism rose that Washington may be able to get past its partisanship to deliver more support for the economy. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told airlines in the afternoon to stop furloughing workers because aid for them is imminent. She said a wider rescue package for the economy, one that investors have long been agitating for, could also perhaps be on the way.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average swung from a loss of 433 points to a gain of as much as 44 points. It was up 2 points, or less than 0.1%, at 27,819, as of 2:08 p.m. Eastern time. Smaller stocks were rallying more than the rest of the market, and the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks was up 0.3%.    Big technology stocks remained weak, though, and the Nasdaq composite was down 1.6%. It's a sharp departure from much of the summer, when Big Tech stocks carried the market higher, though their remarkable ascent left critics calling them too expensive.    Earlier Friday morning, markets appeared set for much sharper declines. Stock futures and Treasury yields tumbled after Trump tweeted overnight that he and First Lady Melania Trump had tested positive for COVID-19.    Analysts said some of the market\u2019s movements could be explained by investors building up expectations for a Joe Biden victory of the White House, with Election Day a little more than a month away. That could mean higher tax rates and tighter regulations on companies, which would limit profits and hurt stock prices, but it could also raise the odds of more stimulus for the economy.    \u201cTo say this potentially could be a big deal is an understatement,\u201d Rabobank said in a commentary. \u201cAnyway, everything now takes a backseat to the latest incredible twist in this US election campaign.\u201d    Trump\u2019s positive COVID-19 test also highlights the continued spread of the pandemic. The White House physician said the president is expected to continue carrying out his duties \u201cwithout disruption\u201d while recovering.    But the potential for a further ramp up in infections as the weather turns colder is raising worries that governments may put some more restrictions on businesses.    Also stirring up the market\u2019s movements Friday was the latest report on U.S. jobs growth, which is usually the headline economic data of each month. Employers added fewer jobs last month than economists expected, the third straight month of slowing hiring.    The slowdown is yet another sign that the recovery is trailing off, said Mike Zigmont, director of trading and research at Harvest Volatility Management. The numbers don't inspire bullishness, but they could be a brighter signal for more help from Congress.    \u201cIf the conclusion is that the economic data disappoints, Wall Street may say that\u2019s added incentive for the next stimulus deal to eventually go through and more quickly,\u201d he said.    Other reports on the economy were more mixed. Consumer sentiment was stronger for September than economists expected, which is key because their spending drives the bulk of the economy. Orders for machinery and other long-lasting goods also strengthened by more than expected in August, but growth in factory orders fell short of forecasts.    All the uncertainty is making an already shaky market even more so. Stocks have swung through turbulent trading recently amid a raft of open questions for investors: Who will win the election, and what will it mean for the economy? Will the relationship between the world\u2019s two largest economies, the United States and China, keep worsening? Did stocks get too expensive after their 60% surge to record heights through the summer, Big Tech in particular?

After slumping as much as 1.7% after trading began, the S&amp;P 500 wavered through the day before cutting its loss to 0.5% by the afternoon. Most stocks across the market were higher, including two out of three in the S&amp;P 500.    The paring of losses came as optimism rose that Washington may be able to get past its partisanship to deliver more support for the economy. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told airlines in the afternoon to stop furloughing workers because aid for them is imminent. She said a wider rescue package for the economy, one that investors have long been agitating for, could also perhaps be on the way.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average swung from a loss of 433 points to a gain of as much as 44 points. It was up 2 points, or less than 0.1%, at 27,819, as of 2:08 p.m. Eastern time. Smaller stocks were rallying more than the rest of the market, and the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks was up 0.3%.    Big technology stocks remained weak, though, and the Nasdaq composite was down 1.6%. It's a sharp departure from much of the summer, when Big Tech stocks carried the market higher, though their remarkable ascent left critics calling them too expensive.    Earlier Friday morning, markets appeared set for much sharper declines. Stock futures and Treasury yields tumbled after Trump tweeted overnight that he and First Lady Melania Trump had tested positive for COVID-19.    Analysts said some of the market\u2019s movements could be explained by investors building up expectations for a Joe Biden victory of the White House, with Election Day a little more than a month away. That could mean higher tax rates and tighter regulations on companies, which would limit profits and hurt stock prices, but it could also raise the odds of more stimulus for the economy.    \u201cTo say this potentially could be a big deal is an understatement,\u201d Rabobank said in a commentary. \u201cAnyway, everything now takes a backseat to the latest incredible twist in this US election campaign.\u201d    Trump\u2019s positive COVID-19 test also highlights the continued spread of the pandemic. The White House physician said the president is expected to continue carrying out his duties \u201cwithout disruption\u201d while recovering.    But the potential for a further ramp up in infections as the weather turns colder is raising worries that governments may put some more restrictions on businesses.    Also stirring up the market\u2019s movements Friday was the latest report on U.S. jobs growth, which is usually the headline economic data of each month. Employers added fewer jobs last month than economists expected, the third straight month of slowing hiring.    The slowdown is yet another sign that the recovery is trailing off, said Mike Zigmont, director of trading and research at Harvest Volatility Management. The numbers don't inspire bullishness, but they could be a brighter signal for more help from Congress.    \u201cIf the conclusion is that the economic data disappoints, Wall Street may say that\u2019s added incentive for the next stimulus deal to eventually go through and more quickly,\u201d he said.    Other reports on the economy were more mixed. Consumer sentiment was stronger for September than economists expected, which is key because their spending drives the bulk of the economy. Orders for machinery and other long-lasting goods also strengthened by more than expected in August, but growth in factory orders fell short of forecasts.    All the uncertainty is making an already shaky market even more so. Stocks have swung through turbulent trading recently amid a raft of open questions for investors: Who will win the election, and what will it mean for the economy? Will the relationship between the world\u2019s two largest economies, the United States and China, keep worsening? Did stocks get too expensive after their 60% surge to record heights through the summer, Big Tech in particular?    In recent days, the dominant question has been whether Washington will be able to get past its partisanship to deliver more aid to the economy.    Extra benefits for laid-off workers and other support for the economy that Congress approved in March has expired, and investors have been clamoring for more assistance. Layoffs have remained stubbornly high across the country, and parts of the economy have slowed with the support from Congress gone.    The House of Representatives passed a Democratic $2.2 trillion package Thursday night, but it has little chance of getting through the Republican Senate. Talks between Democrats and Republicans on a compromise are continuing, but skepticism is high.    Airlines have announced the furloughs of tens of thousands of workers, saying they need more support from Washington as demand for travel has vanished. After Pelosi said in the afternoon that some kind of aid was imminent, their shares shook off earlier losses to climb. American Airlines was up 2.1%, Delta Air Lines rose 1.7% and United Airlines climbed 1.6%.    The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.69% from 0.68% late Thursday, after pulling back from an earlier loss.    In Europe, stocks also trimmed their losses as the day progressed. Germany\u2019s DAX lost 0.3%, and France\u2019s CAC 40 rose less than 0.1%. The FTSE 100 in London edged up 0.4%.    Trading in Asia was thin, with markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong closed. The Nikkei 225 index shed strong early gains to lose 0.7% after the Tokyo Stock Exchange resumed trading following an all-day outage due to a technical failure.    Reports that the Japanese government is preparing new stimulus measures to help the economy recover from a prolonged downturn worsened by the coronavirus pandemic provided only a temporary lift. Prices fell further after Trump\u2019s announcement.    ___    AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Stocks are pulling lower Friday, as Wall Street's first reaction to President Donald Trump's testing positive for the coronavirus was to retrench. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Wall Street is easing off its knee-jerk reaction to sell after President Donald Trump tested positive for the coronavirus, and stocks are clawing back much of their sharp losses from earlier in the morning on Friday. </p><p>After slumping as much as 1.7% after trading began, the S&amp;#38;P 500 wavered through the day before cutting its loss to 0.5% by the afternoon. Most stocks across the market were higher, including two out of three in the S&amp;#38;P 500.  The paring of losses came as optimism rose that Washington may be able to get past its partisanship to deliver more support for the economy. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told airlines in the afternoon to stop furloughing workers because aid for them is imminent. She said a wider rescue package for the economy, one that investors have long been agitating for, could also perhaps be on the way.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average swung from a loss of 433 points to a gain of as much as 44 points. It was up 2 points, or less than 0.1%, at 27,819, as of 2:08 p.m. Eastern time. Smaller stocks were rallying more than the rest of the market, and the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks was up 0.3%.  Big technology stocks remained weak, though, and the Nasdaq composite was down 1.6%. It's a sharp departure from much of the summer, when Big Tech stocks carried the market higher, though their remarkable ascent left critics calling them too expensive.  Earlier Friday morning, markets appeared set for much sharper declines. Stock futures and Treasury yields tumbled after Trump tweeted overnight that he and First Lady Melania Trump had tested positive for COVID-19.  Analysts said some of the market's movements could be explained by investors building up expectations for a Joe Biden victory of the White House, with Election Day a little more than a month away. That could mean higher tax rates and tighter regulations on companies, which would limit profits and hurt stock prices, but it could also raise the odds of more stimulus for the economy. (Ad) We're just getting word of this an all new way to trade - before the bell rings on Wall Street - allowing traders to achieve up to 1,139% return You might be wondering, 'how is it possible to trade before the markets open?!' Roger Scott, the fund manager who once took his $20 million fund to over $740 million has teamed up with the legendary pre-market trader Tom Busby - self-made millionaire who looks at two numbers before the markets open And by using them they've been able to score as high as 93.2% accuracy on all their trades. Click here for the top Stock Market Hack.  'To say this potentially could be a big deal is an understatement,' Rabobank said in a commentary. 'Anyway, everything now takes a backseat to the latest incredible twist in this US election campaign.' Trump's positive COVID-19 test also highlights the continued spread of the pandemic. The White House physician said the president is expected to continue carrying out his duties 'without disruption' while recovering.  But the potential for a further ramp up in infections as the weather turns colder is raising worries that governments may put some more restrictions on businesses. Also stirring up the market's movements Friday was the latest report on U.S. jobs growth, which is usually the headline economic data of each month. Employers added fewer jobs last month than economists expected, the third straight month of slowing hiring. The slowdown is yet another sign that the recovery is trailing off, said Mike Zigmont, director of trading and research at Harvest Volatility Management. The numbers don't inspire bullishness, but they could be a brighter signal for more help from Congress. 'If the conclusion is that the economic data disappoints, Wall Street may say that's added incentive for the next stimulus deal to eventually go through and more quickly,' he said. Other reports on the economy were more mixed. Consumer sentiment was stronger for September than economists expected, which is key because their spending drives the bulk of the economy. Orders for machinery and other long-lasting goods also strengthened by more than expected in August, but growth in factory orders fell short of forecasts.  All the uncertainty is making an already shaky market even more so. Stocks have swung through turbulent trading recently amid a raft of open questions for investors: Who will win the election, and what will it mean for the economy? Will the relationship between the world's two largest economies, the United States and China, keep worsening? Did stocks get too expensive after their 60% surge to record heights through the summer, Big Tech in particular?  In recent days, the dominant question has been whether Washington will be able to get past its partisanship to deliver more aid to the economy. Extra benefits for laid-off workers and other support for the economy that Congress approved in March has expired, and investors have been clamoring for more assistance. Layoffs have remained stubbornly high across the country, and parts of the economy have slowed with the support from Congress gone. The House of Representatives passed a Democratic $2.2 trillion package Thursday night, but it has little chance of getting through the Republican Senate. Talks between Democrats and Republicans on a compromise are continuing, but skepticism is high. Airlines have announced the furloughs of tens of thousands of workers, saying they need more support from Washington as demand for travel has vanished. After Pelosi said in the afternoon that some kind of aid was imminent, their shares shook off earlier losses to climb. American Airlines was up 2.1%, Delta Air Lines rose 1.7% and United Airlines climbed 1.6%.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.69% from 0.68% late Thursday, after pulling back from an earlier loss.  In Europe, stocks also trimmed their losses as the day progressed. Germany's DAX lost 0.3%, and France's CAC 40 rose less than 0.1%. The FTSE 100 in London edged up 0.4%.  Trading in Asia was thin, with markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong closed. The Nikkei 225 index shed strong early gains to lose 0.7% after the Tokyo Stock Exchange resumed trading following an all-day outage due to a technical failure.  Reports that the Japanese government is preparing new stimulus measures to help the economy recover from a prolonged downturn worsened by the coronavirus pandemic provided only a temporary lift. Prices fell further after Trump's announcement.  ___ AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed. Companies Mentioned in This Article Compare These Stocks[1] Add These Stocks to My Watchlist[2] 6 Stocks That Will Benefit From a Dovish Federal Reserve[3]The quaint correction that was labeled the 'tech wreck' of 2018 seems like a distant memory to investors. What also seems like a distant memory is any thought of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates. At the end of 2018, the Federal Reserve had raised its benchmark federal funds rate. With the trade dispute with China dragging on, there was increasing pressure on the Fed to lower interest rates. When interest rates are lower, stocks will generally rise as investors have no other option for growth. In July 2019, the doves got their wish. But in a move that now seems to be a 'what did they know move', the Fed dropped rates again in October. The market soared to record highs in January and early February. Since mid-February however, the market has fallen dramatically, and the Fed juiced the market one more time by cutting rates down to levels not seen since the financial crisis. None of us know for sure when the U.S. economy will be opened up. And while stocks are still a good investment, not every stock is a smart investment at this time. But some stocks perform well when interest rates are falling and that's why we've prepared this presentation. These six stocks stand to benefit from both low-interest rates and the unique economic conditions being brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic.

After slumping as much as 1.7% after trading began, the S&amp;P 500 wavered through the day before cutting its loss to 0.5% by the afternoon. Most stocks across the market were higher, including two out of three in the S&amp;P 500.

Smaller stocks were rallying more than the rest of the market, and the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks was up 0.3%.    Big technology stocks remained weak, though, and the Nasdaq composite was down 1.6%. It's a sharp departure from much of the summer, when Big Tech stocks carried the market higher, though their remarkable ascent left critics calling them too expensive.    Earlier Friday morning, markets appeared set for much sharper declines. Stock futures and Treasury yields tumbled after Trump tweeted overnight that he and First Lady Melania Trump had tested positive for COVID-19.    Analysts said some of the market\u2019s movements could be explained by investors building up expectations for a Joe Biden victory of the White House, with Election Day a little more than a month away. That could mean higher tax rates and tighter regulations on companies, which would limit profits and hurt stock prices, but it could also raise the odds of more stimulus for the economy.    \u201cTo say this potentially could be a big deal is an understatement,\u201d Rabobank said in a commentary. \u201cAnyway, everything now takes a backseat to the latest incredible twist in this US election campaign.\u201d    Trump\u2019s positive COVID-19 test also highlights the continued spread of the pandemic.

Talks between Democrats and Republicans on a compromise are continuing, but skepticism is high.    Airlines have announced the furloughs of tens of thousands of workers, saying they need more support from Washington as demand for travel has vanished. After Pelosi said in the afternoon that some kind of aid was imminent, their shares shook off earlier losses to climb. American Airlines was up 2.1%, Delta Air Lines rose 1.7% and United Airlines climbed 1.6%.    The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 0.69% from 0.68% late Thursday, after pulling back from an earlier loss.    In Europe, stocks also trimmed their losses as the day progressed. Germany\u2019s DAX lost 0.3%, and France\u2019s CAC 40 rose less than 0.1%. The FTSE 100 in London edged up 0.4%.    Trading in Asia was thin, with markets in Shanghai and Hong Kong closed. The Nikkei 225 index shed strong early gains to lose 0.7% after the Tokyo Stock Exchange resumed trading following an all-day outage due to a technical failure.    Reports that the Japanese government is preparing new stimulus measures to help the economy recover from a prolonged downturn worsened by the coronavirus pandemic provided only a temporary lift. Prices fell further after Trump\u2019s announcement.    ___    AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Generally sales are seen as having increased, but the question remains just who gained the most ground and the toll of price cuts to lure shoppers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While the fiscal year for most retailers doesn't officially end for another few weeks, the post-holiday read is an important wrap-up for many companies, which also use the occasion to set the tone for the year ahead and layout cuts to the store base.</p><p>Antony Karabus, chief executive officer of HRC Advisory, said many retailers are seeing store sales lag online growth.</p><p>\"That store fleet is going to be less profitable than it was before, which means retailers are going to have to take a harder look at closures of marginal stores because the balance is shifting,\" Karabus said.</p><p>\"The total size of the market available to the traditional brick-and-mortar retailer has declined because Amazon has continued to take billions upon billions [of dollars] out of the market,\" he said. \"The bar is being raised.\"</p><p>And investors are <url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/financial/stock-market-volatility-1202944671/\">ever watchful - and ever fearful</url>.</p><p>Many retailers weathered sharp stock declines recently as the overall market grew more volatile and the Black Friday sales momentum was lost to an early December lull.</p><p>Target Corp., in particular, has something to prove when it updates investors on Thursday.</p><p>Seth Sigman, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said he's looking for signs of stronger market share and margins from the discount retailer, which has spent heavily to reinvent its business for the digital age.</p><p>\"A lot needs to go right this week for this stock to move up,\" Sigman said of the update Thursday. \"Holiday results come at a critical time for the story, as the market weighs broader cyclical risks, as well as debates whether <url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/financial/sears-new-buyer-bankruptcy-deadline-missed-1202942265/\">Target</url>'s position in the marketplace has truly improved, as we believe it has, versus just a rising tide.\"</p><p>Sigman said Target would need to deliver holiday comparable sales gains of at least 5 percent to pass muster, which likely requires stronger market share gains.</p><p>As Target seeks to prove it can break away from the pack, the department store sector has an uneven outlook. Although companies in the space have taken many steps to reinvent, the business model is still on trial on Wall Street and it is not clear exactly how the format fully translates into a new age of retailing.</p><p>Michael Binetti, an analyst at Credit Suisse, said he was maintaining a \"cautious posture\" toward Macy's Inc., Kohl's Corp.Nordstrom Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. Inc.</p><p>The analyst's company-by-company commentary painted a picture of a very mixed department store world. He noted:</p><p>* Macy's has tougher comp comparisons this month than in November and December, \"potentially limiting the ability to drive accelerating comps.\"</p><p>* \"Kohl's may have the most interesting opportunities of the group - Kohl's could finally announce a bigger partnership with <url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/media/trend-2019-watch-regulation-of-facebook-google-amazon-1202942656/\">Amazon</url> in 2019, make a bigger push into cosmetics, and a planned relaunch of the credit/loyalty programs in 2019 could be significant.\"</p><p>* Nordstrom has the analyst \"concerned\" about \"exposure to the high-income consumer given the recent volatility in the stock market.\"</p><p>* J.C. Penney \"continues to work through recent inventory missteps, and a new ceo/cfo team needs to lay out a much clearer direction to help offset the significant structural issues ahead for this moderate department store -\u00a0e.g., how to unwind previous strategic missteps like appliances.\"</p><p>And Binetti isn't expecting the <url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/retail/what-to-watch-retail-1202930587/\">environment for discretionary spending</url> to improve this year, when a strong job market helped fuel spending and buoy optimism.</p><p>\"Bottom line, while we expect the group to report modest same-store sales growth during holiday 2018, we see minimal reason to expect a rotation into department store stocks in the near-term,\" he said.</p><p>Related stories</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/media/trend-2019-watch-regulation-of-facebook-google-amazon-1202942656/\">What to Watch: Regulation of Big Tech</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/media/media-trends-2019-voice-devices-news-1202942252/\">What to Watch: Voice Devices Bringing the News</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://wwd.com/business-news/financial/stock-market-picks-1202941270/\">What to Watch: The Stocks Worth Eyeing</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WOWEDA-1202949878</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WOWEDA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V4T-91W1-DYJW-X4NR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434863</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"693\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Penske Media Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>WWD</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"26352\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 7, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC0002J9K</classCode><className>TARGET CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001PF9</classCode><className>MACY'S INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0001NGX</classCode><className>J C PENNEY CO INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0001Y2Q</classCode><className>KOHL'S CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>CC0001QWI</classCode><className>NORDSTROM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0001X99</classCode><className>CREDIT SUISSE GROUP AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>NAICS452319 ALL OTHER GENERAL MERCHANDISE STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>SIC5331 VARIETY STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS452210 DEPARTMENT STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS448140 FAMILY CLOTHING STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC5311 DEPARTMENT STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC5961 CATALOG &amp;

It's Tuesday, the 21st of July.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, the verdict is in: Apple's latest results are due out this hour.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bowing to the pressure. Toshiba's chief executive quits over a giant accounting scandal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And fiery protests return to Calais, and the CEO of Eurostar tells me it's not hurting his company.</p><p>I'm Maggie Lake. This is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>Good evening. In the coming hour, a crucial report card for the world's most valuable company. Apple has exceeded analysts' expectations for eight quarters in a row, and there are three crucial areas that will determine whether the company can beat forecasts once more.</p><p>First, sales of Apple's moneymaker, the iPhone, ahead of a new model expected later this year, Apple's second-biggest market, China, after months of wild stock swings, and clues about the success of the Apple Watch, now on sale for three months. We will bring you those numbers as soon as they are released, and we will be keeping an eye on Microsoft and Yahoo! also. Both due to report this hour.</p><p>First we go to Tokyo for our other top story tonight, where one of Japan's biggest tech companies is in turmoil. Toshiba's CEO, along with eight board members, have resigned from their post. They took the blame for a massive accounting scandal involving overstated profits of $1.2 billion.</p><p>An independent committee found Toshiba had been fiddling with the figures all the way back to 2008. CNN's Asia-Pacific editor, Andrew Stevens, put the scandal into context from Hong Kong.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDREW STEVENS, CNN ASIA-PACIFIC EDITOR: It is one of Japan's oldest and most established corporations, a household name not only in its home country, but around the world. And now, Toshiba is at the center of a scandal in which executives are accused of systematically lying about the company's profits, and they'd lied, apparently, for the past seven years.</p><p>Three current and previous CEOs have now quit, plus another six senior executives. Billions of dollars have been wiped off the share price, and the reputation of Toshiba has been blasted.</p><p>The scandal first surfaced in May of this year when Toshiba itself announced that it had brought a former Tokyo prosecutor in to investigate irregularities in its earnings statement. Investors took fright. The stock plunged, down 24 percent at its lowest point last week.</p><p>Now, there has been something of a rebound since then, but that's little comfort against the damage to the 140-year-old company's reputation. And also the expose of what investigators say was a corporate culture where underlings were too scared to question their bosses.</p><p>Now, the prosecutors found -- take a look at this -- there existed a corporate culture at Toshiba where it was impossible to go against the boss's will. It also said employees were pressured into postponing loss reports or moving some costs into later years.</p><p>Toshiba inflated the earnings by $1.2 billion over seven years between 2008 and 2014 to hit aggressive targets which had been set by top management. That's according to the investigation.</p><p>Now, the report does not say why they did that. The business conditions for many Japanese companies over that period were certainly tough. The 2008 global financial crisis to begin with, followed in 2011 by the devastating tsunami, which spawned, of course, the Fukushima nuclear crisis. Toshiba built nuclear reactors.</p><p>Toshiba's outgoing CEO apologized to the press conference on Tuesday.</p><p>HISAO TANAKA, OUTGOING PRESIDENT AND CEO, TOSHIBA: We are taking what has happened very seriously, and we would like to apologize from our hearts, too, starting with the shareholders, and to all the stakeholders.</p><p>STEVENS: The prosecutor's report said Toshiba should have been a model for other companies, but coming just two years after the $1.7 billion accounting scandal at another Japanese giant, Olympus, it's a model for all the wrong reasons.</p><p>Andrew Stevens, CNN, Hong Kong.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAKE: Toshiba is not the first major Japanese company to face a scandal over its accounts. In 2012, the former chairman of Olympus was arrested over accounting fraud, along with several other executives. He later admitted he had lied to regulators.</p><p>The problem isn't limited to Japan, either. That same year, HP took a nearly $9 billion writedown on Autonomy and alleged the acquisition had misrepresented its finances. And last year, the Tesco CEO stepped down after the company admitted overstating its profit forecast by $400 million.</p><p>[16:05:02] In Japan, the country's finance minister says investors could lose market trust if better corporate governance isn't put in place. Toshiba's shares are down, as Andrew mentioned, around 20 percent so far this year. On Tuesday, they actually managed to push more than 6 percent higher. Investors, apparently, were glad the report wasn't worse.</p><p>A recent study from Transparency International showed tech companies are among the worst when it comes to handling corporate reports. Ben Elers is the programs director for Transparency International, and he joins me now, live from Berlin. Ben, thank you so much for being with us. What do you make of this Toshiba revelations, and how worried should investors be?</p><p>BEN ELERS, PROGRAMS DIRECTOR, TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL: Well, this is just simply old-fashioned cooking the books, but on a massive scale. In so many scandals that we see, there are attempts to blame rogue employees or a bad apple, but on this case, it was clearly systemic and went right to the top of the company.</p><p>And with eight senior executives having gone, this is huge. And corporate Japan and Japan should be very worried indeed.</p><p>When we undertook our study in 2012 of transparency in corporate reporting, we looked at 124 of the largest publicly-traded companies in the world, five of which came from Japan, not Toshiba. And only one of those, I think it was Toyota, even had a basic public statement, anti-corruption commitment.</p><p>And this really is 101 in fighting corruption, just being clear about this. No Japanese company explicitly prohibited facilitation payments. There was no information whatsoever on reporting of financial information on a country-by-country basis. And Honda actually came 123rd out of 124 companies in terms of their corporate transparency in reporting --</p><p>LAKE: Yes --</p><p>ELERS: -- and basically, only Chinese companies came worse.</p><p>LAKE: But I want to ask you about this issue of this being so pervasive throughout the corporate culture. In that report, as Andrew pointed out, they said that there was this idea that employees felt that they couldn't possibly even push back against their managers' wishes.</p><p>This seems like something that is deeply embedded, or that there is a culture that sort of lends itself to this type of thing if you feel you can't question a boss.</p><p>ELERS: Look, all companies depend on the loyalty of their employees, that's a good thing. But it's not really loyalty to the company when integrity is at stake and you can potentially bring a whole company down. And there's -- what? -- 200,000 employees and their families who are probably not very proud to be working for Toshiba tonight.</p><p>So, this is huge. And this obsession with loyalty and not questioning things, we see the results. It gets companies into massive trouble. And Japan and the company and the stakeholders, shareholders, everyone suffers.</p><p>LAKE: That's right. Ben, where were the regulators? Where are the auditors? These are publicly-traded companies? How was this able to go on for so long before any red flags came up to anyone?</p><p>ELERS: Well, this is the big question, isn't it? It's what is the role of the auditors here? And hopefully there will be a thorough investigation here, and it won't just stop with the resignation of eight senior executives, and that's it.</p><p>But there can't be impunity for this kind of act and this kind of scandal on such a large scale. So hopefully there'll be an investigation, which will really get to the bottom of this. Because it's certainly hurting Japan.</p><p>Investors depend on the numbers. They need to trust the numbers which they're given. And when they can't, ratings agencies will downgrade companies, and the fallout can be massive. Look at Brazil with the scandals around Petrobras, where the stock has just died, bonds are down, and brand Brazil has been severely compromised. And it's going to happen to Japan as well.</p><p>LAKE: All right. Very interesting development in this story, we certainly haven't heard the end of. Ben Elers from Transparency International. Thank you so much, Ben.</p><p>Now, Apple's newest product, the Apple Watch, is far from its biggest money-maker. A top Apple analyst will tell us what he's watching for in the company's results.</p><p>[16:09:43] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAKE: In just a few minutes, Apple is expected to release its report card for the past three months. It will be the first set of results to include the sales of the Apple Watch.</p><p>But the watch is far from the biggest slice of Apple's business. Until 2007, the company was formerly known as Apple Computer. Today, just one-tenth of company's revenue comes from computer sales. The iPad is just behind at 9 percent. Services bring in another 9 percent, that includes revenue from the iTunes store, the apps store, along with licensing and extended warranties.</p><p>The \"other\" category, with 3 percent, includes the iPod, Apple TV, Beats, and Apple accessories. Starting this quarter, \"other\" will also include Apple Watch sales.</p><p>The final and, as you can imagine, the biggest slice of the iPhone. With a new iPhone expected later this year, investors will be watching to see if demand holds up.</p><p>No one's watching closer than Gene Munster. He is one of the industry's best-known Apple analysts. He's managing director at Piper Jaffray, and he joins me now live. Gene, great to see you. So, tell me, what are you expecting? Is Apple going to ride to the rescue? We've seen the market having a little bit of a hard time, and we know how closely everyone watches for Apple.</p><p>GENE MUNSTER, MANAGING DIRECTOR, PIPER JAFFRAY: Well, we'll find out in 15 minutes. My bet is that they will come through. And I think that the unit numbers, the 49 million unit iPhone, if there's one number to focus on, that's a critical number, and I think that they're going to deliver on that, which is going to really speak to the strength of how they're gaining share with the iPhone. And so, I think they're going to come through tonight.</p><p>LAKE: I'm going to ask you about the \"other\" in a second, but it is important to talk about that. Gene, there was a time when you and I were talking, and it was all about Samsung really catching up with Apple, that maybe Apple had lost its cool, and people were not gravitating to those very expensive iPhones. We don't seem to be having that conversation that much anymore.</p><p>MUNSTER: We don't, and the reason is that they're gaining share back at the high end of the smartphone market. The low end is going to other very low-cost providers, but at the high end, the Samsung that we've talked about in the past, Apple is gaining share and growing significantly faster.</p><p>And so, I think what's happened is just this slow evolution of the iPhone, and it's just started to creep up, and now it's starting to impact the overall global market share. Keep in mind, one other quick point is that it's still small. Apple's overall market share globally is about 15 percent of the smartphone market, so there's room for it to grow.</p><p>LAKE: There is. And a lot of people talk about the fact that it's hard when you look at it, because they kind of are an integrated system. You're not talking about all these various makers who are on the Android platform. Is that ecosystem helping? And how much should we pay attention to the importance of Apple Watch as a part of that?</p><p>MUNSTER: Well, the ecosystem's definitely working, and we think of the analogy of they're just slowly turning the screw down on their competitors. And the reason is that the ability for something to work really seamless for people who are non-technical is important, and that's where they're gaining some of their share.</p><p>As far as the watch and the impact, it's going to take time. And some investors are disappointed by the uptake, it's just a few million units, a few percentage of revenue, as you talked about.</p><p>But we think if you fast forward a couple years from now when there's better apps, it's going to be a much bigger story. And that tight network or that tight connection, that ecosystem with their other Apple devices should play into the watch's favor.</p><p>LAKE: Yes. I have to tell you, Gene, I have, when we talk about it with the viewers all the time, everyone asks me about it. And everyone tells me they're thinking about buying one, they're just holding off. So, anecdotally for me, it seems to be right that there's interest. Maybe people just haven't pulled the trigger.</p><p>Gene, what about the stock price though? It's been trading near all- time highs again. What should we expect from this? Is all the good news priced in already, or are people still kind of underestimating the power of Apple?</p><p>[16:15:06] MUNSTER: Well, we talked to investors, and one of the big themes over the last nine months has been this slowdown in their revenue growth, because this last four quarters have been so strong with the new form factors, that creates a tough comparison or a tough comp.</p><p>And so, I think this setup is really good to own the stock, and the reason is that investors have factored in the negative part about these tough comps and the slowing growth, but haven't factored in the positive about them gaining shares. And the other, slow increase in profitability next year.</p><p>And so, the net of this is I think that we have $162 stock price target. The stock's at $132. We think it's a good one to own.</p><p>LAKE: All right, there you go, it's a bullish call. Gene, I know you're going to be very busy in the next couple of hours. We appreciate you catching up with us. Gene Munster for us.</p><p>MUNSTER: Thank you.</p><p>LAKE: Now, Apple stock hit Wall Street 35 years ago in December of 1980, if you can believe it. It didn't truly take off, though, until the iPod and Mac boom in the mid-2000s. Ordinary investors who bought in early and held on are now sitting on a goldmine. Our Samuel Burke met a couple that invested $17,000 in 1998. Today, they say they're millionaires.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They say buy low, but if you were buying Apple stock in 1998, you were buying really low, under $1 a share in today's terms.</p><p>BURKE (on camera): When you first invested in Apple, how much money was your initial investment?</p><p>NING WANG, EARLY APPLE INVESTOR: We stated in 1998, $17,600. That's how we started. We didn't spend much on it. They were cheap.</p><p>BURKE: This was before the iPhone, even before the iPod. That was actually a low point for the Apple company. What made you so excited about Apple?</p><p>TING QIAN, EARLY APPLE INVESTOR: I think it's 1998, 1999, I went to the Mac Award Conference, and I saw Steve Jobs talking. And the whole thing triggered it. It's not just about the product. And they kind of sparked an interest in their business.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over): Ning Wang and his wife, Ting Qian, didn't stop buying Apple stock in 1998. They say they've invested tens of thousands in the company over the years, an investment in a stock that's up over 13,000 percent since they first bought.</p><p>BURKE (on camera): Just recently, you finally hit a million dollars in your total investment. What was that moment like?</p><p>WANG: She's more excited about that we are participating, not the money.</p><p>QIAN: Yes, not the money part.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over): Ning and Ting have sold some of their stock to buy things like a vacation home, but they say they're always held on to most of it.</p><p>BURKE (on camera): When you guys have sold stock, was it because you didn't have confidence in the products or the business?</p><p>WANG: Never. Always discipline. Discipline. The market goes up and down. You can not catch it.</p><p>BURKE: Now, Apple Watch has come out. A lot of analysts have said they don't think Apple Watch sales have been nearly as high as expected. So, is this a time for you to stop and assess and decide whether you want to cash in on some of the stock? What are you guys going to do?</p><p>QIAN: In any new first generation comes out, maybe there's a waiting time.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURKE: Maybe there's room for improvement.</p><p>QIAN: Yes, of course.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over): So, what does the couple think about the stock today?</p><p>QIAN: I think it's time to buy.</p><p>BURKE (on camera): Time to buy?</p><p>QIAN: Yes.</p><p>WANG: More? More?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURKE: That's news to him.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAKE: OK, we see who the lead investor is in that couple. Well now, new into CNN, we want to bring you right up to date, Microsoft and Yahoo! have revealed their results for the quarter.</p><p>Microsoft says it was the Cloud and hardware that drove its record revenues. Yahoo! says its 15 percent year-over-year growth is the best in nearly a decade. That was driven mostly by mobile video and display ads. CNN Money's Paul La Monica is here with us now to break it down, maybe keep it real.</p><p>All right, so is this -- let's start with Microsoft -- good news, or is this spin? Both of them are, of course, saying this is fantastic, but what do you think first blush? Because they are just coming out, these minutes.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN MONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, they're just coming out. The very quick reaction, it looks like Microsoft and Yahoo! stocks are both down on this news. I think -- it was a negative day overall, so I think investors may still be conditioned to look for bad news after IBM.</p><p>Microsoft, we all knew that their hardware business was hopefully going to get a bit of a boost. The Windows 10 side of things, on the software side, you've got a refresh there. Xbox is still a strong performer for them. But mobile, they took that huge writedown from the</p><p>LAKE: Yes.</p><p>LA MONICA: -- Nokia business they acquired, that's something I think investors are still concerned about.</p><p>With Yahoo!, even though they're touting that strong growth on earnings and the success that they're finally having with mobile and display ads, earnings did miss forecasts. Investors seem to be spooked by that. But also, Yahoo!, let's be honest, it's really just, as I like to call it, Alibaba West.</p><p>LAKE: Yes.</p><p>LA MONICA: People are waiting for Marissa Mayer and more details from her about the spin-off of the remaining Alibaba shares, and that's what people want to hear about, not the core results, I think.</p><p>[16:20:01] LAKE: There -- and these are both companies that are in transition, right? They're trying to sort of reinvent themselves from what they were in the past to something new.</p><p>I want to talk about Microsoft for just a moment. That stock has really been lagging. If you want to take a punt on something, Satya Nadella trying to get some of the bad news out with that phone part of the business earlier before the earnings call and try to keep everybody's focus on that Cloud business.</p><p>It looks like if investors aren't thrilled at first, we're going to hear the conference call as well. Is it that the transition's not happening fast enough, or people just don't know if they can replace that cash cow that was Windows?</p><p>LA MONICA: Exactly. Don't get me wrong, Windows still is a cash cow, Office to a certain extent as well. But Nadella definitely focusing on the Cloud. I think that he realized that the Nokia acquisition, that was not his call, that was done under Steve Ballmer.</p><p>So he's trying to get maybe the classic sort of kitchen sink, let's really take this huge writedown, we'll do more layoffs, which is unfortunate, because Microsoft has cut a lot of jobs under Nadella. I think he's hoping that can maybe kick start this transition and get people focused on the more exciting Cloud business yet again.</p><p>To be fair, Nadella -- the stock has done well overall since he took over. Last year, it did extremely well. People were very excited, probably because he just wasn't Steve Ballmer.</p><p>LAKE: Yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LA MONICA: But now, the honeymoon seems to be over, and it's definitely the same case with Marissa Mayer.</p><p>LAKE: I was going to say. And we know that the honeymoon has sort of been ending for her --</p><p>LA MONICA: Been over for a while.</p><p>LAKE: -- as well. Paul, I want to ask you, we saw a pretty big drop in the Dow today. There was a lot of hope pinned on these tech companies, could they kind of revive that momentum. What's going on with the broader market? What's holding the broader market back?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, the broader market today, I mean, I don't want to get too worried about the Dow. I think what happened with the Dow is more the folly of price weighting.</p><p>LAKE: Yes.</p><p>LA MONICA: Because you had IBM and United Technologies, two companies with triple-digit stock prices, their earnings stunk.</p><p>LAKE: Yes.</p><p>LA MONICA: And that's why the Dow went down. Verizon also didn't have great numbers, it's a Dow component. But the big drop in the Dow really was about what happened at IBM and also United Technologies, which despite having \"Technologies\" in its name, isn't really --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LAKE: Yes, that's right.</p><p>LA MONICA: -- a technology company. Jet engines, elevators, and air conditioners.</p><p>LAKE: Yes, and there's some headwinds on that. Energy, also, which I know people are worried about the energy sector, too, so that's a drag. We'll have to see if some of these big tech companies, which are also blue chips --</p><p>LA MONICA: Right.</p><p>LAKE: -- can help swing things.</p><p>LA MONICA: Google had another all-time high.</p><p>LAKE: Right.</p><p>LA MONICA: -- the earnings --</p><p>LAKE: We're waiting for Apple, so we'll see.</p><p>LA MONICA: And Facebook next week, too. That's another all-time high today.</p><p>LAKE: There could be hope. There could be hope. We'll hang onto that. Paul, thanks so much for breaking it down for us --</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you.</p><p>LAKE: -- those early numbers. And again, those conference calls will be happening. We'll keep an eye on them for you.</p><p>Now, after the break, Nigeria stands on the brink of economic crisis. We find out how the country's new president plans to turn that tide.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAKE: Once held up as one of the up and coming mint economies, Nigeria has seen a reversal of its economic fortunes in recent years. The government relies on oil for about 80 percent of its revenue, so low crude prices have weighed heavily on the economy.</p><p>Earlier, CNN's Christiane Amanpour spoke exclusively to Nigeria's new president, Muhammadu Buhari. She asked him how he plans to tackle this brewing economic crisis.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT OF NIGERIA: My people, firstly, I believe, they want the security in their country to be stabilized, so that a normal life, mostly in the southern part of the country, where the militants are still sabotaging oil installations and kidnapping people and demanding ransom.</p><p>[16:25:13] And also into the country, where Boko Haram is still active. This is the main preoccupation of Nigeria now, and the real issue we're looking to solve. Nothing will work until the country is secure.</p><p>CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: What about your campaign promise to root out corruption? If they turned out that some of the guilty ones were members of your own party or your own associates, would you crack down on them, too?</p><p>BUHARI: Yes, I have to. There isn't going to be any party member or any personality that can escape justice.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Mr. President, are you disappointed that President Obama is yet again not going to Nigeria, the biggest and most economically powerful country in Africa?</p><p>BUHARI: I wouldn't say I was disappointed, but how I wished he will change his mind and go to Nigeria.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Did you ask him? Did he say he would?</p><p>BUHARI: Well, I ask him -- I will send a formal invitation.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAKE: With low oil prices causing government revenues to dry up, ordinary citizens are beginning to feel the effects. Civil servants in 23 Nigerian states have gone unpaid for months. CNN's Christian Purefoy looks at how the people of Nigeria are coping with the crisis.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHRISTIAN PUREFOY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A small roadside mechanic outside of Lagos. Most people just drive on by. Inside is a mechanic who knows how to fix oil leaks in broken engines. But the problem is, there's one engine Obinna can't fix: Nigeria's broken oil economy.</p><p>EDWIN OBINNA, MECHANIC: When there's no oil in the vehicle, the engine can't work, because you need oil to protect its moving, very soft, easily to move. When there's no oil it won't work, iron to iron.</p><p>PUREFOY (on camera): Like Nigeria.</p><p>OBINNA: Like Nigeria. Our currency is different than other places because everywhere is very hot.</p><p>PUREFOY (voice-over): Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer, but as the price of oil has crashed, so, too, has Nigeria's economy.</p><p>The naira has fallen to record lows. International investment has stalled, and there are persistent fuel shortages across the country.</p><p>PUREFOY (on camera): Obinna's mechanic store sits beside what is probably one of the most important roads in the whole of Nigeria. It links the mega city and port of Lagos to the rest of the country.</p><p>Now, the federal government had promised to rehabilitate and expand this road. But as you can see from the potholes behind me, work has stalled. And that is simply because there's no money left to finish the job.</p><p>PUREFOY (voice-over): And energy analysts say there is no clear plan to fix the problem.</p><p>DOLAPO ONI, ENERGY ANALYST: There needs to be communication about the economic policy of the government, which is a case of saying this is how we want to drive the economy going forward. This is how we want to open the economy.</p><p>That sort of communication will give investors an idea of, OK, this is what you want to do, and this is how we fit it into your plan. And then we can start to see some forex influence back into Nigeria.</p><p>PUREFOY (on camera): Does that communication exist right now?</p><p>ONI: At the moment, no, it doesn't.</p><p>PUREFOY (voice-over): And now the problems are affecting Obinna's business.</p><p>OBINNA: Today, I'm hungry for my family, we have nothing to eat. For groceries, I can have something to do. I need money, I get it when I work.</p><p>PUREFOY: Obinna manages to start up his engine to get the truck back on the road. He hopes Nigeria's leaders will do the same with the economy soon.</p><p>Christian Purefoy, CNN, Lagos, Nigeria.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAKE: It is the moment Wall Street is waiting for: Apple's highly- anticipated results, due to be released in just a few moments.</p><p>[16:29:12] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAKE: Hello, I'm Maggie Lake. Coming up on the next half hour of \"Quest Means Business,\" the results are in, Apple third-quarter reports are due out any minute.</p><p>And the CEO of Eurostar tells me that a fresh wave of protests is bad news. First though, these are the top world headlines we're following for you this hour.</p><p>Funerals have taken place for the victims of Monday's bombing in Southern Turkey. Turkey's prime minister says one of the suspects has been identified and that a connection to ISIS appears likely. At least 31 people were killed when an explosion tore through a rally in the town of Suruc.</p><p>Three Spanish journalists have gone missing in Syria. The president of the Spanish Federation of Journalists says the three men were last seen nine days ago when they were working in the Aleppo region.</p><p>Two British men are being held by U.K. police on terror charges. Authorities say the pair from the town of Wootton, north of London, intended to join ISIS in Syria. As our Fred Pleitgen tells us, one of the men is also being charged with planning to attack U.S. troops on British soil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: One of the charges against both of them was that they were plotting to go to Syria and to join ISIS there. And then one of the men, Junead Kahn, he apparently was plotting to kill American service members here in Britain, and they did offer some more details as to what they thought this plot entailed.</p><p>And apparently they were talking about a hit-and-run car style attack, or an accident style attack as they called it, where apparently he was planning to run into a U.S. service member and then kill a service member with a knife. Allegedly there was also talk of using a suicide vest as well.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>LAKE: Pope Francis has called on the United Nations to take action on human trafficking. The Pope invited 65 mayors and local politicians from around the world to a conference aimed at fighting modern-day slavery and climate change. The Pope said decisive action was needed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>POPE FRANCIS, ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH, VIA INTERPRETER: The United Nations really needs to take a very strong position on this issue, particularly the trafficking of human beings that are caused by this environmental situation and the exploitation of people.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>LAKE: Donald Trump's presidential run continues to grab headlines. At a speech in South Carolina, the Republican candidate read out the private cell phone number of his fellow candidate Senator Lindsey Graham urging supporters to call.</p><p>Senator Graham later tweeted that he was quote, \"probably getting a new phone.\"</p><p>Major disruptions at the gateway between Britain and mainland Europe. This was the scene in the French port of Calais. Disgruntled ferry workers set tires alight on the busy highway, blocking access to the Channel tunnel terminal more than - for more than - two hours.</p><p>It is just the latest in a series of protests which have plagued Eurotunnel travelers this summer. It seems the disruptions at Calais have done little to derail Eurotunnel's biggest customer Eurostar. The train network operator which links cities like London, Paris and Brussels just reported record passenger traffic -- more than 2.8 million customers between April and June.</p><p>[16:35:03] To help it cope with demand, Eurostar is introducing its first new fleet of trains in two decades. They will enter service at the end of the year.</p><p>Earlier I caught up with the firm's CEO and asked him how much the recent protests were affecting his bottom line.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>NICOLAS PETROVIC, CEO, EUROSTAR: We suffer from the closures of the tunnel in June especially because of protestors on the line and for us it's not very good news. It's several millions of pounds off the bottom line. First of all there's a loss of revenue because not everyone can travel but also we have to compensate passengers, you know, who have to go to hotels and they've missed their train.</p><p>So for us it's really bad news and I really hope the situation will get resolved soon.</p><p>LAKE: If we look beyond the protests, just at the underlying fundamentals, what are you seeing in terms of where we are with the economy and with consumers' willingness to spend?</p><p>PETROVIC: Q2 for us was a record quarter and this is because especially the U.K. economy is now - there's a lot of confidence in the leisure market and the stirring (ph) is strong so people are, you know, they're happy to have city breaks and to spend money.</p><p>The French economy actually is also OK abzsory (ph) because the reports are not that good but we don't see that in our numbers. But really what's interesting is to see the business market both in Paris and London is extremely strong. I mean, we're coming back to the levels of 2007 or 2006, so that's pretty - that's pretty good news for us.</p><p>LAKE: It certainly is. Do you think that that kind of momentum is sustainable?</p><p>PETROVIC: Well, these days it's very difficult because literally each quarter is different and so the summer looks very good at the moment. Obviously it's mostly leisure markets because many, many Americans also coming now to Europe because the euro is weaker than it used to be. So we've got quite a few American tourists onboard which is great.</p><p>Then September/October we'll have to wait and see to and hopefully the business markets will be there to - for the comeback after the summer.</p><p>LAKE: One of the uncertainties for the business market or the headwinds is really the political wrangling we've seen in Europe. There was so much drama surrounding Greece and a lot of people are concerned about what that might mean for Britain as it considers whether it wants to stay part of the European Union.</p><p>How concerned are you about that?</p><p>PETROVIC: The Greek - the Greek debate - didn't affect business at all. We could see, and I speak to a lot of businesses, of course our customers - and they were very relaxed actually about Greece.</p><p>Now the U.K., that's a different story and we're still unsure about when, you know, the vote will take place - the referendum, but that will bring uncertainty and as the campaign hits up, it won't be very good I think for business because there was always a tendency for businesses to, I would say, to wait and see when there is a big election.</p><p>So that's the big uncertainty for next year and the year after, so that's what we need to watch closely.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>LAKE: As promised, Apple has just released its latest earnings and shares are sinking in after-hours trade. We're crunching the numbers and we'll have a lot more after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:40:49] LAKE: Apple's highly-anticipated results are in and shares are down more than 7 percent in after-hours trade. As a result the company reported $49.6 billion in revenue. That's more than $10 billion higher than a year ago. That was driven by record iPhone and Mac sales.</p><p>CEO Tim Cook also held a successful release for the Apple Watch. Joining me now to discuss, our own Samuel Burke and Shelly Palmer, the host of \"Shelly Palmer Digital Living.\" Thank you both for being with us.</p><p>Sam, I just want to start with you because of these numbers did just come across. What are - I mean - you're talking about massive revenue, massive profit every year, but what don't - what is it that investors don't like about (inaudible)?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: The one number here that investors are not going to like is the amount of iPhones sold was just 47.5 million. If that sounds like a massive amount, well you're correct but they actually had expectations of between 48 and even a lot of people expecting 50 million iPhones. That's what's driving the stock down.</p><p>It was down about 8 percent at one point and now just about 6.5 percent.</p><p>LAKE: Right, and we're just going off headlines, and, Shelly, I have one more quick one to Samuel. Because investors - this is kind of a kneejerk reaction. China - was China the trouble spot?</p><p>BURKE: It doesn't look like it for now, at least in the preliminary looking over their press releases, China sales doubling they say. So it may not be China. It does look like it is though weaker than expected iPhone numbers.</p><p>LAKE: Right. Well so Tim Cook I'm sure is going to be asked about what exactly that's about. Shelly, is this a lot of reaction about nothing? I mean, when you look at the massive number this company is posting, the fact that according to Gene Munster they seem to be gaining market share on the high end, should we be disappointed by this?</p><p>SHELLY PALMER, HOST \"SHELLY PALMER DIGITAL LIVING\": Look, people who are caring about what the stock is doing today are going to care a lot about this. Because this is movement and if you trade movement, you're going to love today.</p><p>If you're long on Apple, you say long on Apple. They are about to break Apple television in Q4, we don't know what that's going to look like but it's going to be massive.</p><p>They have a strategy to extract the highest-end consumers in the world, give them something to aspire to, give them a platform to consume on, and they hand advertisers these consumers on a platter.</p><p>I'm sorry, that's the best strategy in the entire business. And if you sold 48 million more devices that'll do that, two thumbs up. If the stock price is going in the wrong direction - OK -</p><p>LAKE: Yes, maybe -</p><p>PALMER: -- that's the market but it has nothing to with Apple or their strategy or what's to come. So these are just people who are playing Apple games.</p><p>LAKE: Yes.</p><p>PALMER: I am very long on Apple.</p><p>LAKE: And a company that potentially might be sitting on $200 billion in cash to play with as well I think teed up (ph).</p><p>Shelly, we talked a lot - there was - there were -- questions about whether Apple had lost its way, whether it had lost its mojo, what about Tim Cook? Those sort of - that seems to be - have been silenced they seem to be.</p><p>Even if you're not sure about the Apple Watch, they seem to be sort of as you say perfecting this ecosystem and they have pricing power - even in places like China they're getting people to pay up for product.</p><p>PALMER: Look, at the end of the day the Apple Watch may and/or may not successful, I am not long on the Apple Watch. I think the Apple Watch is a horribly failed experiment. I know I'm going to be proven wrong if you'll go -</p><p>LAKE: Because I love mine, Shelly -</p><p>PALMER: -- yes, don't say anything bad about it, no no, no.</p><p>LAKE: (LAUGHTER)</p><p>PALMER: But at the end of the day, their supply chain is unmatched in the world, their strategy is unmatched in the world and their performance with respect to delivering high-end merchandise to high-end individuals - packaging those individuals for advertisers.</p><p>LAKE: Sam, I want to ask you - this is a stock that's not just important to short-term momentum professional investors. This is a stock that is widely held and matters a lot to - sort of - people's sentiment about how things are going.</p><p>BURKE: You just saw that in the report I did earlier in the show with the Chinese-American couple who started out with a few tens of thousands of dollars and they say they've turned it into millions of dollars. And you heard her say when I asked her about the Apple Watch, she said, look, it's just the first generation. They can improve and if you look back at iPad numbers, they were only 3 million in their first quarter.</p><p>We don't see Apple Watch numbers broken out in this report, yet analysts expect about $3 million. So maybe if they don't get it right this time around, maybe they'll get it right next time around.</p><p>LAKE: Did I mention I love my Apple Watch? Did I mention that, Shelly?</p><p>PALMER: You did mention you love it.</p><p>LAKE: Listen, so good for Apple. Is it good for the economy? I mean, you have all these tech companies. We talked about Microsoft doing well but laying off people. Should we feel that good if Apple's doing well or is that - is that a -</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>[16:45:06] PALMER: You know there's a macro - there's a macro question about the economy and what the ever-increasing pace of technological advancement's going to mean for white collar jobs and jobs where you're using brain power.</p><p>You know, look, the industrial revolution made - gave us - the steam engine and it amplified the value of our muscles. And a lot of people who work with their muscles got laid off and had to change jobs and now they toil the machines as opposed to be the machines.</p><p>Well, think about it - computers replace - enhance our brain ability by millions of times. People who put numbers from one column to the next, their jobs are in jeopardy. If you do things computers could do, you're in trouble. So writ large tech companies doing better.</p><p>You know, Apple doing better mean people are buying their devices and buying the ecosystem.</p><p>LAKE: Yes.</p><p>PALMER: Tech companies writ large doing better like Cloud computing - that's a whole other story, probably for another segment and another -</p><p>BURKE: Meantime time, no matter where you report on tech in the world - whether it's California or Israel, they always say they have a demand for engineers. They need computer engineers.</p><p>LAKE: Yes, so we see it go that way. One last note, Shelly - Microsoft and Apple used to compete. It doesn't even seem like these two are going after the same thing at all anymore.</p><p>PALMER: Considering what's happened to Microsoft and that phone company they bought and what they had to do with it and where Apple is, I think - you know, look - the iPhone may be down a few units this quarter but it's the star device in their lineup and probably will continue to be.</p><p>Microsoft is really doing a nice job in Cloud computing. When they get Office 365 all put together in the Cloud and Azure, they're going to have a cash cow to end all cash cows. So they're looking strong. They don't compete with Apple head to head the way that you'd think they would. They're still all enterprise, Apple still seems to feel very computer - kind of a good messaging come from both companies.</p><p>LAKE: Yes.</p><p>PALMER: Pretty strong.</p><p>LAKE: And if you look at the stock price, it may be interesting all right obviously. Thank you both. We're going to have to wait for the conference call to sort of tease out -</p><p>PALMER: That's right.</p><p>LAKE: -- a lot more detail about exactly what's going on underneath the hood. So stay tuned. Shelly Palmer and Samuel Burke - thank you to both of you.</p><p>Now Pope Francis says humanity's reckless behavior has pushed the planet to a breaking point. He's gathered some of the world's most powerful local leaders at the Vatican to push the U.N. to do something about it.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAKE: \"Humanity cannot separate itself from the environment or see itself as something outside of it.\" Those words of Pope Francis as he takes on the issue of climate change.</p><p>Pope Francis has gathered 65 mayors from around the world for a conference at the Vatican. It's aimed at putting pressure on global leaders to adopt bold measures during climate talks in Paris later this year.</p><p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio described the Pope's message as a call to challenge corporate interests.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY: His Holiness challenges us. He challenges us not to be captives, not to be slavish to consumerism - as citizens to rise above it. He also challenges us not to be captive as leaders to powerful corporate interests.</p><p>Encyclical is not a call to arms, it is a call to sanity. It's a reminder that we as leaders have a sworn duty to protect. But how can we protect our people if we accept a status quo that is slowly killing our earth?</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[16:50:01] LAKE: Norsk Hydro is known for its production of aluminum which, as it happens, is a key material in technologies like solar panels.</p><p>The company is also a big producer of renewable energy through its hydro power plant. The Norsk Hydro CEO told me how his company balances energy-intensive aluminum production with its goal to minimize the environmental footprint.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SVEIN RICHARD BRANDTZAEG, NORSK HYDRO CEO: If you look at the total portfolio, we are quite well covered with hydro power but we would like to increase that share even more because of renewable energy because aluminum is energy-intensive metal. But saying that, we should not forget that aluminum is also a very recycling-friendly material. And when we are recycling aluminum we need only 5 percent of the original energy content to bring it back to the value chain.</p><p>So this is a big advantage for aluminum.</p><p>LAKE: It certainly is. But as you look forward, I mean, you've got to plan for the future. You have the Pope today just saying we can't separate ourselves from the environment and saying businesses need to consider the environment as much as they consider profits.</p><p>For a company that has a foot in both worlds - both traditional industry and renewable - how does that influence how you balance your business going forward?</p><p>BRANDTZAEG: We are probably one of the few metal and mining companies that have an ambition to be carbon neutral in 2020. We have an aspiration to become bigger, better and greener. And the greener aspiration is very much about the climate, also covering the total sustainability agenda for hizzel (ph).</p><p>But, as I said, we have an ambition to become carbon neutral in 2020 and we are well on the way to achieve that target.</p><p>LAKE: You managed to beat expectations despite the fact that the market still seems to be dealing with oversupply. What is your expectation for demand in the second half of this year?</p><p>BRANDTZAEG: Well we are taking down the expectation for the global demand from 6 percent to 5 percent this quarter based on the situation in the different segments of the market as we see it.</p><p>But 5 percent is still a good growth rate of aluminum consumption and we see that we have almost surprise (ph) situation today that is also affecting the prices and the premiums. But going forward, we will be very much supported by the fairly high growth rate in aluminum.</p><p>And if you compare aluminum with other materials and metals, it is among the highest speed growth rates that you can find.</p><p>LAKE: And for those who are maybe not that familiar, where is the growth for aluminum? You sort of said it's the high growth area of the market - what exactly is that?</p><p>BRANDTZAEG: Well if you look into automotive and transport, there is a strong drive to change other materials with aluminum, to reduce energy consumption and also of course reduce emissions.</p><p>So this is the main driving market segment as we see today - automotive and transport. But you also have many other segments like for example can business is seasonally very strong in the second quarter, building and construction in the U.S. market is picking up and there are also many other markets which is moving very much in a positive direction.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>LAKE: Elsewhere at the Vatican conference, the Pope called for action on human trafficking, something which CNN is shining a light on as part of our \"Freedom Project.\" In a new documentary, the actress and activist Jada Pinkett-Smith investigates modern-day slavery happening here inside the United States.</p><p>She interviews a young survivor who was sold for sex. She said she was lured in by someone she thought was her friend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>\"SACHARAY,\" SURVIVOR: You thirsty? Is that why you're (inaudible)? You thirsty?</p><p>JADA PINKETT-SMITH, ACTRESS AND ACTIVIST: Sasha Ray was born and raised in Florida. By the time she was 14, she was constantly being teased at school.</p><p>SACHARAY: What I got picked on a lot about was being black - my really, really dark skin I guess.</p><p>PINKETT-SMITH: She felt alone at home and at school. Sasha Ray says that's why when an older classmate offered friendship, she jumped at it.</p><p>SACHARAY: I thought she was like my best friend because I could like tell her anything. One day she asked if, you know, I want to skip school and have fun you know. So we went to this barbershop. When I was there she introduced me to these guys.</p><p>PINKETT-SMITH: Sasha Ray's new \"friend\" had just led her to the man who would eventually become her trafficker.</p><p>SACHARAY: They talked about how I was going to make money, how it was going to be easy, we didn't have to depend on nobody. And it was all sounding good and stuff so I fell for it.</p><p>PINKETT-SMITH: Was there any kind of grooming process, like when this first started? Or it's just something that just happened and you - he - was just expecting you to learn on the way?</p><p>[16:55:00] SACHARAY: He slowly brought it on when we got closer, when he felt like he got closer to me. He usually did it out of the back of the barbershop. And he'd even have people that worked with the post office - mailmen - come in. Mail men came in and paid their money to him, came back there to me.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>LAKE: The \"CNN Freedom Project\" documentary premiers on Wednesday night - \"Children for Sale - the Fight to End Human Trafficking.

Hot on the heels of her World Cup success, U.S. Women's Soccer star Alex Morgan will feature alongside Lionel Messi on the cover of \"FIFA 16.\" That will be available across the United States.</p><p>In Canada, women's team captain Christine Sinclair will be on the front cover. Publisher E.A. says the game will also feature a playable woman's team for the first time. U.K. versions will still feature a male player on the cover after Liverpool's Jordan Henderson won a fan's vote.</p><p>Time for a quick reminder of how U.S. markets in the U.S. finished. A choppy day for the Dow which fell by more than 180 points. The index was dragged lower by weak performances from tech giants IBM and United Technologies.</p><p>Over in Europe, a nine-day run has come to an end.

It's  Tuesday, the 21st of July.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, the verdict is in:  Apple's latest results are due out this  hour.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bowing to the pressure.  Toshiba's chief executive quits over a giant  accounting scandal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And fiery protests return to Calais, and the CEO of Eurostar tells me  it's not hurting his company.</p><p>I'm Maggie Lake.  This is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>Good evening.  In the coming hour, a crucial report card for the  world's most valuable company.  Apple has exceeded analysts' expectations  for eight quarters in a row, and there are three crucial areas that will  determine whether the company can beat forecasts once more.</p><p>First, sales of Apple's moneymaker, the iPhone, ahead of a new model  expected later this year, Apple's second-biggest market, China, after  months of wild stock swings, and clues about the success of the Apple  Watch, now on sale for three months.  We will bring you those numbers as  soon as they are released, and we will be keeping an eye on Microsoft and  Yahoo! also.  Both due to report this hour.</p><p>First we go to Tokyo for our other top story tonight, where one of  Japan's biggest tech companies is in turmoil.  Toshiba's CEO, along with  eight board members, have resigned from their post.  They took the blame  for a massive accounting scandal involving overstated profits of $1.2  billion.</p><p>An independent committee found Toshiba had been fiddling with the  figures all the way back to 2008.  CNN's Asia-Pacific editor, Andrew  Stevens, put the scandal into context from Hong Kong.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDREW STEVENS, CNN ASIA-PACIFIC EDITOR:  It is one of Japan's oldest  and most established corporations, a household name not only in its home  country, but around the world.  And now, Toshiba is at the center of a  scandal in which executives are accused of systematically lying about the  company's profits, and they'd lied, apparently, for the past seven years.</p><p>Three current and previous CEOs have now quit, plus another six senior  executives.  Billions of dollars have been wiped off the share price, and  the reputation of Toshiba has been blasted.  </p><p>The scandal first surfaced in May of this year when Toshiba itself  announced that it had brought a former Tokyo prosecutor in to investigate  irregularities in its earnings statement.  Investors took fright.  The  stock plunged, down 24 percent at its lowest point last week.</p><p>Now, there has been something of a rebound since then, but that's  little comfort against the damage to the 140-year-old company's reputation.   And also the expose of what investigators say was a corporate culture where  underlings were too scared to question their bosses.</p><p>Now, the prosecutors found -- take a look at this -- there existed a  corporate culture at Toshiba where it was impossible to go against the  boss's will.  It also said employees were pressured into postponing loss  reports or moving some costs into later years. </p><p>Toshiba inflated the earnings by $1.2 billion over seven years between  2008 and 2014 to hit aggressive targets which had been set by top  management.  That's according to the investigation.</p><p>Now, the report does not say why they did that.  The business  conditions for many Japanese companies over that period were certainly  tough.  The 2008 global financial crisis to begin with, followed in 2011 by  the devastating tsunami, which spawned, of course, the Fukushima nuclear  crisis.  Toshiba built nuclear reactors.</p><p>Toshiba's outgoing CEO apologized to the press conference on Tuesday.</p><p>HISAO TANAKA, OUTGOING PRESIDENT AND CEO, TOSHIBA:  We are taking what  has happened very seriously, and we would like to apologize from our  hearts, too, starting with the shareholders, and to all the stakeholders.</p><p>STEVENS:  The prosecutor's report said Toshiba should have been a  model for other companies, but coming just two years after the $1.7 billion  accounting scandal at another Japanese giant, Olympus, it's a model for all  the wrong reasons.</p><p>Andrew Stevens, CNN, Hong Kong.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAKE:  Toshiba is not the first major Japanese company to face a  scandal over its accounts.  In 2012, the former chairman of Olympus was  arrested over accounting fraud, along with several other executives.  He  later admitted he had lied to regulators.</p><p>The problem isn't limited to Japan, either.  That same year, HP took a  nearly $9 billion writedown on Autonomy and alleged the acquisition had  misrepresented its finances.  And last year, the Tesco CEO stepped down  after the company admitted overstating its profit forecast by $400 million.</p><p>[16:05:02]  In Japan, the country's finance minister says investors  could lose market trust if better corporate governance isn't put in place.   Toshiba's shares are down, as Andrew mentioned, around 20 percent so far  this year.  On Tuesday, they actually managed to push more than 6 percent  higher.  Investors, apparently, were glad the report wasn't worse.</p><p>A recent study from Transparency International showed tech companies  are among the worst when it comes to handling corporate reports.  Ben Elers  is the programs director for Transparency International, and he joins me  now, live from Berlin.  Ben, thank you so much for being with us.  What do  you make of this Toshiba revelations, and how worried should investors be?</p><p>BEN ELERS, PROGRAMS DIRECTOR, TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL:  Well, this  is just simply old-fashioned cooking the books, but on a massive scale.  In  so many scandals that we see, there are attempts to blame rogue employees  or a bad apple, but on this case, it was clearly systemic and went right to  the top of the company.</p><p>And with eight senior executives having gone, this is huge.  And  corporate Japan and Japan should be very worried indeed.</p><p>When we undertook our study in 2012 of transparency in corporate  reporting, we looked at 124 of the largest publicly-traded companies in the  world, five of which came from Japan, not Toshiba.  And only one of those,  I think it was Toyota, even had a basic public statement, anti-corruption  commitment.  </p><p>And this really is 101 in fighting corruption, just being clear about  this.  No Japanese company explicitly prohibited facilitation payments.   There was no information whatsoever on reporting of financial information  on a country-by-country basis.  And Honda actually came 123rd out of 124  companies in terms of their corporate transparency in reporting --</p><p>LAKE:  Yes --</p><p>ELERS:  -- and basically, only Chinese companies came worse.</p><p>LAKE:  But I want to ask you about this issue of this being so  pervasive throughout the corporate culture.  In that report, as Andrew  pointed out, they said that there was this idea that employees felt that  they couldn't possibly even push back against their managers' wishes.  </p><p>This seems like something that is deeply embedded, or that there is a  culture that sort of lends itself to this type of thing if you feel you  can't question a boss.</p><p>ELERS:  Look, all companies depend on the loyalty of their employees,  that's a good thing.  But it's not really loyalty to the company when  integrity is at stake and you can potentially bring a whole company down.   And there's -- what? -- 200,000 employees and their families who are  probably not very proud to be working for Toshiba tonight.</p><p>So, this is huge.  And this obsession with loyalty and not questioning  things, we see the results.  It gets companies into massive trouble.  And  Japan and the company and the stakeholders, shareholders, everyone suffers.</p><p>LAKE:  That's right.  Ben, where were the regulators?  Where are the  auditors?  These are publicly-traded companies?  How was this able to go on  for so long before any red flags came up to anyone?</p><p>ELERS:  Well, this is the big question, isn't it?  It's what is the  role of the auditors here?  And hopefully there will be a thorough  investigation here, and it won't just stop with the resignation of eight  senior executives, and that's it.</p><p>But there can't be impunity for this kind of act and this kind of  scandal on such a large scale.  So hopefully there'll be an investigation,  which will really get to the bottom of this.  Because it's certainly  hurting Japan.  </p><p>Investors depend on the numbers.  They need to trust the numbers which  they're given.  And when they can't, ratings agencies will downgrade  companies, and the fallout can be massive.  Look at Brazil with the  scandals around Petrobras, where the stock has just died, bonds are down,  and brand Brazil has been severely compromised.  And it's going to happen  to Japan as well.</p><p>LAKE:  All right.  Very interesting development in this story, we  certainly haven't heard the end of.  Ben Elers from Transparency  International.  Thank you so much, Ben.</p><p>Now, Apple's newest product, the Apple Watch, is far from its biggest  money-maker.  A top Apple analyst will tell us what he's watching for in  the company's results.</p><p>[16:09:43]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAKE:  In just a few minutes, Apple is expected to release its report  card for the past three months.  It will be the first set of results to  include the sales of the Apple Watch.  </p><p>But the watch is far from the biggest slice of Apple's business.   Until 2007, the company was formerly known as Apple Computer.  Today, just  one-tenth of company's revenue comes from computer sales.  The iPad is just  behind at 9 percent.  Services bring in another 9 percent, that includes  revenue from the iTunes store, the apps store, along with licensing and  extended warranties.</p><p>The \"other\" category, with 3 percent, includes the iPod, Apple TV,  Beats, and Apple accessories.  Starting this quarter, \"other\" will also  include Apple Watch sales.</p><p>The final and, as you can imagine, the biggest slice of the iPhone.   With a new iPhone expected later this year, investors will be watching to  see if demand holds up.</p><p>No one's watching closer than Gene Munster.  He is one of the  industry's best-known Apple analysts.  He's managing director at Piper  Jaffray, and he joins me now live.  Gene, great to see you.  So, tell me,  what are you expecting?  Is Apple going to ride to the rescue?  We've seen  the market having a little bit of a hard time, and we know how closely  everyone watches for Apple.</p><p>GENE MUNSTER, MANAGING DIRECTOR, PIPER JAFFRAY:  Well, we'll find out  in 15 minutes.  My bet is that they will come through.  And I think that  the unit numbers, the 49 million unit iPhone, if there's one number to  focus on, that's a critical number, and I think that they're going to  deliver on that, which is going to really speak to the strength of how  they're gaining share with the iPhone.  And so, I think they're going to  come through tonight.</p><p>LAKE:  I'm going to ask you about the \"other\" in a second, but it is  important to talk about that.  Gene, there was a time when you and I were  talking, and it was all about Samsung really catching up with Apple, that  maybe Apple had lost its cool, and people were not gravitating to those  very expensive iPhones.  We don't seem to be having that conversation that  much anymore.</p><p>MUNSTER:  We don't, and the reason is that they're gaining share back  at the high end of the smartphone market.  The low end is going to other  very low-cost providers, but at the high end, the Samsung that we've talked  about in the past, Apple is gaining share and growing significantly faster.</p><p>And so, I think what's happened is just this slow evolution of the  iPhone, and it's just started to creep up, and now it's starting to impact  the overall global market share.  Keep in mind, one other quick point is  that it's still small.  Apple's overall market share globally is about 15  percent of the smartphone market, so there's room for it to grow.</p><p>LAKE:  There is.  And a lot of people talk about the fact that it's  hard when you look at it, because they kind of are an integrated system.   You're not talking about all these various makers who are on the Android  platform.  Is that ecosystem helping?  And how much should we pay attention  to the importance of Apple Watch as a part of that?</p><p>MUNSTER:  Well, the ecosystem's definitely working, and we think of  the analogy of they're just slowly turning the screw down on their  competitors.  And the reason is that the ability for something to work  really seamless for people who are non-technical is important, and that's  where they're gaining some of their share.</p><p>As far as the watch and the impact, it's going to take time.  And some  investors are disappointed by the uptake, it's just a few million units, a  few percentage of revenue, as you talked about.  </p><p>But we think if you fast forward a couple years from now when there's  better apps, it's going to be a much bigger story.  And that tight network  or that tight connection, that ecosystem with their other Apple devices  should play into the watch's favor.</p><p>LAKE:  Yes.  I have to tell you, Gene, I have, when we talk about it  with the viewers all the time, everyone asks me about it.  And everyone  tells me they're thinking about buying one, they're just holding off.  So,  anecdotally for me, it seems to be right that there's interest.  Maybe  people just haven't pulled the trigger.  </p><p>Gene, what about the stock price though?  It's been trading near all- time highs again.  What should we expect from this?  Is all the good news  priced in already, or are people still kind of underestimating the power of  Apple?</p><p>[16:15:06]  MUNSTER:  Well, we talked to investors, and one of the big  themes over the last nine months has been this slowdown in their revenue  growth, because this last four quarters have been so strong with the new  form factors, that creates a tough comparison or a tough comp.</p><p>And so, I think this setup is really good to own the stock, and the  reason is that investors have factored in the negative part about these  tough comps and the slowing growth, but haven't factored in the positive  about them gaining shares.  And the other, slow increase in profitability  next year.  </p><p>And so, the net of this is I think that we have $162 stock price  target.  The stock's at $132.  We think it's a good one to own.</p><p>LAKE:  All right, there you go, it's a bullish call.  Gene, I know  you're going to be very busy in the next couple of hours.  We appreciate  you catching up with us.  Gene Munster for us.</p><p>MUNSTER:  Thank you.</p><p>LAKE:  Now, Apple stock hit Wall Street 35 years ago in December of  1980, if you can believe it.  It didn't truly take off, though, until the  iPod and Mac boom in the mid-2000s.  Ordinary investors who bought in early  and held on are now sitting on a goldmine.  Our Samuel Burke met a couple  that invested $17,000 in 1998.  Today, they say they're millionaires.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  They say buy  low, but if you were buying Apple stock in 1998, you were buying really  low, under $1 a share in today's terms.</p><p>BURKE (on camera):  When you first invested in Apple, how much money  was your initial investment?</p><p>NING WANG, EARLY APPLE INVESTOR:  We stated in 1998, $17,600.  That's  how we started.  We didn't spend much on it.  They were cheap.</p><p>BURKE:  This was before the iPhone, even before the iPod.  That was  actually a low point for the Apple company.  What made you so excited about  Apple?</p><p>TING QIAN, EARLY APPLE INVESTOR:  I think it's 1998, 1999, I went to  the Mac Award Conference, and I saw Steve Jobs talking.  And the whole  thing triggered it.  It's not just about the product.  And they kind of  sparked an interest in their business.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over):  Ning Wang and his wife, Ting Qian, didn't stop  buying Apple stock in 1998.  They say they've invested tens of thousands in  the company over the years, an investment in a stock that's up over 13,000  percent since they first bought.</p><p>BURKE (on camera):  Just recently, you finally hit a million dollars  in your total investment.  What was that moment like?</p><p>WANG:  She's more excited about that we are participating, not the  money.</p><p>QIAN:  Yes, not the money part.  </p><p>BURKE (voice-over):  Ning and Ting have sold some of their stock to  buy things like a vacation home, but they say they're always held on to  most of it.</p><p>BURKE (on camera):  When you guys have sold stock, was it because you  didn't have confidence in the products or the business?</p><p>WANG:  Never.  Always discipline.  Discipline.  The market goes up and  down.  You can not catch it. </p><p>BURKE:  Now, Apple Watch has come out.  A lot of analysts have said  they don't think Apple Watch sales have been nearly as high as expected.   So, is this a time for you to stop and assess and decide whether you want  to cash in on some of the stock?  What are you guys going to do?</p><p>QIAN:  In any new first generation comes out, maybe there's a waiting  time.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURKE:  Maybe there's room for improvement.</p><p>QIAN:  Yes, of course.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over):  So, what does the couple think about the stock  today?</p><p>QIAN:  I think it's time to buy. </p><p>BURKE (on camera):  Time to buy?</p><p>QIAN:  Yes.</p><p>WANG:  More?  More?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURKE:  That's news to him.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAKE:  OK, we see who the lead investor is in that couple.  Well now,  new into CNN, we want to bring you right up to date, Microsoft and Yahoo!  have revealed their results for the quarter.  </p><p>Microsoft says it was the Cloud and hardware that drove its record  revenues.  Yahoo! says its 15 percent year-over-year growth is the best in  nearly a decade.  That was driven mostly by mobile video and display ads.   CNN Money's Paul La Monica is here with us now to break it down, maybe keep  it real.  </p><p>All right, so is this -- let's start with Microsoft -- good news, or  is this spin?  Both of them are, of course, saying this is fantastic, but  what do you think first blush?  Because they are just coming out, these  minutes.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN MONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, they're just  coming out.  The very quick reaction, it looks like Microsoft and Yahoo!  stocks are both down on this news.  I think -- it was a negative day  overall, so I think investors may still be conditioned to look for bad news  after IBM.</p><p>Microsoft, we all knew that their hardware business was hopefully  going to get a bit of a boost.  The Windows 10 side of things, on the  software side, you've got a refresh there.  Xbox is still a strong  performer for them.  But mobile, they took that huge writedown from the </p><p>LAKE:  Yes.</p><p>LA MONICA:  -- Nokia business they acquired, that's something I think  investors are still concerned about.  </p><p>With Yahoo!, even though they're touting that strong growth on  earnings and the success that they're finally having with mobile and  display ads, earnings did miss forecasts.  Investors seem to be spooked by  that.  But also, Yahoo!, let's be honest, it's really just, as I like to  call it, Alibaba West.  </p><p>LAKE:  Yes.</p><p>LA MONICA:  People are waiting for Marissa Mayer and more details from  her about the spin-off of the remaining Alibaba shares, and that's what  people want to hear about, not the core results, I think.</p><p>[16:20:01]  LAKE:  There -- and these are both companies that are in  transition, right?  They're trying to sort of reinvent themselves from what  they were in the past to something new.  </p><p>I want to talk about Microsoft for just a moment.  That stock has  really been lagging.  If you want to take a punt on something, Satya  Nadella trying to get some of the bad news out with that phone part of the  business earlier before the earnings call and try to keep everybody's focus  on that Cloud business.  </p><p>It looks like if investors aren't thrilled at first, we're going to  hear the conference call as well.  Is it that the transition's not  happening fast enough, or people just don't know if they can replace that  cash cow that was Windows?</p><p>LA MONICA:  Exactly.  Don't get me wrong, Windows still is a cash cow,  Office to a certain extent as well.  But Nadella definitely focusing on the  Cloud.  I think that he realized that the Nokia acquisition, that was not  his call, that was done under Steve Ballmer.</p><p>So he's trying to get maybe the classic sort of kitchen sink, let's  really take this huge writedown, we'll do more layoffs, which is  unfortunate, because Microsoft has cut a lot of jobs under Nadella.  I  think he's hoping that can maybe kick start this transition and get people  focused on the more exciting Cloud business yet again.</p><p>To be fair, Nadella -- the stock has done well overall since he took  over.  Last year, it did extremely well.  People were very excited,  probably because he just wasn't Steve Ballmer.</p><p>LAKE:  Yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LA MONICA:  But now, the honeymoon seems to be over, and it's  definitely the same case with Marissa Mayer.</p><p>LAKE:  I was going to say.  And we know that the honeymoon has sort of  been ending for her --</p><p>LA MONICA:  Been over for a while.</p><p>LAKE:  -- as well.  Paul, I want to ask you, we saw a pretty big drop  in the Dow today.  There was a lot of hope pinned on these tech companies,  could they kind of revive that momentum.  What's going on with the broader  market?  What's holding the broader market back?</p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, the broader market today, I mean, I don't want to get  too worried about the Dow.  I think what happened with the Dow is more the  folly of price weighting.</p><p>LAKE:  Yes.</p><p>LA MONICA:  Because you had IBM and United Technologies, two companies  with triple-digit stock prices, their earnings stunk.</p><p>LAKE:  Yes.</p><p>LA MONICA:  And that's why the Dow went down.  Verizon also didn't  have great numbers, it's a Dow component.  But the big drop in the Dow  really was about what happened at IBM and also United Technologies, which  despite having \"Technologies\" in its name, isn't really --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LAKE:  Yes, that's right.</p><p>LA MONICA:  -- a technology company.  Jet engines, elevators, and air  conditioners.</p><p>LAKE:  Yes, and there's some headwinds on that.  Energy, also, which I  know people are worried about the energy sector, too, so that's a drag.   We'll have to see if some of these big tech companies, which are also blue  chips --</p><p>LA MONICA:  Right.</p><p>LAKE:  -- can help swing things.</p><p>LA MONICA:  Google had another all-time high.</p><p>LAKE:  Right.</p><p>LA MONICA:  -- the earnings --</p><p>LAKE:  We're waiting for Apple, so we'll see.</p><p>LA MONICA:  And Facebook next week, too.  That's another all-time high  today.</p><p>LAKE:  There could be hope.  There could be hope.  We'll hang onto  that.  Paul, thanks so much for breaking it down for us --</p><p>LA MONICA:  Thank you.</p><p>LAKE:  -- those early numbers.  And again, those conference calls will  be happening.  We'll keep an eye on them for you.</p><p>Now, after the break, Nigeria stands on the brink of economic crisis.   We find out how the country's new president plans to turn that tide.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAKE:  Once held up as one of the up and coming mint economies,  Nigeria has seen a reversal of its economic fortunes in recent years.  The  government relies on oil for about 80 percent of its revenue, so low crude  prices have weighed heavily on the economy.</p><p>Earlier, CNN's Christiane Amanpour spoke exclusively to Nigeria's new  president, Muhammadu Buhari.  She asked him how he plans to tackle this  brewing economic crisis.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT OF NIGERIA:  My people, firstly, I  believe, they want the security in their country to be stabilized, so that  a normal life, mostly in the southern part of the country, where the  militants are still sabotaging oil installations and kidnapping people and  demanding ransom.</p><p>[16:25:13]  And also into the country, where Boko Haram is still  active.  This is the main preoccupation of Nigeria now, and the real issue  we're looking to solve.  Nothing will work until the country is secure.</p><p>CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  What  about your campaign promise to root out corruption?  If they turned out  that some of the guilty ones were members of your own party or your own  associates, would you crack down on them, too?</p><p>BUHARI:  Yes, I have to.  There isn't going to be any party member or  any personality that can escape justice.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Mr. President, are you disappointed that President Obama is  yet again not going to Nigeria, the biggest and most economically powerful  country in Africa?</p><p>BUHARI:  I wouldn't say I was disappointed, but how I wished he will  change his mind and go to Nigeria.</p><p>AMANPOUR:  Did you ask him?  Did he say he would?</p><p>BUHARI:  Well, I ask him -- I will send a formal invitation.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAKE:  With low oil prices causing government revenues to dry up,  ordinary citizens are beginning to feel the effects.  Civil servants in 23  Nigerian states have gone unpaid for months.  CNN's Christian Purefoy looks  at how the people of Nigeria are coping with the crisis.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHRISTIAN PUREFOY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  A  small roadside mechanic outside of Lagos.  Most people just drive on by.   Inside is a mechanic who knows how to fix oil leaks in broken engines.  But  the problem is, there's one engine Obinna can't fix:  Nigeria's broken oil  economy.  </p><p>EDWIN OBINNA, MECHANIC:  When there's no oil in the vehicle, the  engine can't work, because you need oil to protect its moving, very soft,  easily to move.  When there's no oil it won't work, iron to iron.</p><p>PUREFOY (on camera):  Like Nigeria.</p><p>OBINNA:  Like Nigeria.  Our currency is different than other places  because everywhere is very hot.</p><p>PUREFOY (voice-over):  Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer, but  as the price of oil has crashed, so, too, has Nigeria's economy.  </p><p>The naira has fallen to record lows.  International investment has  stalled, and there are persistent fuel shortages across the country.</p><p>PUREFOY (on camera):  Obinna's mechanic store sits beside what is  probably one of the most important roads in the whole of Nigeria.  It links  the mega city and port of Lagos to the rest of the country.</p><p>Now, the federal government had promised to rehabilitate and expand  this road.  But as you can see from the potholes behind me, work has  stalled.  And that is simply because there's no money left to finish the  job.</p><p>PUREFOY (voice-over):  And energy analysts say there is no clear plan  to fix the problem.</p><p>DOLAPO ONI, ENERGY ANALYST:  There needs to be communication about the  economic policy of the government, which is a case of saying this is how we  want to drive the economy going forward.  This is how we want to open the  economy.  </p><p>That sort of communication will give investors an idea of, OK, this is  what you want to do, and this is how we fit it into your plan.  And then we  can start to see some forex influence back into Nigeria.</p><p>PUREFOY (on camera):  Does that communication exist right now?</p><p>ONI:  At the moment, no, it doesn't.</p><p>PUREFOY (voice-over):  And now the problems are affecting Obinna's  business.</p><p>OBINNA:  Today, I'm hungry for my family, we have nothing to eat.  For  groceries, I can have something to do.  I need money, I get it when I work.</p><p>PUREFOY:  Obinna manages to start up his engine to get the truck back  on the road.  He hopes Nigeria's leaders will do the same with the economy  soon.</p><p>Christian Purefoy, CNN, Lagos, Nigeria.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAKE:  It is the moment Wall Street is waiting for:  Apple's highly- anticipated results, due to be released in just a few moments.</p><p>[16:29:12]  (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAKE:  Hello, I'm Maggie Lake.  Coming up on the next half hour of  \"Quest Means Business,\" the results are in, Apple third-quarter reports are  due out any minute.</p><p>And the CEO of Eurostar tells me that a fresh wave of protests is bad  news.  First though, these are the top world headlines we're following for  you this hour.</p><p>Funerals have taken place for the victims of Monday's bombing in  Southern Turkey.  Turkey's prime minister says one of the suspects has been  identified and that a connection to ISIS appears likely.  At least 31  people were killed when an explosion tore through a rally in the town of  Suruc.  </p><p>Three Spanish journalists have gone missing in Syria.  The president  of the Spanish Federation of Journalists says the three men were last seen  nine days ago when they were working in the Aleppo region.  </p><p>Two British men are being held by U.K. police on terror charges.   Authorities say the pair from the town of Wootton, north of London,  intended to join ISIS in Syria.  As our Fred Pleitgen tells us, one of the  men is also being charged with planning to attack U.S. troops on British  soil.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:  One of the  charges against both of them was that they were plotting to go to Syria and  to join ISIS there.  And then one of the men, Junead Kahn, he apparently  was plotting to kill American service members here in Britain, and they did  offer some more details as to what they thought this plot entailed.</p><p>And apparently they were talking about a hit-and-run car style attack,  or an accident style attack as they called it, where apparently he was  planning to run into a U.S. service member and then kill a service member  with a knife.  Allegedly there was also talk of using a suicide vest as  well.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>LAKE:  Pope Francis has called on the United Nations to take action on  human trafficking.  The Pope invited 65 mayors and local politicians from  around the world to a conference aimed at fighting modern-day slavery and  climate change.  The Pope said decisive action was needed.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>POPE FRANCIS, ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH,  VIA INTERPRETER:  The United  Nations really needs to take a very strong position on this issue,  particularly the trafficking of human beings that are caused by this  environmental situation and the exploitation of people.  </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>LAKE:  Donald Trump's presidential run continues to grab headlines.   At a speech in South Carolina, the Republican candidate read out the  private cell phone number of his fellow candidate Senator Lindsey Graham  urging supporters to call.  </p><p>Senator Graham later tweeted that he was quote, \"probably getting a  new phone.\"</p><p>Major disruptions at the gateway between Britain and mainland Europe.   This was the scene in the French port of Calais.  Disgruntled ferry workers  set tires alight on the busy highway, blocking access to the Channel tunnel  terminal more than - for more than - two hours.  </p><p>It is just the latest in a series of protests which have plagued  Eurotunnel travelers this summer.  It seems the disruptions at Calais have  done little to derail Eurotunnel's biggest customer Eurostar.  The train  network operator which links cities like London, Paris and Brussels just  reported record passenger traffic -- more than 2.8 million customers  between April and June.  </p><p>[16:35:03] To help it cope with demand, Eurostar is introducing its  first new fleet of trains in two decades. They will enter service at the  end of the year.  </p><p>Earlier I caught up with the firm's CEO and asked him how much the  recent protests were affecting his bottom line.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>NICOLAS PETROVIC, CEO, EUROSTAR:  We suffer from the closures of the  tunnel in June especially because of protestors on the line and for us it's  not very good news.  It's several millions of pounds off the bottom line.   First of all there's a loss of revenue because not everyone can travel but  also we have to compensate passengers, you know, who have to go to hotels  and they've missed their train.</p><p>So for us it's really bad news and I really hope the situation will  get resolved soon.</p><p>LAKE:  If we look beyond the protests, just at the underlying  fundamentals, what are you seeing in terms of where we are with the economy  and with consumers' willingness to spend?</p><p>PETROVIC:  Q2 for us was a record quarter and this is because  especially the U.K. economy is now - there's a lot of confidence in the  leisure market and the stirring (ph) is strong so people are, you know,  they're happy to have city breaks and to spend money.</p><p>The French economy actually is also OK abzsory (ph) because the  reports are not that good but we don't see that in our numbers.  But really  what's interesting is to see the business market both in Paris and London  is extremely strong.  I mean, we're coming back to the levels of 2007 or  2006, so that's pretty - that's pretty good news for us.  </p><p>LAKE:  It certainly is.  Do you think that that kind of momentum is  sustainable?  </p><p>PETROVIC:  Well, these days it's very difficult because literally each  quarter is different and so the summer looks very good at the moment.   Obviously it's mostly leisure markets because many, many Americans also  coming now to Europe because the euro is weaker than it used to be.  So  we've got quite a few American tourists onboard which is great.  </p><p>Then September/October we'll have to wait and see to and hopefully the  business markets will be there to - for the comeback after the summer.  </p><p>LAKE:  One of the uncertainties for the business market or the  headwinds is really the political wrangling we've seen in Europe.  There  was so much drama surrounding Greece and a lot of people are concerned  about what that might mean for Britain as it considers whether it wants to  stay part of the European Union.</p><p>How concerned are you about that?  </p><p>PETROVIC:  The Greek - the Greek debate - didn't affect business at  all.  We could see, and I speak to a lot of businesses, of course our  customers - and they were very relaxed actually about Greece.  </p><p>Now the U.K., that's a different story and we're still unsure about  when, you know, the vote will take place - the referendum, but that will  bring uncertainty and as the campaign hits up, it won't be very good I  think for business because there was always a tendency for businesses to, I  would say, to wait and see when there is a big election.</p><p>So that's the big uncertainty for next year and the year after, so  that's what we need to watch closely.  </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>LAKE:  As promised, Apple has just released its latest earnings and  shares are sinking in after-hours trade.  We're crunching the numbers and  we'll have a lot more after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:40:49] LAKE:  Apple's highly-anticipated results are in and shares  are down more than 7 percent in after-hours trade.  As a result the company  reported $49.6 billion in revenue.  That's more than $10 billion higher  than a year ago.  That was driven by record iPhone and Mac sales.  </p><p>CEO Tim Cook also held a successful release for the Apple Watch.   Joining me now to discuss, our own Samuel Burke and Shelly Palmer, the host  of \"Shelly Palmer Digital Living.\"  Thank you both for being with us.</p><p>Sam, I just want to start with you because of these numbers did just  come across.  What are - I mean - you're talking about massive revenue,  massive profit every year, but what don't - what is it that investors don't  like about (inaudible)?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  The one number here that  investors are not going to like is the amount of iPhones sold was just 47.5  million.  If that sounds like a massive amount, well you're correct but  they actually had expectations of between 48 and even a lot of people  expecting 50 million iPhones.  That's what's driving the stock down.</p><p>It was down about 8 percent at one point and now just about 6.5  percent.  </p><p>LAKE:  Right, and we're just going off headlines, and, Shelly, I have  one more quick one to Samuel.  Because investors - this is kind of a  kneejerk reaction.  China - was China the trouble spot?  </p><p>BURKE:  It doesn't look like it for now, at least in the preliminary  looking over their press releases, China sales doubling they say.  So it  may not be China.  It does look like it is though weaker than expected  iPhone numbers.</p><p>LAKE:  Right.  Well so Tim Cook I'm sure is going to be asked about  what exactly that's about.  Shelly, is this a lot of reaction about  nothing?  I mean, when you look at the massive number this company is  posting, the fact that according to Gene Munster they seem to be gaining  market share on the high end, should we be disappointed by this?  </p><p>SHELLY PALMER, HOST \"SHELLY PALMER DIGITAL LIVING\":  Look, people who  are caring about what the stock is doing today are going to care a lot  about this.  Because this is movement and if you trade movement, you're  going to love today.  </p><p>If you're long on Apple, you say long on Apple.  They are about to  break Apple television in Q4, we don't know what that's going to look like  but it's going to be massive.  </p><p>They have a strategy to extract the highest-end consumers in the  world, give them something to aspire to, give them a platform to consume  on, and they hand advertisers these consumers on a platter.  </p><p>I'm sorry, that's the best strategy in the entire business.  And if  you sold 48 million more devices that'll do that, two thumbs up.  If the  stock price is going in the wrong direction - OK - </p><p>LAKE:  Yes, maybe - </p><p>PALMER:  -- that's the market but it has nothing to with Apple or  their strategy or what's to come.  So these are just people who are playing  Apple games.  </p><p>LAKE:  Yes.</p><p>PALMER:  I am very long on Apple.  </p><p>LAKE:  And a company that potentially might be sitting on $200 billion  in cash to play with as well I think teed up (ph).</p><p>Shelly, we talked a lot - there was - there were -- questions about  whether Apple had lost its way, whether it had lost its mojo, what about  Tim Cook?  Those sort of - that seems to be - have been silenced they seem  to be.  </p><p>Even if you're not sure about the Apple Watch, they seem to be sort of  as you say perfecting this ecosystem and they have pricing power - even in  places like China they're getting people to pay up for product.</p><p>PALMER:  Look, at the end of the day the Apple Watch may and/or may  not successful, I am not long on the Apple Watch.  I think the Apple Watch  is a horribly failed experiment.  I know I'm going to be proven wrong if  you'll go - </p><p>LAKE:  Because I love mine, Shelly - </p><p>PALMER:  -- yes, don't say anything bad about it, no no, no.</p><p>LAKE:  (LAUGHTER)</p><p>PALMER:  But at the end of the day, their supply chain is unmatched in  the world, their strategy is unmatched in the world and their performance  with respect to delivering high-end merchandise to high-end individuals -  packaging those individuals for advertisers.  </p><p>LAKE:  Sam, I want to ask you - this is a stock that's not just  important to short-term momentum professional investors.  This is a stock  that is widely held and matters a lot to - sort of - people's sentiment  about how things are going.</p><p>BURKE:  You just saw that in the report I did earlier in the show with  the Chinese-American couple who started out with a few tens of thousands of  dollars and they say they've turned it into millions of dollars.  And you  heard her say when I asked her about the Apple Watch, she said, look, it's  just the first generation.  They can improve and if you look back at iPad  numbers, they were only 3 million in their first quarter.  </p><p>We don't see Apple Watch numbers broken out in this report, yet  analysts expect about $3 million.  So maybe if they don't get it right this  time around, maybe they'll get it right next time around.  </p><p>LAKE:  Did I mention I love my Apple Watch?  Did I mention that,  Shelly?  </p><p>PALMER:  You did mention you love it.  </p><p>LAKE:  Listen, so good for Apple.  Is it good for the economy?  I  mean, you have all these tech companies.  We talked about Microsoft doing  well but laying off people.  Should we feel that good if Apple's doing well  or is that - is that a - </p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>[16:45:06] PALMER:  You know there's a macro - there's a macro  question about the economy and what the ever-increasing pace of  technological advancement's going to mean for white collar jobs and jobs  where you're using brain power.  </p><p>You know, look, the industrial revolution made - gave us - the steam  engine and it amplified the value of our muscles.  And a lot of people who  work with their muscles got laid off and had to change jobs and now they  toil the machines as opposed to be the machines.  </p><p>Well, think about it - computers replace - enhance our brain ability  by millions of times.  People who put numbers from one column to the next,  their jobs are in jeopardy.  If you do things computers could do, you're in  trouble.  So writ large tech companies doing better.</p><p>You know, Apple doing better mean people are buying their devices and  buying the ecosystem.</p><p>LAKE:  Yes.  </p><p>PALMER:  Tech companies writ large doing better like Cloud computing -  that's a whole other story, probably for another segment and another - </p><p>BURKE:  Meantime time, no matter where you report on tech in the world  - whether it's California or Israel, they always say they have a demand for  engineers.  They need computer engineers.  </p><p>LAKE:  Yes, so we see it go that way.  One last note, Shelly -  Microsoft and Apple used to compete.  It doesn't even seem like these two  are going after the same thing at all anymore. </p><p>PALMER:  Considering what's happened to Microsoft and that phone  company they bought and what they had to do with it and where Apple is, I  think - you know, look - the iPhone may be down a few units this quarter  but it's the star device in their lineup and probably will continue to be.</p><p>Microsoft is really doing a nice job in Cloud computing.  When they  get Office 365 all put together in the Cloud and Azure, they're going to  have a cash cow to end all cash cows.  So they're looking strong.  They  don't compete with Apple head to head the way that you'd think they would.   They're still all enterprise, Apple still seems to feel very computer -  kind of a good messaging come from both companies.  </p><p>LAKE:  Yes. </p><p>PALMER:  Pretty strong.</p><p>LAKE:  And if you look at the stock price, it may be interesting all  right obviously.  Thank you both.  We're going to have to wait for the  conference call to sort of tease out - </p><p>PALMER:  That's right. </p><p>LAKE:  -- a lot more detail about exactly what's going on underneath  the hood.  So stay tuned.  Shelly Palmer and Samuel Burke - thank you to  both of you.</p><p>Now Pope Francis says humanity's reckless behavior has pushed the  planet to a breaking point.  He's gathered some of the world's most  powerful local leaders at the Vatican to push the U.N. to do something  about it.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAKE:  \"Humanity cannot separate itself from the environment or see  itself as something outside of it.\"  Those words of Pope Francis as he  takes on the issue of climate change.   </p><p>Pope Francis has gathered 65 mayors from around the world for a  conference at the Vatican.  It's aimed at putting pressure on global  leaders to adopt bold measures during climate talks in Paris later this  year.  </p><p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio described the Pope's message as a  call to challenge corporate interests.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY:  His Holiness challenges us.   He challenges us not to be captives, not to be slavish to consumerism - as  citizens to rise above it.  He also challenges us not to be captive as  leaders to powerful corporate interests.  </p><p>Encyclical is not a call to arms, it is a call to sanity.  It's a  reminder that we as leaders have a sworn duty to protect.  But how can we  protect our people if we accept a status quo that is slowly killing our  earth?  </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[16:50:01] LAKE:  Norsk Hydro is known for its production of aluminum  which, as it happens, is a key material in technologies like solar panels.  </p><p>The company is also a big producer of renewable energy through its  hydro power plant.  The Norsk Hydro CEO told me how his company balances  energy-intensive aluminum production with its goal to minimize the  environmental footprint.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SVEIN RICHARD BRANDTZAEG, NORSK HYDRO CEO:  If you look at the total  portfolio, we are quite well covered with hydro power but we would like to  increase that share even more because of renewable energy because aluminum  is energy-intensive metal.  But saying that, we should not forget that  aluminum is also a very recycling-friendly material.  And when we are  recycling aluminum we need only 5 percent of the original energy content to  bring it back to the value chain.</p><p>So this is a big advantage for aluminum.  </p><p>LAKE:  It certainly is.  But as you look forward, I mean, you've got  to plan for the future.  You have the Pope today just saying we can't  separate ourselves from the environment and saying businesses need to  consider the environment as much as they consider profits. </p><p>For a company that has a foot in both worlds - both traditional  industry and renewable - how does that influence how you balance your  business going forward?  </p><p>BRANDTZAEG:  We are probably one of the few metal and mining companies  that have an ambition to be carbon neutral in 2020.  We have an aspiration  to become bigger, better and greener.  And the greener aspiration is very  much about the climate, also covering the total sustainability agenda for  hizzel (ph).  </p><p>But, as I said, we have an ambition to become carbon neutral in 2020  and we are well on the way to achieve that target.  </p><p>LAKE:  You managed to beat expectations despite the fact that the  market still seems to be dealing with oversupply.  What is your expectation  for demand in the second half of this year?  </p><p>BRANDTZAEG:  Well we are taking down the expectation for the global  demand from 6 percent to 5 percent this quarter based on the situation in  the different segments of the market as we see it.</p><p>But 5 percent is still a good growth rate of aluminum consumption and  we see that we have almost surprise (ph) situation today that is also  affecting the prices and the premiums.  But going forward, we will be very  much supported by the fairly high growth rate in aluminum.  </p><p>And if you compare aluminum with other materials and metals, it is  among the highest speed growth rates that you can find.</p><p>LAKE:  And for those who are maybe not that familiar, where is the  growth for aluminum?  You sort of said it's the high growth area of the  market - what exactly is that?  </p><p>BRANDTZAEG:  Well if you look into automotive and transport, there is  a strong drive to change other materials with aluminum, to reduce energy  consumption and also of course reduce emissions.  </p><p>So this is the main driving market segment as we see today -  automotive and transport.  But you also have many other segments like for  example can business is seasonally very strong in the second quarter,  building and construction in the U.S. market is picking up and there are  also many other markets which is moving very much in a positive direction.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>LAKE:  Elsewhere at the Vatican conference, the Pope called for action  on human trafficking, something which CNN is shining a light on as part of  our \"Freedom Project.\"  In a new documentary, the actress and activist Jada  Pinkett-Smith investigates modern-day slavery happening here inside the  United States. </p><p>She interviews a young survivor who was sold for sex.  She said she  was lured in by someone she thought was her friend.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>\"SACHARAY,\" SURVIVOR:  You thirsty?  Is that why you're (inaudible)?   You thirsty?</p><p>JADA PINKETT-SMITH, ACTRESS AND ACTIVIST:  Sasha Ray was born and  raised in Florida.  By the time she was 14, she was constantly being teased  at school.  </p><p>SACHARAY:  What I got picked on a lot about was being black - my  really, really dark skin I guess.  </p><p>PINKETT-SMITH:  She felt alone at home and at school.  Sasha Ray says  that's why when an older classmate offered friendship, she jumped at it.  </p><p>SACHARAY:  I thought she was like my best friend because I could like  tell her anything.  One day she asked if, you know, I want to skip school  and have fun you know.  So we went to this barbershop.  When I was there  she introduced me to these guys.  </p><p>PINKETT-SMITH:  Sasha Ray's new \"friend\" had just led her to the man  who would eventually become her trafficker.  </p><p>SACHARAY:  They talked about how I was going to make money, how it was  going to be easy, we didn't have to depend on nobody.  And it was all  sounding good and stuff so I fell for it.  </p><p>PINKETT-SMITH:  Was there any kind of grooming process, like when this  first started?  Or it's just something that just happened and you - he -  was just expecting you to learn on the way?  </p><p>[16:55:00] SACHARAY:  He slowly brought it on when we got closer, when  he felt like he got closer to me.  He usually did it out of the back of the  barbershop.  And he'd even have people that worked with the post office -  mailmen - come in.  Mail men came in and paid their money to him, came back  there to me.  </p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>LAKE:  The \"CNN Freedom Project\" documentary premiers on Wednesday  night - \"Children for Sale - the Fight to End Human Trafficking.

This is QUEST MEANS BUSINESS.</p><p>Good evening. In the coming hour, a crucial report card for the world's most valuable company. Apple has exceeded analysts' expectations for eight quarters in a row, and there are three crucial areas that will determine whether the company can beat forecasts once more.</p><p>First, sales of Apple's moneymaker, the iPhone, ahead of a new model expected later this year, Apple's second-biggest market, China, after months of wild stock swings, and clues about the success of the Apple Watch, now on sale for three months. We will bring you those numbers as soon as they are released, and we will be keeping an eye on Microsoft and Yahoo! also. Both due to report this hour.</p><p>First we go to Tokyo for our other top story tonight, where one of Japan's biggest tech companies is in turmoil. Toshiba's CEO, along with eight board members, have resigned from their post. They took the blame for a massive accounting scandal involving overstated profits of $1.2 billion.</p><p>An independent committee found Toshibahad been fiddling with the figures all the way back to 2008. CNN's Asia-Pacific editor, Andrew Stevens, put the scandal into context from Hong Kong.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANDREW STEVENS, CNN ASIA-PACIFIC EDITOR: It is one of Japan's oldest and most established corporations, a household name not only in its home country, but around the world. And now, Toshibais at the center of a scandal in which executives are accused of systematically lying about the company's profits, and they'd lied, apparently, for the past seven years.</p><p>Three current and previous CEOs have now quit, plus another six senior executives. Billions of dollars have been wiped off the share price, and the reputation of Toshibahas been blasted.</p><p>The scandal first surfaced in May of this year when Toshibaitself announced that it had brought a former Tokyo prosecutor in to investigate irregularities in its earnings statement. Investors took fright. The stock plunged, down 24 percent at its lowest point last week.</p><p>Now, there has been something of a rebound since then, but that's little comfort against the damage to the 140-year-old company's reputation. And also the expose of what investigators say was a corporate culture where underlings were too scared to question their bosses.</p><p>Now, the prosecutors found -- take a look at this -- there existed a corporate culture at Toshibawhere it was impossible to go against the boss's will. It also said employees were pressured into postponing loss reports or moving some costs into later years.</p><p>Toshibainflated the earnings by $1.2 billion over seven years between 2008 and 2014 to hit aggressive targets which had been set by top management. That's according to the investigation.</p><p>Now, the report does not say why they did that. The business conditions for many Japanese companies over that period were certainly tough. The 2008 global financial crisis to begin with, followed in 2011 by the devastating tsunami, which spawned, of course, the Fukushima nuclear crisis. Toshibabuilt nuclear reactors.</p><p>Toshiba's outgoing CEO apologized to the press conference on Tuesday.</p><p>HISAO TANAKA, OUTGOING PRESIDENT AND CEO, TOSHIBA: We are taking what has happened very seriously, and we would like to apologize from our hearts, too, starting with the shareholders, and to all the stakeholders.</p><p>STEVENS: The prosecutor's report said Toshibashould have been a model for other companies, but coming just two years after the $1.7 billion accounting scandal at another Japanese giant, Olympus, it's a model for all the wrong reasons.</p><p>Andrew Stevens, CNN, Hong Kong.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAKE: Toshibais not the first major Japanese company to face a scandal over its accounts. In 2012, the former chairman of Olympus was arrested over accounting fraud, along with several other executives. He later admitted he had lied to regulators.</p><p>The problem isn't limited to Japan, either. That same year, HP took a nearly $9 billion writedown on Autonomy and alleged the acquisition had misrepresented its finances. And last year, the Tesco CEO stepped down after the company admitted overstating its profit forecast by $400 million.</p><p>[16:05:02] In Japan, the country's finance minister says investors could lose market trust if better corporate governance isn't put in place. Toshiba's shares are down, as Andrew mentioned, around 20 percent so far this year. On Tuesday, they actually managed to push more than 6 percent higher. Investors, apparently, were glad the report wasn't worse.</p><p>A recent study from Transparency International showed tech companies are among the worst when it comes to handling corporate reports. Ben Elers is the programs director for Transparency International, and he joins me now, live from Berlin. Ben, thank you so much for being with us. What do you make of this Toshibarevelations, and how worried should investors be?</p><p>BEN ELERS, PROGRAMS DIRECTOR, TRANSPARENCY INTERNATIONAL: Well, this is just simply old-fashioned cooking the books, but on a massive scale. In so many scandals that we see, there are attempts to blame rogue employees or a bad apple, but on this case, it was clearly systemic and went right to the top of the company.</p><p>And with eight senior executives having gone, this is huge. And corporate Japan and Japan should be very worried indeed.</p><p>When we undertook our study in 2012 of transparency in corporate reporting, we looked at 124 of the largest publicly-traded companies in the world, five of which came from Japan, not Toshiba. And only one of those, I think it was Toyota, even had a basic public statement, anti-corruption commitment.</p><p>And this really is 101 in fighting corruption, just being clear about this. No Japanese company explicitly prohibited facilitation payments. There was no information whatsoever on reporting of financial information on a country-by-country basis. And Honda actually came 123rd out of 124 companies in terms of their corporate transparency in reporting --</p><p>LAKE: Yes --</p><p>ELERS: -- and basically, only Chinese companies came worse.</p><p>LAKE: But I want to ask you about this issue of this being so pervasive throughout the corporate culture. In that report, as Andrew pointed out, they said that there was this idea that employees felt that they couldn't possibly even push back against their managers' wishes.</p><p>This seems like something that is deeply embedded, or that there is a culture that sort of lends itself to this type of thing if you feel you can't question a boss.</p><p>ELERS: Look, all companies depend on the loyalty of their employees, that's a good thing. But it's not really loyalty to the company when integrity is at stake and you can potentially bring a whole company down. And there's -- what? -- 200,000 employees and their families who are probably not very proud to be working for Toshibatonight.</p><p>So, this is huge. And this obsession with loyalty and not questioning things, we see the results. It gets companies into massive trouble. And Japan and the company and the stakeholders, shareholders, everyone suffers.</p><p>LAKE: That's right. Ben, where were the regulators? Where are the auditors? These are publicly-traded companies? How was this able to go on for so long before any red flags came up to anyone?</p><p>ELERS: Well, this is the big question, isn't it? It's what is the role of the auditors here? And hopefully there will be a thorough investigation here, and it won't just stop with the resignation of eight senior executives, and that's it.</p><p>But there can't be impunity for this kind of act and this kind of scandal on such a large scale. So hopefully there'll be an investigation, which will really get to the bottom of this. Because it's certainly hurting Japan.</p><p>Investors depend on the numbers. They need to trust the numbers which they're given. And when they can't, ratings agencies will downgrade companies, and the fallout can be massive. Look at Brazil with the scandals around Petrobras, where the stock has just died, bonds are down, and brand Brazil has been severely compromised. And it's going to happen to Japan as well.</p><p>LAKE: All right. Very interesting development in this story, we certainly haven't heard the end of. Ben Elers from Transparency International. Thank you so much, Ben.</p><p>Now, Apple's newest product, the Apple Watch, is far from its biggest money-maker. A top Apple analyst will tell us what he's watching for in the company's results.</p><p>[16:09:43] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAKE: In just a few minutes, Apple is expected to release its report card for the past three months. It will be the first set of results to include the sales of the Apple Watch.</p><p>But the watch is far from the biggest slice of Apple's business. Until 2007, the company was formerly known as Apple Computer. Today, just one-tenth of company's revenue comes from computer sales. The iPad is just behind at 9 percent. Services bring in another 9 percent, that includes revenue from the iTunes store, the apps store, along with licensing and extended warranties.</p><p>The \"other\" category, with 3 percent, includes the iPod, Apple TV, Beats, and Apple accessories. Starting this quarter, \"other\" will also include Apple Watch sales.</p><p>The final and, as you can imagine, the biggest slice of the iPhone. With a new iPhone expected later this year, investors will be watching to see if demand holds up.</p><p>No one's watching closer than Gene Munster. He is one of the industry's best-known Apple analysts. He's managing director at Piper Jaffray, and he joins me now live. Gene, great to see you. So, tell me, what are you expecting? Is Apple going to ride to the rescue? We've seen the market having a little bit of a hard time, and we know how closely everyone watches for Apple.</p><p>GENE MUNSTER, MANAGING DIRECTOR, PIPER JAFFRAY: Well, we'll find out in 15 minutes. My bet is that they will come through. And I think that the unit numbers, the 49 million unit iPhone, if there's one number to focus on, that's a critical number, and I think that they're going to deliver on that, which is going to really speak to the strength of how they're gaining share with the iPhone. And so, I think they're going to come through tonight.</p><p>LAKE: I'm going to ask you about the \"other\" in a second, but it is important to talk about that. Gene, there was a time when you and I were talking, and it was all about Samsung really catching up with Apple, that maybe Apple had lost its cool, and people were not gravitating to those very expensive iPhones. We don't seem to be having that conversation that much anymore.</p><p>MUNSTER: We don't, and the reason is that they're gaining share back at the high end of the smartphone market. The low end is going to other very low-cost providers, but at the high end, the Samsung that we've talked about in the past, Apple is gaining share and growing significantly faster.</p><p>And so, I think what's happened is just this slow evolution of the iPhone, and it's just started to creep up, and now it's starting to impact the overall global market share. Keep in mind, one other quick point is that it's still small. Apple's overall market share globally is about 15 percent of the smartphone market, so there's room for it to grow.</p><p>LAKE: There is. And a lot of people talk about the fact that it's hard when you look at it, because they kind of are an integrated system. You're not talking about all these various makers who are on the Android platform. Is that ecosystem helping? And how much should we pay attention to the importance of Apple Watch as a part of that?</p><p>MUNSTER: Well, the ecosystem's definitely working, and we think of the analogy of they're just slowly turning the screw down on their competitors. And the reason is that the ability for something to work really seamless for people who are non-technical is important, and that's where they're gaining some of their share.</p><p>As far as the watch and the impact, it's going to take time. And some investors are disappointed by the uptake, it's just a few million units, a few percentage of revenue, as you talked about.</p><p>But we think if you fast forward a couple years from now when there's better apps, it's going to be a much bigger story. And that tight network or that tight connection, that ecosystem with their other Apple devices should play into the watch's favor.</p><p>LAKE: Yes. I have to tell you, Gene, I have, when we talk about it with the viewers all the time, everyone asks me about it. And everyone tells me they're thinking about buying one, they're just holding off. So, anecdotally for me, it seems to be right that there's interest. Maybe people just haven't pulled the trigger.</p><p>Gene, what about the stock price though? It's been trading near all- time highs again. What should we expect from this? Is all the good news priced in already, or are people still kind of underestimating the power of Apple?</p><p>[16:15:06] MUNSTER: Well, we talked to investors, and one of the big themes over the last nine months has been this slowdown in their revenue growth, because this last four quarters have been so strong with the new form factors, that creates a tough comparison or a tough comp.</p><p>And so, I think this setup is really good to own the stock, and the reason is that investors have factored in the negative part about these tough comps and the slowing growth, but haven't factored in the positive about them gaining shares. And the other, slow increase in profitability next year.</p><p>And so, the net of this is I think that we have $162 stock price target. The stock's at $132. We think it's a good one to own.</p><p>LAKE: All right, there you go, it's a bullish call. Gene, I know you're going to be very busy in the next couple of hours. We appreciate you catching up with us. Gene Munster for us.</p><p>MUNSTER: Thank you.</p><p>LAKE: Now, Apple stock hit Wall Street 35 years ago in December of 1980, if you can believe it. It didn't truly take off, though, until the iPod and Mac boom in the mid-2000s. Ordinary investors who bought in early and held on are now sitting on a goldmine. Our Samuel Burke met a couple that invested $17,000 in 1998. Today, they say they're millionaires.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): They say buy low, but if you were buying Apple stock in 1998, you were buying really low, under $1 a share in today's terms.</p><p>BURKE (on camera): When you first invested in Apple, how much money was your initial investment?</p><p>NING WANG, EARLY APPLE INVESTOR: We stated in 1998, $17,600. That's how we started. We didn't spend much on it. They were cheap.</p><p>BURKE: This was before the iPhone, even before the iPod. That was actually a low point for the Apple company. What made you so excited about Apple?</p><p>TING QIAN, EARLY APPLE INVESTOR: I think it's 1998, 1999, I went to the Mac Award Conference, and I saw Steve Jobs talking. And the whole thing triggered it. It's not just about the product. And they kind of sparked an interest in their business.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over): Ning Wang and his wife, Ting Qian, didn't stop buying Apple stock in 1998. They say they've invested tens of thousands in the company over the years, an investment in a stock that's up over 13,000 percent since they first bought.</p><p>BURKE (on camera): Just recently, you finally hit a million dollars in your total investment. What was that moment like?</p><p>WANG: She's more excited about that we are participating, not the money.</p><p>QIAN: Yes, not the money part.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over): Ning and Ting have sold some of their stock to buy things like a vacation home, but they say they're always held on to most of it.</p><p>BURKE (on camera): When you guys have sold stock, was it because you didn't have confidence in the products or the business?</p><p>WANG: Never. Always discipline. Discipline. The market goes up and down. You can not catch it.</p><p>BURKE: Now, Apple Watch has come out. A lot of analysts have said they don't think Apple Watch sales have been nearly as high as expected. So, is this a time for you to stop and assess and decide whether you want to cash in on some of the stock? What are you guys going to do?</p><p>QIAN: In any new first generation comes out, maybe there's a waiting time.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BURKE: Maybe there's room for improvement.</p><p>QIAN: Yes, of course.</p><p>BURKE (voice-over): So, what does the couple think about the stock today?</p><p>QIAN: I think it's time to buy.</p><p>BURKE (on camera): Time to buy?</p><p>QIAN: Yes.</p><p>WANG: More? More?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BURKE: That's news to him.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAKE: OK, we see who the lead investor is in that couple. Well now, new into CNN, we want to bring you right up to date, Microsoft and Yahoo! have revealed their results for the quarter.</p><p>Microsoft says it was the Cloud and hardware that drove its record revenues. Yahoo! says its 15 percent year-over-year growth is the best in nearly a decade. That was driven mostly by mobile video and display ads. CNN Money's Paul La Monica is here with us now to break it down, maybe keep it real.</p><p>All right, so is this -- let's start with Microsoft -- good news, or is this spin? Both of them are, of course, saying this is fantastic, but what do you think first blush? Because they are just coming out, these minutes.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN MONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT: Yes, they're just coming out. The very quick reaction, it looks like Microsoft and Yahoo! stocks are both down on this news. I think -- it was a negative day overall, so I think investors may still be conditioned to look for bad news after IBM.</p><p>Microsoft, we all knew that their hardware business was hopefully going to get a bit of a boost. The Windows 10 side of things, on the software side, you've got a refresh there. Xbox is still a strong performer for them. But mobile, they took that huge writedown from the</p><p>LAKE: Yes.</p><p>LA MONICA: -- Nokia business they acquired, that's something I think investors are still concerned about.</p><p>With Yahoo!, even though they're touting that strong growth on earnings and the success that they're finally having with mobile and display ads, earnings did miss forecasts. Investors seem to be spooked by that. But also, Yahoo!, let's be honest, it's really just, as I like to call it, Alibaba West.</p><p>LAKE: Yes.</p><p>LA MONICA: People are waiting for Marissa Mayer and more details from her about the spin-off of the remaining Alibaba shares, and that's what people want to hear about, not the core results, I think.</p><p>[16:20:01] LAKE: There -- and these are both companies that are in transition, right? They're trying to sort of reinvent themselves from what they were in the past to something new.</p><p>I want to talk about Microsoft for just a moment. That stock has really been lagging. If you want to take a punt on something, Satya Nadella trying to get some of the bad news out with that phone part of the business earlier before the earnings call and try to keep everybody's focus on that Cloud business.</p><p>It looks like if investors aren't thrilled at first, we're going to hear the conference call as well. Is it that the transition's not happening fast enough, or people just don't know if they can replace that cash cow that was Windows?</p><p>LA MONICA: Exactly. Don't get me wrong, Windows still is a cash cow, Office to a certain extent as well. But Nadella definitely focusing on the Cloud. I think that he realized that the Nokia acquisition, that was not his call, that was done under Steve Ballmer.</p><p>So he's trying to get maybe the classic sort of kitchen sink, let's really take this huge writedown, we'll do more layoffs, which is unfortunate, because Microsoft has cut a lot of jobs under Nadella. I think he's hoping that can maybe kick start this transition and get people focused on the more exciting Cloud business yet again.</p><p>To be fair, Nadella -- the stock has done well overall since he took over. Last year, it did extremely well. People were very excited, probably because he just wasn't Steve Ballmer.</p><p>LAKE: Yes.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LA MONICA: But now, the honeymoon seems to be over, and it's definitely the same case with Marissa Mayer.</p><p>LAKE: I was going to say. And we know that the honeymoon has sort of been ending for her --</p><p>LA MONICA: Been over for a while.</p><p>LAKE: -- as well. Paul, I want to ask you, we saw a pretty big drop in the Dow today. There was a lot of hope pinned on these tech companies, could they kind of revive that momentum. What's going on with the broader market? What's holding the broader market back?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, the broader market today, I mean, I don't want to get too worried about the Dow. I think what happened with the Dow is more the folly of price weighting.</p><p>LAKE: Yes.</p><p>LA MONICA: Because you had IBM and United Technologies, two companies with triple-digit stock prices, their earnings stunk.</p><p>LAKE: Yes.</p><p>LA MONICA: And that's why the Dow went down. Verizon also didn't have great numbers, it's a Dow component. But the big drop in the Dow really was about what happened at IBM and also United Technologies, which despite having \"Technologies\" in its name, isn't really --</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>LAKE: Yes, that's right.</p><p>LA MONICA: -- a technology company. Jet engines, elevators, and air conditioners.</p><p>LAKE: Yes, and there's some headwinds on that. Energy, also, which I know people are worried about the energy sector, too, so that's a drag. We'll have to see if some of these big tech companies, which are also blue chips --</p><p>LA MONICA: Right.</p><p>LAKE: -- can help swing things.</p><p>LA MONICA: Google had another all-time high.</p><p>LAKE: Right.</p><p>LA MONICA: -- the earnings --</p><p>LAKE: We're waiting for Apple, so we'll see.</p><p>LA MONICA: And Facebook next week, too. That's another all-time high today.</p><p>LAKE: There could be hope. There could be hope. We'll hang onto that. Paul, thanks so much for breaking it down for us --</p><p>LA MONICA: Thank you.</p><p>LAKE: -- those early numbers. And again, those conference calls will be happening. We'll keep an eye on them for you.</p><p>Now, after the break, Nigeria stands on the brink of economic crisis. We find out how the country's new president plans to turn that tide.</p><p>LAKE: Once held up as one of the up and coming mint economies, Nigeria has seen a reversal of its economic fortunes in recent years. The government relies on oil for about 80 percent of its revenue, so low crude prices have weighed heavily on the economy.</p><p>Earlier, CNN's Christiane Amanpour spoke exclusively to Nigeria's new president, Muhammadu Buhari. She asked him how he plans to tackle this brewing economic crisis.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MUHAMMADU BUHARI, PRESIDENT OF NIGERIA: My people, firstly, I believe, they want the security in their country to be stabilized, so that a normal life, mostly in the southern part of the country, where the militants are still sabotaging oil installations and kidnapping people and demanding ransom.</p><p>[16:25:13] And also into the country, where Boko Haram is still active. This is the main preoccupation of Nigeria now, and the real issue we're looking to solve. Nothing will work until the country is secure.</p><p>CHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN CHIEF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: What about your campaign promise to root out corruption? If they turned out that some of the guilty ones were members of your own party or your own associates, would you crack down on them, too?</p><p>BUHARI: Yes, I have to. There isn't going to be any party member or any personality that can escape justice.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Mr. President, are you disappointed that President Obama is yet again not going to Nigeria, the biggest and most economically powerful country in Africa?</p><p>BUHARI: I wouldn't say I was disappointed, but how I wished he will change his mind and go to Nigeria.</p><p>AMANPOUR: Did you ask him? Did he say he would?</p><p>BUHARI: Well, I ask him -- I will send a formal invitation.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAKE: With low oil prices causing government revenues to dry up, ordinary citizens are beginning to feel the effects. Civil servants in 23 Nigerian states have gone unpaid for months. CNN's Christian Purefoy looks at how the people of Nigeria are coping with the crisis.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHRISTIAN PUREFOY, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A small roadside mechanic outside of Lagos. Most people just drive on by. Inside is a mechanic who knows how to fix oil leaks in broken engines. But the problem is, there's one engine Obinna can't fix: Nigeria's broken oil economy.</p><p>EDWIN OBINNA, MECHANIC: When there's no oil in the vehicle, the engine can't work, because you need oil to protect its moving, very soft, easily to move. When there's no oil it won't work, iron to iron.</p><p>PUREFOY (on camera): Like Nigeria.</p><p>OBINNA: Like Nigeria. Our currency is different than other places because everywhere is very hot.</p><p>PUREFOY (voice-over): Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer, but as the price of oil has crashed, so, too, has Nigeria's economy.</p><p>The naira has fallen to record lows. International investment has stalled, and there are persistent fuel shortages across the country.</p><p>PUREFOY (on camera): Obinna's mechanic store sits beside what is probably one of the most important roads in the whole of Nigeria. It links the mega city and port of Lagos to the rest of the country.</p><p>Now, the federal government had promised to rehabilitate and expand this road. But as you can see from the potholes behind me, work has stalled. And that is simply because there's no money left to finish the job.</p><p>PUREFOY (voice-over): And energy analysts say there is no clear plan to fix the problem.</p><p>DOLAPO ONI, ENERGY ANALYST: There needs to be communication about the economic policy of the government, which is a case of saying this is how we want to drive the economy going forward. This is how we want to open the economy.</p><p>That sort of communication will give investors an idea of, OK, this is what you want to do, and this is how we fit it into your plan. And then we can start to see some forex influence back into Nigeria.</p><p>PUREFOY (on camera): Does that communication exist right now?</p><p>ONI: At the moment, no, it doesn't.</p><p>PUREFOY (voice-over): And now the problems are affecting Obinna's business.</p><p>OBINNA: Today, I'm hungry for my family, we have nothing to eat. For groceries, I can have something to do. I need money, I get it when I work.</p><p>PUREFOY: Obinna manages to start up his engine to get the truck back on the road. He hopes Nigeria's leaders will do the same with the economy soon.</p><p>Christian Purefoy, CNN, Lagos, Nigeria.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAKE: It is the moment Wall Street is waiting for: Apple's highly- anticipated results, due to be released in just a few moments.</p><p>[16:29:12] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>LAKE: Hello, I'm Maggie Lake. Coming up on the next half hour of \"Quest Means Business,\" the results are in, Apple third-quarter reports are due out any minute.</p><p>And the CEO of Eurostar tells me that a fresh wave of protests is bad news. First though, these are the top world headlines we're following for you this hour.</p><p>Funerals have taken place for the victims of Monday's bombing in Southern Turkey. Turkey's prime minister says one of the suspects has been identified and that a connection to ISIS appears likely. At least 31 people were killed when an explosion tore through a rally in the town of Suruc.</p><p>Three Spanish journalists have gone missing in Syria. The president of the Spanish Federation of Journalists says the three men were last seen nine days ago when they were working in the Aleppo region.</p><p>Two British men are being held by U.K. police on terror charges. Authorities say the pair from the town of Wootton, north of London, intended to join ISIS in Syria. As our Fred Pleitgen tells us, one of the men is also being charged with planning to attack U.S. troops on British soil.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>FREDERIK PLEITGEN, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: One of the charges against both of them was that they were plotting to go to Syria and to join ISIS there. And then one of the men, Junead Kahn, he apparently was plotting to kill American service members here in Britain, and they did offer some more details as to what they thought this plot entailed.</p><p>And apparently they were talking about a hit-and-run car style attack, or an accident style attack as they called it, where apparently he was planning to run into a U.S. service member and then kill a service member with a knife. Allegedly there was also talk of using a suicide vest as well.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>LAKE: Pope Francis has called on the United Nations to take action on human trafficking. The Pope invited 65 mayors and local politicians from around the world to a conference aimed at fighting modern-day slavery and climate change. The Pope said decisive action was needed.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>POPE FRANCIS, ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH, VIA INTERPRETER: The United Nations really needs to take a very strong position on this issue, particularly the trafficking of human beings that are caused by this environmental situation and the exploitation of people.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>LAKE: Donald Trump's presidential run continues to grab headlines. At a speech in South Carolina, the Republican candidate read out the private cell phone number of his fellow candidate Senator Lindsey Graham urging supporters to call.</p><p>Senator Graham later tweeted that he was quote, \"probably getting a new phone.\"</p><p>Major disruptions at the gateway between Britain and mainland Europe. This was the scene in the French port of Calais. Disgruntled ferry workers set tires alight on the busy highway, blocking access to the Channel tunnel terminal more than - for more than - two hours.</p><p>It is just the latest in a series of protests which have plagued Eurotunnel travelers this summer. It seems the disruptions at Calais have done little to derail Eurotunnel's biggest customer Eurostar. The train network operator which links cities like London, Paris and Brussels just reported record passenger traffic -- more than 2.8 million customers between April and June.</p><p>[16:35:03] To help it cope with demand, Eurostar is introducing its first new fleet of trains in two decades. They will enter service at the end of the year.</p><p>Earlier I caught up with the firm's CEO and asked him how much the recent protests were affecting his bottom line.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>NICOLAS PETROVIC, CEO, EUROSTAR: We suffer from the closures of the tunnel in June especially because of protestors on the line and for us it's not very good news. It's several millions of pounds off the bottom line. First of all there's a loss of revenue because not everyone can travel but also we have to compensate passengers, you know, who have to go to hotels and they've missed their train.</p><p>So for us it's really bad news and I really hope the situation will get resolved soon.</p><p>LAKE: If we look beyond the protests, just at the underlying fundamentals, what are you seeing in terms of where we are with the economy and with consumers' willingness to spend?</p><p>PETROVIC: Q2 for us was a record quarter and this is because especially the U.K. economy is now - there's a lot of confidence in the leisure market and the stirring (ph) is strong so people are, you know, they're happy to have city breaks and to spend money.</p><p>The French economy actually is also OK abzsory (ph) because the reports are not that good but we don't see that in our numbers. But really what's interesting is to see the business market both in Paris and London is extremely strong. I mean, we're coming back to the levels of 2007 or 2006, so that's pretty - that's pretty good news for us.</p><p>LAKE: It certainly is. Do you think that that kind of momentum is sustainable?</p><p>PETROVIC: Well, these days it's very difficult because literally each quarter is different and so the summer looks very good at the moment. Obviously it's mostly leisure markets because many, many Americans also coming now to Europe because the euro is weaker than it used to be. So we've got quite a few American tourists onboard which is great.</p><p>Then September/October we'll have to wait and see to and hopefully the business markets will be there to - for the comeback after the summer.</p><p>LAKE: One of the uncertainties for the business market or the headwinds is really the political wrangling we've seen in Europe. There was so much drama surrounding Greece and a lot of people are concerned about what that might mean for Britain as it considers whether it wants to stay part of the European Union.</p><p>How concerned are you about that?</p><p>PETROVIC: The Greek - the Greek debate - didn't affect business at all. We could see, and I speak to a lot of businesses, of course our customers - and they were very relaxed actually about Greece.</p><p>Now the U.K., that's a different story and we're still unsure about when, you know, the vote will take place - the referendum, but that will bring uncertainty and as the campaign hits up, it won't be very good I think for business because there was always a tendency for businesses to, I would say, to wait and see when there is a big election.</p><p>So that's the big uncertainty for next year and the year after, so that's what we need to watch closely.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>LAKE: As promised, Apple has just released its latest earnings and shares are sinking in after-hours trade. We're crunching the numbers and we'll have a lot more after the break.</p><p>[16:40:49] LAKE: Apple's highly-anticipated results are in and shares are down more than 7 percent in after-hours trade. As a result the company reported $49.6 billion in revenue. That's more than $10 billion higher than a year ago. That was driven by record iPhone and Mac sales.</p><p>CEO Tim Cook also held a successful release for the Apple Watch. Joining me now to discuss, our own Samuel Burke and Shelly Palmer, the host of \"Shelly Palmer Digital Living.\" Thank you both for being with us.</p><p>Sam, I just want to start with you because of these numbers did just come across. What are - I mean - you're talking about massive revenue, massive profit every year, but what don't - what is it that investors don't like about (inaudible)?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: The one number here that investors are not going to like is the amount of iPhones sold was just 47.5 million. If that sounds like a massive amount, well you're correct but they actually had expectations of between 48 and even a lot of people expecting 50 million iPhones. That's what's driving the stock down.</p><p>It was down about 8 percent at one point and now just about 6.5 percent.</p><p>LAKE: Right, and we're just going off headlines, and, Shelly, I have one more quick one to Samuel. Because investors - this is kind of a kneejerk reaction. China - was China the trouble spot?</p><p>BURKE: It doesn't look like it for now, at least in the preliminary looking over their press releases, China sales doubling they say. So it may not be China. It does look like it is though weaker than expected iPhone numbers.</p><p>LAKE: Right. Well so Tim Cook I'm sure is going to be asked about what exactly that's about. Shelly, is this a lot of reaction about nothing? I mean, when you look at the massive number this company is posting, the fact that according to Gene Munster they seem to be gaining market share on the high end, should we be disappointed by this?</p><p>SHELLY PALMER, HOST \"SHELLY PALMER DIGITAL LIVING\": Look, people who are caring about what the stock is doing today are going to care a lot about this. Because this is movement and if you trade movement, you're going to love today.</p><p>If you're long on Apple, you say long on Apple. They are about to break Apple television in Q4, we don't know what that's going to look like but it's going to be massive.</p><p>They have a strategy to extract the highest-end consumers in the world, give them something to aspire to, give them a platform to consume on, and they hand advertisers these consumers on a platter.</p><p>I'm sorry, that's the best strategy in the entire business. And if you sold 48 million more devices that'll do that, two thumbs up. If the stock price is going in the wrong direction - OK -</p><p>LAKE: Yes, maybe -</p><p>PALMER: -- that's the market but it has nothing to with Apple or their strategy or what's to come. So these are just people who are playing Apple games.</p><p>LAKE: Yes.</p><p>PALMER: I am very long on Apple.</p><p>LAKE: And a company that potentially might be sitting on $200 billion in cash to play with as well I think teed up (ph).</p><p>Shelly, we talked a lot - there was - there were -- questions about whether Apple had lost its way, whether it had lost its mojo, what about Tim Cook? Those sort of - that seems to be - have been silenced they seem to be.</p><p>Even if you're not sure about the Apple Watch, they seem to be sort of as you say perfecting this ecosystem and they have pricing power - even in places like China they're getting people to pay up for product.</p><p>PALMER: Look, at the end of the day the Apple Watch may and/or may not successful, I am not long on the Apple Watch. I think the Apple Watch is a horribly failed experiment. I know I'm going to be proven wrong if you'll go -</p><p>LAKE: Because I love mine, Shelly -</p><p>PALMER: -- yes, don't say anything bad about it, no no, no.</p><p>LAKE: (LAUGHTER)</p><p>PALMER: But at the end of the day, their supply chain is unmatched in the world, their strategy is unmatched in the world and their performance with respect to delivering high-end merchandise to high-end individuals - packaging those individuals for advertisers.</p><p>LAKE: Sam, I want to ask you - this is a stock that's not just important to short-term momentum professional investors. This is a stock that is widely held and matters a lot to - sort of - people's sentiment about how things are going.</p><p>BURKE: You just saw that in the report I did earlier in the show with the Chinese-American couple who started out with a few tens of thousands of dollars and they say they've turned it into millions of dollars. And you heard her say when I asked her about the Apple Watch, she said, look, it's just the first generation. They can improve and if you look back at iPad numbers, they were only 3 million in their first quarter.</p><p>We don't see Apple Watch numbers broken out in this report, yet analysts expect about $3 million. So maybe if they don't get it right this time around, maybe they'll get it right next time around.</p><p>LAKE: Did I mention I love my Apple Watch? Did I mention that, Shelly?</p><p>PALMER: You did mention you love it.</p><p>LAKE: Listen, so good for Apple. Is it good for the economy? I mean, you have all these tech companies. We talked about Microsoft doing well but laying off people. Should we feel that good if Apple's doing well or is that - is that a -</p><p>(CROSS TALK)</p><p>[16:45:06] PALMER: You know there's a macro - there's a macro question about the economy and what the ever-increasing pace of technological advancement's going to mean for white collar jobs and jobs where you're using brain power.</p><p>You know, look, the industrial revolution made - gave us - the steam engine and it amplified the value of our muscles. And a lot of people who work with their muscles got laid off and had to change jobs and now they toil the machines as opposed to be the machines.</p><p>Well, think about it - computers replace - enhance our brain ability by millions of times. People who put numbers from one column to the next, their jobs are in jeopardy. If you do things computers could do, you're in trouble. So writ large tech companies doing better.</p><p>You know, Apple doing better mean people are buying their devices and buying the ecosystem.</p><p>LAKE: Yes.</p><p>PALMER: Tech companies writ large doing better like Cloud computing - that's a whole other story, probably for another segment and another -</p><p>BURKE: Meantime time, no matter where you report on tech in the world - whether it's California or Israel, they always say they have a demand for engineers. They need computer engineers.</p><p>LAKE: Yes, so we see it go that way. One last note, Shelly - Microsoft and Apple used to compete. It doesn't even seem like these two are going after the same thing at all anymore.</p><p>PALMER: Considering what's happened to Microsoft and that phone company they bought and what they had to do with it and where Apple is, I think - you know, look - the iPhone may be down a few units this quarter but it's the star device in their lineup and probably will continue to be.</p><p>Microsoft is really doing a nice job in Cloud computing. When they get Office 365 all put together in the Cloud and Azure, they're going to have a cash cow to end all cash cows. So they're looking strong. They don't compete with Apple head to head the way that you'd think they would. They're still all enterprise, Apple still seems to feel very computer - kind of a good messaging come from both companies.</p><p>LAKE: Yes.</p><p>PALMER: Pretty strong.</p><p>LAKE: And if you look at the stock price, it may be interesting all right obviously. Thank you both. We're going to have to wait for the conference call to sort of tease out -</p><p>PALMER: That's right.</p><p>LAKE: -- a lot more detail about exactly what's going on underneath the hood. So stay tuned. Shelly Palmer and Samuel Burke - thank you to both of you.</p><p>Now Pope Francis says humanity's reckless behavior has pushed the planet to a breaking point. He's gathered some of the world's most powerful local leaders at the Vatican to push the U.N. to do something about it.</p><p>LAKE: \"Humanity cannot separate itself from the environment or see itself as something outside of it.\" Those words of Pope Francis as he takes on the issue of climate change.</p><p>Pope Francis has gathered 65 mayors from around the world for a conference at the Vatican. It's aimed at putting pressure on global leaders to adopt bold measures during climate talks in Paris later this year.</p><p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio described the Pope's message as a call to challenge corporate interests.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>BILL DE BLASIO, MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY: His Holiness challenges us. He challenges us not to be captives, not to be slavish to consumerism - as citizens to rise above it. He also challenges us not to be captive as leaders to powerful corporate interests.</p><p>Encyclical is not a call to arms, it is a call to sanity. It's a reminder that we as leaders have a sworn duty to protect. But how can we protect our people if we accept a status quo that is slowly killing our earth?</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>[16:50:01] LAKE: Norsk Hydro is known for its production of aluminum which, as it happens, is a key material in technologies like solar panels.</p><p>The company is also a big producer of renewable energy through its hydro power plant. The Norsk Hydro CEO told me how his company balances energy-intensive aluminum production with its goal to minimize the environmental footprint.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>SVEIN RICHARD BRANDTZAEG, NORSK HYDRO CEO: If you look at the total portfolio, we are quite well covered with hydro power but we would like to increase that share even more because of renewable energy because aluminum is energy-intensive metal. But saying that, we should not forget that aluminum is also a very recycling-friendly material. And when we are recycling aluminum we need only 5 percent of the original energy content to bring it back to the value chain.</p><p>So this is a big advantage for aluminum.</p><p>LAKE: It certainly is. But as you look forward, I mean, you've got to plan for the future. You have the Pope today just saying we can't separate ourselves from the environment and saying businesses need to consider the environment as much as they consider profits.</p><p>For a company that has a foot in both worlds - both traditional industry and renewable - how does that influence how you balance your business going forward?</p><p>BRANDTZAEG: We are probably one of the few metal and mining companies that have an ambition to be carbon neutral in 2020. We have an aspiration to become bigger, better and greener. And the greener aspiration is very much about the climate, also covering the total sustainability agenda for hizzel (ph).</p><p>But, as I said, we have an ambition to become carbon neutral in 2020 and we are well on the way to achieve that target.</p><p>LAKE: You managed to beat expectations despite the fact that the market still seems to be dealing with oversupply. What is your expectation for demand in the second half of this year?</p><p>BRANDTZAEG: Well we are taking down the expectation for the global demand from 6 percent to 5 percent this quarter based on the situation in the different segments of the market as we see it.</p><p>But 5 percent is still a good growth rate of aluminum consumption and we see that we have almost surprise (ph) situation today that is also affecting the prices and the premiums. But going forward, we will be very much supported by the fairly high growth rate in aluminum.</p><p>And if you compare aluminum with other materials and metals, it is among the highest speed growth rates that you can find.</p><p>LAKE: And for those who are maybe not that familiar, where is the growth for aluminum? You sort of said it's the high growth area of the market - what exactly is that?</p><p>BRANDTZAEG: Well if you look into automotive and transport, there is a strong drive to change other materials with aluminum, to reduce energy consumption and also of course reduce emissions.</p><p>So this is the main driving market segment as we see today - automotive and transport. But you also have many other segments like for example can business is seasonally very strong in the second quarter, building and construction in the U.S. market is picking up and there are also many other markets which is moving very much in a positive direction.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>LAKE: Elsewhere at the Vatican conference, the Pope called for action on human trafficking, something which CNN is shining a light on as part of our \"Freedom Project.\" In a new documentary, the actress and activist Jada Pinkett-Smith investigates modern-day slavery happening here inside the United States.</p><p>She interviews a young survivor who was sold for sex. She said she was lured in by someone she thought was her friend.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>\"SACHARAY,\" SURVIVOR: You thirsty? Is that why you're (inaudible)? You thirsty?</p><p>JADA PINKETT-SMITH, ACTRESS AND ACTIVIST: Sasha Ray was born and raised in Florida. By the time she was 14, she was constantly being teased at school.</p><p>SACHARAY: What I got picked on a lot about was being black - my really, really dark skin I guess.</p><p>PINKETT-SMITH: She felt alone at home and at school. Sasha Ray says that's why when an older classmate offered friendship, she jumped at it.</p><p>SACHARAY: I thought she was like my best friend because I could like tell her anything. One day she asked if, you know, I want to skip school and have fun you know. So we went to this barbershop. When I was there she introduced me to these guys.</p><p>PINKETT-SMITH: Sasha Ray's new \"friend\" had just led her to the man who would eventually become her trafficker.</p><p>SACHARAY: They talked about how I was going to make money, how it was going to be easy, we didn't have to depend on nobody. And it was all sounding good and stuff so I fell for it.</p><p>PINKETT-SMITH: Was there any kind of grooming process, like when this first started? Or it's just something that just happened and you - he - was just expecting you to learn on the way?</p><p>[16:55:00] SACHARAY: He slowly brought it on when we got closer, when he felt like he got closer to me. He usually did it out of the back of the barbershop. And he'd even have people that worked with the post office - mailmen - come in. Mail men came in and paid their money to him, came back there to me.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>LAKE: The \"CNN Freedom Project\" documentary premiers on Wednesday night - \"Children for Sale - the Fight to End Human Trafficking. That's at 8 p.m. London time, 9 p.m. Central Europe, only on CNN.

Hot on the heels of her World Cup success, U.S. Women's Soccer star Alex Morgan will feature alongside Lionel Messi on the cover of \"FIFA 16.\" That will be available across the United States.</p><p>In Canada, women's team captain Christine Sinclair will be on the front cover. Publisher E.A. says the game will also feature a playable woman's team for the first time. U.K. versions will still feature a male player on the cover after Liverpool's Jordan Henderson won a fan's vote.</p><p>Time for a quick reminder of how U.S. markets in the U.S. finished. A choppy day for the Dow which fell by more than 180 points. The index was dragged lower by weak performances from tech giants IBM and United Technologies.</p><p>Over in Europe, a nine-day run has come to an end. Stock markets across Europe ended in the red, ending their longest winning streak in over a year. Investor sentiment was hit by a weak set of corporate earnings and of course that sell off we saw in the U.S.</p><p>And that's \"Quest Means Business.\" I'm Maggie Lake in New York.

It means what it always means on Wall Street: when you have shares that go parabolic it attracts a huge amount of leverage from momentum players. <br/>That begets a further rally, though much of it is unrelated to fundamentals. <br/>It's just guys piling in. <br/>Then something fundamental happens--the mildest of earnings or guidance disappointments, or someone with influence writes something that says this doesn't make much sense (thank you, Goldman), and you get a selloff that accelerates. <br/>The Australian dollar is changing hands at US75.00 compared with US75.37 previously. <br/>Offshore the Aussie posted a high of US75.37 and low of US75.00; Against the yen it is 83.08(pre 83.03); euro 1.4862(pre 1.4874); British pence 1.6887 (pre 1.6942)  USD jpy changing hands at 110.31 yen (pre 110.17); On the euro it is $U1.1194(pre 1.1215) against sterling it is S1.2710(pre 1.2774) and against the USDCHF 0.9693 (pre 0.9678); CNY 5.1185 (pre 5.1228; AUD NZD 1.0443 (pre 1.0443) USD rouble 57.02 (pre 56.88). </pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RWEAUS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RWEAUS2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NSG-WH01-JCBH-F0TV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266307</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><timeReceived>8:06 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 RWE Australian Business News Pty Ltd.

In good times, that positive feedback loop pushes the Nasdaq higher, but the reverse happens when Facebook and other popular tech stocks are falling in price, says Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network.</p><p>Tech stocks now account for more than 25% of the broad Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index, with the financial stocks the next largest at nearly 15% of the index, according to S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices. And a lot of investor cash has been rushing into the popular and well-performing tech sector.</p><p>Also weighing on stock prices:</p><p>Interest rate angst</p><p>The Federal Reserve kicks off a two-day meeting on interest rates Tuesday. The nation's central bank is widely expected to hike short-term interest rates a quarter of a percentage point. But what Wall Street fears is if the Fed and its new chairman, Jerome Powell, signal that they now see four rate increases this year, one more than the three signaled in December.</p><p>\"We think we know what Powell and the Fed will do, but we are not really sure,\" McMillan says.</p><p>Trade war fears</p><p>Wall Street is also worried about the possibility of a trade war resulting from President Trump's threatened move to levy additional tariffs on trading partners, including China, beyond the import taxes he has already slapped on steel and aluminum. Fears of retaliation from countries around the globe has Wall Street worried, as an all-out trade fight is seen as a negative for both the U.S. and global economy.</p><p>\"Markets need certainty ... (but that) is being tested on many fronts,\" says Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \"With rate uncertainty and implications for tariffs on China pending ... the market may have to deal with increased volatility as it searches for clarity.\" <br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USATDY-98560335</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USATDY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RX7-9091-JC8N-K017-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8213</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"659\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Gannett Company, Inc.

The Retail Industry Leaders Association wrote to the Federal Trade Commission with the demand, emphasising the dominance they have over consumer data. The Association said Amazon raises \"clear antitrust concerns\" because of the way it amasses third-party sales data and sells its own products. The retailers could be hoping to capitalize on the growing hostility towards big tech in Washington D.C. Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1]  Some of the biggest retailers in America have thrown their weight behind antitrust investigations into Amazon and Google. </p><p>The Retail Industry Leaders Association (RILA), which counts Walmart, Target, and Best Buy among its members, wrote a 10-page letter to the Federal Trade Commission[2], saying it would be happy to assist with regulatory probes. The letter, which is dated June 30, outlines how the Association believes antitrust laws need to be adapted to accommodate big tech companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook. In doing so, they could be hoping to capitalize on the growing hostility towards big tech in Washington D.C., where work is underway to investigate if the FAANG companies are abusing their market dominance. \"Our view is that modern antitrust enforcement needs to be driven by a greater recognition that control over information can drive anticompetitive effect just as much as market power and price control,\" RILA wrote. One of the main concerns raised in the letter is to do with tech giants controlling how people search online. \"It should... be quite concerning to the Commission that Amazon and Google control the majority of all of Internet product search, and can very easily affect whether and how price and product information actually reaches customers,\" the letter said. RILA takes particular aim at Amazon for \"degrad[ing] the consumer experience on its own platform,\" and said the company \"tends to deceive consumers\" by pretending to sell directly from trusted brands, even when those brands choose to remain off the platform and their merchandise is being sold on by third-party sellers.

It can analyze data from its rivals to develop an entry plan against those sellers.\" At the end of the letter, RILA said it \"stands ready to work with the Commission.\" RILA's vice president of innovation Nicholas Ahrens reiterated this sentiment in an interview with Bloomberg[4]. \"It's pretty clear to us that the FTC and different relevant regulators should be taking a much closer look at these platform companies,\" said Ahrens. \"We are here to help.\" The retailers' letter turns up the heat on rivals like Amazon. Democratic presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren is among those to have said that Amazon's role as both marketplace and vendor is a prime reason for breaking up Jeff Bezos' company[5]. Last month, reports emerged that the FTC and the Department of Justice have divided up the big tech companies[6] between them for antitrust scrutiny.

Now, as tech companies bear the brunt of the scrutiny, the retail giant is amassing wealth \u2014 earning $514.4 billion in revenue, the most of any company on Earth, in 2018.What's happening: \"I don't think anyone is paying attention to Walmart,\" says Sally Hubbard, a director at the Open Markets Institute and a former assistant attorney general in New York's antitrust bureau. \"It's just not on people's minds because it isn't considered the way of the future. ... The government sees brick and mortar as more of a dying industry.\"But Walmart isn't going anywhere. </p><p>It has transformed into a 21st-century company that's doing everything Amazon is doing \u2014 and it's neck-and-neck with Amazon in a few high-tech areas that are considered the tech giant's home turf, like drone delivery[1] and same-day shipping.Investigators are under intense political pressure from lawmakers and consumers to do something about Big Tech, says Hubbard. But \"the political pressure just isn't there to investigate Walmart. The places where Walmart has large grocery market share are not places where policy activists live.\"Amazon is new to the U.S. grocery business, of which Walmart already owns 13%. In many parts of America, Walmart's dominance is far more pronounced. The retailer has more than 50% market share in 203 cities and towns, and more than 70% in 38 of those places, per a recent report[2] from the Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR). Many of these towns are among the most economically distressed in the nation.\"No other grocer in the history of the country has ever had this kind of market share,\" says Stacy Mitchell, co-director at ILSR, a nonprofit research and advocacy group that opposes concentrated economic power.When it comes to all U.S. retail spending[3], Walmart takes 8.9% and Amazon 6.4%. Jeff Bezos has become the American billionaire archetype. But also consider the Walton family of Walmart fortune: six members of the family have more wealth than the bottom 41% of Americans.What to watch: Not only is Walmart avoiding the antitrust spotlight, but it is also helping fuel the techlash against its competitors. The Free and Fair Markets Institute, which called itself a \"grassroots campaign\" to topple Amazon, is funded by Walmart, reports WSJ[4].Walmart is also part of the Retail Industry Leaders Association that has written to the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department with concerns that Amazon and Google stifle competition, the LA Times reports[5]. Worth noting: A major driver of the global antitrust probes into Amazon is the fact that it simultaneously operates as an e-commerce platform and an individual seller \u2014 it's the mall, but it also has its own store within the mall, in the best location. Walmart's online platform isn't nearly as powerful as Amazon's. \"When we ask sellers who are fed up with Amazon why they don't switch to Walmart.com, they say the volume just isn't there,\" Hubbard says. The bottom line: \"The fad to hate Walmart has been overshadowed,\" says Eleanor Fox, an NYU antitrust law professor.

Welcome back, everybody.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, July 17th.   Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Taking on Amazon,  Wal-Mart and Microsoft team up on a new cloud deal.  Microsoft CEO Satya  Nadella telling me in an exclusive interview why the partnership is  crucial.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SATYA NADELLA, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MICROSOFT:  Everything that we  think about, every places being digitized whether it's a retail outlet or a  hospital, a stadium, your home or your workplace is increasingly comPuting,  it's getting embedded in the real world.  And in the case of Wal-Mart is a  good example because if you think about Wal-Mart they have an amazing need  today when it comes to anything around off-line commerce but they're  increasing the momentum online.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  More of my exclusive interview with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella  straight ahead.  Earnings in focus this morning on Wall Street.  Three Dow  components reporting their second quarter ahead of the opening bell.   Johnson &amp; Johnson, Goldman Sachs, and UnitedHealth are all out.  Goldman  Sachs President David Solomon will become CEO on October 1 according to the  New York Times.  The handoff to David Solomon was expected and now we know  the date October 1 a change in leadership at Goldman Sachs.  Markets this  morning look like this, futures edging lower.  The Dow Industrials now at  the low of the morning here down about 30 points.  The S&amp;P 500 down three  and the NASDAQ down 3-/2.  This after the markets finished the day mixed  yesterday.  Take a look, Dow Industrials picked up 45 points but the S&amp;P  and the NASDAQ fractionally lower on the session.</p><p>And in Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board.  The FT-100  down nine points, the CAC quarante down 25, that's a half of a percent.   And the DAX Index in Germany down a quarter of a percent.  In Asia  overnight, mixed performances, take a look the best performer was Japan,  Nikkei Average up one-half of one percent.  Amazon prime day will under way  but it got off to a rock start outages prevented customers from making  purchases yesterday.  The fallout for the retail giant on the biggest sales  day of the year.</p><p>And it was a wild night at the Home Run Derby, Bryce Harper pulling off a  last second win at his home stadium.  We have all the highlights.  All  those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it all  down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, The Wall Street Journal global  economics editor, Jon Hilsenrath and CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey  Bell.  Great show so far guys.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good to be here.  And earnings  are doing very, very well, 19.6 percent on the S&amp;P 500.  90 percent of  companies beating the bottom line.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And revenue?  </p><p>BELL:  And revenue, 87 percent finish top line.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just for the second quarter.  </p><p>BELL:  Nine percent revenue.  </p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  The estimates are for  earnings of 26 or 27 percent, isn't it?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not second quarter.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BELL:  the numbers --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- getting better as the new numbers comes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think the earnings period gets even better for the  second quarter?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Could be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to keep watching that.  We want to look  at Microsoft which is of course is reporting earnings later this week.  It  is teaming up with Wal-Mart to take on Amazon.  The retail giant looking to  accelerate its digital transformation with the help of Microsoft's cloud  technology.  I spoke exclusively with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella for his  take on the partnership, privacy concerns facing technology today and where  Microsoft can continue to grow. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>NADELLA:  The core mission of our company really comes through in the  momentum we have.  If you think about it, we sort of describe our mission  as empowering every person in every organization on the planet to achieve  more.  In our words, our success, whatever we have of it is dependent on  our costumers succeeding in an increasingly digital world.  That's what you  see what's on the examples like Wal-Mart who's patterned deeply with us and  others.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's interesting because this announcement with Wal-Mart, a  strategic partnership, it's a digital transformation for Wal-Mart but  you're calling this a 4-1/2 trillion opportunity.  This transformation to  digital. </p><p>NADELLA:  Yes, it's actually frustration.  If we think about it for all the  success of digital technology companies on a percentage basis of the GDP,  the worldwide GDP, I think the text banned is just around five percent.  It  is expected to go to 10 percent next 10 years.  But the real question is,  what is the opportunity for the other 95 percent of GDP or the 90 percent  of the GDP.  How are they going to use the digital technology, doing some  sense digital companies in their own right.  Whether it's any retailer like  Wal-Mart or any health company, 81 across all industries is going to look  to digital technology to bring about the next level of experience  innovation or cost savings.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And for Wal-Mart, this is a critical transition as it battles  with Amazon who of course, has been incredibly aggressive in that space.   Tell me about I.T. budgets today.  Are you seeing that increase in  technology spending?  I know that there was a pretty good lift when the tax  plan first came out in anticipation of the tax cut plan but there was  worries that things have slowed down.  Are you still seeing I.T. budgets  increase and are you seeing the kind of spend that you would expect?  </p><p>NADELLA:  No, I mean, on a long-term basis, if I had to sort of look at it,  tax spend or digital spend is absolutely going to increase just because  everything that we think about every place is being digitized whether it's  a retail outlet or a hospital, a stadium, your home or your workplace is  increasing comPuting, it's getting embedded in the real world.  Every  experience is being driven by more and more A.I. capability.  So that's  what's going to keep driving more tax spend.  It's going to essentially --  I think over the world's operating expense as well as cogs are being  digitized.  And in the case of Wal-Mart is a good example because if you  think about Wal-Mart, they're having amazing lead today when it comes to  anything around off-line commerce.  But they're increasing their momentum  online.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is the priority for companies today whether big or small,  because let's not forget Microsoft is really the priority for smaller and  midcap companies as well in addition to the G.E.s and the Wal-Marts of the  world.  But is the spend priority in terms of security right now or is it  cloud?  Where would you see the priority is in terms of corporate spending?  </p><p>NADELLA:  I would say the number one priority is around productivity and  digital transformation. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Was it the tax cut plan that encouraged you to take some money  back to the U.S.?  </p><p>NADELLA:  I mean, I think we've had a pretty balanced approach.  First and  foremost we are being very aggressive spenders in R&amp;D dollars and operating  expenses right here in the United States.  And if you look at what we do,  we do (INAUDIBLE) $30 plus billion spend every year, and majority 85  percent of it is right here in the United States.  And so we continue to  bet on the organic growth and innovation but we are complementing that,  whether it's with LinkedIn or pending acquisition or GitHub or what you did  earlier with Minecraft.  We are looking for assets that can complement what  we do well and as well as dividends and buybacks.  So, we think having that  approach which is some in some sense more stable across all various  different forms and spend patterns in business cycles is important.  But at  at the end of the day what matters to us is continue to drive the  innovation and growth in this company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have been in China for a long time and I have a stat here,  someone said to me that there was expectation that 97 percent of companies  in China use Microsoft Windows and more than 90 percent do not pay for it.   You have been dealing with piracy this for a long time.  What can you tell  us about it?  </p><p>NADELLA:  I mean, I think one of the fundamental things that been -- have  been our approach in China is to be able sort of to look to how -- what do  their customers and the government there value and how do we in some sense  adapt the business models that allow us to succeed there.  I think  intellectual property needs to be protected.  I think it's China's own  interest to given that they now are big intellectual property creators  themselves to help ensure that intellectual property like software is  protected and that's something that we have a good dialogue with the  Chinese government.  And I think the voices coming out of Washington are  all good which is we want fair trade between countries.  I believe that the  next 10 years, 20 years, 30 years whatever your time frame is is going to  be defined by how the United States and China not only create an  equilibrium between themselves but also for the rest of the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, you know, China won't even admit that they're stealing our  I.P.  So how do you change that behavior?  Is there any way to stop that?  </p><p>NADELLA:  Yes.  I mean, absolutely.  I mean, first of all, for example as  we move to the cloud, you see a shift in how people acquire intellectual  property and that by itself I think is very helpful but overall, I think  every country that's going through a massive transformation internally and  socially and economically, I am of the belief that when you get to a  certain level of GDP and GDP growth, comes with it responsibility for  protecting things like intellectual property.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, most people understand the issues around China  because of that intellectual property theft but the aluminum and steel  tariffs are something different.  Are you expecting an impact as a result  of these tariffs?  </p><p>NADELLA:  You know, for us, we don't see anything today in our outlook.   The overall I think, this entire world order so to speak that we've seen is  based on a predictable model of how goods are produced and distributed and  how well you add work.  And I'm hoping that we'll come back.  I think the  President has said that what he wants is fair deals, and so I hope that as  we negotiate them that we come back to a stable environment.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Satya, obviously privacy has become the issue within the text  base and in Silicon Valley particularly after the Cambridge Analytica  scandal over at Facebook.  A lot of people are expecting a heavier hand as  it relates to technology.  Are you expecting a new round of rules or  regulations coming out of Washington and how will you adapt?  </p><p>NADELLA:  You know, privacy in my opinion is now become a human right and  that's how I think of it when it comes to our products and services.  And  the customers and consumers everywhere are going to demand it and expect it  in our products.  That's why we were very, you know, aggressive and in  terms of responding to GDPR, in terms of implementation and we don't even  think of GDP as just a one point in time regulation.  It requires an  ongoing commitment to compliance around privacy.  And I think that -- I  fully expect that more countries and more geographies including the United  States are going to take a, you know, a lead from what the Europeans have  done.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about your contract with the U.S. Immigration and  Customs enforcements.  Obviously a lot of noise around this, given the  separation of families.  I know your contract with ICE involves the legacy  mail, e-mail, calendar, messenger and documents.  Is there a potential for  using the facial recognition as well?  </p><p>NADELLA:  We have been very clear, in fact, a multiple years ago is when I  wrote about RAI principals and how we are going to make sure that A.I.  technology that we build and how it's used is always going to be driven by  set of enduring principles.  Now, one of the things that we recognize is  with A.I. technology with all the benefits comes from unintended uses.   Like bias or facial recognition.  And so therefore, we are very clear that  we will not participate in any project that is going to be against, you  know, fundamental human rights.  And in this case, what we are doing with  ICE is to support them in the core infrastructure around e-mail but we are  not at all involved in any of the facial recognition technology and their  use cases.  But more importantly we think that its' not just about a single  company having principal approach which we do but it's also having a set of  rules and regulations especially in a democracy like ours.  Instead of us  trying to govern the government, I think the legislative process should  govern the companies and their technologies and the uses.  That's what the  blog, the Brad Smith wrote last week really outlines and we in fact welcome  any regulation and any expert comedy that the legislative process creates.   And then the rules and policies that come out of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I was looking at Brad Smith's post and the truth is is we  are in sort of an uncertain term -- time.  When you look at A.I. and  machine learning, there's a balance to walk here that these things are  making our lives so much easier but at the same time people worried that it  is in fact infringing on our privacy.  There is that balance that  Microsoft, the entire tech sector has to -- has to walk.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's absolutely correct.  When it will comes to things like  security or cybersecurity, privacy in A.I., I think in all of these cases  two things need to happen.  One is  companies like us at Microsoft, we need  to take responsibility and protect privacy as a human right, ensure things  like we are doing with cybersecurity, like the Tech Accord.  I think cover  as like the Geneva Convention in the cybersecurity world.  As well as have  ethical principles that drive the development and the use of A.I.  But on  top of it, I think the governments around the world also have their role. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  As Congress plans to come up with a new solution here going  into midterm elections, what kind of a legal immigration system would you  like to see?  </p><p>NADELLA:  You know, first of all, Maria, I am a product of I think two  amazingly unique things,  American, one is American technology that reached  me where I was growing up and letting me dream the dream and American  immigration policy that then allowed me to come here, get an education and  live that dream.  So I'll always come from that personal experience to  advocate for and enlighten immigration policy that allows the -- for the  best and the brightest to come to the United States, participate in our  economy, pay taxes, create innovations that are going to make us more  competitive globally.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you finding employees that you need to put in the jobs that  you have open?  Recently we learned that there are more job openings than  actually people to fill those jobs.  </p><p>NADELLA:  I mean, I think we are seeing definitely growth is much faster  and so therefore we have always have insatiable need for new talent and  better talent.  Be definitely can employ more people but at the same time I  think this fantastic people in the right here in the schools in the United  States as well as in the industry.  So I think that yes, immigration,  policy reform is required but I would not sort of use that as only thing  that is required in order for us to continue to grow in the united states.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, final question here, Satya.  Obviously you're doing a  lot, right?  How does it feel sitting on the doorstep of a $1-trillion  market value from Microsoft right now? </p><p>NADELLA:  For us I think, Maria, is going to come down to what I said which  is how can we ensure that we stay focused on building technologies that are  relevant in helping our customers.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Satya, it's great to see you today.  Thanks so much.  And  congratulations to you.  </p><p>NADELLA:  Thank you so much, Maria.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  As we told you earlier, Goldman Sachs announced  that David Solomon will take over for Lloyd Blankfein as CEO beginning  October 1.  Nicole Petallides is on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange with details looking at the stock.  Nicole, good morning.  </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  So  it's finally official, I mean, David Solomon has been speculated to be the  succession to Lloyd Blankfein in this top role particularly after the  Goldman co-President Harvey Schwartz was out.  And so now, he is going to  take the helm on October 1st.  He will be the third Goldman CEO since it  went public in 1999.  Of course, Hank Paulson who have gone on to be  treasury secretary under George W. Bush, then Lloyd Blankfein and now David  Soloman.  Veteran investment banker will be taking over on October 1st.   Now we're also -- by the way, he's also a D.J., that was another underlying  story on his spare time which I thought was really cute in Miami, New York,  and Bahamas.  Let's take a look also at the numbers.  You can see that the  stock is down about a quarter of a percent.  They did beat on profit and  revenue.  Revenue was listed by fixed income where they're not able to make  it as the trading revenue clients are just a little spooked by the sharp  price moves and so the strength certainly with investment banking and that  was a winner.  Johnson &amp; Johnson, that is up right now after a beat strong  dollar did hurt, defending itself in the talc issues.  And last but not  least, you are seeing UnitedHealth to the downside.  The premiums missed  and also medical loss ratio missed estimates but they did raise a forecast  and did have some good numbers but a couple of misses weighing on the  stock.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Stock down almost two percent UnitedHealth.  Thank  you, Nicole.  Coming up.  Amazon prime day starts with a glitch.  Problems  with the retail giant's Web site.  Shoppers searching for deals later this  hour.  Then there is, Bryce Harper making an epic comeback.  The highlights  from last night's Home Run Derby coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Trade tensions escalating in the United States.   Filing complaints against trading partners including Canada, China, the  European Union.  This after lawsuits were filed against the U.S.  through  the World Trade Organization over the steel and aluminum tariffs.  Joining  us right now is Ian Bremmer, President of the Eurasia Group and GZERO  Media.  Ian, great to see you this morning.  </p><p>IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT, EURASIA GROUP:  Hi, Maia.  Good morning to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What progress is being made on the trade front?  Where are you  in this trade dispute whether if it would with China or our allies on  aluminum and steel?  </p><p>BREMMER:  So far, as you say, we have a dueling suits that have been put in  place with the World Trade Organization.  The the good news is that for  those that were saying that there is draft, you know, sort of order going  around from -- in the White House saying that Trump wants to withdraw the  United States from the WTO, that was never feasible in terms of Congress.   And it was never something that the Trump administration in any had a  consensus in moving towards.  They are using the WTO as the allies are, as  China is and if this ends up getting resolved by the established  multilateral trade organization over years, that's a much better place to  be than unfettered escalation on trade.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Ian, it's Dagen McDowell.   The commerce department under President Trump is studying this potential  tariff on automobile imports into the United States, maybe 20 percent,  maybe higher.  They're looking at it right now.  I believe there is a  hearing even later this week.  Do you think that just ultimately gets  tabled because again they would try to argue that it's a -- that auto  imports are risk to our national security potentially which just seems  ludicrous.  </p><p>BREMMER:  Yes.  But it seems ludicrous to make that argument for steel and  aluminum with say the Canadians but they still made it.  So, I mean, the  fact is that you have a regulation and you've got people that are looking  to find any way to press forward with a political posture that they want to  pursue.  Look, we know that when you talk to CEOs and businesspeople in the  U.S., it's not the Helsinki meeting between Trump and Putin that they're  worried about, they're worried about Trump's stance on trade.  And they  certainly believe and it's a -- it's true that if we press forward with  these automotive tariffs that you're going to see, a significant hit to  American workers, a significant hit to a lot of these American businesses. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, Kevin Brady said that, he said that that's' going  to show up in the economic numbers later this year, Jon.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, you raised Helsinki and I want to -- I want to  ask you about that.  The President goes to Europe and he calls the European  allies foes and then turns to Helsinki and has a pretty compatible  interaction with Putin.  How do you think America's European allies are  looking at that Helsinki meeting and how does that shape the way they're  going to respond to our trade stance and the challenge that the President  is putting in front of them on autos and all these other goods?  </p><p>BREMMER:  Well, look, I mean, to be clear, it was very strange when Trump  referred to the E.U. as a foe but then after that, he said China is also a  foe, Russia is also a foe.  So, the problem is that Trump clearly has a  better set of relationships personally with authoritarian leaders around  the world like Erdogan who he fist bumps at the NATO Summit in front of  everyone else.  Like Kim Jong-un, like Putin then he does with a lot of the  allies.  So obviously, the toxicity of the transatlantic relations, despite  the fact that we have much closer relationships is a problem.  On the other  side, you look at Putin, it's very clear that Trump wants a better  relationship with Putin.  It's also very clear he's not going to get one.   There is a reason why Trump spent over two hours with Putin in private and  not with his advisories.  It's not because he was worried that the advisers  were going to say something out of turn that was more hawkish.  Those  advisers don't say boo unless Trump turns to them and says Mr. Pompeo,  Mike, do you want to comment and say something, right?  The issue is they  don't agree with him.  They have a harder line policy on Russia as the  Republican Party does and they would have leaked like crazy if they were in  that room.  U.S. sanctions against Russia are still in place and there are  harder line than they were under Obama.  U.S. defense spending is up.   Trump didn't say anything on recognition of Crimea, he didn't suspend NATO  or U.S. military activities in the Baltics.  He certainly didn't say we're  going to take U.S. troops out of Syria.  So as embarrassing as yesterday  was from the perspective the of American President standing on the stage  and providing moral equivalency with President Trump -- Putin, we need to  recognize that the -- that actually U.S. policy towards Russia under the  Trump administration is likely to be harder line at the end of 2018 than it  was today. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Do you think we dial up --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a really good point.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Do you think we dial up sanctions on the Russians?  We did it  earlier this year when previous allegations of interference in our  elections came out.  Do we take these latest Mueller allegations and add to  the sanction list?  </p><p>BREMMER:  I think we do.  I think that Congress will continue to move in  that direction as we see evidence -- intelligence evidence of the Russians  engaged in the creation of more fake accounts and disinformation and  cyberattacks around the midterm elections.  Certainly in terms of  cyberattacks against American critical infrastructure which is the single  piece I was most concerned that Trump did not bring up publicly.  It's the  one that's the greatest danger in area of confrontation between the two  countries.  Congress is not backing off from that, Trump's own advisers are  not backing off unless they all resign, there's no question that's where  most of the Republican Party across the board is heading this year.  I  think we will see tougher sanctions, another round that comes down from the  Americans against Russia later this year irrespective of whether that's  what Trump wants or not.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what Jon Hilsenrath actually said earlier.  Yes.  That's  a really good point, Ian.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning, Ian.</p><p>BREMMER:  My pleasure, guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see.  Ian Bremmer there.  Coming up.  President Trump  headed to the Hill to discuss tax reform 2.0.  We'll head to Washington,  D.C. as well for all the details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, July 17th, your  top stories right now 8:31 on the east coast.  Trade tensions taking a  backseat as investors are focused on earnings season today.  Futures are  indicating a fractionally lower opening for the broader averages.  It's  going to a big week for second-quarter reports, and we've already heard  from three Dow components this morning.  In Europe, this morning, markets  are lower across the board, take a look, as you see, the FT-100 right  around even, the CAC Quarante is down a third of a percent in Paris, and  the DAX Index is down a fraction in Germany.  In Asia overnight, mixed  performances there as well.  The one best performer was Japan, Nikkei  Average up half a percent.</p><p>Amazon Prime Day starts with a glitch.

But, first, President Trump is putting  another round of tax reforms on the fast track.  Kristina Partsinevelos is  in Washington this morning with all the details.  Kristina, good morning.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.   That is Tax Reform 2.0.  That's what they're calling it.  You have some  Republicans that are going to be meeting with the President this afternoon.   What they're going to expect to some changes from the first set of tax cuts  that happened about a year ago.  What am I talking about changes?  They  were, we know, the corporate tax rate went from 35 percent to 21 percent.   We know individual tax rates changed for the vast majority of Americans.</p><p>And I'd like to highlight just two income brackets.  You have those that  made around $38,000 to about $82,000, they saw their tax bracket dropped  from 25 percent to 22 percent.  However, if you're also, you know, making a  little bit more money over $500,000, you saw your tax rate drop from 39.6  percent to 37 percent as well.  So, both sides of the income brackets --  for across the board, they did benefit from these tax cuts.  The problem is  these individual tax cuts are set to expire in 2025.  President Trump  weighed in, listen to what he had to say about these tax cuts.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're doing a phase two,  we'll be doing it probably on October, maybe a little sooner than that.   And it will be more of a middleclass.  We did a lot for the middleclass but  this will be even more aimed at the middleclass.  One of the things we're  thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20, and then, for the  most part, the rest of it would go right to the middleclass.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  And what we know is Tuesday, they want to extend these  individual tax rates, there's possibility about having universal savings  account.  There's also talk about small businesses and how small businesses  can help retirement plans, specifically, encouraging small employers to  offer retirement savings programs as well as annuities that would turn  workers' savings into a guaranteed annual income.  I know, Maria, you spoke  on Wall Street to Kevin Brady, he's the chairman of the tax rating  committee, and he also weighed in about how this could be beneficial to  future growth in the American economy.  Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R), TEXAS:  President Trump's tax cuts and reforms was  about changing the economic direction of the country for the better, 2.0 is  about changing the culture in Washington, where we don't wait 30 years  between fixing the tax code, we get better every year, we continue to lead  the rest of the world here.  And so, you're going to see, I think,  permanence of the middleclass cuts and the small business cuts will be the  centerpiece of this.  And people, I think, overlook the growth impact long  term.  That alone could help create a million and a half new jobs in  America, continue to raise paychecks significantly in the long term.  So,  that will be the centerpiece of it.  We're working with the President on  the rest of the elements of 2.0.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  So, Kevin Brady did highlight that they want to make it  permanent.  That's going to be the huge obstacle within the House because a  lot of people have discussed, how high the deficit has ballooned because of  these tax cuts.  So, they're going to need about 60 votes and a lot of even  Republicans have voiced some unease regarding this deficit.  They want to  push this forward before midterms as well.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  How do you pay for it?  The question keeps coming up.   Kristina, thank you.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kristina Partsinevelos.  Let's turn to North Korea's nuclear  ambitions hours after the Helsinki summit with Russia's President.   President Trump revealed that Vladimir Putin will help the United States  deal with North Korea and nuclear weapons.  Here's what the President told  Sean Hannity last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  You know, if look at Russia and the United States, that's 90  percent of the nuclear weapons.  And --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRUMP:  -- doing something and working on other countries.  And he also  said he wants to be very helpful with North Korea.  We're doing well with  North Korea, we have time.  There's no rush.  You know, it's been going on  for many years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me now is the former deputy defense secretary under  George W. Bush and former ambassador to Indonesia, Paul Wolfowitz.   Ambassador, good to see you this morning, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>PAUL WOLFOWITZ, FORMER UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO INDONESIA:  Nice to be  with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to what you just heard?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  Look, we've been dealing with the North Korea issue for many  years.  I thought the whole idea was to try to get it behind us then to do  it reasonably quickly.  I'm worried that we're getting now mired in this  strategic patience of waiting step-by-step and the North Koreans will  continue to extract more and more as we go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what should the President do then at this point?  I mean,  it was pretty historic that they met.  We thought that we would see more  progress.  Are we seeing progress?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  It seems to me we're not seeing progress.  If anything, things  seem to be going backward in terms of what the North Koreans are saying  when they denounce the Secretary of State as a gangster after their  meetings with him, and we're trying to pretend the meetings were fine.   There's something wrong there.  You know, in his own book, President Trump  wrote years ago that in negotiating, it's important to know when to walk  away, otherwise you start to seem desperate.  And I worry that we may be  starting to seem too eager for an agreement, and that's a bad way to get  there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's interesting.  And your thoughts on the Helsinki meeting,  and the -- and the press conference with Putin?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  Well, of course, we don't know much about the meeting except  the press conference.  But the press conference by itself is very  important.  And I hate to say this, but I think -- well, I don't hate to  say this part, Putin is a classic KGB bully, with former President Bush, he  even showed him his big Russian wolfhound and said, see, bigger, faster,  stronger than your little scotch terrier.  That's the kind of man he is,  and I think, Americans often make the mistake, and I think maybe President  Trump made this mistake, of thinking the way to improve relations with  someone like that is to be nice to them.  They just interpret that as  weakness.  </p><p>We have a lot of business to do with Russia, it's true.  We could do with a  better relationship, we could do with less close relationship between  Russia and China, but that's not come -- going to come about by having  Putin underestimate us and I'm afraid if the tone of the private meeting  was like the press conference, where Putin dismissively said, what makes  you think after Trump had said everything changed four hours ago, Putin  dismissively says, why do you think we trust one another?  It doesn't bode  well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  It reminds me, actually, Maria, of when President Kennedy met  with, I guess, he was called General Secretary at the time, Nikita  Khrushchev of the Soviet Union.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Right.</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  In Vienna in 1962, I think.  It was interpreted as Kennedy  being weak and was followed not so long afterwards by the Cuban missile  crisis.  You need to make sure he takes this deadly serious.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what do you think about the policies?  When you look at the  policies that the U.S. has put in place, as it relates to Russia, whether  it'd be sanctions, or troops, or you know, poking the Germans for having  the gas pipeline deal?  When you look at the policies versus the  appeasement that we saw onstage yesterday, they're very different, aren't  they?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  They are somewhat different.  They're not as different as they  might be, but -- I think -- I mean, part of the problem, to be fair to the  President, our President is that we're in a pretty deep hole in Syria and  in Ukraine, and it's not clear how you dig out of that hole but we do need  more pressure, and I think tougher sanctions would be appropriate.  But I  think something else we ought to be looking at is exposing what we know  about Putin's corruption which I believe goes very, very deep.  And the  U.S. Justice Department has an ability to expose that which would be a huge  pressure on Putin.  We ought to think about doing something like that in my  opinion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really interesting.  Let me -- let me move over to the border  crackdown.  The National Guard which has been part of the stepped up  immigration efforts has helped border agents arrest more than 10,000  illegal immigrants just since April.  This comes as House GOP leaders are  set to hold a vote tomorrow in support of all the Immigration and Customs  Enforcement officers and denounce the calls by Democrats to abolish the ICE  agencies.  What do you make of the democratic attempt to abolish ICE?  I  mean, obviously, that stance has quicklu fallen apart.</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  I think you've just said it right there.  We have to have  immigration enforcement, we have to have border enforcement.  I think  sometimes ICE officials may get too aggressive about keeping people out of  that treating immigrants -- or treating everyone as the illegal one whether  they are or not.  And certainly, we made, if nothing else, a mistake in  this handling of the children that we separated from their parents.  I  think we're on the way to correcting that, and I think -- I think at the  heart of this immigration issue, unfortunately, is a kind of canyon between  the two sides, of one side saying, we really don't need any border  enforcement at all, and I think that enrages most Americans who'll say,  what the heck are you talking about here?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I totally agree with that.  Let me ask you, Secretary,  look across the world for us, where do you see the biggest risks in terms  of foreign policy right now for the United States?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  You know there's a big difference between the risks right now  and the risks further in the future.  Further -- and I'm going to go  further in the future first because I think that is where China is  potentially our biggest problem, it's a huge strong country that is clearly  on an expansion in a kind of imperial mode.  And that's the reason, by the  way, in defense of trying to improve relations with Russia, to see if we  can separate the two of them, instead of having them be close buddies which  is where they are now.  But I think in terms of immediate risks, North  Korea is clearly one of the most serious ones.  And I don't think we're  making a progress with the speed that we thought we could, or that we  should be able to do.  So, I think we need to think about a tougher policy  probably with North Korea than we've had.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the tougher policy?  Like, what would be the most  important policy this President could adopt?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  Look, I think that regime is very vulnerable to economic  sanctions.  It's a miserable economy but they have to keep paying their  policemen and their guards, and when they start running out of money to do  that, I think it -- something that has to make them very nervous.  And we  went further with sanctions under this President than we have in the past,  but I think there's still a long way that we could be going.  So basically  shut them out of the international financial system and to shut down people  who are helping them like Chinese companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes, really good point.  Ambassador, it's great to see  you this morning, thanks very much for your insights.</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  You're very welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it very much.  Paul Wolfowitz joining us there.   Coming up, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is crowned the richest man alive.   Richest man in the planet.  The details on the jaw-dropping net worth of  the founder of Amazon.  Then, Bryce Harper making an epic comeback, the  highlights from last night's home run derby, coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  So, Amazon's Prime Day wasn't exactly ready for  primetime.  Deirdre Bolton is in New York City with all the details on  that.  Deirdre, hello, good morning to you.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hello, Maria, good morning.   I'm in front of Whole Foods which as you will remember, Amazon bought for  upwards of $13 billion last year, but you mentioned these glitches for  Prime Day which started yesterday at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time, yes, for about  three hours, Maria.  If you were trying to buy something, you actually  couldn't pay for it which I'm pretty sure is about the worst thing can  happen to a retailer.  Social media, you have this whole #goingaround which  was #PrimeDayFail.  But I want to let you know that statistically, it was  still a win for Amazon even in those dicey three hours, shoppers have still  spent more than 54 percent more in those first three hours than they did on  Prime Day this time last year.  So, you may wonder or for our viewers who  may wonder, what exactly is Prime Day, this is the fourth annual run at it  for Amazon, it equals Black Friday as far as the numbers go.  </p><p>Amazon has more than a million deals today, Maria, they want you to buy  Fire Stick, Echo Dot, that was the big seller last year.  They also want  you to buy groceries.  They didn't buy Whole Foods for nothing.  So, if you  show up here, if you're an Amazon Prime Member who has not yet gotten a  grocery deliver from Whole Foods, if you go today, you spend more than  $10.00, you get $10.00 off of future order and another one as well.  All of  this, glitches included, we have to say have not hurt the founder and CEO,  Jeff Bezos.  He is the world's richest man, at least measured in modern  U.S. dollars of 150 billion U.S. is his worth.  The stock is up 55 percent  this year, Maria, that has added $50 billion just to his pocket alone.  </p><p>So, he has passed Bill Gates, of course, the founder of Microsoft.  Jeff  Bezos has also passed the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, he has passed  Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.  And a lot of people somewhat critical of Jeff  Bezos saying, OK, well, how come he isn't giving more of his money away,  all of those other people that I mentioned obviously have plans in place.   But he is working on building infrastructure in space, that has been the  answer untold but that takes a lot of money.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible, Deirdre, $150 billion value -- net wealth of  Jeff Bezos.  Pretty incredible.  Deirdre, thank you, we will be watching  Amazon shares and where Bezos' wealth goes next.  Can you believe that, you  guys, $150 billion?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Here's to Varney about to weigh -- and you predicted it.  Once  again, you predicted yesterday you said it was going to be a big day, and  you've been positive on Amazon for some time.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I remember, a half century  ago, when I was brought up on the idea that if you are truly rich, you  could live on the interest from the interest from your capital.  I suspect  that Mr. Bezos can live on the interest on the interest on the interest on  the interest from his $150 billion, but I digress.  Look, I think that big  tech investors face a bit of a problem right now, can big techl keep on  scoring 30, 40 percent increases in their profits and their revenue?   That's a very tough row to hoe, but that's the situation as of now.  </p><p>If you look at Netflix, which I consider a big name technology company,  they're going to be down, what, 10, maybe 11 percent this morning because  they missed their expectations, they missed their new subscribers.  So,  there's a big question here for all of big tech, is it the end of the road  or should I buy more, or just do nothing and let it ride?  Very interesting  question today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe the expectations have to come in just a little.   When you have expectations all the way up there, hard to have any room for  error.</p><p>VARNEY:  I hate expectations.  You know what I feel about that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY:  You will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know you got a lot more on \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  Join Stuart  top of the hour at 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  But first,  Bryce Harper winning this year's home run derby.  More of the highlights  next as we head to Nationals Park in D.C.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Fireworks at the home run derby.  Hometown hero,  Bryce Harper, wowing the crowd as Washington, D.C., gets ready for  tonight's all-star game.  Connell McShane with the details from Nationals  Park.  Connell?</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, there, good morning,  Maria, kind of fun to be here in Washington talking some baseball instead  of politics for a change.  89th Major League Baseball all-star game will be  tonight on the Fox broadcast network, and the first time they've had it  here in D.C. since back in 1969 when it was the Senators, not the Nationals  playing in this city.  But as you said it, last night, a lot of fun with  the home run derby.  Let's take a look at some of the highlights, Bryce  Harper, obviously with the favorite go again given the hometown guy and he  came out dressed for the occasion with stars and stripes bandana.  But I  got to tell you, for Harper got a run from his -- for his money from the  Cubs' Kyle Schwarber.  </p><p>Now, Schwarber, the power left-handed hitter hit more than 20 home runs in  the semi-final run of the derby and then in the final, he kind of set the  pace.  He went first, did Schwarber, and he put 18 on the board.  So,  Harper knew he had to make a good run at it.  He got off to a slow start in  the final.  When Harper came up, his dad pitching too him, just couldn't  get the rhythm.  Took a time-out which you're allowed to do in the home run  derby, kind of take a deep breath, set himself, and then he really got  going on some kind of a run, and hit the game-winning home run with two  hands in the air.  The big celebration in front of the hometown crowd.  </p><p>So, sometimes that's more exciting, Maria, than the game.  We'll see how  things go tonight but I know there was a lot of buzz here in the stadium  for the derby last night.  We'll have plenty more throughout the day  (INAUDIBLE) the game is on Fox tonight, so we'll speak to some of the stars  there (INAUDIBLE) Alex Rodriguez and others, and maybe a few surprise  guests, so we'll see you throughout the day here from Nationals Park.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Awesome.  Great coverage, Connell, thanks.  We'll be tune in.   Have fun, Connell McShane.  Remember to watch the MLB All-Star game tonight  at 8:00 p.m. Eastern on Fox.  Coming up, we got final thoughts from this  all-star panel.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Lindsey Bell?</p><p>BELL:  I think Netflix -- we're getting a gift.  This is a buying  opportunity.  They're spending more on content than anyone else, and I  think they will bode guidance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Even the stock is where it is.  All right, Jon  Hilsenrath?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  9:15 we're going to get really strong data on manufacturing  sector.  10:00 a.m. we're going to have Jay Powell saying the economy is in  great shape.  Despite all of these angsts right now about what's happening  on the trade front, the economy is in pretty good shape.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sure is.  And we're going to get a 4-1/2 percent number on  GDP, you said.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  That's the estimate from the Atlanta Feds for now.  But  the reason that there is so much optimism is because those tax cuts for  corporations, they're permanent.  Regardless of what the President says or  does not say, that's something that companies can take to the banks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And today, they're going to try to come up with Tax Plan 2.0  and make the individual cuts permanent.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And maybe turn the attention to the economy and away  from what happened in Helsinki.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I'm waiting for them to do something about the deficit.  It's  nice to have those tax-cuts but we've got very good --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good luck.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  Thanks, everybody.  Great show.  Right to  Varney we go.  That'll do it for us.  Have a great day, everybody.  Here's  Stuart.  Stu?</p><p>VARNEY:  Here I am, and good morning, Maria, and good morning, everyone. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Welcome back, everybody. I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, July 17th. Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast. Taking on Amazon, Wal-Mart and Microsoft team up on a new cloud deal. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella telling me in an exclusive interview why the partnership is crucial.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SATYA NADELLA, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MICROSOFT: Everything that we think about, every places being digitized whether it's a retail outlet or a hospital, a stadium, your home or your workplace is increasingly comPuting, it's getting embedded in the real world. And in the case of Wal-Mart is a good example because if you think about Wal-Mart they have an amazing need today when it comes to anything around off-line commerce but they're increasing the momentum online.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: More of my exclusive interview with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella straight ahead. Earnings in focus this morning on Wall Street. Three Dow components reporting their second quarter ahead of the opening bell. Johnson &amp; Johnson, Goldman Sachs, and UnitedHealth are all out. Goldman Sachs President David Solomon will become CEO on October 1 according to the New York Times. The handoff to David Solomon was expected and now we know the date October 1 a change in leadership at Goldman Sachs. Markets this morning look like this, futures edging lower. The Dow Industrials now at the low of the morning here down about 30 points. The S&amp;P 500 down three and the NASDAQ down 3-/2. This after the markets finished the day mixed yesterday. Take a look, Dow Industrials picked up 45 points but the S&amp;P and the NASDAQ fractionally lower on the session.</p><p>And in Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board. The FT-100 down nine points, the CAC quarante down 25, that's a half of a percent. And the DAX Index in Germany down a quarter of a percent. In Asia overnight, mixed performances, take a look the best performer was Japan, Nikkei Average up one-half of one percent. Amazon prime day will under way but it got off to a rock start outages prevented customers from making purchases yesterday. The fallout for the retail giant on the biggest sales day of the year.</p><p>And it was a wild night at the Home Run Derby, Bryce Harper pulling off a last second win at his home stadium. We have all the highlights. All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it all down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, The Wall Street Journal global economics editor, Jon Hilsenrath and CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey Bell. Great show so far guys.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA: Good to be here. And earnings are doing very, very well, 19.6 percent on the S&amp;P 500. 90 percent of companies beating the bottom line.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And revenue?</p><p>BELL: And revenue, 87 percent finish top line.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Just for the second quarter.</p><p>BELL: Nine percent revenue.</p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: The estimates are for earnings of 26 or 27 percent, isn't it?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Not second quarter.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BELL: the numbers --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: -- getting better as the new numbers comes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you think the earnings period gets even better for the second quarter?</p><p>HILSENRATH: Could be.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We're going to keep watching that. We want to look at Microsoft which is of course is reporting earnings later this week. It is teaming up with Wal-Mart to take on Amazon. The retail giant looking to accelerate its digital transformation with the help of Microsoft's cloud technology. I spoke exclusively with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella for his take on the partnership, privacy concerns facing technology today and where Microsoft can continue to grow.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NADELLA: The core mission of our company really comes through in the momentum we have. If you think about it, we sort of describe our mission as empowering every person in every organization on the planet to achieve more. In our words, our success, whatever we have of it is dependent on our costumers succeeding in an increasingly digital world. That's what you see what's on the examples like Wal-Mart who's patterned deeply with us and others.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's interesting because this announcement with Wal-Mart, a strategic partnership, it's a digital transformation for Wal-Mart but you're calling this a 4-1/2 trillion opportunity. This transformation to digital.</p><p>NADELLA: Yes, it's actually frustration. If we think about it for all the success of digital technology companies on a percentage basis of the GDP, the worldwide GDP, I think the text banned is just around five percent. It is expected to go to 10 percent next 10 years. But the real question is, what is the opportunity for the other 95 percent of GDP or the 90 percent of the GDP. How are they going to use the digital technology, doing some sense digital companies in their own right. Whether it's any retailer like Wal-Mart or any health company, 81 across all industries is going to look to digital technology to bring about the next level of experience innovation or cost savings.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And for Wal-Mart, this is a critical transition as it battles with Amazon who of course, has been incredibly aggressive in that space. Tell me about I.T. budgets today. Are you seeing that increase in technology spending? I know that there was a pretty good lift when the tax plan first came out in anticipation of the tax cut plan but there was worries that things have slowed down. Are you still seeing I.T. budgets increase and are you seeing the kind of spend that you would expect?</p><p>NADELLA: No, I mean, on a long-term basis, if I had to sort of look at it, tax spend or digital spend is absolutely going to increase just because everything that we think about every place is being digitized whether it's a retail outlet or a hospital, a stadium, your home or your workplace is increasing comPuting, it's getting embedded in the real world. Every experience is being driven by more and more A.I. capability. So that's what's going to keep driving more tax spend. It's going to essentially -- I think over the world's operating expense as well as cogs are being digitized. And in the case of Wal-Mart is a good example because if you think about Wal-Mart, they're having amazing lead today when it comes to anything around off-line commerce. But they're increasing their momentum online.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Is the priority for companies today whether big or small, because let's not forget Microsoft is really the priority for smaller and midcap companies as well in addition to the G.E.s and the Wal-Marts of the world. But is the spend priority in terms of security right now or is it cloud? Where would you see the priority is in terms of corporate spending?</p><p>NADELLA: I would say the number one priority is around productivity and digital transformation.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Was it the tax cut plan that encouraged you to take some money back to the U.S.?</p><p>NADELLA: I mean, I think we've had a pretty balanced approach. First and foremost we are being very aggressive spenders in R&amp;D dollars and operating expenses right here in the United States. And if you look at what we do, we do (INAUDIBLE) $30 plus billion spend every year, and majority 85 percent of it is right here in the United States. And so we continue to bet on the organic growth and innovation but we are complementing that, whether it's with LinkedIn or pending acquisition or GitHub or what you did earlier with Minecraft. We are looking for assets that can complement what we do well and as well as dividends and buybacks. So, we think having that approach which is some in some sense more stable across all various different forms and spend patterns in business cycles is important. But at at the end of the day what matters to us is continue to drive the innovation and growth in this company.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You have been in China for a long time and I have a stat here, someone said to me that there was expectation that 97 percent of companies in China use Microsoft Windows and more than 90 percent do not pay for it. You have been dealing with piracy this for a long time. What can you tell us about it?</p><p>NADELLA: I mean, I think one of the fundamental things that been -- have been our approach in China is to be able sort of to look to how -- what do their customers and the government there value and how do we in some sense adapt the business models that allow us to succeed there. I think intellectual property needs to be protected. I think it's China's own interest to given that they now are big intellectual property creators themselves to help ensure that intellectual property like software is protected and that's something that we have a good dialogue with the Chinese government. And I think the voices coming out of Washington are all good which is we want fair trade between countries. I believe that the next 10 years, 20 years, 30 years whatever your time frame is is going to be defined by how the United States and China not only create an equilibrium between themselves but also for the rest of the world.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But, you know, China won't even admit that they're stealing our I.P. So how do you change that behavior? Is there any way to stop that?</p><p>NADELLA: Yes. I mean, absolutely. I mean, first of all, for example as we move to the cloud, you see a shift in how people acquire intellectual property and that by itself I think is very helpful but overall, I think every country that's going through a massive transformation internally and socially and economically, I am of the belief that when you get to a certain level of GDP and GDP growth, comes with it responsibility for protecting things like intellectual property.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I mean, most people understand the issues around China because of that intellectual property theft but the aluminum and steel tariffs are something different. Are you expecting an impact as a result of these tariffs?</p><p>NADELLA: You know, for us, we don't see anything today in our outlook. The overall I think, this entire world order so to speak that we've seen is based on a predictable model of how goods are produced and distributed and how well you add work. And I'm hoping that we'll come back. I think the President has said that what he wants is fair deals, and so I hope that as we negotiate them that we come back to a stable environment.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Satya, obviously privacy has become the issue within the text base and in Silicon Valley particularly after the Cambridge Analytica scandal over at Facebook. A lot of people are expecting a heavier hand as it relates to technology. Are you expecting a new round of rules or regulations coming out of Washington and how will you adapt?</p><p>NADELLA: You know, privacy in my opinion is now become a human right and that's how I think of it when it comes to our products and services. And the customers and consumers everywhere are going to demand it and expect it in our products. That's why we were very, you know, aggressive and in terms of responding to GDPR, in terms of implementation and we don't even think of GDP as just a one point in time regulation. It requires an ongoing commitment to compliance around privacy. And I think that -- I fully expect that more countries and more geographies including the United States are going to take a, you know, a lead from what the Europeans have done.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Let's talk about your contract with the U.S. Immigration and Customs enforcements. Obviously a lot of noise around this, given the separation of families. I know your contract with ICE involves the legacy mail, e-mail, calendar, messenger and documents. Is there a potential for using the facial recognition as well?</p><p>NADELLA: We have been very clear, in fact, a multiple years ago is when I wrote about RAI principals and how we are going to make sure that A.I. technology that we build and how it's used is always going to be driven by set of enduring principles. Now, one of the things that we recognize is with A.I. technology with all the benefits comes from unintended uses. Like bias or facial recognition. And so therefore, we are very clear that we will not participate in any project that is going to be against, you know, fundamental human rights. And in this case, what we are doing with ICE is to support them in the core infrastructure around e-mail but we are not at all involved in any of the facial recognition technology and their use cases. But more importantly we think that its' not just about a single company having principal approach which we do but it's also having a set of rules and regulations especially in a democracy like ours. Instead of us trying to govern the government, I think the legislative process should govern the companies and their technologies and the uses. That's what the blog, the Brad Smith wrote last week really outlines and we in fact welcome any regulation and any expert comedy that the legislative process creates. And then the rules and policies that come out of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. I was looking at Brad Smith's post and the truth is is we are in sort of an uncertain term -- time. When you look at A.I. and machine learning, there's a balance to walk here that these things are making our lives so much easier but at the same time people worried that it is in fact infringing on our privacy. There is that balance that Microsoft, the entire tech sector has to -- has to walk.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's absolutely correct. When it will comes to things like security or cybersecurity, privacy in A.I., I think in all of these cases two things need to happen. One is companies like us at Microsoft, we need to take responsibility and protect privacy as a human right, ensure things like we are doing with cybersecurity, like the Tech Accord. I think cover as like the Geneva Convention in the cybersecurity world. As well as have ethical principles that drive the development and the use of A.I. But on top of it, I think the governments around the world also have their role.</p><p>BARTIROMO: As Congress plans to come up with a new solution here going into midterm elections, what kind of a legal immigration system would you like to see?</p><p>NADELLA: You know, first of all, Maria, I am a product of I think two amazingly unique things, American, one is American technology that reached me where I was growing up and letting me dream the dream and American immigration policy that then allowed me to come here, get an education and live that dream. So I'll always come from that personal experience to advocate for and enlighten immigration policy that allows the -- for the best and the brightest to come to the United States, participate in our economy, pay taxes, create innovations that are going to make us more competitive globally.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you finding employees that you need to put in the jobs that you have open? Recently we learned that there are more job openings than actually people to fill those jobs.</p><p>NADELLA: I mean, I think we are seeing definitely growth is much faster and so therefore we have always have insatiable need for new talent and better talent. Be definitely can employ more people but at the same time I think this fantastic people in the right here in the schools in the United States as well as in the industry. So I think that yes, immigration, policy reform is required but I would not sort of use that as only thing that is required in order for us to continue to grow in the united states.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, final question here, Satya. Obviously you're doing a lot, right? How does it feel sitting on the doorstep of a $1-trillion market value from Microsoft right now?</p><p>NADELLA: For us I think, Maria, is going to come down to what I said which is how can we ensure that we stay focused on building technologies that are relevant in helping our customers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Satya, it's great to see you today. Thanks so much. And congratulations to you.</p><p>NADELLA: Thank you so much, Maria.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO: We'll be right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. As we told you earlier, Goldman Sachs announced that David Solomon will take over for Lloyd Blankfein as CEO beginning October 1. Nicole Petallides is on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange with details looking at the stock. Nicole, good morning.</p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Good morning, Maria. So it's finally official, I mean, David Solomon has been speculated to be the succession to Lloyd Blankfein in this top role particularly after the Goldman co-President Harvey Schwartz was out. And so now, he is going to take the helm on October 1st. He will be the third Goldman CEO since it went public in 1999. Of course, Hank Paulson who have gone on to be treasury secretary under George W. Bush, then Lloyd Blankfein and now David Soloman. Veteran investment banker will be taking over on October 1st. Now we're also -- by the way, he's also a D.J., that was another underlying story on his spare time which I thought was really cute in Miami, New York, and Bahamas. Let's take a look also at the numbers. You can see that the stock is down about a quarter of a percent. They did beat on profit and revenue. Revenue was listed by fixed income where they're not able to make it as the trading revenue clients are just a little spooked by the sharp price moves and so the strength certainly with investment banking and that was a winner. Johnson &amp; Johnson, that is up right now after a beat strong dollar did hurt, defending itself in the talc issues. And last but not least, you are seeing UnitedHealth to the downside. The premiums missed and also medical loss ratio missed estimates but they did raise a forecast and did have some good numbers but a couple of misses weighing on the stock. Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Stock down almost two percent UnitedHealth. Thank you, Nicole. Coming up. Amazon prime day starts with a glitch. Problems with the retail giant's Web site. Shoppers searching for deals later this hour. Then there is, Bryce Harper making an epic comeback. The highlights from last night's Home Run Derby coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Trade tensions escalating in the United States. Filing complaints against trading partners including Canada, China, the European Union. This after lawsuits were filed against the U.S. through the World Trade Organization over the steel and aluminum tariffs. Joining us right now is Ian Bremmer, President of the Eurasia Group and GZERO Media. Ian, great to see you this morning.</p><p>IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT, EURASIA GROUP: Hi, Maia. Good morning to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What progress is being made on the trade front? Where are you in this trade dispute whether if it would with China or our allies on aluminum and steel?</p><p>BREMMER: So far, as you say, we have a dueling suits that have been put in place with the World Trade Organization. The the good news is that for those that were saying that there is draft, you know, sort of order going around from -- in the White House saying that Trump wants to withdraw the United States from the WTO, that was never feasible in terms of Congress. And it was never something that the Trump administration in any had a consensus in moving towards. They are using the WTO as the allies are, as China is and if this ends up getting resolved by the established multilateral trade organization over years, that's a much better place to be than unfettered escalation on trade.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Ian, it's Dagen McDowell. The commerce department under President Trump is studying this potential tariff on automobile imports into the United States, maybe 20 percent, maybe higher. They're looking at it right now. I believe there is a hearing even later this week. Do you think that just ultimately gets tabled because again they would try to argue that it's a -- that auto imports are risk to our national security potentially which just seems ludicrous.</p><p>BREMMER: Yes. But it seems ludicrous to make that argument for steel and aluminum with say the Canadians but they still made it. So, I mean, the fact is that you have a regulation and you've got people that are looking to find any way to press forward with a political posture that they want to pursue. Look, we know that when you talk to CEOs and businesspeople in the U.S., it's not the Helsinki meeting between Trump and Putin that they're worried about, they're worried about Trump's stance on trade. And they certainly believe and it's a -- it's true that if we press forward with these automotive tariffs that you're going to see, a significant hit to American workers, a significant hit to a lot of these American businesses.</p><p>BARTIROMO: By the way, Kevin Brady said that, he said that that's' going to show up in the economic numbers later this year, Jon.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Well, you know, you raised Helsinki and I want to -- I want to ask you about that. The President goes to Europe and he calls the European allies foes and then turns to Helsinki and has a pretty compatible interaction with Putin. How do you think America's European allies are looking at that Helsinki meeting and how does that shape the way they're going to respond to our trade stance and the challenge that the President is putting in front of them on autos and all these other goods?</p><p>BREMMER: Well, look, I mean, to be clear, it was very strange when Trump referred to the E.U. as a foe but then after that, he said China is also a foe, Russia is also a foe. So, the problem is that Trump clearly has a better set of relationships personally with authoritarian leaders around the world like Erdogan who he fist bumps at the NATO Summit in front of everyone else. Like Kim Jong-un, like Putin then he does with a lot of the allies. So obviously, the toxicity of the transatlantic relations, despite the fact that we have much closer relationships is a problem. On the other side, you look at Putin, it's very clear that Trump wants a better relationship with Putin. It's also very clear he's not going to get one. There is a reason why Trump spent over two hours with Putin in private and not with his advisories. It's not because he was worried that the advisers were going to say something out of turn that was more hawkish. Those advisers don't say boo unless Trump turns to them and says Mr. Pompeo, Mike, do you want to comment and say something, right? The issue is they don't agree with him. They have a harder line policy on Russia as the Republican Party does and they would have leaked like crazy if they were in that room. U.S. sanctions against Russia are still in place and there are harder line than they were under Obama. U.S. defense spending is up. Trump didn't say anything on recognition of Crimea, he didn't suspend NATO or U.S. military activities in the Baltics. He certainly didn't say we're going to take U.S. troops out of Syria. So as embarrassing as yesterday was from the perspective the of American President standing on the stage and providing moral equivalency with President Trump -- Putin, we need to recognize that the -- that actually U.S. policy towards Russia under the Trump administration is likely to be harder line at the end of 2018 than it was today.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH: Do you think we dial up --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's a really good point.</p><p>HILSENRATH: Do you think we dial up sanctions on the Russians? We did it earlier this year when previous allegations of interference in our elections came out. Do we take these latest Mueller allegations and add to the sanction list?</p><p>BREMMER: I think we do. I think that Congress will continue to move in that direction as we see evidence -- intelligence evidence of the Russians engaged in the creation of more fake accounts and disinformation and cyberattacks around the midterm elections. Certainly in terms of cyberattacks against American critical infrastructure which is the single piece I was most concerned that Trump did not bring up publicly. It's the one that's the greatest danger in area of confrontation between the two countries. Congress is not backing off from that, Trump's own advisers are not backing off unless they all resign, there's no question that's where most of the Republican Party across the board is heading this year. I think we will see tougher sanctions, another round that comes down from the Americans against Russia later this year irrespective of whether that's what Trump wants or not.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's what Jon Hilsenrath actually said earlier. Yes. That's a really good point, Ian. Thanks so much for joining us this morning, Ian.</p><p>BREMMER: My pleasure, guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Good to see. Ian Bremmer there. Coming up. President Trump headed to the Hill to discuss tax reform 2.0. We'll head to Washington, D.C. as well for all the details next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, July 17th, your top stories right now 8:31 on the east coast. Trade tensions taking a backseat as investors are focused on earnings season today. Futures are indicating a fractionally lower opening for the broader averages. It's going to a big week for second-quarter reports, and we've already heard from three Dow components this morning. In Europe, this morning, markets are lower across the board, take a look, as you see, the FT-100 right around even, the CAC Quarante is down a third of a percent in Paris, and the DAX Index is down a fraction in Germany. In Asia overnight, mixed performances there as well. The one best performer was Japan, Nikkei Average up half a percent.</p><p>Amazon Prime Day starts with a glitch. Problems with the retail giant's Web site as shoppers search for deals later this hour. Plus, Jeff Bezos becomes the richest man alive. Details on the jaw-dropping net worth of the Amazon founder. And then, Bryce Harper staging an epic comeback in this year's Major League Baseball home run derby.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There it is! Centerfield, and Bryce Harper has thrown his bat in the air, and won the 2018 T-Mobile home run derby.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: More of the highlights as we head live to Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., coming up. But, first, President Trump is putting another round of tax reforms on the fast track. Kristina Partsinevelos is in Washington this morning with all the details. Kristina, good morning.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning. That is Tax Reform 2.0. That's what they're calling it. You have some Republicans that are going to be meeting with the President this afternoon. What they're going to expect to some changes from the first set of tax cuts that happened about a year ago. What am I talking about changes? They were, we know, the corporate tax rate went from 35 percent to 21 percent. We know individual tax rates changed for the vast majority of Americans.</p><p>And I'd like to highlight just two income brackets. You have those that made around $38,000 to about $82,000, they saw their tax bracket dropped from 25 percent to 22 percent. However, if you're also, you know, making a little bit more money over $500,000, you saw your tax rate drop from 39.6 percent to 37 percent as well. So, both sides of the income brackets -- for across the board, they did benefit from these tax cuts. The problem is these individual tax cuts are set to expire in 2025. President Trump weighed in, listen to what he had to say about these tax cuts.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're doing a phase two, we'll be doing it probably on October, maybe a little sooner than that. And it will be more of a middleclass. We did a lot for the middleclass but this will be even more aimed at the middleclass. One of the things we're thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20, and then, for the most part, the rest of it would go right to the middleclass.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: And what we know is Tuesday, they want to extend these individual tax rates, there's possibility about having universal savings account. There's also talk about small businesses and how small businesses can help retirement plans, specifically, encouraging small employers to offer retirement savings programs as well as annuities that would turn workers' savings into a guaranteed annual income. I know, Maria, you spoke on Wall Street to Kevin Brady, he's the chairman of the tax rating committee, and he also weighed in about how this could be beneficial to future growth in the American economy. Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R), TEXAS: President Trump's tax cuts and reforms was about changing the economic direction of the country for the better, 2.0 is about changing the culture in Washington, where we don't wait 30 years between fixing the tax code, we get better every year, we continue to lead the rest of the world here. And so, you're going to see, I think, permanence of the middleclass cuts and the small business cuts will be the centerpiece of this. And people, I think, overlook the growth impact long term. That alone could help create a million and a half new jobs in America, continue to raise paychecks significantly in the long term. So, that will be the centerpiece of it. We're working with the President on the rest of the elements of 2.0.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: So, Kevin Brady did highlight that they want to make it permanent. That's going to be the huge obstacle within the House because a lot of people have discussed, how high the deficit has ballooned because of these tax cuts. So, they're going to need about 60 votes and a lot of even Republicans have voiced some unease regarding this deficit. They want to push this forward before midterms as well. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. How do you pay for it? The question keeps coming up. Kristina, thank you.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Kristina Partsinevelos. Let's turn to North Korea's nuclear ambitions hours after the Helsinki summit with Russia's President. President Trump revealed that Vladimir Putin will help the United States deal with North Korea and nuclear weapons. Here's what the President told Sean Hannity last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>TRUMP: You know, if look at Russia and the United States, that's 90 percent of the nuclear weapons. And --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TRUMP: -- doing something and working on other countries. And he also said he wants to be very helpful with North Korea. We're doing well with North Korea, we have time. There's no rush. You know, it's been going on for many years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me now is the former deputy defense secretary under George W. Bush and former ambassador to Indonesia, Paul Wolfowitz. Ambassador, good to see you this morning, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>PAUL WOLFOWITZ, FORMER UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO INDONESIA: Nice to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Your reaction to what you just heard?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ: Look, we've been dealing with the North Korea issue for many years. I thought the whole idea was to try to get it behind us then to do it reasonably quickly. I'm worried that we're getting now mired in this strategic patience of waiting step-by-step and the North Koreans will continue to extract more and more as we go.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, what should the President do then at this point? I mean, it was pretty historic that they met. We thought that we would see more progress. Are we seeing progress?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ: It seems to me we're not seeing progress. If anything, things seem to be going backward in terms of what the North Koreans are saying when they denounce the Secretary of State as a gangster after their meetings with him, and we're trying to pretend the meetings were fine. There's something wrong there. You know, in his own book, President Trump wrote years ago that in negotiating, it's important to know when to walk away, otherwise you start to seem desperate. And I worry that we may be starting to seem too eager for an agreement, and that's a bad way to get there.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's interesting. And your thoughts on the Helsinki meeting, and the -- and the press conference with Putin?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ: Well, of course, we don't know much about the meeting except the press conference. But the press conference by itself is very important. And I hate to say this, but I think -- well, I don't hate to say this part, Putin is a classic KGB bully, with former President Bush, he even showed him his big Russian wolfhound and said, see, bigger, faster, stronger than your little scotch terrier. That's the kind of man he is, and I think, Americans often make the mistake, and I think maybe President Trump made this mistake, of thinking the way to improve relations with someone like that is to be nice to them. They just interpret that as weakness.</p><p>We have a lot of business to do with Russia, it's true. We could do with a better relationship, we could do with less close relationship between Russia and China, but that's not come -- going to come about by having Putin underestimate us and I'm afraid if the tone of the private meeting was like the press conference, where Putin dismissively said, what makes you think after Trump had said everything changed four hours ago, Putin dismissively says, why do you think we trust one another? It doesn't bode well.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>WOLFOWITZ: It reminds me, actually, Maria, of when President Kennedy met with, I guess, he was called General Secretary at the time, Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Right.</p><p>WOLFOWITZ: In Vienna in 1962, I think. It was interpreted as Kennedy being weak and was followed not so long afterwards by the Cuban missile crisis. You need to make sure he takes this deadly serious.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But what do you think about the policies? When you look at the policies that the U.S. has put in place, as it relates to Russia, whether it'd be sanctions, or troops, or you know, poking the Germans for having the gas pipeline deal? When you look at the policies versus the appeasement that we saw onstage yesterday, they're very different, aren't they?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ: They are somewhat different. They're not as different as they might be, but -- I think -- I mean, part of the problem, to be fair to the President, our President is that we're in a pretty deep hole in Syria and in Ukraine, and it's not clear how you dig out of that hole but we do need more pressure, and I think tougher sanctions would be appropriate. But I think something else we ought to be looking at is exposing what we know about Putin's corruption which I believe goes very, very deep. And the U.S. Justice Department has an ability to expose that which would be a huge pressure on Putin. We ought to think about doing something like that in my opinion.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Really interesting. Let me -- let me move over to the border crackdown. The National Guard which has been part of the stepped up immigration efforts has helped border agents arrest more than 10,000 illegal immigrants just since April. This comes as House GOP leaders are set to hold a vote tomorrow in support of all the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and denounce the calls by Democrats to abolish the ICE agencies. What do you make of the democratic attempt to abolish ICE? I mean, obviously, that stance has quicklu fallen apart.</p><p>WOLFOWITZ: I think you've just said it right there. We have to have immigration enforcement, we have to have border enforcement. I think sometimes ICE officials may get too aggressive about keeping people out of that treating immigrants -- or treating everyone as the illegal one whether they are or not. And certainly, we made, if nothing else, a mistake in this handling of the children that we separated from their parents. I think we're on the way to correcting that, and I think -- I think at the heart of this immigration issue, unfortunately, is a kind of canyon between the two sides, of one side saying, we really don't need any border enforcement at all, and I think that enrages most Americans who'll say, what the heck are you talking about here?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I totally agree with that. Let me ask you, Secretary, look across the world for us, where do you see the biggest risks in terms of foreign policy right now for the United States?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ: You know there's a big difference between the risks right now and the risks further in the future. Further -- and I'm going to go further in the future first because I think that is where China is potentially our biggest problem, it's a huge strong country that is clearly on an expansion in a kind of imperial mode. And that's the reason, by the way, in defense of trying to improve relations with Russia, to see if we can separate the two of them, instead of having them be close buddies which is where they are now. But I think in terms of immediate risks, North Korea is clearly one of the most serious ones. And I don't think we're making a progress with the speed that we thought we could, or that we should be able to do. So, I think we need to think about a tougher policy probably with North Korea than we've had.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What's the tougher policy? Like, what would be the most important policy this President could adopt?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ: Look, I think that regime is very vulnerable to economic sanctions. It's a miserable economy but they have to keep paying their policemen and their guards, and when they start running out of money to do that, I think it -- something that has to make them very nervous. And we went further with sanctions under this President than we have in the past, but I think there's still a long way that we could be going. So basically shut them out of the international financial system and to shut down people who are helping them like Chinese companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Yes, really good point. Ambassador, it's great to see you this morning, thanks very much for your insights.</p><p>WOLFOWITZ: You're very welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO: We appreciate it very much. Paul Wolfowitz joining us there. Coming up, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is crowned the richest man alive. Richest man in the planet. The details on the jaw-dropping net worth of the founder of Amazon. Then, Bryce Harper making an epic comeback, the highlights from last night's home run derby, coming up.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. So, Amazon's Prime Day wasn't exactly ready for primetime. Deirdre Bolton is in New York City with all the details on that. Deirdre, hello, good morning to you.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hello, Maria, good morning. I'm in front of Whole Foods which as you will remember, Amazon bought for upwards of $13 billion last year, but you mentioned these glitches for Prime Day which started yesterday at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time, yes, for about three hours, Maria. If you were trying to buy something, you actually couldn't pay for it which I'm pretty sure is about the worst thing can happen to a retailer. Social media, you have this whole #goingaround which was #PrimeDayFail. But I want to let you know that statistically, it was still a win for Amazon even in those dicey three hours, shoppers have still spent more than 54 percent more in those first three hours than they did on Prime Day this time last year. So, you may wonder or for our viewers who may wonder, what exactly is Prime Day, this is the fourth annual run at it for Amazon, it equals Black Friday as far as the numbers go.</p><p>Amazon has more than a million deals today, Maria, they want you to buy Fire Stick, Echo Dot, that was the big seller last year. They also want you to buy groceries. They didn't buy Whole Foods for nothing. So, if you show up here, if you're an Amazon Prime Member who has not yet gotten a grocery deliver from Whole Foods, if you go today, you spend more than $10.00, you get $10.00 off of future order and another one as well. All of this, glitches included, we have to say have not hurt the founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos. He is the world's richest man, at least measured in modern U.S. dollars of 150 billion U.S. is his worth. The stock is up 55 percent this year, Maria, that has added $50 billion just to his pocket alone.</p><p>So, he has passed Bill Gates, of course, the founder of Microsoft. Jeff Bezos has also passed the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, he has passed Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. And a lot of people somewhat critical of Jeff Bezos saying, OK, well, how come he isn't giving more of his money away, all of those other people that I mentioned obviously have plans in place. But he is working on building infrastructure in space, that has been the answer untold but that takes a lot of money. Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible, Deirdre, $150 billion value -- net wealth of Jeff Bezos. Pretty incredible. Deirdre, thank you, we will be watching Amazon shares and where Bezos' wealth goes next. Can you believe that, you guys, $150 billion?</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Here's to Varney about to weigh -- and you predicted it. Once again, you predicted yesterday you said it was going to be a big day, and you've been positive on Amazon for some time.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: I remember, a half century ago, when I was brought up on the idea that if you are truly rich, you could live on the interest from the interest from your capital. I suspect that Mr. Bezos can live on the interest on the interest on the interest on the interest from his $150 billion, but I digress. Look, I think that big tech investors face a bit of a problem right now, can big techl keep on scoring 30, 40 percent increases in their profits and their revenue? That's a very tough row to hoe, but that's the situation as of now.</p><p>If you look at Netflix, which I consider a big name technology company, they're going to be down, what, 10, maybe 11 percent this morning because they missed their expectations, they missed their new subscribers. So, there's a big question here for all of big tech, is it the end of the road or should I buy more, or just do nothing and let it ride? Very interesting question today.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, maybe the expectations have to come in just a little. When you have expectations all the way up there, hard to have any room for error.</p><p>VARNEY: I hate expectations. You know what I feel about that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY: You will.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know you got a lot more on \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\" Join Stuart top of the hour at 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA. But first, Bryce Harper winning this year's home run derby. More of the highlights next as we head to Nationals Park in D.C.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Fireworks at the home run derby. Hometown hero, Bryce Harper, wowing the crowd as Washington, D.C., gets ready for tonight's all-star game. Connell McShane with the details from Nationals Park. Connell?</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Hey, there, good morning, Maria, kind of fun to be here in Washington talking some baseball instead of politics for a change. 89th Major League Baseball all-star game will be tonight on the Fox broadcast network, and the first time they've had it here in D.C. since back in 1969 when it was the Senators, not the Nationals playing in this city. But as you said it, last night, a lot of fun with the home run derby. Let's take a look at some of the highlights, Bryce Harper, obviously with the favorite go again given the hometown guy and he came out dressed for the occasion with stars and stripes bandana. But I got to tell you, for Harper got a run from his -- for his money from the Cubs' Kyle Schwarber.</p><p>Now, Schwarber, the power left-handed hitter hit more than 20 home runs in the semi-final run of the derby and then in the final, he kind of set the pace. He went first, did Schwarber, and he put 18 on the board. So, Harper knew he had to make a good run at it. He got off to a slow start in the final. When Harper came up, his dad pitching too him, just couldn't get the rhythm. Took a time-out which you're allowed to do in the home run derby, kind of take a deep breath, set himself, and then he really got going on some kind of a run, and hit the game-winning home run with two hands in the air. The big celebration in front of the hometown crowd.</p><p>So, sometimes that's more exciting, Maria, than the game. We'll see how things go tonight but I know there was a lot of buzz here in the stadium for the derby last night. We'll have plenty more throughout the day (INAUDIBLE) the game is on Fox tonight, so we'll speak to some of the stars there (INAUDIBLE) Alex Rodriguez and others, and maybe a few surprise guests, so we'll see you throughout the day here from Nationals Park.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Awesome. Great coverage, Connell, thanks. We'll be tune in. Have fun, Connell McShane. Remember to watch the MLB All-Star game tonight at 8:00 p.m. Eastern on Fox. Coming up, we got final thoughts from this all-star panel. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Final thoughts from this all-star panel. Lindsey Bell?</p><p>BELL: I think Netflix -- we're getting a gift. This is a buying opportunity. They're spending more on content than anyone else, and I think they will bode guidance.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow. Even the stock is where it is. All right, Jon Hilsenrath?</p><p>HILSENRATH: 9:15 we're going to get really strong data on manufacturing sector. 10:00 a.m. we're going to have Jay Powell saying the economy is in great shape. Despite all of these angsts right now about what's happening on the trade front, the economy is in pretty good shape.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It sure is. And we're going to get a 4-1/2 percent number on GDP, you said.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. That's the estimate from the Atlanta Feds for now. But the reason that there is so much optimism is because those tax cuts for corporations, they're permanent. Regardless of what the President says or does not say, that's something that companies can take to the banks.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And today, they're going to try to come up with Tax Plan 2.0 and make the individual cuts permanent.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Right. And maybe turn the attention to the economy and away from what happened in Helsinki.</p><p>HILSENRATH: I'm waiting for them to do something about the deficit. It's nice to have those tax-cuts but we've got very good --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL: Good luck.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, good point. Thanks, everybody. Great show. Right to Varney we go. That'll do it for us. Have a great day, everybody. Here's Stuart. Stu?</p><p>VARNEY: Here I am, and good morning, Maria, and good morning, everyone.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2018071703cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5STW-1DR1-JB20-G0KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7729\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 17, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002LAF</classCode><className>WAL-MART STORES INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>CC00027GQ</classCode><className>JOHNSON &amp;

Microsoft CEO Satya  Nadella telling me in an exclusive interview why the partnership is  crucial.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SATYA NADELLA, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MICROSOFT:  Everything that we  think about, every places being digitized whether it's a retail outlet or a  hospital, a stadium, your home or your workplace is increasingly comPuting,  it's getting embedded in the real world.  And in the case of Wal-Mart is a  good example because if you think about Wal-Mart they have an amazing need  today when it comes to anything around off-line commerce but they're  increasing the momentum online.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  More of my exclusive interview with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella  straight ahead.  Earnings in focus this morning on Wall Street.  Three Dow  components reporting their second quarter ahead of the opening bell.   Johnson &amp; Johnson, Goldman Sachs, and UnitedHealth are all out.  Goldman  Sachs President David Solomon will become CEO on October 1 according to the  New York Times.  The handoff to David Solomon was expected and now we know  the date October 1 a change in leadership at Goldman Sachs.  Markets this  morning look like this, futures edging lower.  The Dow Industrials now at  the low of the morning here down about 30 points.  The S&amp;P 500 down three  and the NASDAQ down 3-/2.  This after the markets finished the day mixed  yesterday.  Take a look, Dow Industrials picked up 45 points but the S&amp;P  and the NASDAQ fractionally lower on the session.</p><p> And in Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board.  The FT-100  down nine points, the CAC quarante down 25, that's a half of a percent.   And the DAX Index in Germany down a quarter of a percent.  In Asia  overnight, mixed performances, take a look the best performer was Japan,  Nikkei Average up one-half of one percent.  Amazon prime day will under way  but it got off to a rock start outages prevented customers from making  purchases yesterday.  The fallout for the retail giant on the biggest sales  day of the year.</p><p> And it was a wild night at the Home Run Derby, Bryce Harper pulling off a  last second win at his home stadium.  We have all the highlights.  All  those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it all  down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, The Wall Street Journal global  economics editor, Jon Hilsenrath and CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey  Bell.  Great show so far guys.</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good to be here.  And earnings  are doing very, very well, 19.6 percent on the S&amp;P 500.  90 percent of  companies beating the bottom line.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And revenue?  </p><p> BELL:  And revenue, 87 percent finish top line.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Just for the second quarter.  </p><p> BELL:  Nine percent revenue.  </p><p> JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  The estimates are for  earnings of 26 or 27 percent, isn't it?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not second quarter.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BELL:  the numbers --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- getting better as the new numbers comes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you think the earnings period gets even better for the  second quarter?  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Could be.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to keep watching that.  We want to look  at Microsoft which is of course is reporting earnings later this week.  It  is teaming up with Wal-Mart to take on Amazon.  The retail giant looking to  accelerate its digital transformation with the help of Microsoft's cloud  technology.  I spoke exclusively with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella for his  take on the partnership, privacy concerns facing technology today and where  Microsoft can continue to grow. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> NADELLA:  The core mission of our company really comes through in the  momentum we have.  If you think about it, we sort of describe our mission  as empowering every person in every organization on the planet to achieve  more.  In our words, our success, whatever we have of it is dependent on  our costumers succeeding in an increasingly digital world.  That's what you  see what's on the examples like Wal-Mart who's patterned deeply with us and  others.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's interesting because this announcement with Wal-Mart, a  strategic partnership, it's a digital transformation for Wal-Mart but  you're calling this a 4-1/2 trillion opportunity.  This transformation to  digital. </p><p> NADELLA:  Yes, it's actually frustration.  If we think about it for all the  success of digital technology companies on a percentage basis of the GDP,  the worldwide GDP, I think the text banned is just around five percent.  It  is expected to go to 10 percent next 10 years.  But the real question is,  what is the opportunity for the other 95 percent of GDP or the 90 percent  of the GDP.  How are they going to use the digital technology, doing some  sense digital companies in their own right.  Whether it's any retailer like  Wal-Mart or any health company, 81 across all industries is going to look  to digital technology to bring about the next level of experience  innovation or cost savings.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And for Wal-Mart, this is a critical transition as it battles  with Amazon who of course, has been incredibly aggressive in that space.   Tell me about I.T. budgets today.  Are you seeing that increase in  technology spending?  I know that there was a pretty good lift when the tax  plan first came out in anticipation of the tax cut plan but there was  worries that things have slowed down.  Are you still seeing I.T. budgets  increase and are you seeing the kind of spend that you would expect?  </p><p> NADELLA:  No, I mean, on a long-term basis, if I had to sort of look at it,  tax spend or digital spend is absolutely going to increase just because  everything that we think about every place is being digitized whether it's  a retail outlet or a hospital, a stadium, your home or your workplace is  increasing comPuting, it's getting embedded in the real world.  Every  experience is being driven by more and more A.I. capability.  So that's  what's going to keep driving more tax spend.  It's going to essentially --  I think over the world's operating expense as well as cogs are being  digitized.  And in the case of Wal-Mart is a good example because if you  think about Wal-Mart, they're having amazing lead today when it comes to  anything around off-line commerce.  But they're increasing their momentum  online.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is the priority for companies today whether big or small,  because let's not forget Microsoft is really the priority for smaller and  midcap companies as well in addition to the G.E.s and the Wal-Marts of the  world.  But is the spend priority in terms of security right now or is it  cloud?  Where would you see the priority is in terms of corporate spending?  </p><p> NADELLA:  I would say the number one priority is around productivity and  digital transformation. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Was it the tax cut plan that encouraged you to take some money  back to the U.S.?  </p><p> NADELLA:  I mean, I think we've had a pretty balanced approach.  First and  foremost we are being very aggressive spenders in R&amp;D dollars and operating  expenses right here in the United States.  And if you look at what we do,  we do (INAUDIBLE) $30 plus billion spend every year, and majority 85  percent of it is right here in the United States.  And so we continue to  bet on the organic growth and innovation but we are complementing that,  whether it's with LinkedIn or pending acquisition or GitHub or what you did  earlier with Minecraft.  We are looking for assets that can complement what  we do well and as well as dividends and buybacks.  So, we think having that  approach which is some in some sense more stable across all various  different forms and spend patterns in business cycles is important.  But at  at the end of the day what matters to us is continue to drive the  innovation and growth in this company.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You have been in China for a long time and I have a stat here,  someone said to me that there was expectation that 97 percent of companies  in China use Microsoft Windows and more than 90 percent do not pay for it.   You have been dealing with piracy this for a long time.  What can you tell  us about it?  </p><p> NADELLA:  I mean, I think one of the fundamental things that been -- have  been our approach in China is to be able sort of to look to how -- what do  their customers and the government there value and how do we in some sense  adapt the business models that allow us to succeed there.  I think  intellectual property needs to be protected.  I think it's China's own  interest to given that they now are big intellectual property creators  themselves to help ensure that intellectual property like software is  protected and that's something that we have a good dialogue with the  Chinese government.  And I think the voices coming out of Washington are  all good which is we want fair trade between countries.  I believe that the  next 10 years, 20 years, 30 years whatever your time frame is is going to  be defined by how the United States and China not only create an  equilibrium between themselves but also for the rest of the world.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But, you know, China won't even admit that they're stealing our  I.P.  So how do you change that behavior?  Is there any way to stop that?  </p><p> NADELLA:  Yes.  I mean, absolutely.  I mean, first of all, for example as  we move to the cloud, you see a shift in how people acquire intellectual  property and that by itself I think is very helpful but overall, I think  every country that's going through a massive transformation internally and  socially and economically, I am of the belief that when you get to a  certain level of GDP and GDP growth, comes with it responsibility for  protecting things like intellectual property.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, most people understand the issues around China  because of that intellectual property theft but the aluminum and steel  tariffs are something different.  Are you expecting an impact as a result  of these tariffs?  </p><p> NADELLA:  You know, for us, we don't see anything today in our outlook.   The overall I think, this entire world order so to speak that we've seen is  based on a predictable model of how goods are produced and distributed and  how well you add work.  And I'm hoping that we'll come back.  I think the  President has said that what he wants is fair deals, and so I hope that as  we negotiate them that we come back to a stable environment.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Satya, obviously privacy has become the issue within the text  base and in Silicon Valley particularly after the Cambridge Analytica  scandal over at Facebook.  A lot of people are expecting a heavier hand as  it relates to technology.  Are you expecting a new round of rules or  regulations coming out of Washington and how will you adapt?  </p><p> NADELLA:  You know, privacy in my opinion is now become a human right and  that's how I think of it when it comes to our products and services.  And  the customers and consumers everywhere are going to demand it and expect it  in our products.  That's why we were very, you know, aggressive and in  terms of responding to GDPR, in terms of implementation and we don't even  think of GDP as just a one point in time regulation.  It requires an  ongoing commitment to compliance around privacy.  And I think that -- I  fully expect that more countries and more geographies including the United  States are going to take a, you know, a lead from what the Europeans have  done.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about your contract with the U.S. Immigration and  Customs enforcements.  Obviously a lot of noise around this, given the  separation of families.  I know your contract with ICE involves the legacy  mail, e-mail, calendar, messenger and documents.  Is there a potential for  using the facial recognition as well?  </p><p> NADELLA:  We have been very clear, in fact, a multiple years ago is when I  wrote about RAI principals and how we are going to make sure that A.I.  technology that we build and how it's used is always going to be driven by  set of enduring principles.  Now, one of the things that we recognize is  with A.I. technology with all the benefits comes from unintended uses.   Like bias or facial recognition.  And so therefore, we are very clear that  we will not participate in any project that is going to be against, you  know, fundamental human rights.  And in this case, what we are doing with  ICE is to support them in the core infrastructure around e-mail but we are  not at all involved in any of the facial recognition technology and their  use cases.  But more importantly we think that its' not just about a single  company having principal approach which we do but it's also having a set of  rules and regulations especially in a democracy like ours.  Instead of us  trying to govern the government, I think the legislative process should  govern the companies and their technologies and the uses.  That's what the  blog, the Brad Smith wrote last week really outlines and we in fact welcome  any regulation and any expert comedy that the legislative process creates.   And then the rules and policies that come out of it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I was looking at Brad Smith's post and the truth is is we  are in sort of an uncertain term -- time.  When you look at A.I. and  machine learning, there's a balance to walk here that these things are  making our lives so much easier but at the same time people worried that it  is in fact infringing on our privacy.  There is that balance that  Microsoft, the entire tech sector has to -- has to walk.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's absolutely correct.  When it will comes to things like  security or cybersecurity, privacy in A.I., I think in all of these cases  two things need to happen.  One is  companies like us at Microsoft, we need  to take responsibility and protect privacy as a human right, ensure things  like we are doing with cybersecurity, like the Tech Accord.  I think cover  as like the Geneva Convention in the cybersecurity world.  As well as have  ethical principles that drive the development and the use of A.I.  But on  top of it, I think the governments around the world also have their role. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  As Congress plans to come up with a new solution here going  into midterm elections, what kind of a legal immigration system would you  like to see?  </p><p> NADELLA:  You know, first of all, Maria, I am a product of I think two  amazingly unique things,  American, one is American technology that reached  me where I was growing up and letting me dream the dream and American  immigration policy that then allowed me to come here, get an education and  live that dream.  So I'll always come from that personal experience to  advocate for and enlighten immigration policy that allows the -- for the  best and the brightest to come to the United States, participate in our  economy, pay taxes, create innovations that are going to make us more  competitive globally.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you finding employees that you need to put in the jobs that  you have open?  Recently we learned that there are more job openings than  actually people to fill those jobs.  </p><p> NADELLA:  I mean, I think we are seeing definitely growth is much faster  and so therefore we have always have insatiable need for new talent and  better talent.  Be definitely can employ more people but at the same time I  think this fantastic people in the right here in the schools in the United  States as well as in the industry.  So I think that yes, immigration,  policy reform is required but I would not sort of use that as only thing  that is required in order for us to continue to grow in the united states.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, final question here, Satya.  Obviously you're doing a  lot, right?  How does it feel sitting on the doorstep of a $1-trillion  market value from Microsoft right now? </p><p> NADELLA:  For us I think, Maria, is going to come down to what I said which  is how can we ensure that we stay focused on building technologies that are  relevant in helping our customers.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Satya, it's great to see you today.  Thanks so much.  And  congratulations to you.  </p><p> NADELLA:  Thank you so much, Maria.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>  BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  As we told you earlier, Goldman Sachs announced  that David Solomon will take over for Lloyd Blankfein as CEO beginning  October 1.  Nicole Petallides is on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange with details looking at the stock.  Nicole, good morning.  </p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  So  it's finally official, I mean, David Solomon has been speculated to be the  succession to Lloyd Blankfein in this top role particularly after the  Goldman co-President Harvey Schwartz was out.  And so now, he is going to  take the helm on October 1st.  He will be the third Goldman CEO since it  went public in 1999.  Of course, Hank Paulson who have gone on to be  treasury secretary under George W. Bush, then Lloyd Blankfein and now David  Soloman.  Veteran investment banker will be taking over on October 1st.   Now we're also -- by the way, he's also a D.J., that was another underlying  story on his spare time which I thought was really cute in Miami, New York,  and Bahamas.  Let's take a look also at the numbers.  You can see that the  stock is down about a quarter of a percent.  They did beat on profit and  revenue.  Revenue was listed by fixed income where they're not able to make  it as the trading revenue clients are just a little spooked by the sharp  price moves and so the strength certainly with investment banking and that  was a winner.  Johnson &amp; Johnson, that is up right now after a beat strong  dollar did hurt, defending itself in the talc issues.  And last but not  least, you are seeing UnitedHealth to the downside.  The premiums missed  and also medical loss ratio missed estimates but they did raise a forecast  and did have some good numbers but a couple of misses weighing on the  stock.  Back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Stock down almost two percent UnitedHealth.  Thank  you, Nicole.  Coming up.  Amazon prime day starts with a glitch.  Problems  with the retail giant's Web site.  Shoppers searching for deals later this  hour.  Then there is, Bryce Harper making an epic comeback.  The highlights  from last night's Home Run Derby coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Trade tensions escalating in the United States.   Filing complaints against trading partners including Canada, China, the  European Union.  This after lawsuits were filed against the U.S.  through  the World Trade Organization over the steel and aluminum tariffs.  Joining  us right now is Ian Bremmer, President of the Eurasia Group and GZERO  Media.  Ian, great to see you this morning.  </p><p> IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT, EURASIA GROUP:  Hi, Maia.  Good morning to you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What progress is being made on the trade front?  Where are you  in this trade dispute whether if it would with China or our allies on  aluminum and steel?  </p><p> BREMMER:  So far, as you say, we have a dueling suits that have been put in  place with the World Trade Organization.  The the good news is that for  those that were saying that there is draft, you know, sort of order going  around from -- in the White House saying that Trump wants to withdraw the  United States from the WTO, that was never feasible in terms of Congress.   And it was never something that the Trump administration in any had a  consensus in moving towards.  They are using the WTO as the allies are, as  China is and if this ends up getting resolved by the established  multilateral trade organization over years, that's a much better place to  be than unfettered escalation on trade.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Ian, it's Dagen McDowell.   The commerce department under President Trump is studying this potential  tariff on automobile imports into the United States, maybe 20 percent,  maybe higher.  They're looking at it right now.  I believe there is a  hearing even later this week.  Do you think that just ultimately gets  tabled because again they would try to argue that it's a -- that auto  imports are risk to our national security potentially which just seems  ludicrous.  </p><p> BREMMER:  Yes.  But it seems ludicrous to make that argument for steel and  aluminum with say the Canadians but they still made it.  So, I mean, the  fact is that you have a regulation and you've got people that are looking  to find any way to press forward with a political posture that they want to  pursue.  Look, we know that when you talk to CEOs and businesspeople in the  U.S., it's not the Helsinki meeting between Trump and Putin that they're  worried about, they're worried about Trump's stance on trade.  And they  certainly believe and it's a -- it's true that if we press forward with  these automotive tariffs that you're going to see, a significant hit to  American workers, a significant hit to a lot of these American businesses. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  By the way, Kevin Brady said that, he said that that's' going  to show up in the economic numbers later this year, Jon.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, you raised Helsinki and I want to -- I want to  ask you about that.  The President goes to Europe and he calls the European  allies foes and then turns to Helsinki and has a pretty compatible  interaction with Putin.  How do you think America's European allies are  looking at that Helsinki meeting and how does that shape the way they're  going to respond to our trade stance and the challenge that the President  is putting in front of them on autos and all these other goods?  </p><p> BREMMER:  Well, look, I mean, to be clear, it was very strange when Trump  referred to the E.U. as a foe but then after that, he said China is also a  foe, Russia is also a foe.  So, the problem is that Trump clearly has a  better set of relationships personally with authoritarian leaders around  the world like Erdogan who he fist bumps at the NATO Summit in front of  everyone else.  Like Kim Jong-un, like Putin then he does with a lot of the  allies.  So obviously, the toxicity of the transatlantic relations, despite  the fact that we have much closer relationships is a problem.  On the other  side, you look at Putin, it's very clear that Trump wants a better  relationship with Putin.  It's also very clear he's not going to get one.   There is a reason why Trump spent over two hours with Putin in private and  not with his advisories.  It's not because he was worried that the advisers  were going to say something out of turn that was more hawkish.  Those  advisers don't say boo unless Trump turns to them and says Mr. Pompeo,  Mike, do you want to comment and say something, right?  The issue is they  don't agree with him.  They have a harder line policy on Russia as the  Republican Party does and they would have leaked like crazy if they were in  that room.  U.S. sanctions against Russia are still in place and there are  harder line than they were under Obama.  U.S. defense spending is up.   Trump didn't say anything on recognition of Crimea, he didn't suspend NATO  or U.S. military activities in the Baltics.  He certainly didn't say we're  going to take U.S. troops out of Syria.  So as embarrassing as yesterday  was from the perspective the of American President standing on the stage  and providing moral equivalency with President Trump -- Putin, we need to  recognize that the -- that actually U.S. policy towards Russia under the  Trump administration is likely to be harder line at the end of 2018 than it  was today. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Do you think we dial up --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a really good point.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Do you think we dial up sanctions on the Russians?  We did it  earlier this year when previous allegations of interference in our  elections came out.  Do we take these latest Mueller allegations and add to  the sanction list?  </p><p> BREMMER:  I think we do.  I think that Congress will continue to move in  that direction as we see evidence -- intelligence evidence of the Russians  engaged in the creation of more fake accounts and disinformation and  cyberattacks around the midterm elections.  Certainly in terms of  cyberattacks against American critical infrastructure which is the single  piece I was most concerned that Trump did not bring up publicly.  It's the  one that's the greatest danger in area of confrontation between the two  countries.  Congress is not backing off from that, Trump's own advisers are  not backing off unless they all resign, there's no question that's where  most of the Republican Party across the board is heading this year.  I  think we will see tougher sanctions, another round that comes down from the  Americans against Russia later this year irrespective of whether that's  what Trump wants or not.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what Jon Hilsenrath actually said earlier.  Yes.  That's  a really good point, Ian.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning, Ian.</p><p> BREMMER:  My pleasure, guys.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good to see.  Ian Bremmer there.  Coming up.  President Trump  headed to the Hill to discuss tax reform 2.0.  We'll head to Washington,  D.C. as well for all the details next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, July 17th, your  top stories right now 8:31 on the east coast.  Trade tensions taking a  backseat as investors are focused on earnings season today.  Futures are  indicating a fractionally lower opening for the broader averages.  It's  going to a big week for second-quarter reports, and we've already heard  from three Dow components this morning.  In Europe, this morning, markets  are lower across the board, take a look, as you see, the FT-100 right  around even, the CAC Quarante is down a third of a percent in Paris, and  the DAX Index is down a fraction in Germany.  In Asia overnight, mixed  performances there as well.  The one best performer was Japan, Nikkei  Average up half a percent.</p><p>Amazon Prime Day starts with a glitch.

Centerfield, and Bryce Harper has thrown  his bat in the air, and won the 2018 T-Mobile home run derby.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  More of the highlights as we head live to Nationals Park in  Washington, D.C., coming up.  But, first, President Trump is putting  another round of tax reforms on the fast track.  Kristina Partsinevelos is  in Washington this morning with all the details.  Kristina, good morning.</p><p> KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.   That is Tax Reform 2.0.  That's what they're calling it.  You have some  Republicans that are going to be meeting with the President this afternoon.   What they're going to expect to some changes from the first set of tax cuts  that happened about a year ago.  What am I talking about changes?  They  were, we know, the corporate tax rate went from 35 percent to 21 percent.   We know individual tax rates changed for the vast majority of Americans.</p><p> And I'd like to highlight just two income brackets.  You have those that  made around $38,000 to about $82,000, they saw their tax bracket dropped  from 25 percent to 22 percent.  However, if you're also, you know, making a  little bit more money over $500,000, you saw your tax rate drop from 39.6  percent to 37 percent as well.  So, both sides of the income brackets --  for across the board, they did benefit from these tax cuts.  The problem is  these individual tax cuts are set to expire in 2025.  President Trump  weighed in, listen to what he had to say about these tax cuts.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're doing a phase two,  we'll be doing it probably on October, maybe a little sooner than that.   And it will be more of a middleclass.  We did a lot for the middleclass but  this will be even more aimed at the middleclass.  One of the things we're  thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20, and then, for the  most part, the rest of it would go right to the middleclass.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  And what we know is Tuesday, they want to extend these  individual tax rates, there's possibility about having universal savings  account.  There's also talk about small businesses and how small businesses  can help retirement plans, specifically, encouraging small employers to  offer retirement savings programs as well as annuities that would turn  workers' savings into a guaranteed annual income.  I know, Maria, you spoke  on Wall Street to Kevin Brady, he's the chairman of the tax rating  committee, and he also weighed in about how this could be beneficial to  future growth in the American economy.  Listen in.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> REP. KEVIN BRADY (R), TEXAS:  President Trump's tax cuts and reforms was  about changing the economic direction of the country for the better, 2.0 is  about changing the culture in Washington, where we don't wait 30 years  between fixing the tax code, we get better every year, we continue to lead  the rest of the world here.  And so, you're going to see, I think,  permanence of the middleclass cuts and the small business cuts will be the  centerpiece of this.  And people, I think, overlook the growth impact long  term.  That alone could help create a million and a half new jobs in  America, continue to raise paychecks significantly in the long term.  So,  that will be the centerpiece of it.  We're working with the President on  the rest of the elements of 2.0.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  So, Kevin Brady did highlight that they want to make it  permanent.  That's going to be the huge obstacle within the House because a  lot of people have discussed, how high the deficit has ballooned because of  these tax cuts.  So, they're going to need about 60 votes and a lot of even  Republicans have voiced some unease regarding this deficit.  They want to  push this forward before midterms as well.  Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  How do you pay for it?  The question keeps coming up.   Kristina, thank you.  </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Kristina Partsinevelos.  Let's turn to North Korea's nuclear  ambitions hours after the Helsinki summit with Russia's President.   President Trump revealed that Vladimir Putin will help the United States  deal with North Korea and nuclear weapons.  Here's what the President told  Sean Hannity last night.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  You know, if look at Russia and the United States, that's 90  percent of the nuclear weapons.  And --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> TRUMP:  -- doing something and working on other countries.  And he also  said he wants to be very helpful with North Korea.  We're doing well with  North Korea, we have time.  There's no rush.  You know, it's been going on  for many years.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me now is the former deputy defense secretary under  George W. Bush and former ambassador to Indonesia, Paul Wolfowitz.   Ambassador, good to see you this morning, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p> PAUL WOLFOWITZ, FORMER UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO INDONESIA:  Nice to be  with you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to what you just heard?</p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  Look, we've been dealing with the North Korea issue for many  years.  I thought the whole idea was to try to get it behind us then to do  it reasonably quickly.  I'm worried that we're getting now mired in this  strategic patience of waiting step-by-step and the North Koreans will  continue to extract more and more as we go.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, what should the President do then at this point?  I mean,  it was pretty historic that they met.  We thought that we would see more  progress.  Are we seeing progress?</p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  It seems to me we're not seeing progress.  If anything, things  seem to be going backward in terms of what the North Koreans are saying  when they denounce the Secretary of State as a gangster after their  meetings with him, and we're trying to pretend the meetings were fine.   There's something wrong there.  You know, in his own book, President Trump  wrote years ago that in negotiating, it's important to know when to walk  away, otherwise you start to seem desperate.  And I worry that we may be  starting to seem too eager for an agreement, and that's a bad way to get  there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's interesting.  And your thoughts on the Helsinki meeting,  and the -- and the press conference with Putin?</p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  Well, of course, we don't know much about the meeting except  the press conference.  But the press conference by itself is very  important.  And I hate to say this, but I think -- well, I don't hate to  say this part, Putin is a classic KGB bully, with former President Bush, he  even showed him his big Russian wolfhound and said, see, bigger, faster,  stronger than your little scotch terrier.  That's the kind of man he is,  and I think, Americans often make the mistake, and I think maybe President  Trump made this mistake, of thinking the way to improve relations with  someone like that is to be nice to them.  They just interpret that as  weakness.  </p><p> We have a lot of business to do with Russia, it's true.  We could do with a  better relationship, we could do with less close relationship between  Russia and China, but that's not come -- going to come about by having  Putin underestimate us and I'm afraid if the tone of the private meeting  was like the press conference, where Putin dismissively said, what makes  you think after Trump had said everything changed four hours ago, Putin  dismissively says, why do you think we trust one another?  It doesn't bode  well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  It reminds me, actually, Maria, of when President Kennedy met  with, I guess, he was called General Secretary at the time, Nikita  Khrushchev of the Soviet Union.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Right.</p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  In Vienna in 1962, I think.  It was interpreted as Kennedy  being weak and was followed not so long afterwards by the Cuban missile  crisis.  You need to make sure he takes this deadly serious.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But what do you think about the policies?  When you look at the  policies that the U.S. has put in place, as it relates to Russia, whether  it'd be sanctions, or troops, or you know, poking the Germans for having  the gas pipeline deal?  When you look at the policies versus the  appeasement that we saw onstage yesterday, they're very different, aren't  they?</p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  They are somewhat different.  They're not as different as they  might be, but -- I think -- I mean, part of the problem, to be fair to the  President, our President is that we're in a pretty deep hole in Syria and  in Ukraine, and it's not clear how you dig out of that hole but we do need  more pressure, and I think tougher sanctions would be appropriate.  But I  think something else we ought to be looking at is exposing what we know  about Putin's corruption which I believe goes very, very deep.  And the  U.S. Justice Department has an ability to expose that which would be a huge  pressure on Putin.  We ought to think about doing something like that in my  opinion.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really interesting.  Let me -- let me move over to the border  crackdown.  The National Guard which has been part of the stepped up  immigration efforts has helped border agents arrest more than 10,000  illegal immigrants just since April.  This comes as House GOP leaders are  set to hold a vote tomorrow in support of all the Immigration and Customs  Enforcement officers and denounce the calls by Democrats to abolish the ICE  agencies.  What do you make of the democratic attempt to abolish ICE?  I  mean, obviously, that stance has quicklu fallen apart.</p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  I think you've just said it right there.  We have to have  immigration enforcement, we have to have border enforcement.  I think  sometimes ICE officials may get too aggressive about keeping people out of  that treating immigrants -- or treating everyone as the illegal one whether  they are or not.  And certainly, we made, if nothing else, a mistake in  this handling of the children that we separated from their parents.  I  think we're on the way to correcting that, and I think -- I think at the  heart of this immigration issue, unfortunately, is a kind of canyon between  the two sides, of one side saying, we really don't need any border  enforcement at all, and I think that enrages most Americans who'll say,  what the heck are you talking about here?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I totally agree with that.  Let me ask you, Secretary,  look across the world for us, where do you see the biggest risks in terms  of foreign policy right now for the United States?</p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  You know there's a big difference between the risks right now  and the risks further in the future.  Further -- and I'm going to go  further in the future first because I think that is where China is  potentially our biggest problem, it's a huge strong country that is clearly  on an expansion in a kind of imperial mode.  And that's the reason, by the  way, in defense of trying to improve relations with Russia, to see if we  can separate the two of them, instead of having them be close buddies which  is where they are now.  But I think in terms of immediate risks, North  Korea is clearly one of the most serious ones.  And I don't think we're  making a progress with the speed that we thought we could, or that we  should be able to do.  So, I think we need to think about a tougher policy  probably with North Korea than we've had.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's the tougher policy?  Like, what would be the most  important policy this President could adopt?</p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  Look, I think that regime is very vulnerable to economic  sanctions.  It's a miserable economy but they have to keep paying their  policemen and their guards, and when they start running out of money to do  that, I think it -- something that has to make them very nervous.  And we  went further with sanctions under this President than we have in the past,  but I think there's still a long way that we could be going.  So basically  shut them out of the international financial system and to shut down people  who are helping them like Chinese companies.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes, really good point.  Ambassador, it's great to see  you this morning, thanks very much for your insights.</p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  You're very welcome.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it very much.  Paul Wolfowitz joining us there.   Coming up, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is crowned the richest man alive.   Richest man in the planet.  The details on the jaw-dropping net worth of  the founder of Amazon.  Then, Bryce Harper making an epic comeback, the  highlights from last night's home run derby, coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  So, Amazon's Prime Day wasn't exactly ready for  primetime.  Deirdre Bolton is in New York City with all the details on  that.  Deirdre, hello, good morning to you.</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hello, Maria, good morning.   I'm in front of Whole Foods which as you will remember, Amazon bought for  upwards of $13 billion last year, but you mentioned these glitches for  Prime Day which started yesterday at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time, yes, for about  three hours, Maria.  If you were trying to buy something, you actually  couldn't pay for it which I'm pretty sure is about the worst thing can  happen to a retailer.  Social media, you have this whole #goingaround which  was #PrimeDayFail.  But I want to let you know that statistically, it was  still a win for Amazon even in those dicey three hours, shoppers have still  spent more than 54 percent more in those first three hours than they did on  Prime Day this time last year.  So, you may wonder or for our viewers who  may wonder, what exactly is Prime Day, this is the fourth annual run at it  for Amazon, it equals Black Friday as far as the numbers go.  </p><p>Amazon has more than a million deals today, Maria, they want you to buy  Fire Stick, Echo Dot, that was the big seller last year.  They also want  you to buy groceries.  They didn't buy Whole Foods for nothing.  So, if you  show up here, if you're an Amazon Prime Member who has not yet gotten a  grocery deliver from Whole Foods, if you go today, you spend more than  $10.00, you get $10.00 off of future order and another one as well.  All of  this, glitches included, we have to say have not hurt the founder and CEO,  Jeff Bezos.  He is the world's richest man, at least measured in modern  U.S. dollars of 150 billion U.S. is his worth.  The stock is up 55 percent  this year, Maria, that has added $50 billion just to his pocket alone.  </p><p> So, he has passed Bill Gates, of course, the founder of Microsoft.  Jeff  Bezos has also passed the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, he has passed  Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.  And a lot of people somewhat critical of Jeff  Bezos saying, OK, well, how come he isn't giving more of his money away,  all of those other people that I mentioned obviously have plans in place.   But he is working on building infrastructure in space, that has been the  answer untold but that takes a lot of money.  Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible, Deirdre, $150 billion value -- net wealth of  Jeff Bezos.  Pretty incredible.  Deirdre, thank you, we will be watching  Amazon shares and where Bezos' wealth goes next.  Can you believe that, you  guys, $150 billion?</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Here's to Varney about to weigh -- and you predicted it.  Once  again, you predicted yesterday you said it was going to be a big day, and  you've been positive on Amazon for some time.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I remember, a half century  ago, when I was brought up on the idea that if you are truly rich, you  could live on the interest from the interest from your capital.  I suspect  that Mr. Bezos can live on the interest on the interest on the interest on  the interest from his $150 billion, but I digress.  Look, I think that big  tech investors face a bit of a problem right now, can big techl keep on  scoring 30, 40 percent increases in their profits and their revenue?   That's a very tough row to hoe, but that's the situation as of now.  </p><p> If you look at Netflix, which I consider a big name technology company,  they're going to be down, what, 10, maybe 11 percent this morning because  they missed their expectations, they missed their new subscribers.  So,  there's a big question here for all of big tech, is it the end of the road  or should I buy more, or just do nothing and let it ride?  Very interesting  question today.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe the expectations have to come in just a little.   When you have expectations all the way up there, hard to have any room for  error.</p><p> VARNEY:  I hate expectations.  You know what I feel about that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.</p><p> VARNEY:  You will.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know you got a lot more on \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  Join Stuart  top of the hour at 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  But first,  Bryce Harper winning this year's home run derby.  More of the highlights  next as we head to Nationals Park in D.C.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Fireworks at the home run derby.  Hometown hero,  Bryce Harper, wowing the crowd as Washington, D.C., gets ready for  tonight's all-star game.  Connell McShane with the details from Nationals  Park.  Connell?</p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, there, good morning,  Maria, kind of fun to be here in Washington talking some baseball instead  of politics for a change.  89th Major League Baseball all-star game will be  tonight on the Fox broadcast network, and the first time they've had it  here in D.C. since back in 1969 when it was the Senators, not the Nationals  playing in this city.  But as you said it, last night, a lot of fun with  the home run derby.  Let's take a look at some of the highlights, Bryce  Harper, obviously with the favorite go again given the hometown guy and he  came out dressed for the occasion with stars and stripes bandana.  But I  got to tell you, for Harper got a run from his -- for his money from the  Cubs' Kyle Schwarber.  </p><p> Now, Schwarber, the power left-handed hitter hit more than 20 home runs in  the semi-final run of the derby and then in the final, he kind of set the  pace.  He went first, did Schwarber, and he put 18 on the board.  So,  Harper knew he had to make a good run at it.  He got off to a slow start in  the final.  When Harper came up, his dad pitching too him, just couldn't  get the rhythm.  Took a time-out which you're allowed to do in the home run  derby, kind of take a deep breath, set himself, and then he really got  going on some kind of a run, and hit the game-winning home run with two  hands in the air.  The big celebration in front of the hometown crowd.  </p><p> So, sometimes that's more exciting, Maria, than the game.  We'll see how  things go tonight but I know there was a lot of buzz here in the stadium  for the derby last night.  We'll have plenty more throughout the day  (INAUDIBLE) the game is on Fox tonight, so we'll speak to some of the stars  there (INAUDIBLE) Alex Rodriguez and others, and maybe a few surprise  guests, so we'll see you throughout the day here from Nationals Park.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Awesome.  Great coverage, Connell, thanks.  We'll be tune in.   Have fun, Connell McShane.  Remember to watch the MLB All-Star game tonight  at 8:00 p.m. Eastern on Fox.  Coming up, we got final thoughts from this  all-star panel.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Lindsey Bell?</p><p> BELL:  I think Netflix -- we're getting a gift.  This is a buying  opportunity.  They're spending more on content than anyone else, and I  think they will bode guidance.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Even the stock is where it is.  All right, Jon  Hilsenrath?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  9:15 we're going to get really strong data on manufacturing  sector.  10:00 a.m. we're going to have Jay Powell saying the economy is in  great shape.  Despite all of these angsts right now about what's happening  on the trade front, the economy is in pretty good shape.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It sure is.  And we're going to get a 4-1/2 percent number on  GDP, you said.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  That's the estimate from the Atlanta Feds for now.  But  the reason that there is so much optimism is because those tax cuts for  corporations, they're permanent.  Regardless of what the President says or  does not say, that's something that companies can take to the banks.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And today, they're going to try to come up with Tax Plan 2.0  and make the individual cuts permanent.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  And maybe turn the attention to the economy and away  from what happened in Helsinki.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  I'm waiting for them to do something about the deficit.  It's  nice to have those tax-cuts but we've got very good --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good luck.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  Thanks, everybody.  Great show.  Right to  Varney we go.  That'll do it for us.  Have a great day, everybody.  Here's  Stuart.  Stu?</p><p> VARNEY:  Here I am, and good morning, Maria, and good morning, everyone. </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Welcome back, everybody.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, July 17th.   Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Taking on Amazon,  Wal-Mart and Microsoft team up on a new cloud deal.  Microsoft CEO Satya  Nadella telling me in an exclusive interview why the partnership is  crucial.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SATYA NADELLA, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MICROSOFT:  Everything that we  think about, every places being digitized whether it's a retail outlet or a  hospital, a stadium, your home or your workplace is increasingly comPuting,  it's getting embedded in the real world.  And in the case of Wal-Mart is a  good example because if you think about Wal-Mart they have an amazing need  today when it comes to anything around off-line commerce but they're  increasing the momentum online.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  More of my exclusive interview with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella  straight ahead.  Earnings in focus this morning on Wall Street.  Three Dow  components reporting their second quarter ahead of the opening bell.   Johnson &amp; Johnson, Goldman Sachs, and UnitedHealth are all out.  Goldman  Sachs President David Solomon will become CEO on October 1 according to the  New York Times.  The handoff to David Solomon was expected and now we know  the date October 1 a change in leadership at Goldman Sachs.  Markets this  morning look like this, futures edging lower.  The Dow Industrials now at  the low of the morning here down about 30 points.  The S&amp;P 500 down three  and the NASDAQ down 3-/2.  This after the markets finished the day mixed  yesterday.  Take a look, Dow Industrials picked up 45 points but the S&amp;P  and the NASDAQ fractionally lower on the session.</p><p>And in Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board.  The FT-100  down nine points, the CAC quarante down 25, that's a half of a percent.   And the DAX Index in Germany down a quarter of a percent.  In Asia  overnight, mixed performances, take a look the best performer was Japan,  Nikkei Average up one-half of one percent.  Amazon prime day will under way  but it got off to a rock start outages prevented customers from making  purchases yesterday.  The fallout for the retail giant on the biggest sales  day of the year.</p><p>And it was a wild night at the Home Run Derby, Bryce Harper pulling off a  last second win at his home stadium.  We have all the highlights.  All  those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it all  down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, The Wall Street Journal global  economics editor, Jon Hilsenrath and CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey  Bell.  Great show so far guys.</p><p>LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good to be here.  And earnings  are doing very, very well, 19.6 percent on the S&amp;P 500.  90 percent of  companies beating the bottom line.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And revenue?  </p><p>BELL:  And revenue, 87 percent finish top line.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Just for the second quarter.  </p><p>BELL:  Nine percent revenue.  </p><p>JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  The estimates are for  earnings of 26 or 27 percent, isn't it?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Not second quarter.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BELL:  the numbers --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  -- getting better as the new numbers comes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So you think the earnings period gets even better for the  second quarter?  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Could be.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to keep watching that.  We want to look  at Microsoft which is of course is reporting earnings later this week.  It  is teaming up with Wal-Mart to take on Amazon.  The retail giant looking to  accelerate its digital transformation with the help of Microsoft's cloud  technology.  I spoke exclusively with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella for his  take on the partnership, privacy concerns facing technology today and where  Microsoft can continue to grow. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>NADELLA:  The core mission of our company really comes through in the  momentum we have.  If you think about it, we sort of describe our mission  as empowering every person in every organization on the planet to achieve  more.  In our words, our success, whatever we have of it is dependent on  our costumers succeeding in an increasingly digital world.  That's what you  see what's on the examples like Wal-Mart who's patterned deeply with us and  others.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It's interesting because this announcement with Wal-Mart, a  strategic partnership, it's a digital transformation for Wal-Mart but  you're calling this a 4-1/2 trillion opportunity.  This transformation to  digital. </p><p>NADELLA:  Yes, it's actually frustration.  If we think about it for all the  success of digital technology companies on a percentage basis of the GDP,  the worldwide GDP, I think the text banned is just around five percent.  It  is expected to go to 10 percent next 10 years.  But the real question is,  what is the opportunity for the other 95 percent of GDP or the 90 percent  of the GDP.  How are they going to use the digital technology, doing some  sense digital companies in their own right.  Whether it's any retailer like  Wal-Mart or any health company, 81 across all industries is going to look  to digital technology to bring about the next level of experience  innovation or cost savings.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And for Wal-Mart, this is a critical transition as it battles  with Amazon who of course, has been incredibly aggressive in that space.   Tell me about I.T. budgets today.  Are you seeing that increase in  technology spending?  I know that there was a pretty good lift when the tax  plan first came out in anticipation of the tax cut plan but there was  worries that things have slowed down.  Are you still seeing I.T. budgets  increase and are you seeing the kind of spend that you would expect?  </p><p>NADELLA:  No, I mean, on a long-term basis, if I had to sort of look at it,  tax spend or digital spend is absolutely going to increase just because  everything that we think about every place is being digitized whether it's  a retail outlet or a hospital, a stadium, your home or your workplace is  increasing comPuting, it's getting embedded in the real world.  Every  experience is being driven by more and more A.I. capability.  So that's  what's going to keep driving more tax spend.  It's going to essentially --  I think over the world's operating expense as well as cogs are being  digitized.  And in the case of Wal-Mart is a good example because if you  think about Wal-Mart, they're having amazing lead today when it comes to  anything around off-line commerce.  But they're increasing their momentum  online.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Is the priority for companies today whether big or small,  because let's not forget Microsoft is really the priority for smaller and  midcap companies as well in addition to the G.E.s and the Wal-Marts of the  world.  But is the spend priority in terms of security right now or is it  cloud?  Where would you see the priority is in terms of corporate spending?  </p><p>NADELLA:  I would say the number one priority is around productivity and  digital transformation. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Was it the tax cut plan that encouraged you to take some money  back to the U.S.?  </p><p>NADELLA:  I mean, I think we've had a pretty balanced approach.  First and  foremost we are being very aggressive spenders in R&amp;D dollars and operating  expenses right here in the United States.  And if you look at what we do,  we do (INAUDIBLE) $30 plus billion spend every year, and majority 85  percent of it is right here in the United States.  And so we continue to  bet on the organic growth and innovation but we are complementing that,  whether it's with LinkedIn or pending acquisition or GitHub or what you did  earlier with Minecraft.  We are looking for assets that can complement what  we do well and as well as dividends and buybacks.  So, we think having that  approach which is some in some sense more stable across all various  different forms and spend patterns in business cycles is important.  But at  at the end of the day what matters to us is continue to drive the  innovation and growth in this company.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  You have been in China for a long time and I have a stat here,  someone said to me that there was expectation that 97 percent of companies  in China use Microsoft Windows and more than 90 percent do not pay for it.   You have been dealing with piracy this for a long time.  What can you tell  us about it?  </p><p>NADELLA:  I mean, I think one of the fundamental things that been -- have  been our approach in China is to be able sort of to look to how -- what do  their customers and the government there value and how do we in some sense  adapt the business models that allow us to succeed there.  I think  intellectual property needs to be protected.  I think it's China's own  interest to given that they now are big intellectual property creators  themselves to help ensure that intellectual property like software is  protected and that's something that we have a good dialogue with the  Chinese government.  And I think the voices coming out of Washington are  all good which is we want fair trade between countries.  I believe that the  next 10 years, 20 years, 30 years whatever your time frame is is going to  be defined by how the United States and China not only create an  equilibrium between themselves but also for the rest of the world.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But, you know, China won't even admit that they're stealing our  I.P.  So how do you change that behavior?  Is there any way to stop that?  </p><p>NADELLA:  Yes.  I mean, absolutely.  I mean, first of all, for example as  we move to the cloud, you see a shift in how people acquire intellectual  property and that by itself I think is very helpful but overall, I think  every country that's going through a massive transformation internally and  socially and economically, I am of the belief that when you get to a  certain level of GDP and GDP growth, comes with it responsibility for  protecting things like intellectual property.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, most people understand the issues around China  because of that intellectual property theft but the aluminum and steel  tariffs are something different.  Are you expecting an impact as a result  of these tariffs?  </p><p>NADELLA:  You know, for us, we don't see anything today in our outlook.   The overall I think, this entire world order so to speak that we've seen is  based on a predictable model of how goods are produced and distributed and  how well you add work.  And I'm hoping that we'll come back.  I think the  President has said that what he wants is fair deals, and so I hope that as  we negotiate them that we come back to a stable environment.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Satya, obviously privacy has become the issue within the text  base and in Silicon Valley particularly after the Cambridge Analytica  scandal over at Facebook.  A lot of people are expecting a heavier hand as  it relates to technology.  Are you expecting a new round of rules or  regulations coming out of Washington and how will you adapt?  </p><p>NADELLA:  You know, privacy in my opinion is now become a human right and  that's how I think of it when it comes to our products and services.  And  the customers and consumers everywhere are going to demand it and expect it  in our products.  That's why we were very, you know, aggressive and in  terms of responding to GDPR, in terms of implementation and we don't even  think of GDP as just a one point in time regulation.  It requires an  ongoing commitment to compliance around privacy.  And I think that -- I  fully expect that more countries and more geographies including the United  States are going to take a, you know, a lead from what the Europeans have  done.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about your contract with the U.S. Immigration and  Customs enforcements.  Obviously a lot of noise around this, given the  separation of families.  I know your contract with ICE involves the legacy  mail, e-mail, calendar, messenger and documents.  Is there a potential for  using the facial recognition as well?  </p><p>NADELLA:  We have been very clear, in fact, a multiple years ago is when I  wrote about RAI principals and how we are going to make sure that A.I.  technology that we build and how it's used is always going to be driven by  set of enduring principles.  Now, one of the things that we recognize is  with A.I. technology with all the benefits comes from unintended uses.   Like bias or facial recognition.  And so therefore, we are very clear that  we will not participate in any project that is going to be against, you  know, fundamental human rights.  And in this case, what we are doing with  ICE is to support them in the core infrastructure around e-mail but we are  not at all involved in any of the facial recognition technology and their  use cases.  But more importantly we think that its' not just about a single  company having principal approach which we do but it's also having a set of  rules and regulations especially in a democracy like ours.  Instead of us  trying to govern the government, I think the legislative process should  govern the companies and their technologies and the uses.  That's what the  blog, the Brad Smith wrote last week really outlines and we in fact welcome  any regulation and any expert comedy that the legislative process creates.   And then the rules and policies that come out of it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I was looking at Brad Smith's post and the truth is is we  are in sort of an uncertain term -- time.  When you look at A.I. and  machine learning, there's a balance to walk here that these things are  making our lives so much easier but at the same time people worried that it  is in fact infringing on our privacy.  There is that balance that  Microsoft, the entire tech sector has to -- has to walk.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's absolutely correct.  When it will comes to things like  security or cybersecurity, privacy in A.I., I think in all of these cases  two things need to happen.  One is  companies like us at Microsoft, we need  to take responsibility and protect privacy as a human right, ensure things  like we are doing with cybersecurity, like the Tech Accord.  I think cover  as like the Geneva Convention in the cybersecurity world.  As well as have  ethical principles that drive the development and the use of A.I.  But on  top of it, I think the governments around the world also have their role. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  As Congress plans to come up with a new solution here going  into midterm elections, what kind of a legal immigration system would you  like to see?  </p><p>NADELLA:  You know, first of all, Maria, I am a product of I think two  amazingly unique things,  American, one is American technology that reached  me where I was growing up and letting me dream the dream and American  immigration policy that then allowed me to come here, get an education and  live that dream.  So I'll always come from that personal experience to  advocate for and enlighten immigration policy that allows the -- for the  best and the brightest to come to the United States, participate in our  economy, pay taxes, create innovations that are going to make us more  competitive globally.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you finding employees that you need to put in the jobs that  you have open?  Recently we learned that there are more job openings than  actually people to fill those jobs.  </p><p>NADELLA:  I mean, I think we are seeing definitely growth is much faster  and so therefore we have always have insatiable need for new talent and  better talent.  Be definitely can employ more people but at the same time I  think this fantastic people in the right here in the schools in the United  States as well as in the industry.  So I think that yes, immigration,  policy reform is required but I would not sort of use that as only thing  that is required in order for us to continue to grow in the united states.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, final question here, Satya.  Obviously you're doing a  lot, right?  How does it feel sitting on the doorstep of a $1-trillion  market value from Microsoft right now? </p><p>NADELLA:  For us I think, Maria, is going to come down to what I said which  is how can we ensure that we stay focused on building technologies that are  relevant in helping our customers.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Satya, it's great to see you today.  Thanks so much.  And  congratulations to you.  </p><p>NADELLA:  Thank you so much, Maria.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  As we told you earlier, Goldman Sachs announced  that David Solomon will take over for Lloyd Blankfein as CEO beginning  October 1.  Nicole Petallides is on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange with details looking at the stock.  Nicole, good morning.  </p><p>NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  So  it's finally official, I mean, David Solomon has been speculated to be the  succession to Lloyd Blankfein in this top role particularly after the  Goldman co-President Harvey Schwartz was out.  And so now, he is going to  take the helm on October 1st.  He will be the third Goldman CEO since it  went public in 1999.  Of course, Hank Paulson who have gone on to be  treasury secretary under George W. Bush, then Lloyd Blankfein and now David  Soloman.  Veteran investment banker will be taking over on October 1st.   Now we're also -- by the way, he's also a D.J., that was another underlying  story on his spare time which I thought was really cute in Miami, New York,  and Bahamas.  Let's take a look also at the numbers.  You can see that the  stock is down about a quarter of a percent.  They did beat on profit and  revenue.  Revenue was listed by fixed income where they're not able to make  it as the trading revenue clients are just a little spooked by the sharp  price moves and so the strength certainly with investment banking and that  was a winner.  Johnson &amp; Johnson, that is up right now after a beat strong  dollar did hurt, defending itself in the talc issues.  And last but not  least, you are seeing UnitedHealth to the downside.  The premiums missed  and also medical loss ratio missed estimates but they did raise a forecast  and did have some good numbers but a couple of misses weighing on the  stock.  Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Stock down almost two percent UnitedHealth.  Thank  you, Nicole.  Coming up.  Amazon prime day starts with a glitch.  Problems  with the retail giant's Web site.  Shoppers searching for deals later this  hour.  Then there is, Bryce Harper making an epic comeback.  The highlights  from last night's Home Run Derby coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Trade tensions escalating in the United States.   Filing complaints against trading partners including Canada, China, the  European Union.  This after lawsuits were filed against the U.S.  through  the World Trade Organization over the steel and aluminum tariffs.  Joining  us right now is Ian Bremmer, President of the Eurasia Group and GZERO  Media.  Ian, great to see you this morning.  </p><p>IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT, EURASIA GROUP:  Hi, Maia.  Good morning to you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What progress is being made on the trade front?  Where are you  in this trade dispute whether if it would with China or our allies on  aluminum and steel?  </p><p>BREMMER:  So far, as you say, we have a dueling suits that have been put in  place with the World Trade Organization.  The the good news is that for  those that were saying that there is draft, you know, sort of order going  around from -- in the White House saying that Trump wants to withdraw the  United States from the WTO, that was never feasible in terms of Congress.   And it was never something that the Trump administration in any had a  consensus in moving towards.  They are using the WTO as the allies are, as  China is and if this ends up getting resolved by the established  multilateral trade organization over years, that's a much better place to  be than unfettered escalation on trade.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Ian, it's Dagen McDowell.   The commerce department under President Trump is studying this potential  tariff on automobile imports into the United States, maybe 20 percent,  maybe higher.  They're looking at it right now.  I believe there is a  hearing even later this week.  Do you think that just ultimately gets  tabled because again they would try to argue that it's a -- that auto  imports are risk to our national security potentially which just seems  ludicrous.  </p><p>BREMMER:  Yes.  But it seems ludicrous to make that argument for steel and  aluminum with say the Canadians but they still made it.  So, I mean, the  fact is that you have a regulation and you've got people that are looking  to find any way to press forward with a political posture that they want to  pursue.  Look, we know that when you talk to CEOs and businesspeople in the  U.S., it's not the Helsinki meeting between Trump and Putin that they're  worried about, they're worried about Trump's stance on trade.  And they  certainly believe and it's a -- it's true that if we press forward with  these automotive tariffs that you're going to see, a significant hit to  American workers, a significant hit to a lot of these American businesses. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  By the way, Kevin Brady said that, he said that that's' going  to show up in the economic numbers later this year, Jon.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, you raised Helsinki and I want to -- I want to  ask you about that.  The President goes to Europe and he calls the European  allies foes and then turns to Helsinki and has a pretty compatible  interaction with Putin.  How do you think America's European allies are  looking at that Helsinki meeting and how does that shape the way they're  going to respond to our trade stance and the challenge that the President  is putting in front of them on autos and all these other goods?  </p><p>BREMMER:  Well, look, I mean, to be clear, it was very strange when Trump  referred to the E.U. as a foe but then after that, he said China is also a  foe, Russia is also a foe.  So, the problem is that Trump clearly has a  better set of relationships personally with authoritarian leaders around  the world like Erdogan who he fist bumps at the NATO Summit in front of  everyone else.  Like Kim Jong-un, like Putin then he does with a lot of the  allies.  So obviously, the toxicity of the transatlantic relations, despite  the fact that we have much closer relationships is a problem.  On the other  side, you look at Putin, it's very clear that Trump wants a better  relationship with Putin.  It's also very clear he's not going to get one.   There is a reason why Trump spent over two hours with Putin in private and  not with his advisories.  It's not because he was worried that the advisers  were going to say something out of turn that was more hawkish.  Those  advisers don't say boo unless Trump turns to them and says Mr. Pompeo,  Mike, do you want to comment and say something, right?  The issue is they  don't agree with him.  They have a harder line policy on Russia as the  Republican Party does and they would have leaked like crazy if they were in  that room.  U.S. sanctions against Russia are still in place and there are  harder line than they were under Obama.  U.S. defense spending is up.   Trump didn't say anything on recognition of Crimea, he didn't suspend NATO  or U.S. military activities in the Baltics.  He certainly didn't say we're  going to take U.S. troops out of Syria.  So as embarrassing as yesterday  was from the perspective the of American President standing on the stage  and providing moral equivalency with President Trump -- Putin, we need to  recognize that the -- that actually U.S. policy towards Russia under the  Trump administration is likely to be harder line at the end of 2018 than it  was today. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HILSENRATH:  Do you think we dial up --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's a really good point.  </p><p>HILSENRATH:  Do you think we dial up sanctions on the Russians?  We did it  earlier this year when previous allegations of interference in our  elections came out.  Do we take these latest Mueller allegations and add to  the sanction list?  </p><p>BREMMER:  I think we do.  I think that Congress will continue to move in  that direction as we see evidence -- intelligence evidence of the Russians  engaged in the creation of more fake accounts and disinformation and  cyberattacks around the midterm elections.  Certainly in terms of  cyberattacks against American critical infrastructure which is the single  piece I was most concerned that Trump did not bring up publicly.  It's the  one that's the greatest danger in area of confrontation between the two  countries.  Congress is not backing off from that, Trump's own advisers are  not backing off unless they all resign, there's no question that's where  most of the Republican Party across the board is heading this year.  I  think we will see tougher sanctions, another round that comes down from the  Americans against Russia later this year irrespective of whether that's  what Trump wants or not.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's what Jon Hilsenrath actually said earlier.  Yes.  That's  a really good point, Ian.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning, Ian.</p><p>BREMMER:  My pleasure, guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good to see.  Ian Bremmer there.  Coming up.  President Trump  headed to the Hill to discuss tax reform 2.0.  We'll head to Washington,  D.C. as well for all the details next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Good Tuesday morning, everybody, thanks so much  for joining us.  I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, July 17th, your  top stories right now 8:31 on the east coast.  Trade tensions taking a  backseat as investors are focused on earnings season today.  Futures are  indicating a fractionally lower opening for the broader averages.  It's  going to a big week for second-quarter reports, and we've already heard  from three Dow components this morning.  In Europe, this morning, markets  are lower across the board, take a look, as you see, the FT-100 right  around even, the CAC Quarante is down a third of a percent in Paris, and  the DAX Index is down a fraction in Germany.  In Asia overnight, mixed  performances there as well.  The one best performer was Japan, Nikkei  Average up half a percent.</p><p>Amazon Prime Day starts with a glitch.

Centerfield, and Bryce Harper has thrown  his bat in the air, and won the 2018 T-Mobile home run derby.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  More of the highlights as we head live to Nationals Park in  Washington, D.C., coming up.  But, first, President Trump is putting  another round of tax reforms on the fast track.  Kristina Partsinevelos is  in Washington this morning with all the details.  Kristina, good morning.</p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.   That is Tax Reform 2.0.  That's what they're calling it.  You have some  Republicans that are going to be meeting with the President this afternoon.   What they're going to expect to some changes from the first set of tax cuts  that happened about a year ago.  What am I talking about changes?  They  were, we know, the corporate tax rate went from 35 percent to 21 percent.   We know individual tax rates changed for the vast majority of Americans.</p><p>And I'd like to highlight just two income brackets.  You have those that  made around $38,000 to about $82,000, they saw their tax bracket dropped  from 25 percent to 22 percent.  However, if you're also, you know, making a  little bit more money over $500,000, you saw your tax rate drop from 39.6  percent to 37 percent as well.  So, both sides of the income brackets --  for across the board, they did benefit from these tax cuts.  The problem is  these individual tax cuts are set to expire in 2025.  President Trump  weighed in, listen to what he had to say about these tax cuts.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're doing a phase two,  we'll be doing it probably on October, maybe a little sooner than that.   And it will be more of a middleclass.  We did a lot for the middleclass but  this will be even more aimed at the middleclass.  One of the things we're  thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20, and then, for the  most part, the rest of it would go right to the middleclass.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  And what we know is Tuesday, they want to extend these  individual tax rates, there's possibility about having universal savings  account.  There's also talk about small businesses and how small businesses  can help retirement plans, specifically, encouraging small employers to  offer retirement savings programs as well as annuities that would turn  workers' savings into a guaranteed annual income.  I know, Maria, you spoke  on Wall Street to Kevin Brady, he's the chairman of the tax rating  committee, and he also weighed in about how this could be beneficial to  future growth in the American economy.  Listen in.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>REP. KEVIN BRADY (R), TEXAS:  President Trump's tax cuts and reforms was  about changing the economic direction of the country for the better, 2.0 is  about changing the culture in Washington, where we don't wait 30 years  between fixing the tax code, we get better every year, we continue to lead  the rest of the world here.  And so, you're going to see, I think,  permanence of the middleclass cuts and the small business cuts will be the  centerpiece of this.  And people, I think, overlook the growth impact long  term.  That alone could help create a million and a half new jobs in  America, continue to raise paychecks significantly in the long term.  So,  that will be the centerpiece of it.  We're working with the President on  the rest of the elements of 2.0.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  So, Kevin Brady did highlight that they want to make it  permanent.  That's going to be the huge obstacle within the House because a  lot of people have discussed, how high the deficit has ballooned because of  these tax cuts.  So, they're going to need about 60 votes and a lot of even  Republicans have voiced some unease regarding this deficit.  They want to  push this forward before midterms as well.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  How do you pay for it?  The question keeps coming up.   Kristina, thank you.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Kristina Partsinevelos.  Let's turn to North Korea's nuclear  ambitions hours after the Helsinki summit with Russia's President.   President Trump revealed that Vladimir Putin will help the United States  deal with North Korea and nuclear weapons.  Here's what the President told  Sean Hannity last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>TRUMP:  You know, if look at Russia and the United States, that's 90  percent of the nuclear weapons.  And --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>TRUMP:  -- doing something and working on other countries.  And he also  said he wants to be very helpful with North Korea.  We're doing well with  North Korea, we have time.  There's no rush.  You know, it's been going on  for many years.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Joining me now is the former deputy defense secretary under  George W. Bush and former ambassador to Indonesia, Paul Wolfowitz.   Ambassador, good to see you this morning, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>PAUL WOLFOWITZ, FORMER UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO INDONESIA:  Nice to be  with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to what you just heard?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  Look, we've been dealing with the North Korea issue for many  years.  I thought the whole idea was to try to get it behind us then to do  it reasonably quickly.  I'm worried that we're getting now mired in this  strategic patience of waiting step-by-step and the North Koreans will  continue to extract more and more as we go.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So, what should the President do then at this point?  I mean,  it was pretty historic that they met.  We thought that we would see more  progress.  Are we seeing progress?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  It seems to me we're not seeing progress.  If anything, things  seem to be going backward in terms of what the North Koreans are saying  when they denounce the Secretary of State as a gangster after their  meetings with him, and we're trying to pretend the meetings were fine.   There's something wrong there.  You know, in his own book, President Trump  wrote years ago that in negotiating, it's important to know when to walk  away, otherwise you start to seem desperate.  And I worry that we may be  starting to seem too eager for an agreement, and that's a bad way to get  there.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's interesting.  And your thoughts on the Helsinki meeting,  and the -- and the press conference with Putin?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  Well, of course, we don't know much about the meeting except  the press conference.  But the press conference by itself is very  important.  And I hate to say this, but I think -- well, I don't hate to  say this part, Putin is a classic KGB bully, with former President Bush, he  even showed him his big Russian wolfhound and said, see, bigger, faster,  stronger than your little scotch terrier.  That's the kind of man he is,  and I think, Americans often make the mistake, and I think maybe President  Trump made this mistake, of thinking the way to improve relations with  someone like that is to be nice to them.  They just interpret that as  weakness.  </p><p>We have a lot of business to do with Russia, it's true.  We could do with a  better relationship, we could do with less close relationship between  Russia and China, but that's not come -- going to come about by having  Putin underestimate us and I'm afraid if the tone of the private meeting  was like the press conference, where Putin dismissively said, what makes  you think after Trump had said everything changed four hours ago, Putin  dismissively says, why do you think we trust one another?  It doesn't bode  well.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  It reminds me, actually, Maria, of when President Kennedy met  with, I guess, he was called General Secretary at the time, Nikita  Khrushchev of the Soviet Union.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Right.</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  In Vienna in 1962, I think.  It was interpreted as Kennedy  being weak and was followed not so long afterwards by the Cuban missile  crisis.  You need to make sure he takes this deadly serious.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But what do you think about the policies?  When you look at the  policies that the U.S. has put in place, as it relates to Russia, whether  it'd be sanctions, or troops, or you know, poking the Germans for having  the gas pipeline deal?  When you look at the policies versus the  appeasement that we saw onstage yesterday, they're very different, aren't  they?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  They are somewhat different.  They're not as different as they  might be, but -- I think -- I mean, part of the problem, to be fair to the  President, our President is that we're in a pretty deep hole in Syria and  in Ukraine, and it's not clear how you dig out of that hole but we do need  more pressure, and I think tougher sanctions would be appropriate.  But I  think something else we ought to be looking at is exposing what we know  about Putin's corruption which I believe goes very, very deep.  And the  U.S. Justice Department has an ability to expose that which would be a huge  pressure on Putin.  We ought to think about doing something like that in my  opinion.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Really interesting.  Let me -- let me move over to the border  crackdown.  The National Guard which has been part of the stepped up  immigration efforts has helped border agents arrest more than 10,000  illegal immigrants just since April.  This comes as House GOP leaders are  set to hold a vote tomorrow in support of all the Immigration and Customs  Enforcement officers and denounce the calls by Democrats to abolish the ICE  agencies.  What do you make of the democratic attempt to abolish ICE?  I  mean, obviously, that stance has quicklu fallen apart.</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  I think you've just said it right there.  We have to have  immigration enforcement, we have to have border enforcement.  I think  sometimes ICE officials may get too aggressive about keeping people out of  that treating immigrants -- or treating everyone as the illegal one whether  they are or not.  And certainly, we made, if nothing else, a mistake in  this handling of the children that we separated from their parents.  I  think we're on the way to correcting that, and I think -- I think at the  heart of this immigration issue, unfortunately, is a kind of canyon between  the two sides, of one side saying, we really don't need any border  enforcement at all, and I think that enrages most Americans who'll say,  what the heck are you talking about here?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, I totally agree with that.  Let me ask you, Secretary,  look across the world for us, where do you see the biggest risks in terms  of foreign policy right now for the United States?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  You know there's a big difference between the risks right now  and the risks further in the future.  Further -- and I'm going to go  further in the future first because I think that is where China is  potentially our biggest problem, it's a huge strong country that is clearly  on an expansion in a kind of imperial mode.  And that's the reason, by the  way, in defense of trying to improve relations with Russia, to see if we  can separate the two of them, instead of having them be close buddies which  is where they are now.  But I think in terms of immediate risks, North  Korea is clearly one of the most serious ones.  And I don't think we're  making a progress with the speed that we thought we could, or that we  should be able to do.  So, I think we need to think about a tougher policy  probably with North Korea than we've had.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  What's the tougher policy?  Like, what would be the most  important policy this President could adopt?</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  Look, I think that regime is very vulnerable to economic  sanctions.  It's a miserable economy but they have to keep paying their  policemen and their guards, and when they start running out of money to do  that, I think it -- something that has to make them very nervous.  And we  went further with sanctions under this President than we have in the past,  but I think there's still a long way that we could be going.  So basically  shut them out of the international financial system and to shut down people  who are helping them like Chinese companies.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes, really good point.  Ambassador, it's great to see  you this morning, thanks very much for your insights.</p><p>WOLFOWITZ:  You're very welcome.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it very much.  Paul Wolfowitz joining us there.   Coming up, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is crowned the richest man alive.   Richest man in the planet.  The details on the jaw-dropping net worth of  the founder of Amazon.  Then, Bryce Harper making an epic comeback, the  highlights from last night's home run derby, coming up.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  So, Amazon's Prime Day wasn't exactly ready for  primetime.  Deirdre Bolton is in New York City with all the details on  that.  Deirdre, hello, good morning to you.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hello, Maria, good morning.   I'm in front of Whole Foods which as you will remember, Amazon bought for  upwards of $13 billion last year, but you mentioned these glitches for  Prime Day which started yesterday at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time, yes, for about  three hours, Maria.  If you were trying to buy something, you actually  couldn't pay for it which I'm pretty sure is about the worst thing can  happen to a retailer.  Social media, you have this whole #goingaround which  was #PrimeDayFail.  But I want to let you know that statistically, it was  still a win for Amazon even in those dicey three hours, shoppers have still  spent more than 54 percent more in those first three hours than they did on  Prime Day this time last year.  So, you may wonder or for our viewers who  may wonder, what exactly is Prime Day, this is the fourth annual run at it  for Amazon, it equals Black Friday as far as the numbers go.  </p><p>Amazon has more than a million deals today, Maria, they want you to buy  Fire Stick, Echo Dot, that was the big seller last year.  They also want  you to buy groceries.  They didn't buy Whole Foods for nothing.  So, if you  show up here, if you're an Amazon Prime Member who has not yet gotten a  grocery deliver from Whole Foods, if you go today, you spend more than  $10.00, you get $10.00 off of future order and another one as well.  All of  this, glitches included, we have to say have not hurt the founder and CEO,  Jeff Bezos.  He is the world's richest man, at least measured in modern  U.S. dollars of 150 billion U.S. is his worth.  The stock is up 55 percent  this year, Maria, that has added $50 billion just to his pocket alone.  </p><p>So, he has passed Bill Gates, of course, the founder of Microsoft.  Jeff  Bezos has also passed the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, he has passed  Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.  And a lot of people somewhat critical of Jeff  Bezos saying, OK, well, how come he isn't giving more of his money away,  all of those other people that I mentioned obviously have plans in place.   But he is working on building infrastructure in space, that has been the  answer untold but that takes a lot of money.  Maria?</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible, Deirdre, $150 billion value -- net wealth of  Jeff Bezos.  Pretty incredible.  Deirdre, thank you, we will be watching  Amazon shares and where Bezos' wealth goes next.  Can you believe that, you  guys, $150 billion?</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Here's to Varney about to weigh -- and you predicted it.  Once  again, you predicted yesterday you said it was going to be a big day, and  you've been positive on Amazon for some time.</p><p>STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I remember, a half century  ago, when I was brought up on the idea that if you are truly rich, you  could live on the interest from the interest from your capital.  I suspect  that Mr. Bezos can live on the interest on the interest on the interest on  the interest from his $150 billion, but I digress.  Look, I think that big  tech investors face a bit of a problem right now, can big techl keep on  scoring 30, 40 percent increases in their profits and their revenue?   That's a very tough row to hoe, but that's the situation as of now.  </p><p>If you look at Netflix, which I consider a big name technology company,  they're going to be down, what, 10, maybe 11 percent this morning because  they missed their expectations, they missed their new subscribers.  So,  there's a big question here for all of big tech, is it the end of the road  or should I buy more, or just do nothing and let it ride?  Very interesting  question today.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe the expectations have to come in just a little.   When you have expectations all the way up there, hard to have any room for  error.</p><p>VARNEY:  I hate expectations.  You know what I feel about that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.</p><p>VARNEY:  You will.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know you got a lot more on \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  Join Stuart  top of the hour at 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  But first,  Bryce Harper winning this year's home run derby.  More of the highlights  next as we head to Nationals Park in D.C.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Fireworks at the home run derby.  Hometown hero,  Bryce Harper, wowing the crowd as Washington, D.C., gets ready for  tonight's all-star game.  Connell McShane with the details from Nationals  Park.  Connell?</p><p>CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, there, good morning,  Maria, kind of fun to be here in Washington talking some baseball instead  of politics for a change.  89th Major League Baseball all-star game will be  tonight on the Fox broadcast network, and the first time they've had it  here in D.C. since back in 1969 when it was the Senators, not the Nationals  playing in this city.  But as you said it, last night, a lot of fun with  the home run derby.  Let's take a look at some of the highlights, Bryce  Harper, obviously with the favorite go again given the hometown guy and he  came out dressed for the occasion with stars and stripes bandana.  But I  got to tell you, for Harper got a run from his -- for his money from the  Cubs' Kyle Schwarber.  </p><p>Now, Schwarber, the power left-handed hitter hit more than 20 home runs in  the semi-final run of the derby and then in the final, he kind of set the  pace.  He went first, did Schwarber, and he put 18 on the board.  So,  Harper knew he had to make a good run at it.  He got off to a slow start in  the final.  When Harper came up, his dad pitching too him, just couldn't  get the rhythm.  Took a time-out which you're allowed to do in the home run  derby, kind of take a deep breath, set himself, and then he really got  going on some kind of a run, and hit the game-winning home run with two  hands in the air.  The big celebration in front of the hometown crowd.  </p><p>So, sometimes that's more exciting, Maria, than the game.  We'll see how  things go tonight but I know there was a lot of buzz here in the stadium  for the derby last night.  We'll have plenty more throughout the day  (INAUDIBLE) the game is on Fox tonight, so we'll speak to some of the stars  there (INAUDIBLE) Alex Rodriguez and others, and maybe a few surprise  guests, so we'll see you throughout the day here from Nationals Park.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Awesome.  Great coverage, Connell, thanks.  We'll be tune in.   Have fun, Connell McShane.  Remember to watch the MLB All-Star game tonight  at 8:00 p.m. Eastern on Fox.  Coming up, we got final thoughts from this  all-star panel.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Lindsey Bell?</p><p>BELL:  I think Netflix -- we're getting a gift.  This is a buying  opportunity.  They're spending more on content than anyone else, and I  think they will bode guidance.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Even the stock is where it is.  All right, Jon  Hilsenrath?</p><p>HILSENRATH:  9:15 we're going to get really strong data on manufacturing  sector.  10:00 a.m. we're going to have Jay Powell saying the economy is in  great shape.  Despite all of these angsts right now about what's happening  on the trade front, the economy is in pretty good shape.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  It sure is.  And we're going to get a 4-1/2 percent number on  GDP, you said.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  That's the estimate from the Atlanta Feds for now.  But  the reason that there is so much optimism is because those tax cuts for  corporations, they're permanent.  Regardless of what the President says or  does not say, that's something that companies can take to the banks.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And today, they're going to try to come up with Tax Plan 2.0  and make the individual cuts permanent.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Right.  And maybe turn the attention to the economy and away  from what happened in Helsinki.</p><p>HILSENRATH:  I'm waiting for them to do something about the deficit.  It's  nice to have those tax-cuts but we've got very good --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Good luck.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  Thanks, everybody.  Great show.  Right to  Varney we go.  That'll do it for us.  Have a great day, everybody.  Here's  Stuart.  Stu?</p><p>VARNEY:  Here I am, and good morning, Maria, and good morning, everyone. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Welcome back, everybody.  I'm Maria Bartiromo and it is Tuesday, July 17th.   Your top stories right now 8:00 a.m. on the East Coast.  Taking on Amazon,  Wal-Mart and Microsoft team up on a new cloud deal.  Microsoft CEO Satya  Nadella telling me in an exclusive interview why the partnership is  crucial.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SATYA NADELLA, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MICROSOFT:  Everything that we  think about, every places being digitized whether it's a retail outlet or a  hospital, a stadium, your home or your workplace is increasingly comPuting,  it's getting embedded in the real world.  And in the case of Wal-Mart is a  good example because if you think about Wal-Mart they have an amazing need  today when it comes to anything around off-line commerce but they're  increasing the momentum online.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  More of my exclusive interview with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella  straight ahead.  Earnings in focus this morning on Wall Street.  Three Dow  components reporting their second quarter ahead of the opening bell.   Johnson &amp; Johnson, Goldman Sachs, and UnitedHealth are all out.  Goldman  Sachs President David Solomon will become CEO on October 1 according to the  New York Times.  The handoff to David Solomon was expected and now we know  the date October 1 a change in leadership at Goldman Sachs.  Markets this  morning look like this, futures edging lower.  The Dow Industrials now at  the low of the morning here down about 30 points.  The S&amp;P 500 down three  and the NASDAQ down 3-/2.  This after the markets finished the day mixed  yesterday.  Take a look, Dow Industrials picked up 45 points but the S&amp;P  and the NASDAQ fractionally lower on the session.</p><p> And in Europe this morning, markets are lower across the board.  The FT-100  down nine points, the CAC quarante down 25, that's a half of a percent.   And the DAX Index in Germany down a quarter of a percent.  In Asia  overnight, mixed performances, take a look the best performer was Japan,  Nikkei Average up one-half of one percent.  Amazon prime day will under way  but it got off to a rock start outages prevented customers from making  purchases yesterday.  The fallout for the retail giant on the biggest sales  day of the year.</p><p> And it was a wild night at the Home Run Derby, Bryce Harper pulling off a  last second win at his home stadium.  We have all the highlights.  All  those stories coming up this Tuesday morning and joining me to break it all  down, Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell, The Wall Street Journal global  economics editor, Jon Hilsenrath and CFRA investment strategist, Lindsey  Bell.  Great show so far guys.</p><p> LINDSEY BELL, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CFRA:  Good to be here.  And earnings  are doing very, very well, 19.6 percent on the S&amp;P 500.  90 percent of  companies beating the bottom line.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And revenue?  </p><p> BELL:  And revenue, 87 percent finish top line.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Just for the second quarter.  </p><p> BELL:  Nine percent revenue.  </p><p> JON HILSENRATH, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR:  The estimates are for  earnings of 26 or 27 percent, isn't it?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Not second quarter.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BELL:  the numbers --</p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HILSENRATH:  -- getting better as the new numbers comes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So you think the earnings period gets even better for the  second quarter?  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Could be.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We're going to keep watching that.  We want to look  at Microsoft which is of course is reporting earnings later this week.  It  is teaming up with Wal-Mart to take on Amazon.  The retail giant looking to  accelerate its digital transformation with the help of Microsoft's cloud  technology.  I spoke exclusively with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella for his  take on the partnership, privacy concerns facing technology today and where  Microsoft can continue to grow. </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) </p><p> NADELLA:  The core mission of our company really comes through in the  momentum we have.  If you think about it, we sort of describe our mission  as empowering every person in every organization on the planet to achieve  more.  In our words, our success, whatever we have of it is dependent on  our costumers succeeding in an increasingly digital world.  That's what you  see what's on the examples like Wal-Mart who's patterned deeply with us and  others.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It's interesting because this announcement with Wal-Mart, a  strategic partnership, it's a digital transformation for Wal-Mart but  you're calling this a 4-1/2 trillion opportunity.  This transformation to  digital. </p><p> NADELLA:  Yes, it's actually frustration.  If we think about it for all the  success of digital technology companies on a percentage basis of the GDP,  the worldwide GDP, I think the text banned is just around five percent.  It  is expected to go to 10 percent next 10 years.  But the real question is,  what is the opportunity for the other 95 percent of GDP or the 90 percent  of the GDP.  How are they going to use the digital technology, doing some  sense digital companies in their own right.  Whether it's any retailer like  Wal-Mart or any health company, 81 across all industries is going to look  to digital technology to bring about the next level of experience  innovation or cost savings.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And for Wal-Mart, this is a critical transition as it battles  with Amazon who of course, has been incredibly aggressive in that space.   Tell me about I.T. budgets today.  Are you seeing that increase in  technology spending?  I know that there was a pretty good lift when the tax  plan first came out in anticipation of the tax cut plan but there was  worries that things have slowed down.  Are you still seeing I.T. budgets  increase and are you seeing the kind of spend that you would expect?  </p><p> NADELLA:  No, I mean, on a long-term basis, if I had to sort of look at it,  tax spend or digital spend is absolutely going to increase just because  everything that we think about every place is being digitized whether it's  a retail outlet or a hospital, a stadium, your home or your workplace is  increasing comPuting, it's getting embedded in the real world.  Every  experience is being driven by more and more A.I. capability.  So that's  what's going to keep driving more tax spend.  It's going to essentially --  I think over the world's operating expense as well as cogs are being  digitized.  And in the case of Wal-Mart is a good example because if you  think about Wal-Mart, they're having amazing lead today when it comes to  anything around off-line commerce.  But they're increasing their momentum  online.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Is the priority for companies today whether big or small,  because let's not forget Microsoft is really the priority for smaller and  midcap companies as well in addition to the G.E.s and the Wal-Marts of the  world.  But is the spend priority in terms of security right now or is it  cloud?  Where would you see the priority is in terms of corporate spending?  </p><p> NADELLA:  I would say the number one priority is around productivity and  digital transformation. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Was it the tax cut plan that encouraged you to take some money  back to the U.S.?  </p><p> NADELLA:  I mean, I think we've had a pretty balanced approach.  First and  foremost we are being very aggressive spenders in R&amp;D dollars and operating  expenses right here in the United States.  And if you look at what we do,  we do (INAUDIBLE) $30 plus billion spend every year, and majority 85  percent of it is right here in the United States.  And so we continue to  bet on the organic growth and innovation but we are complementing that,  whether it's with LinkedIn or pending acquisition or GitHub or what you did  earlier with Minecraft.  We are looking for assets that can complement what  we do well and as well as dividends and buybacks.  So, we think having that  approach which is some in some sense more stable across all various  different forms and spend patterns in business cycles is important.  But at  at the end of the day what matters to us is continue to drive the  innovation and growth in this company.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  You have been in China for a long time and I have a stat here,  someone said to me that there was expectation that 97 percent of companies  in China use Microsoft Windows and more than 90 percent do not pay for it.   You have been dealing with piracy this for a long time.  What can you tell  us about it?  </p><p> NADELLA:  I mean, I think one of the fundamental things that been -- have  been our approach in China is to be able sort of to look to how -- what do  their customers and the government there value and how do we in some sense  adapt the business models that allow us to succeed there.  I think  intellectual property needs to be protected.  I think it's China's own  interest to given that they now are big intellectual property creators  themselves to help ensure that intellectual property like software is  protected and that's something that we have a good dialogue with the  Chinese government.  And I think the voices coming out of Washington are  all good which is we want fair trade between countries.  I believe that the  next 10 years, 20 years, 30 years whatever your time frame is is going to  be defined by how the United States and China not only create an  equilibrium between themselves but also for the rest of the world.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  But, you know, China won't even admit that they're stealing our  I.P.  So how do you change that behavior?  Is there any way to stop that?  </p><p> NADELLA:  Yes.  I mean, absolutely.  I mean, first of all, for example as  we move to the cloud, you see a shift in how people acquire intellectual  property and that by itself I think is very helpful but overall, I think  every country that's going through a massive transformation internally and  socially and economically, I am of the belief that when you get to a  certain level of GDP and GDP growth, comes with it responsibility for  protecting things like intellectual property.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I mean, most people understand the issues around China  because of that intellectual property theft but the aluminum and steel  tariffs are something different.  Are you expecting an impact as a result  of these tariffs?  </p><p> NADELLA:  You know, for us, we don't see anything today in our outlook.   The overall I think, this entire world order so to speak that we've seen is  based on a predictable model of how goods are produced and distributed and  how well you add work.  And I'm hoping that we'll come back.  I think the  President has said that what he wants is fair deals, and so I hope that as  we negotiate them that we come back to a stable environment.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Satya, obviously privacy has become the issue within the text  base and in Silicon Valley particularly after the Cambridge Analytica  scandal over at Facebook.  A lot of people are expecting a heavier hand as  it relates to technology.  Are you expecting a new round of rules or  regulations coming out of Washington and how will you adapt?  </p><p> NADELLA:  You know, privacy in my opinion is now become a human right and  that's how I think of it when it comes to our products and services.  And  the customers and consumers everywhere are going to demand it and expect it  in our products.  That's why we were very, you know, aggressive and in  terms of responding to GDPR, in terms of implementation and we don't even  think of GDP as just a one point in time regulation.  It requires an  ongoing commitment to compliance around privacy.  And I think that -- I  fully expect that more countries and more geographies including the United  States are going to take a, you know, a lead from what the Europeans have  done.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Let's talk about your contract with the U.S. Immigration and  Customs enforcements.  Obviously a lot of noise around this, given the  separation of families.  I know your contract with ICE involves the legacy  mail, e-mail, calendar, messenger and documents.  Is there a potential for  using the facial recognition as well?  </p><p> NADELLA:  We have been very clear, in fact, a multiple years ago is when I  wrote about RAI principals and how we are going to make sure that A.I.  technology that we build and how it's used is always going to be driven by  set of enduring principles.  Now, one of the things that we recognize is  with A.I. technology with all the benefits comes from unintended uses.   Like bias or facial recognition.  And so therefore, we are very clear that  we will not participate in any project that is going to be against, you  know, fundamental human rights.  And in this case, what we are doing with  ICE is to support them in the core infrastructure around e-mail but we are  not at all involved in any of the facial recognition technology and their  use cases.  But more importantly we think that its' not just about a single  company having principal approach which we do but it's also having a set of  rules and regulations especially in a democracy like ours.  Instead of us  trying to govern the government, I think the legislative process should  govern the companies and their technologies and the uses.  That's what the  blog, the Brad Smith wrote last week really outlines and we in fact welcome  any regulation and any expert comedy that the legislative process creates.   And then the rules and policies that come out of it.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  I was looking at Brad Smith's post and the truth is is we  are in sort of an uncertain term -- time.  When you look at A.I. and  machine learning, there's a balance to walk here that these things are  making our lives so much easier but at the same time people worried that it  is in fact infringing on our privacy.  There is that balance that  Microsoft, the entire tech sector has to -- has to walk.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's absolutely correct.  When it will comes to things like  security or cybersecurity, privacy in A.I., I think in all of these cases  two things need to happen.  One is  companies like us at Microsoft, we need  to take responsibility and protect privacy as a human right, ensure things  like we are doing with cybersecurity, like the Tech Accord.  I think cover  as like the Geneva Convention in the cybersecurity world.  As well as have  ethical principles that drive the development and the use of A.I.  But on  top of it, I think the governments around the world also have their role. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  As Congress plans to come up with a new solution here going  into midterm elections, what kind of a legal immigration system would you  like to see?  </p><p> NADELLA:  You know, first of all, Maria, I am a product of I think two  amazingly unique things,  American, one is American technology that reached  me where I was growing up and letting me dream the dream and American  immigration policy that then allowed me to come here, get an education and  live that dream.  So I'll always come from that personal experience to  advocate for and enlighten immigration policy that allows the -- for the  best and the brightest to come to the United States, participate in our  economy, pay taxes, create innovations that are going to make us more  competitive globally.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you finding employees that you need to put in the jobs that  you have open?  Recently we learned that there are more job openings than  actually people to fill those jobs.  </p><p> NADELLA:  I mean, I think we are seeing definitely growth is much faster  and so therefore we have always have insatiable need for new talent and  better talent.  Be definitely can employ more people but at the same time I  think this fantastic people in the right here in the schools in the United  States as well as in the industry.  So I think that yes, immigration,  policy reform is required but I would not sort of use that as only thing  that is required in order for us to continue to grow in the united states.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, final question here, Satya.  Obviously you're doing a  lot, right?  How does it feel sitting on the doorstep of a $1-trillion  market value from Microsoft right now? </p><p> NADELLA:  For us I think, Maria, is going to come down to what I said which  is how can we ensure that we stay focused on building technologies that are  relevant in helping our customers.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Satya, it's great to see you today.  Thanks so much.  And  congratulations to you.  </p><p> NADELLA:  Thank you so much, Maria.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We'll be right back.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>  BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  As we told you earlier, Goldman Sachs announced  that David Solomon will take over for Lloyd Blankfein as CEO beginning  October 1.  Nicole Petallides is on the floor of the New York Stock  Exchange with details looking at the stock.  Nicole, good morning.  </p><p> NICOLE PETALLIDES, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Good morning, Maria.  So  it's finally official, I mean, David Solomon has been speculated to be the  succession to Lloyd Blankfein in this top role particularly after the  Goldman co-President Harvey Schwartz was out.  And so now, he is going to  take the helm on October 1st.  He will be the third Goldman CEO since it  went public in 1999.  Of course, Hank Paulson who have gone on to be  treasury secretary under George W. Bush, then Lloyd Blankfein and now David  Soloman.  Veteran investment banker will be taking over on October 1st.   Now we're also -- by the way, he's also a D.J., that was another underlying  story on his spare time which I thought was really cute in Miami, New York,  and Bahamas.  Let's take a look also at the numbers.  You can see that the  stock is down about a quarter of a percent.  They did beat on profit and  revenue.  Revenue was listed by fixed income where they're not able to make  it as the trading revenue clients are just a little spooked by the sharp  price moves and so the strength certainly with investment banking and that  was a winner.  Johnson &amp; Johnson, that is up right now after a beat strong  dollar did hurt, defending itself in the talc issues.  And last but not  least, you are seeing UnitedHealth to the downside.  The premiums missed  and also medical loss ratio missed estimates but they did raise a forecast  and did have some good numbers but a couple of misses weighing on the  stock.  Back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Stock down almost two percent UnitedHealth.  Thank  you, Nicole.  Coming up.  Amazon prime day starts with a glitch.  Problems  with the retail giant's Web site.  Shoppers searching for deals later this  hour.  Then there is, Bryce Harper making an epic comeback.  The highlights  from last night's Home Run Derby coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Trade tensions escalating in the United States.   Filing complaints against trading partners including Canada, China, the  European Union.  This after lawsuits were filed against the U.S.  through  the World Trade Organization over the steel and aluminum tariffs.  Joining  us right now is Ian Bremmer, President of the Eurasia Group and GZERO  Media.  Ian, great to see you this morning.  </p><p> IAN BREMMER, PRESIDENT, EURASIA GROUP:  Hi, Maia.  Good morning to you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What progress is being made on the trade front?  Where are you  in this trade dispute whether if it would with China or our allies on  aluminum and steel?  </p><p> BREMMER:  So far, as you say, we have a dueling suits that have been put in  place with the World Trade Organization.  The the good news is that for  those that were saying that there is draft, you know, sort of order going  around from -- in the White House saying that Trump wants to withdraw the  United States from the WTO, that was never feasible in terms of Congress.   And it was never something that the Trump administration in any had a  consensus in moving towards.  They are using the WTO as the allies are, as  China is and if this ends up getting resolved by the established  multilateral trade organization over years, that's a much better place to  be than unfettered escalation on trade.</p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Ian, it's Dagen McDowell.   The commerce department under President Trump is studying this potential  tariff on automobile imports into the United States, maybe 20 percent,  maybe higher.  They're looking at it right now.  I believe there is a  hearing even later this week.  Do you think that just ultimately gets  tabled because again they would try to argue that it's a -- that auto  imports are risk to our national security potentially which just seems  ludicrous.  </p><p> BREMMER:  Yes.  But it seems ludicrous to make that argument for steel and  aluminum with say the Canadians but they still made it.  So, I mean, the  fact is that you have a regulation and you've got people that are looking  to find any way to press forward with a political posture that they want to  pursue.  Look, we know that when you talk to CEOs and businesspeople in the  U.S., it's not the Helsinki meeting between Trump and Putin that they're  worried about, they're worried about Trump's stance on trade.  And they  certainly believe and it's a -- it's true that if we press forward with  these automotive tariffs that you're going to see, a significant hit to  American workers, a significant hit to a lot of these American businesses. </p><p> BARTIROMO:  By the way, Kevin Brady said that, he said that that's' going  to show up in the economic numbers later this year, Jon.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Well, you know, you raised Helsinki and I want to -- I want to  ask you about that.  The President goes to Europe and he calls the European  allies foes and then turns to Helsinki and has a pretty compatible  interaction with Putin.  How do you think America's European allies are  looking at that Helsinki meeting and how does that shape the way they're  going to respond to our trade stance and the challenge that the President  is putting in front of them on autos and all these other goods?  </p><p> BREMMER:  Well, look, I mean, to be clear, it was very strange when Trump  referred to the E.U. as a foe but then after that, he said China is also a  foe, Russia is also a foe.  So, the problem is that Trump clearly has a  better set of relationships personally with authoritarian leaders around  the world like Erdogan who he fist bumps at the NATO Summit in front of  everyone else.  Like Kim Jong-un, like Putin then he does with a lot of the  allies.  So obviously, the toxicity of the transatlantic relations, despite  the fact that we have much closer relationships is a problem.  On the other  side, you look at Putin, it's very clear that Trump wants a better  relationship with Putin.  It's also very clear he's not going to get one.   There is a reason why Trump spent over two hours with Putin in private and  not with his advisories.  It's not because he was worried that the advisers  were going to say something out of turn that was more hawkish.  Those  advisers don't say boo unless Trump turns to them and says Mr. Pompeo,  Mike, do you want to comment and say something, right?  The issue is they  don't agree with him.  They have a harder line policy on Russia as the  Republican Party does and they would have leaked like crazy if they were in  that room.  U.S. sanctions against Russia are still in place and there are  harder line than they were under Obama.  U.S. defense spending is up.   Trump didn't say anything on recognition of Crimea, he didn't suspend NATO  or U.S. military activities in the Baltics.  He certainly didn't say we're  going to take U.S. troops out of Syria.  So as embarrassing as yesterday  was from the perspective the of American President standing on the stage  and providing moral equivalency with President Trump -- Putin, we need to  recognize that the -- that actually U.S. policy towards Russia under the  Trump administration is likely to be harder line at the end of 2018 than it  was today. </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> HILSENRATH:  Do you think we dial up --</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's a really good point.  </p><p> HILSENRATH:  Do you think we dial up sanctions on the Russians?  We did it  earlier this year when previous allegations of interference in our  elections came out.  Do we take these latest Mueller allegations and add to  the sanction list?  </p><p> BREMMER:  I think we do.  I think that Congress will continue to move in  that direction as we see evidence -- intelligence evidence of the Russians  engaged in the creation of more fake accounts and disinformation and  cyberattacks around the midterm elections.  Certainly in terms of  cyberattacks against American critical infrastructure which is the single  piece I was most concerned that Trump did not bring up publicly.  It's the  one that's the greatest danger in area of confrontation between the two  countries.  Congress is not backing off from that, Trump's own advisers are  not backing off unless they all resign, there's no question that's where  most of the Republican Party across the board is heading this year.  I  think we will see tougher sanctions, another round that comes down from the  Americans against Russia later this year irrespective of whether that's  what Trump wants or not.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's what Jon Hilsenrath actually said earlier.  Yes.  That's  a really good point, Ian.  Thanks so much for joining us this morning, Ian.</p><p> BREMMER:  My pleasure, guys.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good to see.  Ian Bremmer there.  Coming up.  President Trump  headed to the Hill to discuss tax reform 2.0.  We'll head to Washington,  D.C. as well for all the details next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.

But, first, President Trump is putting  another round of tax reforms on the fast track.  Kristina Partsinevelos is  in Washington this morning with all the details.  Kristina, good morning.</p><p> KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning.   That is Tax Reform 2.0.  That's what they're calling it.  You have some  Republicans that are going to be meeting with the President this afternoon.   What they're going to expect to some changes from the first set of tax cuts  that happened about a year ago.  What am I talking about changes?  They  were, we know, the corporate tax rate went from 35 percent to 21 percent.   We know individual tax rates changed for the vast majority of Americans.</p><p> And I'd like to highlight just two income brackets.  You have those that  made around $38,000 to about $82,000, they saw their tax bracket dropped  from 25 percent to 22 percent.  However, if you're also, you know, making a  little bit more money over $500,000, you saw your tax rate drop from 39.6  percent to 37 percent as well.  So, both sides of the income brackets --  for across the board, they did benefit from these tax cuts.  The problem is  these individual tax cuts are set to expire in 2025.  President Trump  weighed in, listen to what he had to say about these tax cuts.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We're doing a phase two,  we'll be doing it probably on October, maybe a little sooner than that.   And it will be more of a middleclass.  We did a lot for the middleclass but  this will be even more aimed at the middleclass.  One of the things we're  thinking about is bringing the 21 percent down to 20, and then, for the  most part, the rest of it would go right to the middleclass.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  And what we know is Tuesday, they want to extend these  individual tax rates, there's possibility about having universal savings  account.  There's also talk about small businesses and how small businesses  can help retirement plans, specifically, encouraging small employers to  offer retirement savings programs as well as annuities that would turn  workers' savings into a guaranteed annual income.  I know, Maria, you spoke  on Wall Street to Kevin Brady, he's the chairman of the tax rating  committee, and he also weighed in about how this could be beneficial to  future growth in the American economy.  Listen in.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> REP. KEVIN BRADY (R), TEXAS:  President Trump's tax cuts and reforms was  about changing the economic direction of the country for the better, 2.0 is  about changing the culture in Washington, where we don't wait 30 years  between fixing the tax code, we get better every year, we continue to lead  the rest of the world here.  And so, you're going to see, I think,  permanence of the middleclass cuts and the small business cuts will be the  centerpiece of this.  And people, I think, overlook the growth impact long  term.  That alone could help create a million and a half new jobs in  America, continue to raise paychecks significantly in the long term.  So,  that will be the centerpiece of it.  We're working with the President on  the rest of the elements of 2.0.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  So, Kevin Brady did highlight that they want to make it  permanent.  That's going to be the huge obstacle within the House because a  lot of people have discussed, how high the deficit has ballooned because of  these tax cuts.  So, they're going to need about 60 votes and a lot of even  Republicans have voiced some unease regarding this deficit.  They want to  push this forward before midterms as well.  Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  How do you pay for it?  The question keeps coming up.   Kristina, thank you.  </p><p> PARTSINEVELOS:  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Kristina Partsinevelos.  Let's turn to North Korea's nuclear  ambitions hours after the Helsinki summit with Russia's President.   President Trump revealed that Vladimir Putin will help the United States  deal with North Korea and nuclear weapons.  Here's what the President told  Sean Hannity last night.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> TRUMP:  You know, if look at Russia and the United States, that's 90  percent of the nuclear weapons.  And --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> TRUMP:  -- doing something and working on other countries.  And he also  said he wants to be very helpful with North Korea.  We're doing well with  North Korea, we have time.  There's no rush.  You know, it's been going on  for many years.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Joining me now is the former deputy defense secretary under  George W. Bush and former ambassador to Indonesia, Paul Wolfowitz.   Ambassador, good to see you this morning, thanks very much for joining us.</p><p> PAUL WOLFOWITZ, FORMER UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR TO INDONESIA:  Nice to be  with you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Your reaction to what you just heard?</p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  Look, we've been dealing with the North Korea issue for many  years.  I thought the whole idea was to try to get it behind us then to do  it reasonably quickly.  I'm worried that we're getting now mired in this  strategic patience of waiting step-by-step and the North Koreans will  continue to extract more and more as we go.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So, what should the President do then at this point?  I mean,  it was pretty historic that they met.  We thought that we would see more  progress.  Are we seeing progress?</p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  It seems to me we're not seeing progress.  If anything, things  seem to be going backward in terms of what the North Koreans are saying  when they denounce the Secretary of State as a gangster after their  meetings with him, and we're trying to pretend the meetings were fine.   There's something wrong there.  You know, in his own book, President Trump  wrote years ago that in negotiating, it's important to know when to walk  away, otherwise you start to seem desperate.  And I worry that we may be  starting to seem too eager for an agreement, and that's a bad way to get  there.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's interesting.  And your thoughts on the Helsinki meeting,  and the -- and the press conference with Putin?</p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  Well, of course, we don't know much about the meeting except  the press conference.  But the press conference by itself is very  important.  And I hate to say this, but I think -- well, I don't hate to  say this part, Putin is a classic KGB bully, with former President Bush, he  even showed him his big Russian wolfhound and said, see, bigger, faster,  stronger than your little scotch terrier.  That's the kind of man he is,  and I think, Americans often make the mistake, and I think maybe President  Trump made this mistake, of thinking the way to improve relations with  someone like that is to be nice to them.  They just interpret that as  weakness.  </p><p> We have a lot of business to do with Russia, it's true.  We could do with a  better relationship, we could do with less close relationship between  Russia and China, but that's not come -- going to come about by having  Putin underestimate us and I'm afraid if the tone of the private meeting  was like the press conference, where Putin dismissively said, what makes  you think after Trump had said everything changed four hours ago, Putin  dismissively says, why do you think we trust one another?  It doesn't bode  well.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  It reminds me, actually, Maria, of when President Kennedy met  with, I guess, he was called General Secretary at the time, Nikita  Khrushchev of the Soviet Union.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Right.</p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  In Vienna in 1962, I think.  It was interpreted as Kennedy  being weak and was followed not so long afterwards by the Cuban missile  crisis.  You need to make sure he takes this deadly serious.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But what do you think about the policies?  When you look at the  policies that the U.S. has put in place, as it relates to Russia, whether  it'd be sanctions, or troops, or you know, poking the Germans for having  the gas pipeline deal?  When you look at the policies versus the  appeasement that we saw onstage yesterday, they're very different, aren't  they?</p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  They are somewhat different.  They're not as different as they  might be, but -- I think -- I mean, part of the problem, to be fair to the  President, our President is that we're in a pretty deep hole in Syria and  in Ukraine, and it's not clear how you dig out of that hole but we do need  more pressure, and I think tougher sanctions would be appropriate.  But I  think something else we ought to be looking at is exposing what we know  about Putin's corruption which I believe goes very, very deep.  And the  U.S. Justice Department has an ability to expose that which would be a huge  pressure on Putin.  We ought to think about doing something like that in my  opinion.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Really interesting.  Let me -- let me move over to the border  crackdown.  The National Guard which has been part of the stepped up  immigration efforts has helped border agents arrest more than 10,000  illegal immigrants just since April.  This comes as House GOP leaders are  set to hold a vote tomorrow in support of all the Immigration and Customs  Enforcement officers and denounce the calls by Democrats to abolish the ICE  agencies.  What do you make of the democratic attempt to abolish ICE?  I  mean, obviously, that stance has quicklu fallen apart.</p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  I think you've just said it right there.  We have to have  immigration enforcement, we have to have border enforcement.  I think  sometimes ICE officials may get too aggressive about keeping people out of  that treating immigrants -- or treating everyone as the illegal one whether  they are or not.  And certainly, we made, if nothing else, a mistake in  this handling of the children that we separated from their parents.  I  think we're on the way to correcting that, and I think -- I think at the  heart of this immigration issue, unfortunately, is a kind of canyon between  the two sides, of one side saying, we really don't need any border  enforcement at all, and I think that enrages most Americans who'll say,  what the heck are you talking about here?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, I totally agree with that.  Let me ask you, Secretary,  look across the world for us, where do you see the biggest risks in terms  of foreign policy right now for the United States?</p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  You know there's a big difference between the risks right now  and the risks further in the future.  Further -- and I'm going to go  further in the future first because I think that is where China is  potentially our biggest problem, it's a huge strong country that is clearly  on an expansion in a kind of imperial mode.  And that's the reason, by the  way, in defense of trying to improve relations with Russia, to see if we  can separate the two of them, instead of having them be close buddies which  is where they are now.  But I think in terms of immediate risks, North  Korea is clearly one of the most serious ones.  And I don't think we're  making a progress with the speed that we thought we could, or that we  should be able to do.  So, I think we need to think about a tougher policy  probably with North Korea than we've had.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  What's the tougher policy?  Like, what would be the most  important policy this President could adopt?</p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  Look, I think that regime is very vulnerable to economic  sanctions.  It's a miserable economy but they have to keep paying their  policemen and their guards, and when they start running out of money to do  that, I think it -- something that has to make them very nervous.  And we  went further with sanctions under this President than we have in the past,  but I think there's still a long way that we could be going.  So basically  shut them out of the international financial system and to shut down people  who are helping them like Chinese companies.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.  Yes, really good point.  Ambassador, it's great to see  you this morning, thanks very much for your insights.</p><p> WOLFOWITZ:  You're very welcome.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  We appreciate it very much.  Paul Wolfowitz joining us there.   Coming up, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is crowned the richest man alive.   Richest man in the planet.  The details on the jaw-dropping net worth of  the founder of Amazon.  Then, Bryce Harper making an epic comeback, the  highlights from last night's home run derby, coming up.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  So, Amazon's Prime Day wasn't exactly ready for  primetime.  Deirdre Bolton is in New York City with all the details on  that.  Deirdre, hello, good morning to you.</p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hello, Maria, good morning.   I'm in front of Whole Foods which as you will remember, Amazon bought for  upwards of $13 billion last year, but you mentioned these glitches for  Prime Day which started yesterday at 3:00 p.m. Eastern Time, yes, for about  three hours, Maria.  If you were trying to buy something, you actually  couldn't pay for it which I'm pretty sure is about the worst thing can  happen to a retailer.  Social media, you have this whole #goingaround which  was #PrimeDayFail.  But I want to let you know that statistically, it was  still a win for Amazon even in those dicey three hours, shoppers have still  spent more than 54 percent more in those first three hours than they did on  Prime Day this time last year.  So, you may wonder or for our viewers who  may wonder, what exactly is Prime Day, this is the fourth annual run at it  for Amazon, it equals Black Friday as far as the numbers go.  </p><p>Amazon has more than a million deals today, Maria, they want you to buy  Fire Stick, Echo Dot, that was the big seller last year.  They also want  you to buy groceries.  They didn't buy Whole Foods for nothing.  So, if you  show up here, if you're an Amazon Prime Member who has not yet gotten a  grocery deliver from Whole Foods, if you go today, you spend more than  $10.00, you get $10.00 off of future order and another one as well.  All of  this, glitches included, we have to say have not hurt the founder and CEO,  Jeff Bezos.  He is the world's richest man, at least measured in modern  U.S. dollars of 150 billion U.S. is his worth.  The stock is up 55 percent  this year, Maria, that has added $50 billion just to his pocket alone.  </p><p> So, he has passed Bill Gates, of course, the founder of Microsoft.  Jeff  Bezos has also passed the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett, he has passed  Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook.  And a lot of people somewhat critical of Jeff  Bezos saying, OK, well, how come he isn't giving more of his money away,  all of those other people that I mentioned obviously have plans in place.   But he is working on building infrastructure in space, that has been the  answer untold but that takes a lot of money.  Maria?</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible, Deirdre, $150 billion value -- net wealth of  Jeff Bezos.  Pretty incredible.  Deirdre, thank you, we will be watching  Amazon shares and where Bezos' wealth goes next.  Can you believe that, you  guys, $150 billion?</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Here's to Varney about to weigh -- and you predicted it.  Once  again, you predicted yesterday you said it was going to be a big day, and  you've been positive on Amazon for some time.</p><p> STUART VARNEY, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  I remember, a half century  ago, when I was brought up on the idea that if you are truly rich, you  could live on the interest from the interest from your capital.  I suspect  that Mr. Bezos can live on the interest on the interest on the interest on  the interest from his $150 billion, but I digress.  Look, I think that big  tech investors face a bit of a problem right now, can big techl keep on  scoring 30, 40 percent increases in their profits and their revenue?   That's a very tough row to hoe, but that's the situation as of now.  </p><p> If you look at Netflix, which I consider a big name technology company,  they're going to be down, what, 10, maybe 11 percent this morning because  they missed their expectations, they missed their new subscribers.  So,  there's a big question here for all of big tech, is it the end of the road  or should I buy more, or just do nothing and let it ride?  Very interesting  question today.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, maybe the expectations have to come in just a little.   When you have expectations all the way up there, hard to have any room for  error.</p><p> VARNEY:  I hate expectations.  You know what I feel about that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Stu, we'll see you in 10 minutes.</p><p> VARNEY:  You will.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know you got a lot more on \"VARNEY &amp; COMPANY.\"  Join Stuart  top of the hour at 9:00 a.m. right after MORNINGS WITH MARIA.  But first,  Bryce Harper winning this year's home run derby.  More of the highlights  next as we head to Nationals Park in D.C.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  Fireworks at the home run derby.  Hometown hero,  Bryce Harper, wowing the crowd as Washington, D.C., gets ready for  tonight's all-star game.  Connell McShane with the details from Nationals  Park.  Connell?</p><p> CONNELL MCSHANE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, there, good morning,  Maria, kind of fun to be here in Washington talking some baseball instead  of politics for a change.  89th Major League Baseball all-star game will be  tonight on the Fox broadcast network, and the first time they've had it  here in D.C. since back in 1969 when it was the Senators, not the Nationals  playing in this city.  But as you said it, last night, a lot of fun with  the home run derby.  Let's take a look at some of the highlights, Bryce  Harper, obviously with the favorite go again given the hometown guy and he  came out dressed for the occasion with stars and stripes bandana.  But I  got to tell you, for Harper got a run from his -- for his money from the  Cubs' Kyle Schwarber.  </p><p> Now, Schwarber, the power left-handed hitter hit more than 20 home runs in  the semi-final run of the derby and then in the final, he kind of set the  pace.  He went first, did Schwarber, and he put 18 on the board.  So,  Harper knew he had to make a good run at it.  He got off to a slow start in  the final.  When Harper came up, his dad pitching too him, just couldn't  get the rhythm.  Took a time-out which you're allowed to do in the home run  derby, kind of take a deep breath, set himself, and then he really got  going on some kind of a run, and hit the game-winning home run with two  hands in the air.  The big celebration in front of the hometown crowd.  </p><p> So, sometimes that's more exciting, Maria, than the game.  We'll see how  things go tonight but I know there was a lot of buzz here in the stadium  for the derby last night.  We'll have plenty more throughout the day  (INAUDIBLE) the game is on Fox tonight, so we'll speak to some of the stars  there (INAUDIBLE) Alex Rodriguez and others, and maybe a few surprise  guests, so we'll see you throughout the day here from Nationals Park.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Awesome.  Great coverage, Connell, thanks.  We'll be tune in.   Have fun, Connell McShane.  Remember to watch the MLB All-Star game tonight  at 8:00 p.m. Eastern on Fox.  Coming up, we got final thoughts from this  all-star panel.  Stay with us.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Final thoughts from this all-star panel.  Lindsey Bell?</p><p> BELL:  I think Netflix -- we're getting a gift.  This is a buying  opportunity.  They're spending more on content than anyone else, and I  think they will bode guidance.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wow.  Even the stock is where it is.  All right, Jon  Hilsenrath?</p><p> HILSENRATH:  9:15 we're going to get really strong data on manufacturing  sector.  10:00 a.m. we're going to have Jay Powell saying the economy is in  great shape.  Despite all of these angsts right now about what's happening  on the trade front, the economy is in pretty good shape.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  It sure is.  And we're going to get a 4-1/2 percent number on  GDP, you said.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  That's the estimate from the Atlanta Feds for now.  But  the reason that there is so much optimism is because those tax cuts for  corporations, they're permanent.  Regardless of what the President says or  does not say, that's something that companies can take to the banks.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  And today, they're going to try to come up with Tax Plan 2.0  and make the individual cuts permanent.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Right.  And maybe turn the attention to the economy and away  from what happened in Helsinki.</p><p> HILSENRATH:  I'm waiting for them to do something about the deficit.  It's  nice to have those tax-cuts but we've got very good --</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> (LAUGHTER)</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Good luck.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes, good point.  Thanks, everybody.  Great show.  Right to  Varney we go.  That'll do it for us.  Have a great day, everybody.  Here's  Stuart.  Stu?</p><p> VARNEY:  Here I am, and good morning, Maria, and good morning, everyone. </p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Then, by chance, I walked into one of those ubiquitous Walmart optometry centers and realized I could have had the exam and the glasses for little more than the price of the copay. That speaks volumes about our current health system.</p><p><br/>When a third party \u2014 insurance or government, for instance \u2014 pays for something, the prices escalate. What\u2019s the first thing an auto body shop asks when you take in your car to repair the fender? \u201cIs this an insurance job?\u201d If it is, the price will be higher than if you\u2019re paying for it yourself. I never asked the price of my appendix surgery last year, nor did I care. Blue Cross paid the tab.<br/>It\u2019s far worse when government is the default payer, given there are no serious controls on costs. There only are two ways to divvy up resources: pricing or rationing. As economist Thomas Sowell explains, \u201cWhat everyone wants adds up to more than there is. Market economies deal with this problem by confronting individuals with the costs of producing what they want, and letting those individuals make their own trade-offs\u2026.\u201d<br/>Healthcare is tough because everyone needs access to life-saving surgeries and drugs. Unfortunately, our policymakers look at the problem through the wrong lens. Many seek to upend an insurance-based system that works remarkably well (despite the high prices) and replace it with government-run systems that will spend the nation into penury and lead to long waits for common services (rationing).<br/>Instead of starting from scratch, policymakers ought to fill in the gaps \u2014 meet the needs of those people who are falling through the cracks of the current system. One idea goes back to that example in the first paragraph. No one will ever head to Walmart for a kidney transplant, but retail companies and profit-based clinics certainly can offer high-quality, lower-level services \u2013 and impose market discipline in a sector that sorely needs it.<br/>Walmart announced last year that it intends to provide clinics that offer low-cost X-rays, lab work, checkups and dentistry, according to a recent CNBC article. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a consumer revolution,\u201d former Apple CEO John Sculley told the news network. \u201cWhy? Because if the Walmart tests are successful, and I suspect they will be, people will be able to go in and get these kinds of health services at a lower cost than if they had health insurance.\u201d<br/>One of the biggest flaws of Obamacare is that it imposed myriad healthcare mandates, requiring health policies to cover every manner of treatment and service that politicians deemed necessary. For instance, it\u2019s silly for an insurance company to be forced to provide my wife and I, who are in our late 50s, with birth-control coverage.<br/>In other areas, we choose insurance based on our specific needs. I use insurance to protect against financially catastrophic events, not to cover minor services that I can pay for myself. Other people have different needs and priorities.<br/>Scully explained that the big tech firms \u201crealize that this is the largest remaining industry that has not been revolutionized by modern technologies that has transformed every other big industry in the United States.\u201d That\u2019s because health care, and health insurance, is dominated by government regulation and subsidy. Private companies can\u2019t revolutionize industries that are encrusted with Byzantine rules \u2014 and where price signals can\u2019t work their magic.<br/>In particular, occupational licensing rules, which are enforced by entrenched industries that want to keep out the competition, make it difficult to innovate. That\u2019s true especially in healthcare industries. One reason the gig economy has been so successful is these emergent companies have created newfangled ways to circumvent competition-stifling policies that lock inefficient systems into place. Thank goodness for clever work-arounds.<br/>If you look at prices over time, you\u2019ll find that consumer buying power has improved dramatically in industries that have the fewest government regulations. I remember when my parents bought our first color television in 1973 for $470. I still recall the price because it was such a major purchase, the equivalent of around $2,700 in today\u2019s dollars. I recently bought a fancy smart TV for 300 bucks \u2014 and chose among dozens of options.<br/>When products or services largely are immune to market pressure (because government provides, subsidizes or heavily regulates them), inflation levels are daunting. California public schools never have enough money even though per-pupil spending has soared. That\u2019s true for every public service. College tuition has soared. A day doesn\u2019t go by without some politician complaining about skyrocketing healthcare prices.

The launch of Libra proverbially lit a fire under the derrieres of the world's governments, many of which have disregarded Bitcoin and other digital assets, despite their massive bouts of growth over the past decade.While Libra is truly an innovation that has the potential to revolutionize the economy, governments have quickly expressed distaste towards the project, which is also backed by PayPal, Visa, Booking Holdings, Coinbase[1], and more.President Donald Trump vehemently came out against the proposed cryptocurrency, perpetuating his anti-Facebook (and anti-big tech) stance, as did the Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.But interestingly, experts say that similar projects from other behemoths of corporations will not face as much regulatory heat. Walmart Files Patent Mentioning 'Cryptocurrency' Last week, Walmart quietly filed a patent to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. </p><p>While the retailer likely files dozens, if not hundreds of patents each and every month, the content of this certain patent was of interest to the cryptocurrency industry.The patent is for a 'system and method of digital currency via blockchain', which would back a presumably U.S. Dollar-backed stablecoin that can be deployed to Walmart's facets. One feature mentioned would be for the cryptocurrency, let's call it WalmartCoin, to be used as a potential reward in Walmart's customer savings programs.It is important to note that there's a chance that this patent is nothing more than a corporate strategy or marketing ploy. Over the years, firms like Nike, Kodak, and Amazon have filed blockchain-related patents or made references to cryptocurrencies, but have yet to actually announce any intentions to make a bonafide sortie into the industry. A Controversial Play? With there being so much pressure on the cryptocurrency space, many have been left wondering if Walmart's potential project will end up just like Libra \u2014 in the scopes of the world's most powerful entities, governments, and bodies.According to a research note obtained by Bloomberg[2] from Cowen, a financial services firm, it isn't all too likely. In fact, analysts at the firm suggest that as WalmartCoin doesn't share the same 'global intentions' as Libra, which is slated to be rolled out to dozens of countries and backed by a basket of sovereign currencies, it may actually strike a chord with some politicians in America.Cowen wrote that Walmart may 'especially appeal to Democrats', which are looking to promote the provision of financial services to the unbanked/underbanked. Not Walmart's First Blockchain Rodeo If the retail giant ends up launching a cryptocurrency, that won't be its first rodeo in the blockchain industry. Far from, in fact.As reported by Blockonomi earlier this year[3], Walmart's division in China, which presides over 424 retail stores and a handful of corporate warehouses in the nation, joined hands with VeChain. Through this partnership, unveiled at a Chinese conference for product safety and traceability, the consortium is tracking an unnamed 23 'product lines' through blockchain.By the end of 2020 \u2014 just under 18 months away \u2014 the collective wants to trace 50% of packaged fresh meat, 40% of packaged vegetables, and 12.5% of packaged seafood that Walmart China sells through blockchain technologies.The idea is to integrate a 'traceability strategy for products and pioneer the large-scale application of blockchain traceability.' that will give consumers some peace of mind when purchasing products, which is especially important in China, where fake products are rampant and actually dangerous.Walmart has entered similar initiatives around the world, mostly teaming up with the extremely blockchain-friendly technology giant IBM to test out blockchain supply chain and food safety solutions. <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/out/coinbasebutton\">https://blockonomi.com/out/coinbasebutton</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://blockonomi.com/out/etoro\">https://blockonomi.com/out/etoro</url> eToro Risk Warning: 66% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.

Many investors would choose Apple (US:AAPL) based on its proprietary hardware and status as the world's most recognisable brand. However, there are signs that some middle-income consumers have become less inclined to meet the premium prices charged by the group. It could also be argued that Apple is overly reliant on sales through its flagship retail stores.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And because its products are essentially incompatible with other devices, punters are compelled to exclusively purchase Apple apps or accessories. Apple may have enjoyed an almost cult-like status when Steve Jobs was alive, but research from professional services group Accenture indicates that brand loyalty is becoming a more elusive quality.</p><p>Like any other business, the trillion-dollar enterprise was never invulnerable, but it is debatable whether the brand cache is quite as strong it used to be, even though the shares remain as well supported as they have ever been.</p><p>Likewise, Google parent group Alphabet (US:GOOGL), which has just posted a 52-week high. Short of some revolutionary technological innovation, it is difficult to imagine how any competitor would be able to arrest the group's growing dominance in online search, video content sharing, and internet advertising markets.</p><p>The group has achieved its primacy in these markets through its early mastery of search algorithms, in addition to the widespread adoption of its Android mobile operating system, which accounts for around three-quarters of global usage.</p><p>The sheer volume of data gathered through its numerous products and services - many of which were the result of M&amp;A - provides a key competitive advantage. However, this is now being viewed as a double-edged sword, particularly as machine learning becomes ever more advanced. The extent and application of the group's user data harvesting - and its blatant obfuscation and secrecy - has unnerved many end users and could conceivably draw a much stronger response from regulators going forward.</p><p>There are any number of business practices that have been brought into question. For example, the proliferation of paid links from advertisers at the top of the Google search page means that a much greater proportion of users never access the open web at all, instead opting for information provided by Google itself. There is a clear conflict of interest assuming the search engine's primary function is to provide dispassionate analysis of the site's user preferences. Little wonder that nearly every state regulator in the US has their sights trained on the tech giant.</p><p>Though both Apple and Alphabet enjoy market-leading positions, it is conceivable that the former's advantage could be eroded through intensified competition, while the latter tech heavyweight could eventually fall foul of antitrust regulators. It has been posited that a Democrat victory in the upcoming US election would reduce the chances of enforced break-ups given vice-presidential candidate Senator Kamala Harris's close links to Silicon Valley. </p><p>Like Alphabet, Amazon (US:AMZN) has thrived during the pandemic, but until recently you would have thought the threat of antitrust regulators would have posed the principal threat to the business. But midway through this month will see the launch of Walmart+, the eponymous retailer's answer to the Amazon Prime subscription service.</p><p>Walmart (US:WMT) is one of the few retailers with the financial clout and logistical capacity to make a sizeable dent in Amazon's volumes, at least in the US, where the latter accounts for around 40 per cent of online retail sales, largely the result of the delivery benefits linked to the Prime service.</p><p>The monthly subscription rate for Walmart+ at $12.95 is broadly in line with that of Amazon. For that outlay, customers can expect same-day delivery on more than 160,000 items, including tech, toys, household essentials, and groceries. There is also a 'Scan &amp; Go' option, which will enable members to significantly speed up the shopping process at Walmart's bricks-and-mortar outlets. There are no streaming services available, and limited pricing benefits given that the retailers already price-match each other. But members will be entitled to receive fuel discounts at Walmart's petrol stations. It is thought that the discounting may eventually extend to Walmart pharmacies.</p><p>The new service is essentially a rebranding of the existing Delivery Unlimited service, albeit with a few bells and whistles attached. This is not the first time that Walmart has tried to replicate Amazon's success in the online retail space, but you are left wondering whether the enhanced online offering is aimed at preserving Walmart's existing customer base, rather than eating into Amazon's outsized share of the market.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVONL-65678841</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RR-S761-F021-62T0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">459686</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"806\"/><timeReceived>10:53 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investorschronicle.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59811\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 3, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Many investors would choose Apple (US:AAPL) based on its proprietary hardware and status as the world's most recognisable brand. However, there are signs that some middle-income consumers have become less inclined to meet the premium prices charged by the group. It could also be argued that Apple is overly reliant on sales through its flagship retail stores.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And because its products are essentially incompatible with other devices, punters are compelled to exclusively purchase Apple apps or accessories. Apple may have enjoyed an almost cult-like status when Steve Jobs was alive, but research from professional services group Accenture indicates that brand loyalty is becoming a more elusive quality. The trillion-dollar enterprise was never invulnerable, but it is debatable whether the brand cache is quite as strong it used to be, even though the shares remain as well supported as they have ever been.</p><p>Likewise, Google parent group Alphabet (US:GOOGL), which has just posted a 52-week high. Short of some revolutionary technological innovation, it is difficult to imagine how any competitor would be able to arrest the group's growing dominance in online search, video content sharing, and internet advertising markets. The group has achieved its primacy in these markets through its early mastery of search algorithms, in addition to the widespread adoption of its Android mobile operating system, which accounts for around three-quarters of global usage.</p><p>The sheer volume of data gathered through its numerous products and services provides a key competitive advantage.</p><p>However, this is now being viewed as a double-edged sword, particularly as machine learning becomes ever more advanced. The extent and application of the group's user data harvesting - and its blatant obfuscation and secrecy - has unnerved many end users and could conceivably draw a much stronger response from regulators going forward.</p><p>There are any number of business practices that have been brought into question. For example, the proliferation of paid links from advertisers at the top of the Google search page means that a much greater proportion of users never access the open web at all, instead opting for information provided by Google itself. There is a clear conflict of interest assuming the search engine's primary function is to provide dispassionate analysis of the site's user preferences. Little wonder that nearly every state regulator in the US has their sights trained on the tech giant.</p><p>Though both Apple and Alphabet enjoy market-leading positions, it is conceivable that the former's advantage could be eroded through intensified competition, while the latter tech heavyweight could eventually fall foul of antitrust regulators. It has been posited that a Democrat victory in the upcoming US election would reduce the chances of enforced break-ups given vice-presidential candidate Senator Kamala Harris's close links to Silicon Valley.</p><p>Like Alphabet, Amazon (US:AMZN) has thrived during the pandemic, but until recently you would have thought the threat of antitrust regulators would have posed the principal threat to the business. But midway through this month will see the launch of Walmart+, the eponymous retailer's answer to the Amazon Prime subscription service.</p><p>Walmart (US:WMT) is one of the few retailers with the financial clout and logistical capacity to make a sizeable dent in Amazon's volumes, at least in the US, where the latter accounts for around 40 per cent of online retail sales, the result of the delivery benefits linked to the Prime service.</p><p>The monthly subscription rate for Walmart+ at $12.95 is broadly in line with that of Amazon. For that outlay, customers can expect same-day delivery on more than 160,000 items, including tech, toys, household essentials, and groceries. There is also a 'Scan &amp; Go' option, which will enable members to significantly speed up the shopping process at Walmart's bricks-and-mortar outlets. There are no streaming services available, and limited pricing benefits given that the retailers already price-match each other. But members will be entitled to receive fuel discounts at Walmart's petrol stations. It is thought that the discounting may eventually extend to Walmart pharmacies.</p><p>The new service is essentially a rebranding of the existing Delivery Unlimited service. This is not the first time that Walmart has tried to replicate Amazon's success in the online retail space, but you are left wondering whether the enhanced online offering is aimed at preserving Walmart's existing customer base, rather than eating into Amazon's outsized share of the market.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVSTR-162882799</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVSTR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60RX-P561-DYTY-C1T2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234036</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"784\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Financial Times Business Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Investors Chronicle - magazine and web content</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59206\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 4, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Walmart-owned Flipkart, India's e-commerce market-leader that Walmart acquired for more than $16 billion just a few months ago, has inked a deal to acquire Israeli startup Upstream Commerce. The price was not disclosed. However, the deal provides an exit for Israel-based investor YL Ventures, which has backed the pricing technology provider with seed money and at least two institutional rounds. It is seen as an important buy for Flipkart in its competition with Amazon<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/> in India, as well as potentially for the wider Walmart group, writes The Deal's Jonathan Braude in London. Upstream Commerce's cloud-based technology serves a wide range of customers from pet-care products groups Nestle Purina Petcare Co.and Petco Animal Supplies Inc.to home improvement retailer Lowe's Co. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/> and French power tools retailer Debonix, German percussion instruments seller Meinl Musikinstrumente and Singaporean online grocer RedMart.</p><p><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">We talked about how the U.S. regulators are changing their stance on big technology and today, it was Europe's turn.</emphasis> European antitrust boss and Silicon Valley b&amp;ecirc;te noire <person><nameText>Margrethe Vestager </nameText></person>held forth on the challenges of regulating Amazon, Google<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/>, Apple<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/> and an increasingly powerful tech sector at a New York conference Wednesday. \"It is important for us to understand what is the new big,\" Vestager, the Commissioner for Competition for the European Commission, explained at Bloomberg LP's global business forum. Regulators have to weigh network effects, the ability to harness big data, low marginal costs and other factors that can tip the competitive scale, she observed. \"I think our principles are fine because they are about human nature,\" she said.

You could use a smartphone to call up a car as if you were some kind of baller. You could video-chat with people anywhere in the world, like ''The Jetsons'' -- and maybe some of those people would use the new tech to throw off the yoke of repression, somehow. They were the days of miracle and wonder. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  But tech also felt confusing. There were so many new things -- every year, new phones with so much more power, made by so many new companies, all running so many new and purportedly revolutionary apps -- that it was easy to get lost in the hype. It was also easy to pick the wrong horse. There was no guarantee that this or that novelty would last until next year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  So to get the most out of innovations and avoid betting on the also-rans, my inaugural advice to readers was to follow these steps: Buy hardware from Apple. Use online services made by Google. And get digital media from Amazon.</p><p>  Now the time has come to amend and update that advice -- which is fitting, because this will be my final column in these pages. (I'm not going far: I'll be writing for The New York Times's Opinion section starting next year.)</p><p>  The tech industry in 2018 is far more consequential than it was in 2014, when I started this job. It's bigger, more pervasive and in every way more dangerous. It is also less amenable to outside pressure: The companies that run the show are more powerful than ever, and in many cases governments -- especially in the United States -- have proved ineffective at curbing their excesses.</p><p>  How should you, as an ethical and upstanding user of tech, navigate this misbegotten industry? I offer three new maxims for surviving the next era of tech. I hope you heed them; the world rides on your choices.</p><p>  Don't just look at the product. Look at the business model.</p><p>  Not long ago -- in the nascent days of smartphones, mobile apps and the mysterious ''cloud'' -- wading into the market for new tech was often risky. You might buy a phone or tablet whose maker would quickly go belly-up. A lot of stuff didn't work well: Backing up your data was a headache, keeping your photos organized across different devices was a nightmare. And even technologies that did work left you plagued with guilt and worry. Remember the curse of email spam, or how you had to pay through the nose for texting?</p><p>  Something strange and unexpected has happened in the last five years: A lot of tech got pretty good. Slowly but surely, many of our basic struggles were fixed. Nothing is perfect, but for most people, the mobile era has brought simplicity to tech for the first time.</p><p>  But ubiquitous quality has given rise to a new problem: If everything just works, how are you supposed to choose what to buy?</p><p>  My advice: Don't just consider how well a product works, but look at who's making it and how it is sold. Before you dive into any new doodad, consider a company's ethics, morals, branding and messaging. If you aren't comfortable, look to alternatives. (Last year, for instance, I switched to Lyft from Uber, and I've never looked back.) Most important, when you're choosing tech, it's wise to consider the business model -- because it's in the buying and the selling of a product, rather than in the using, that you can best figure out its dangers.</p><p>  For instance: Even though Google's Pixel line of phones is very good -- a far more affordable option with some features that iPhone users might kill for -- I stick with Apple's phones because I appreciate the simplicity of the trade. I pay Apple a huge sum of money for the device, and it takes extraordinary care in protecting me from some of the worst digital scourges.</p><p>  I don't doubt Google's capacity to make great devices. But because Google makes most of its money from ads, and because the internet ad business lies at the heart of just about every terrible thing online, I'd rather not fall deeper into that swamp.</p><p>  Similarly, I found Facebook's new video-chatting machine, Portal, to be very good, but I'll never buy it. Besides Facebook's dependence on targeted ads, the company has repeatedly breached its users' trust, not to mention the casual disregard it has shown for larger ideas like democracy. Portal is nice, but it's not that nice.</p><p>  Avoid feeding the giants.</p><p>  One thing that hasn't changed in the last five years is who's running the show. When I started writing this column, Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft were tech's biggest and most influential companies. Today, even with recent stock-market troubles, the same five giants sit at the top of the world.</p><p>  I've railed against this sort of concentration again and again -- the tech giants' increasing domination ruins innovation, undermines consumer choice and generally makes a lot of the industry ungovernable. Lawmakers around the world are now taking notice, and it's possible that in the next five years, we'll see greater regulatory curbs to the behemoths' size and scope.</p><p>  But you don't have to wait for politicians to weigh in. Your choices as a consumer matter, too -- and for a better, healthier tech industry, it's best to avoid mindlessly feeding the giants whenever you can. If you have a choice between something made by one of the Big Five and some indie brand, choose the indie.</p><p>  Here's one example: Even though I like Apple's hardware and appreciate its business model, I've stayed away from Apple Music, its subscription streaming service. For me, Spotify is superior in just about every way. Its app works better (its music recommendation algorithm is eerily good), it releases innovative features at a faster clip, and its songs play on more types of devices.</p><p>  Best of all, Spotify is an independent company. So when I pay for it, I am, in a small way, spreading the wealth in the industry.</p><p>  There are some downsides to this. Apple has shamelessly given its own service priority on its devices -- so Siri, for example, will play music from Apple's service but not from Spotify. But it's precisely this sort of mischief that I'm hoping to dissuade by putting my money elsewhere.</p><p>  There are lots of other examples for looking beyond the big guys. You can use Dropbox instead of storing all your stuff with Apple and Google. Rather than Microsoft Word or Google Docs, I write in Ulysses, a lightweight composing app that is faster and more elegant than any big-tech competitor. Whatever tech you're in the market for, there's most likely some innovative thing made by a non-giant that deserves consideration, if not your money.</p><p>  Adopt late. Slow down.</p><p>  One reason the tech industry feels as terrible as it now does is that many of us failed to appreciate the collective power of our choices. Ten years ago, smartphones looked like fun gadgets and social media seemed like a harmless pastime -- and few saw the implications for society in their ubiquity, not least the people running the companies and making this stuff.</p><p>  The lesson of the last decade is that our private tech choices can alter economies and societies. They matter. And they matter most in the mindless rush, when everyone seems to be jumping on board the latest new thing, because it's in these heady moments that we lose sight of the precise risks of turning ourselves over to tech.</p><p>  That's why the most important lesson I've gleaned in writing this column is this: Just slow down. Don't jump on the newest thing. If it isn't plagued with bugs or security nightmares, some other unexpected, emergent risk probably lies within it -- and whatever its short-term benefits, you may live to regret it.</p><p>  Yes, tech could make everything better. But we should be on guard for the ways it could make things worse -- how self-driving cars could induce sprawl, how the ''internet of things'' could provoke apocalypse, how social media could ruin democracy.</p><p>  Are these unlikely dangers? Maybe. But we live in unpredictable times. The unlikely happens. Be careful.

Everyone wants more for less.Becausehuman nature.But almost everything costs money. So we must pay for almost everything.Our connection to the Internet costs money. Since the World Wide Web's mid-1990s private sector inception, United States' Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have invested nearly $2 trillion creating, building, maintaining and expanding our networks.ISPs would like to get that money back, please. </p><p>Plus a little something, you know, for the effort[1]. Because 'a little something for the effort' - aka profit - is the only way we humans have improved our otherwise nasty, poor, brutish and short existences.And our Internet connections - are an ever-increasing bargain. Our price-per-bit of data - has dropped through the floorand continues to go down.There has all-along-the-way been another way to reduce We the Users' ISP fees. But ISPs have never implemented it.Because ISPs have been rightly, reasonably concerned about being attacked by the same Leftist mobs that are currently destroying cities all across the country.There are two pools of people ISPs can charge for the bandwidth they use:We the Users - and the monstrous bandwidth hog Big Tech companies.Big Tech?Apple (Market Cap: $1.6 trillion[2])Microsoft (Market Cap: $1.5 trillion[3])Amazon (Market Cap: $1.3 trillion[4])Alphabet (Google's parent company) (Market Cap: $938 billion[5])Facebook (Market Cap: $610 billion[6])As you know from looking at this Big Tech list - these companies use a LOT of bandwidth.The history of the Internet - is one of monstrous bandwidth hog Big Tech companies NOT being charged for the monstrous bandwidth they use.Which means the history of the Internet - is one of We the Users paying more to subsidize Big Tech's monstrous bandwidth use.Why have ISPs given monstrous Big Tech companies this monster pass? Because they have feared the Leftist mobs - funded for many years by Big Tech - screeching and attacking them about the titanically stupid policy known as Network Neutrality[7].Net Neutrality is really stupid policy - for a whole host of reasons. For our purposes today, we'll focus on but one:Net Neutrality prohibits ISPs from charging Big Tech for bandwidth usage.Which is why Big Tech has spent so many years paying the Leftist mobs to screech about Net Neutrality.Which is why - despite Net Neutrality only being actual regulation for about one year (since repealed) - ISPs have never charged Big Tech for all the bandwidth they use.No ISP wanted to be overrun by the Leftist mobs. No one wanted to become the digital version of CHAZ[8].Enter Charter Communications.Charter Seeks FCC Nod to Charge Video Streamers[9]:'Charter Communications wants permission to begin charging Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+ and other streamersfor the pleasure of efficiently carrying its traffic.'In a petition this past week to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the nation's second-largest provider of cable TV and internet services cited the flourishing online video marketplace and asked for a sunset of two notable conditions imposed on Charter's 2016 merger with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks.'Charter has to ask the government permission to engage in Economics 101 - charging people for things they use - because of another obnoxious Leftist practice: merger agreement 'conditions.'[10] Where government can't get bad law passed - so they force merging companies to agree to bad law imposed upon them piecemeal as a condition of merger approval.Charter was thus force fed Net Neutrality. So they now must ask for a waiver from that obnoxious 'condition.'What does Charter want to do? Charge a bunch of online video streaming services - for using the monstrous bandwidth they use to be online video streaming services.Imagine Charter were a chain of gas stations. And the fear of Net Neutrality Leftist mobs - had long prohibited them from charging box trucks and eighteen wheelers for the fuel they use. Which means we have been paying much more to fuel or little passenger cars - and in gas taxes to maintain and build the roads - to subsidize the trucks and tractor-trailers.Charter wishes to infuse a little sanity.This Big Tech video giveaway - has been a MASSIVE. Nothing comes close to the bandwidth used by video. It's an endless caravan of eighteen wheelers - steamrolling down the Information Superhighway.Netflix and (Google's) YouTube Make Up Majority of US Internet Traffic, New Report Shows[11]How can Netflix afford to spend more than $17 billion on content in 2020[12] - including a cool $50 million for the Net Neutrality-pushing Obamas[13] - while only charging $8 or $10 per subscription?By having you subsidize the delivery of their product - whether or not you purchase their product. You're paying more for your tiny Internet connection - to subsidize Netflix's MASSIVE free Internet connection.It's not unlike.Why the Post Office Gives Amazon a $1.46 Subsidy on Each Box[14]Where We the Taxpayers mass-subsidize the world's richest human Jeff Bezos - whether or not we order from his Amazon.Here's hoping the Donald Trump FCC - which repealed the Barack Obama FCC's Net Neutrality imposition - grants Charter the waiver.And here's hoping Charter's singular move - very quickly becomes industry standard practice.Where ISPs everywhere charge Big Tech bandwidth hogs - for being bandwidth hogs.This would be a huge infusion of cash - from the world's richest companies - LOTS of which would be used for continued massive investment in our networks.Leaving We the Users FINALLY rightly ordered in the 'People Paying for the Things They Use' Internet economic ecosystem.WAY behind the heretofore freeloading Big Tech companies.Big Tech companies - FINALLY - paying somethingmeans We the Users can pay less.[Originally posted at RedState][15] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLZFOgSSptw\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLZFOgSSptw</url> [ 2]:

everything costs money.\u00a0 So we must pay for almost everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;Our connection to the Internet costs money.\u00a0 Since the World Wide Web\u2019s mid-1990s private sector inception, United States\u2019 Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have invested nearly $2 trillion creating, building, maintaining and expanding our networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;ISPs would like to get that money back, please.\u00a0 Plus a little something, you know, for the effort.\u00a0 Because \u201ca little something for the effort\u201d \u2013 aka profit \u2013 is the only way we humans have improved our otherwise nasty, poor, brutish and short existences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;And our Internet connections \u2013 are an ever-increasing bargain.\u00a0 Our price-per-bit of data \u2013 has dropped through the floor\u2026and continues to go down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;There has all-along-the-way been another way to reduce We the Users\u2019 ISP fees.\u00a0 But ISPs have never implemented it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;Because ISPs have been rightly, reasonably concerned about being attacked by the same Leftist mobs that are currently destroying cities all across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;There are two pools of people ISPs can charge for the bandwidth they use:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;We the Users \u2013 and the monstrous bandwidth hog Big Tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\"

companies use a LOT of bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;The history of the Internet \u2013 is one of monstrous bandwidth hog Big Tech companies NOT being charged for the monstrous bandwidth they use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;Which means the history of the Internet \u2013 is one of We the Users paying more to subsidize Big Tech\u2019s monstrous bandwidth use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;Why have ISPs given monstrous Big Tech companies this monster pass?\u00a0 Because they have feared the Leftist mobs \u2013 funded for many years by Big Tech \u2013 screeching and attacking them about the titanically stupid policy known as Network Neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;Net Neutrality is really stupid policy \u2013 for a whole host of reasons.\u00a0 For our purposes today, we\u2019ll focus on but one:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;Net Neutrality prohibits ISPs from charging Big Tech for bandwidth usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;Which is why Big Tech has spent so many years paying the Leftist mobs to screech about Net Neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;Which is why \u2013 despite Net Neutrality only being actual regulation for about one year (since repealed) \u2013 ISPs have never charged Big Tech for all the bandwidth they use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;No ISP wanted to be overrun by the Leftist mobs.\u00a0 No one wanted to become the digital version of CHAZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;Enter Charter Communications\u2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;Charter Seeks FCC Nod to Charge Video Streamers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;\u201cCharter Communications wants permission to begin charging Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+ and other streamers\u00a0for the pleasure of efficiently carrying its traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;\u201cIn a petition this past week to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the nation\u2019s second-largest provider of cable TV and internet services cited the flourishing online video marketplace and asked for a sunset of two notable conditions imposed on Charter\u2019s 2016 merger with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;Charter has to ask the government permission to engage in Economics 101 \u2013 charging people for things they use \u2013 because of another obnoxious Leftist practice: merger agreement \u201cconditions.\u201d\u00a0 Where government can\u2019t get bad law passed \u2013 so they force merging companies to agree to bad law imposed upon them piecemeal as a condition of merger approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;Charter was thus force fed Net Neutrality.\u00a0 So they now must ask for a waiver from that obnoxious \u201ccondition.\u201d&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;What does Charter want to do?\u00a0 Charge a bunch of online video streaming services \u2013 for using the monstrous bandwidth they use to be online video streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;Imagine Charter were a chain of gas stations.\u00a0 And the fear of Net Neutrality Leftist mobs \u2013 had long prohibited them from charging box trucks and eighteen wheelers for the fuel they use.\u00a0 Which means we have been paying much more to fuel or little passenger cars \u2013 and in gas taxes to maintain and build the roads \u2013 to subsidize the trucks and tractor-trailers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;Charter wishes to infuse a little sanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=\" margin-left:0px;\"&gt;This Big Tech video giveaway \u2013 has been a MASSIVE.\u00a0 Nothing comes close to the bandwidth used by video.\u00a0 It\u2019s an endless caravan of eighteen wheelers

The popular move could help spur much-needed innovation and job creation -- but first, it has to get through a Senate logjam.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Senate Judiciary Committee passed a bill in April that would patch a litany of problems with the patent system, which hasn't had a major reform in more than five decades. Two months later, the measure still has no timetable for the Senate-wide vote needed to move it through Congress.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I don't know why this hasn't gotten floor time,\" Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman <person><nameText>Patrick Leahy, </nameText></person>D-Vt., said in a recent interview. \"This has nothing to do with ideology. We need an updated patent system to create and protect jobs, and it wouldn't add a penny to the deficit.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Leahy noted that the bill has three Republican co-signers, along with three Democrats. As a result, he predicted that once it gets floor time, the bill could get passed in just three days -- a blink of an eye compared to the marathon sessions it took to get stimulus, health care and financial reform passed.</p><p>The House has two similar bills under consideration, though its versions aren't as far along as the Senate's.  If the Senate bill gets passed, it would likely make its way through the House fairly quickly, Leahy said.</p><p>But with patent reform, nothing is ever that simple. House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers, D-Mich., has said he has concerns about some aspects of the Senate bill. The differences would have to be hammered out by the two chambers.</p><p>And not everyone thinks the bill will sail through as smoothly as Leahy predicts.</p><p>\"<person><nameText>Sen. Leahy </nameText></person>is right; it's not a partisan issue. It's a regional and industry-related issue, and both parties are split on it,\" said Dan Clifton, head of policy research Strategas Research Partners. \"If it did get on the floor, it's not guaranteed to get 60 votes, and it's not clear that the Senate version could get enough votes in the House.\"</p><p>Why it matters</p><p>The U.S. patent system is outdated and inefficient.</p><p>As the law stands now, inventors can sue for infringements on their intellectual property even if they never filed to patent it. Companies can request reviews after a patent has been granted to delay competitors from bring new products to market. Patent disputes take years to work out in court, and often cost both sides millions of dollars.</p><p>Meanwhile, the regulator overseeing all of this -- the U.S. Patent and Trade Office -- doesn't receive any taxpayer support and can't even set its own fees. The result is a backlog of patents over 700,000 long, with an average wait time for patent approval of more than three years.</p><p>David Kappos, director of the Patent Office, said \"millions of jobs\" are waiting in the wings as his agency works to clear its backlog. A recent Social Science Research Network study found that 76% of startup executives said patents are essential to get funding. The Harvard Business Review recently called the Patent Office \"the biggest job creator you never heard of,\" because of its role in issuing patents to startups, \"the primary source of almost all new net job growth in America.\"</p><p>Lawmakers and intellectual property experts say most of the country's patent problems aren't hard to solve. The reform bill the Senate Judiciary Committee passed in April would have \"no effect on revenues\" for the government, according to the Congressional Budget Office -- which means it won't cost taxpayers a dime to implement. The Obama administration supports the bill, and the Commerce Department recently issued a report that said patent reform would accelerate economic growth and job creation.</p><p>What's in the bill</p><p>The Senate bill consists of six main fixes to the system, which focus on making the Patent Office more efficient and the legal process more streamlined.</p><p>The biggest change that would occur is a transition to a \"first-to-file system,\" from a \"first-to-invent system.\" The United States is the only major industrialized nation that awards patents to those who can prove they invented something before someone else's patent was filed. As a result, the U.S. patent system is bogged down by legal disputes and delays as courts attempt to determine who created an invention first.</p><p>Another significant change includes allowing third parties to challenge patents before they are granted. That would cut down on post-grant court battles and making it likelier that only higher-quality patents will emerge from the process.</p><p>The bill also allow for a strong arbitration system, limits on patent violation damages, and incentives for bringing inventions to market. That last provision is intended to cut back on \"patent trolling\" -- the practice of collecting patents for creations you never plan to manufacture, then opportunistically suing alleged infringers.</p><p>Finally, the bill would allow the Patent Office to set its own fees, making it cheaper for smaller companies to file and more expensive for larger companies or those seeking more complex patents. That move would help the office raise the revenue it needs to hire the staff necessary to reduce its long backlog.</p><p>The bill isn't perfect, and it won't close all the loopholes companies use to take advantage of the system. Some groups representing smaller inventors worry that the \"first-to-file\" system will make it more difficult for individuals to file patents, as they compete with Big Tech.</p><p>But for the most part, businesses, government officials, and intellectual property attorneys are eager for Congress to act. Supporters point out that the reform bill slashes the patent application cost for \"small entities\" by 50% and \"micro-entities\" by 75%. That means some patents could cost as little as $250 to file.</p><p>\"Reform would help the U.S. economy by establishing some key principles,\" said Bijal Vakil, a partner in White &amp; Case's intellectual property team in Palo Alto, Calif. \"If the laws aren't changed, domestic and foreign companies will continue to be slammed with expensive lawsuits.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, the Patent Office isn't just sitting on its hands. As the government agency waits for Congress to sort reform out, it has made some important changes that don't require congressional approval. As a start, it began giving examiners more time for interviews and case examinations. The hope is that they'll get more approval decisions right the first time, heading off future disputes.</p><p>That change has reduced the number of post-grant reviews per patent by about 20%. As a result, the agency is on pace to get its case backlog down below 700,000 by the end of the year and below 300,000 by 2015.</p><p>But agency director Kappos says patent reform remains crucial.</p><p>\"While we're doing lots to improve our agency, I couldn't say any more strongly that patent reform is very much needed for our country,\" he said. \"This is not just about improving efficiencies, this is about our national competitiveness.\"</p><p>Kappos said he remains optimistic that a bill will pass this year. But first, it has to get to the Senate floor.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNMNY-20100621patent_reform1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNMNY2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7YS5-Y1N0-Y927-F00N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266331</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1181\"/><timeReceived>4:53 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNNMoney.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15302\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"06\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>June 21, 2010 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>patent reform</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001301</classCode><className>PATENTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000608</classCode><className>EMPLOYMENT GROWTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000980</classCode><className>JOB CREATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A2A8</classCode><className>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009X6F</classCode><className>PATENT INFRINGEMENT</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjdBMTVENTcwQTBDNDc0MkJFN0FFRjc4RkRDRUJGQTI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkQzRkZBQjVFNkJCNDdGOEE3MjZGQUY1NkVCRUQ1QjU</classCode><className>Infringement Actions</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009TD5</classCode><className>US REPUBLICAN PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001211</classCode><className>NEW PRODUCTS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST00629441</classCode><className>INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CRIME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX002075</classCode><className>HEALTH CARE REFORM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000072</classCode><className>ALLIANCES &amp;

This was serious business, and Toronto-Dominion Bank was not messing around.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Weeks earlier, I'd sent a formal request to see all my personal information held by my bank. It's the only bank I've dealt with, going all the way back to when my mom helped a six-year-old me start a savings account at the Canada Trust branch at the end of our street.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The actual contents of the envelope were a bit disappointing. According to TD, all the personal information it holds on me fits comfortably on six pages, with the last page mostly blank. Along with those six pages was a letter that was a total of four paragraphs long.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"As outlined in your letter, you have requested copies of your personal information held at TD. Please find enclosed our response to this information request,*\" the letter said in part. \"If you require further details, please ensure to visit the nearest branch, providing all details necessary to complete the request.\"</p><p>The asterisk referred to a five-paragraph note under the customer relations manager's signature, and hinted at all the information TD was declining to provide: \"Access request packages will not include any information already available through normal business processes; information on non-Canadian operations; TD Ombudsman files; or audio/video tapes (unless details of date, time and location are provided.)</p><p>Any material that may reveal confidential commercial information or is proprietary to TD has been omitted or severed where possible.\"</p><p>I received six pages worth of basic account notes and biographical information, but, ultimately, the bank had decided what information it wanted to provide. If I wanted anything more, I'd need to fight them for it.</p><p>This is how it goes when you start sending letters to corporations requesting to see all the personal information they have on you. If you dig through the terms and conditions to find the right email address, and jump through various complicated and arbitrary bureaucratic hoops, companies almost always send you something, but it's usually less than you expect, and you're left with a feeling that they're holding back on the good stuff.</p><p>In theory, it should be easy for any Canadian to find out how much personal information companies hold on them.</p><p>Under Canada's data privacy law - the Personal Information and Protection of Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) - anyone can send an email to a company asking for a copy of their personal information, and the company is required to send you everything it has within 30 days.</p><p>But if you do take on this quest for all the personal data corporations have on you, the inescapable conclusion is that Canada's data privacy law hasn't kept pace with 21st century technology, and legal compliance is half-hearted at best.</p><p>My barrage of requests met with a wide range of responses, mostly unsatisfactory.</p><p>The hunt for my data started in October 2019 when my phone alerted me that the Tim Hortons app I had installed had been logging my location in the background.</p><p>Curious, I sent a request to Restaurant Brands International Inc. (RBI) the owner of Tim Hortons, to see exactly what it knew about me.</p><p>About a month later, I received a trove of data that indicated Tim Hortons had quite detailed knowledge of my whereabouts at all hours of the day.</p><p>But part of what allowed me to understand the Tim Hortons data was that RBI gave me the data in a format that offered a huge amount of information in a way I could search and analyze. That's not always the case when making data requests.</p><p>For example, Telus Communications Inc., my cellphone carrier for more than a decade, sent me a barrage of PDF files, and, as if to impress upon me the volume and the sensitivity of my personal information, insisted on locking each file with a four-digit passcode we set up in advance.</p><p>Some of the files might have been very interesting to decipher - for example, the 285-page file that logged my mobile data usage down to the byte for a period of about four months - but since the data was all provided in a locked-down PDF, all I could do was scroll through it and observe that on Dec. 4, 2019, at 5:40 p.m. I uploaded 367,894 bytes of data and downloaded 1,880,002 bytes on my phone.</p><p>Telus also gave me a seven-page list of cell tower sites that my phone had connected to during the past year, although not with any corresponding dates or times.</p><p>Big tech companies such as Twitter Inc., Facebook Inc. and Google LLC already provide formal mechanisms to allow users to download their data, but smaller, less technology-focused companies can be much less informal.</p><p>I sent a request for all my data collected by Pizza Pizza Ltd.'s ordering app by emailing <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:privacy@pizzapizza.ca\">privacy@pizzapizza.ca</email></p><p>The reply came directly from Curt Feltner, the company's chief financial officer.</p><p>On location data specifically, Feltner wrote, \"I can confirm that the Pizza Pizza ordering app determines a customer's location but does not track and store the customer's location data movements after the order is delivered.\"</p><p>Paige Backman, a partner at Toronto-based law firm Aird and Berlis LLP, and chair of its privacy and data security group, said the companies she deals with want to comply with data privacy and disclosure regulations, but requests for information don't generally get a lot of attention.</p><p>\"Access requests are actually a very small part of what organizations see. Now, we're seeing more of them, but we don't see a significant amount of them,\" she said. \"The response to access requests varies significantly among businesses.</p><p>For example, I requested my data from McDonald's Restaurants of Canada Ltd., whose ordering app had the same access as Tim Hortons in logging my phone's location, and what I got back was much sparser than what the coffee chain provided.</p><p>The spreadsheet contained dates, restaurant locations, how much I paid for an order and precious little else. Another sheet contained a log of every time the company emailed me - mostly receipts from my mobile orders, as far as I can tell.</p><p>But if people don't think a company is giving them everything it's got, or want that data in a readable format, their only recourse is to file a complaint with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC). That seems like a lot of fuss to get, say, Telus to provide my data in a more useful format than PDF files.</p><p>The privacy commissioner received just 110 complaints last year from people trying to access their personal information under PIPEDA, according to the OPC's most recent annual report.</p><p>It's also particularly difficult to complain if you think a company might not be showing you the full picture. It's almost impossible to prove that a company is collecting more data than what it's provided, so it's hard to justify an appeal, given that it would be based on just a hunch that somebody might be holding back more data.</p><p>That said, I will likely be sending a formal appeal to the OPC soon.</p><p>On the same day the Financial Post published my original piece on Tim Hortons'location tracking efforts, I filed a followup PIPEDA request to Radar Labs Inc., the New York company that Tim Hortons was using to analyze the raw Global Positioning System (GPS) data from my phone. Based on how the technology worked, I suspected Radar might be holding even I more information about me than what Tim Hortons had.</p><p>Radar has not acknowledged my request at all, despite repeated emails, but on Friday, July 10 at 6 p.m., just before the 30-day PIPEDA timeline was about to expire, I received a followup email from RBI that said it will be sending me some more information in another month.</p><p>\"Your access request relates to personal information collected through the Tim Hortons app and, accordingly, RBI will provide you with a response,\" the email said.</p><p>\"We are in the process of consulting with Radar to respond to your request and it will be impracticable to provide you with the response by July 12. We will have a written response to your request by no later than August 11th.\"</p><p>Wading through this whole process, I'm left with two inescapable conclusions.</p><p>The first is that modern digital technology is built in complicated ways that are difficult to understand, and, in many cases, companies use that complexity and confusion to prevent users from fully understanding what they're doing.</p><p>Nothing tells you what data is actually being collected when you agree to install an app on your phone, nor does it indicate which third-party service providers are processing and analyzing that data. You can only ask to see your personal information if you know who's got it, and, right now, that can be impossible to figure out.</p><p>Privacy experts have come to the same conclusion: Companies don't really want users to understand how their technology works.</p><p>\"The data market has not been built on transparency,\" said Neil Sweeney, chief executive of Killi Inc., a Toronto-based company that aims to pay consumers to monetize their data.</p><p>\"The reality was that in the past, the consumer never had to be included. Consent was never a requirement. Ultimately, all the systems that were built were to amalgamate and collect data unbeknownst to the consumer.\"</p><p>The second inescapable conclusion for me was that most of the data I received isn't useful at all.</p><p>One of the fundamental ideas behind PIPEDA is that people should give informed, meaningful consent when their personal information is being collected and used. As part of that, you have to see what personal information a company might be using, thus the right to request access to it.</p><p>But in 2020, data is used for complicated analytics, artificial intelligence algorithms and, when combined with other third-party data, to enable powerful software tools.</p><p>McDonald's may send you a list of transactions, but privacy law doesn't allow you to see the mechanisms behind the scenes that might analyze your behaviour so that the fast-food chain can hit you with customized discounts to keep you coming back more often.</p><p>Can you meaningfully understand how a system works if you can only see your little portion of the data, but you can't see how all of the data is being used? In Canada, many experts say that companies have an enormous amount of latitude in how they choose to abide by PIPEDA, because there are really no consequences if they break the law.</p><p>In response to my information requests, several companies broke the letter of the law by sending indecipherable ID numbers and codes that are mere gibberish to an average person.</p><p>\"The requested information shall be provided or made available in a form that is generally understandable,\" PIPEDA states.</p><p>\"For example, if the organization uses abbreviations or codes to record information, an explanation shall be provided.\"</p><p>But privacy law experts say the only real risk for those companies is harm to their reputation, because the law doesn't have meaningful enforcement teeth.</p><p>\"Historically in Canada, the penalty has been loss of reputation,\" Backman, the lawyer at Aird and Berlis, said.</p><p>PIPEDA gives Canadians the right to have informed consent over how their data is used, and by allowing people to see the personal information that a company has about them, the law should provide transparency into a company's data collection practices.</p><p>But I found that the law is just words on paper when I tried to use my rights under PIPEDA.</p><p>\"I think the law has failed to keep pace with some of the privacy challenges, many of them driven by advances in technology,\" said Michael Geist, a professor at the University of Ottawa, and Canada Research Chair in internet and e-commerce law.</p><p>\"You can't establish a system where your primary mechanism for enforcing the law is leaving it to individuals to go out and file requests and complaints. That's a recipe for what we have now, which is this patchwork for largely ineffective enforcement.\" !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

I'll believe it when I see it. Microsoft spent its 'lost decade' in the barrel when antitrust enforcement was slightly more energetic than today. </p><p>Now it's bigger than ever. Microsoft is even revered as a statesman-like elder among technology giants, unlike bad bad Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook. Unless something fundamental changes, this will mostly turn into the Lawyers' Full Employment Act of 2019. Worse, the exercise won't get to the real issue: Gigantism across the economy. It's not as if Big Tech doesn't deserve to be broken up and face effective regulation (I wrote about this[2] more than a year ago). One big example: Facebook was intimately involved in the disinformation campaign during the 2016 presidential contest, when between 78,000 and 80,000 votes decided the Electoral College. Facebook wants to 'own' the news but doesn't follow accepted standards of journalism. Closer to home, Amazon has clear-cut the brick-and-mortar retailers thanks to its convenience, selection, speed, pricing power over producers \u2014 and early advantage in tax avoidance. AdvertisingPrivacy is a big issue. But who should be surprised that these giants would monetize your personal information? And the enormous concentration of market power by the tech giants attracts criticism. This will be a focus of Rep. David Cicilline[3], D-Rhode Island, who heads the House subcommittee on antitrust. Yet this is a problem across the economy, as the Open Markets Institute, an anti-monopoly think tank, illustrated in a report last year[4]. It laid out the rising domestic concentration of 32 industries in recent years. For example, in 2017 the three largest drug-store chains held 67 percent of market share. In 2002, the top three accounted for only 37 percent. Airlines' Big Four controlled 76 percent of market share last year, compared with 38 percent in 2005. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., 9,144 commercial banks did business in America in 1997, before deregulation. By 2017, the number had fallen to 4,918. But that's not the worst of the problem (most of these are small institutions with small market share). AdvertisingJPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo control half of U.S. bank assets, a much larger concentration than 20 years ago. With the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999 (Republican Congress, Democratic president), big banks roamed into areas of finance once deemed too risky. They 'engineered' exotic financial derivatives, whose danger was little understood until the subprime meltdown triggered a cascading panic in 2008. The big institutions all played varying roles in the crisis \u2014 but they ended up even bigger. And with the Trump rollback of many modest regulations from the Obama years, the big banks are still dangerous.You get the idea. The monopoly and cartel problem is not confined to Big Tech. Data on industry concentration was once compiled by the Federal Trade Commission, but the practice ended in 1981 as the pro-merger Reagan administration took control. Since then, Wall Street has profited mightily from the garage sale of American business and industrial power that it took a century to create. Gigantism by its nature stifles competition. This leaves customers with fewer choices, most cities and towns hollowed out with fewer local institutions, and workers with fewer job options having weaker bargaining power.Monopolies and cartels are linked to slower growth[5] because they stifle new business formation. They increase inequality because of the effects of less competition and business dynamism on labor markets, as economists Jason Furman and Peter Orszag observed[6]. These giants also have an outsized role in politics thanks to the Citizens United decision, which essentially makes corporate money 'free speech' that can't be regulated. Today's Supreme Court is even more 'conservative' than the one that decided that landmark case. This would be among the hurdles that trustbusters would face. This doesn't mean the fight isn't worth it. But don't stop with Big Tech.

Kwasi Kwarteng, Priti Patel, Dominic Raab, Chris Skidmore and Liz Truss appeared to speak with       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">one voice</url> : that of unabashed Thatcherites, convinced that hacking back tax and regulation and fixating on the demands of \"business\" was as appropriate for the 21st-century UK as it supposedly had been for the crisis-plagued Britain of the 1970s.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some of the text was so provocative that it read like trolling. \"The British are among the worst idlers in the world,\" read one passage. \"We work among the lowest hours, we retire early and our productivity is poor. Whereas Indian children aspire to be doctors or businessmen, the British are more interested in football and pop music.\" To even start to compete with the rising economies of India, China and Brazil, said the authors, we need to avenge the \"dependency culture\" and \"stop indulging in irrelevant debates about sharing the pie between manufacturing and services, the north and the south, women and men\". They advised fellow Conservatives to double down on austerity, and maintain their faith in old-fashioned laissez-faire economics.</p><p>All five of the Britannia Unchained gang are now supporters of Boris Johnson. They may be wincing at his scattergun spending pledges, but they are presumably thrilled by his embrace of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">cutting corporation tax</url> ; what       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">one report called</url> \"a Trump-styled moratorium on all new regulations\"; and the surreal idea of turning at least six UK places - including Belfast - into \"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">free ports</url> \" that would charge no taxes or tariffs. Of a piece, of course, was his brilliantly timed move last week, when news that obesity was       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">now rivalling smoking</url> as a cause of cancer coincided with his       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">hostile manoeuvrings</url> on the so-called sugar tax.</p><p>Among the most high-profile Tories at the forefront of Johnson's leadership campaign is Truss, the current chief secretary to the Treasury. In response to the sugar tax story, she <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">tweeted</url> : \"Taxes on treats hits those on lowest incomes. We should be #freetochoose.\" The apparent suggestion was that if the rich were to pay less tax, it was only right that the poor should get a few pence off their next soft drink, with the consequence - incidental, of course - that big corporations (such as Coca-Cola, linked to Johnson via one       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">Will Walden</url>, an adviser who works for a lobbying firm that represents it) would be able to once again load their output with as much bad stuff as before.</p><p>None of this was terribly surprising. In the recent past, Truss has bemoaned the tendency of people in positions of power to sound off about people \"drinking too much\" and \" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">eating too many doughnuts</url> \". If that holds out the prospect of a growing burden on the NHS, she appears to have that covered: calls for increased spending, it seems, may yet be offset by the wonders of technology, a subject that this self-styled \"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">disruptor-in-chief</url> \" has attempted to make her own. \"In health, disruptive new entrepreneurs are       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">revolutionising hospital treatment</url>,\" she offered, back in January last year. \"Everyday goods like smart watches have the potential to transform public health. With real-time peer-to-peer information, like TripAdvisor, surely we can remove some of our bureaucracy?\"</p><p>Which brings us to something very interesting. If you want a sense of how the looming Johnson administration might deal with the ever-increasing questions hanging over Big Tech, Truss is a good person to watch. For the best part of two years, she has been making speeches warning any would-be interveners that such companies should be left alone. When Labour talked about \"digital monopolies\" profiting from everyone's searches and shares, and said it might impose a windfall tax on them to fund public interest journalism, she jumped to the conclusion that it wanted to \" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">nationalise the internet</url> \". As she sees it,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">Uber is simply</url> \"a company that is bringing choice and value to huge numbers of people\", while Airbnb is \"making it easier for people to rent out rooms or to find a cheaper place to stay\". This sounds less like intelligent politics than someone reading out adverts while sitting on the tube, but it reflects a belief that \"       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">people who want to change the nature of the internet</url> \", and thereby imperil \"lifestyle freedom\", are the enemies of liberty.</p><p>What Truss and her ilk don't seem to understand is that lots of trailblazing, decidedly libertarian tech people don't like these companies either, rightly seeing them as malignant concentrations of power antithetical to the internet's original ethos (witness the droves of people working on blockchain technology, and aiming to foster decentralised alternatives to the established platforms). As with the corporations now at the heart of the modern food economy, the internet's big players have been through their unregulated, disruptive phase, much as traditional industries went through their equivalent in the 19th century. And just as we now have to talk about diet and public health, so we are now in a period marked by these platforms' obvious downsides: an array of damaging effects on society; and the fact that, true to capitalist form, the most powerful firms have hardened into monopolies, which tend to eat up any startups that pose a threat.</p><p>In the Britannia Unchained view of things, the only way to deal with these problems is to encourage a kind of \"competition\" that Big Tech's power has long since squashed - and to suggest that these imbalances demand action by governments is to embrace the thinking of the bureaucrat, a belief that neatly chimes with Brexit.

So have politicians and institutions in the US, as well as many Silicon Valley insiders who believe in the profit motive and the wonders of free trade as a matter of instinct. But some 21st-century Tories are so lost in the woods that their instinctive position is to scoff at any claim that all this activity is about protecting consumers and innovators, insisting instead that it is time to rush to the aid of the free market, even where the free market has long since ceased to exist.</p><p>Truss says <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/aug/22/britannia-unchained-rise-of-new-tory-right\">she believes in</url> \"a nation of Airbnb-ing, Deliveroo-eating, Uber-riding freedom fighters\", but what she and many other Johnson supporters seem to be advocating is much less flash: leaving monopolies and oligopolies untroubled, in the service of our old friend, disaster capitalism. We all know what they have in mind. Come the autumn, Britain may well get a huge shock, and penury will beckon. The only way to avoid it, we will be told, will be to bin regulation, drastically lower taxes, and become tech, finance and the corporate food industry's offshore playground.</p><p>Then a terrifying future will open up: a few people creaming it in, while millions of ill, poor, eternally insecure people remain glued to their smartphones to either await their next casual shift in a fulfilment centre or spend whatever crumbs they are paid on the latest useless innovation. Such are the uplands of freedom offered by a party that seems to have lost what was left of its moral bearings, and resolved not to unchain us, but to imprison Britain in true-blue stupidity.</p><p> John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-54286559</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHC-6WJ1-F021-64KS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1257\"/><timeReceived>4:54 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

Mark Atherton explains</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you want to know who will win the US election, ignore the opinion polls and look at the stock market. The S&amp;P 500 of US shares has successfully predicted every president since 1984 and all but three since Herbert Hoover's victory in 1928.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This year's race for the White House looks set to be as fascinating as that of 2016, when Donald Trump, the outsider, overtook Hillary Clinton in the final days to score an unexpected win.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the moment polls are pointing towards a victory for Joe Biden, the Democrat challenger. He leads President Trump by an average of 49.6 per cent to 40.9 per cent nationally and is ahead in key swing states such as Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania, which Trump has to hold if he is to have a realistic prospect of clinging on to another four years in the White House.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the betting markets (which can often be a better indicator than opinion polls) Trump was riding high at 50 per cent to Biden's 5 per cent in February, but the odds of a Biden victory are now 61 per cent to 39 per cent.</p><p>So given all these swings how has the S&amp;P been so successful?</p><p>It works like this: when the index moves higher in the three months preceding the election (so starting in August this time round), the incumbent party has almost always won the race for the White House. When the S&amp;P has drifted lower, the incumbent party has usually lost.</p><p>Very few people expected Trump to beat Clinton in 2016, but those who were watching the movement in the US stock market might have spotted a series of consecutive days when it posted losses in the final part of the race. That contributed to the S&amp;P 500 ending up 2.3 per cent lower over the final three months of the campaign. This indicated that the incumbent party, the Democrats, would lose the election.</p><p>An easier election to predict was Barack Obama's first victory in 2008. It came in the immediate aftermath of the great financial crash of 2008. The S&amp;P 500 was down a huge 24.8 per cent in the three months leading up to polling day and, as predicted by the market, John McCain, the candidate of the incumbent Republican Party, suffered a heavy defeat.</p><p>However, the S&amp;P 500 is not an infallible predictor of the winning party. In 1956 the sitting Republican president, Dwight D Eisenhower, was re-elected even though the S&amp;P 500 had fallen in the three months before the vote. In 1968 a strong rise of 6 per cent in the stock market in the run-up to the election indicated that victory would go to Hubert Humphrey, the candidate of the incumbent Democrats. Instead it was Richard Nixon and the Republicans who emerged the winners. The third occasion in the past 92 years when the markets failed to predict the winner was in 1980 when Ronald Reagan beat the incumbent Democrat president Jimmy Carter, even though the S&amp;P 500 had risen by 6.9 per cent in the preceding three months. That still leaves this stock market-based indicator with a success rate of 87 per cent.</p><p>Those wishing to make use of this prediction tool will have to be patient. The three-month run-up to the election starts this week and concludes on Monday, November 2 - the day before the election. If you can't wait that long to get a handle on the likely result, then consider this fact, provided by Tom Stevenson of Fidelity International, the fund manager. The US is in a recession and no incumbent president since Calvin Coolidge in 1924 has won re-election when there was a recession in the 24 months leading up to polling day.</p><p>A win for Biden would be bad news for pharmaceutical stocks because he is likely to be more committed to reducing healthcare costs. Stevenson said one way to play this scenario would be to reduce exposure to giant pharma stocks such as Merck and Pfizer and buy shares in medical technology companies that could reduce overall healthcare costs.</p><p>He suggests the iShares US Medical Devices ETF. He said Biden is also likely to push for a minimum wage so consumer stocks would benefit from the boost to disposable income, and one way to tap into this would be to buy the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF.</p><p>Bill Dinning from Waverton Investment Management said that Biden's focus on green energy would deal a blow to large integrated oil companies and exploration stocks, but boost sectors such as solar and wind power, and electric vehicles. He thinks Biden would continue to push for more affordable healthcare, as he did as Obama's vice-president, and said one way of playing that would be through the Dow Jones Select Healthcare Providers' Index.</p><p>If you're looking for a fund to reflect some of these trends, Adrian Lowcock from Willis Owen, an investment platform, suggests the Artemis US Select fund, which screens companies on a range of social and economic factors, is underweight on technology stocks, which Biden may regulate more toughly, and holds the healthcare company Johnson &amp; Johnson in its top ten.</p><p>Those who think Trump is going to get four more years in the White House ought to buy the giant technology stocks, such as Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook, Stevenson said, because these companies would be facing much tougher regulation and possibly break up under Biden. If you don't want to buy individual shares, then go for tech-heavy funds such as Scottish Mortgage or JPMorgan US Select.</p><p>In the same way that the big fossil fuel stocks such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron stand to have an easier ride under Trump than Biden, and with less chance of Trump pressing for a minimum wage, his re-election would be good for companies with large numbers of low-paid workers such as Walmart and McDonald's.</p><p>Among the funds that could do well under a Trump re-election, Lowcock said, are T Rowe Price US Large Cap Growth, which includes a number of the big tech and healthcare stocks. Alternatively investors could simply buy the L&amp;G US index fund, which holds the largest US companies and would suit those who reckon Trump is good for the markets.</p><p>Stevenson added that more generally the US markets would be likely to welcome a Trump win over a Biden one. Goldman Sachs has forecast that a Biden win could cut the S&amp;P 500 index from today's 3,200 to 2,700, so if you think he is on course for victory you might want to look elsewhere in the world and buy something like the Vanguard FTSE Developed Europe ex-UK ETF. If you think Trump will win, it would make sense to buy a US tracker, such as the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF.</p><p>                   Times Money Mentor                   From inheritance tax and income tax to stamp duty and self-assessment, take a look at                   Times Money Mentor's tax guides                   Times Money Mentor's tax guides                 </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-64721414</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FC-6VH1-F021-6502-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1108\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 26, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CZ</classCode><className>ELECTIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001347</classCode><className>POLLS &amp;

Mark Atherton explains</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If you want to know who will win the US election, ignore the opinion polls and look at the stock market. The S&amp;P 500 of US shares has successfully predicted every president since 1984 and all but three since Herbert Hoover's victory in 1928.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This year's race for the White House looks set to be as fascinating as that of 2016, when Donald Trump, the outsider, overtook Hillary Clinton in the final days to score an unexpected win.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the moment polls are pointing towards a victory for Joe Biden, the Democrat challenger. He leads President Trump by an average of 49.6 per cent to 40.9 per cent nationally and is ahead in key swing states such as Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania, which Trump has to hold if he is to have a realistic prospect of clinging on to another four years in the White House.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the betting markets (which can often be a better indicator than opinion polls) Trump was riding high at 50 per cent to Biden's 5 per cent in February, but the odds of a Biden victory are now 61 per cent to 39 per cent.</p><p>So given all these swings how has the S&amp;P been so successful? It works like this: when the index moves higher in the three months preceding the election (so starting in August this time round), the incumbent party has almost always won the race for the White House. When the S&amp;P has drifted lower, the incumbent party has usually lost.</p><p>Very few people expected Trump to beat Clinton in 2016, but those who were watching the movement in the US stock market might have spotted a series of consecutive days when it posted losses in the final part of the race. That contributed to the S&amp;P 500 ending up 2.3 per cent lower over the final three months of the campaign. This indicated that the incumbent party, the Democrats, would lose the election.</p><p>An easier election to predict was Barack Obama's first victory in 2008. It came in the immediate aftermath of the great financial crash of 2008. The S&amp;P 500 was down a huge 24.8 per cent in the three months leading up to polling day and, as predicted by the market, John McCain, the candidate of the incumbent Republican Party, suffered a heavy defeat. However, the S&amp;P 500 is not an infallible predictor of the winning party. In 1956 the sitting Republican president, Dwight D Eisenhower, was re-elected even though the S&amp;P 500 had fallen in the three months before the vote. In 1968 a strong rise of 6 per cent in the stock market in the run-up to the election indicated that victory would go to Hubert Humphrey, the candidate of the incumbent Democrats. Instead it was Richard Nixon and the Republicans who emerged the winners. The third occasion in the past 92 years when the markets failed to predict the winner was in 1980 when Ronald Reagan beat the incumbent Democrat president Jimmy Carter, even though the S&amp;P 500 had risen by 6.9 per cent in the preceding three months. That still leaves this stock market-based indicator with a success rate of 87 per cent.</p><p>Those wishing to make use of this prediction tool will have to be patient. The three-month run-up to the election starts this week and concludes on Monday, November 2 - the day before the election. If you can't wait that long to get a handle on the likely result, then consider this fact, provided by Tom Stevenson of Fidelity International, the fund manager. The US is in a recession and no incumbent president since Calvin Coolidge in 1924 has won re-election when there was a recession in the 24 months leading up to polling day.</p><p>A win for Biden would be bad news for pharmaceutical stocks because he is likely to be more committed to reducing healthcare costs. Stevenson said one way to play this scenario would be to reduce exposure to giant pharma stocks such as Merck and Pfizer and buy shares in medical technology companies that could reduce overall healthcare costs.</p><p>He suggests the iShares US Medical Devices ETF. He said Biden is also likely to push for a minimum wage so consumer stocks would benefit from the boost to disposable income, and one way to tap into this would be to buy the Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF.</p><p>Bill Dinning from Waverton Investment Management said that Biden's focus on green energy would deal a blow to large integrated oil companies and exploration stocks, but boost sectors such as solar and wind power, and electric vehicles. He thinks Biden would continue to push for more affordable healthcare, as he did as Obama's vice-president, and said one way of playing that would be through the Dow Jones Select Healthcare Providers' Index.</p><p>If you're looking for a fund to reflect some of these trends, Adrian Lowcock from Willis Owen, an investment platform, suggests the Artemis US Select fund, which screens companies on a range of social and economic factors, is underweight on technology stocks, which Biden may regulate more toughly, and holds the healthcare company Johnson &amp; Johnson in its top ten.</p><p>Those who think Trump is going to get four more years in the White House ought to buy the giant technology stocks, such as Amazon, Apple, Alphabet and Facebook, Stevenson said, because these companies would be facing much tougher regulation and possibly break-up under Biden. If you don't want to buy individual shares, then go for tech-heavy funds such as Scottish Mortgage or JPMorgan US Select.</p><p>In the same way that the big fossil fuel stocks such as Exxon Mobil and Chevron stand to have an easier ride under Trump than Biden, and with less chance of Trump pressing for a minimum wage, his re-election would be good for companies with large numbers of low-paid workers such as Walmart and McDonald's.</p><p>Among the funds that could do well under a Trump re-election, Lowcock said, are T Rowe Price US Large Cap Growth, which includes a number of the big tech and healthcare stocks. Alternatively investors could simply buy the L&amp;G US index fund, which holds the largest US companies and would suit those who reckon Trump is good for the markets.</p><p>Stevenson added that more generally the US markets would be likely to welcome a Trump win over a Biden one. Goldman Sachs has forecast that a Biden win could cut the S&amp;P 500 index from today's 3,200 to 2,700, so if you think he is on course for victory you might want to look elsewhere in the world and buy something like the Vanguard FTSE Developed Europe ex-UK ETF. If you think Trump will win, it would make sense to buy a US tracker, such as the Vanguard S&amp;P 500 UCITS ETF.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STIMES-161854928</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60FC-W5G1-JCBW-N2B4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">332263</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1065\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Times Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Times (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57900\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 26, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

The slides are the same cross-sections of mouse knees from a six-month-old and an 18-month-old animal. The older mouse's image has a splattering of little yellow dots, the younger barely any. That staining indicates the presence of so-called senescent cells - \"zombie cells\" that are damaged and that, as a defence against cancer, have ceased to divide but are also resistant to dying. They are known to accumulate with age, as the immune system can no longer clear them, and as a result of exposure to cell-damaging agents such as radiation and chemotherapy. And they have been identified as a cause of ageing in mice, at least partially responsible for most age-related diseases. Seeing the slides, it makes me worried about my own knees. \"Tell us about it,\" says Pedro Beltran who heads the biology team at <url normalizedValue=\"https://unitybiotechnology.com/\">Unity Biotechnology</url>, a 90 person-strong company trying to halt, slow or reverse age-associated diseases in humans by killing senescent cells. \"We think about it all the time... Wait until you see your brain.\"</p><p>Developing therapies to kill senescent cells is a burgeoning part of the wider quest to defeat ageing and keep people healthier longer. Unity, which was founded in 2011, has received more than $385m in funding to date including investment from big tech names such as Amazon's Jeff Bezos and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel. It went public this May and is valued at more than $700m. Its first drug entered early clinical trials in June, aimed at treating osteoarthritis.</p><p>Other startups with zombie cells in their sights include Seattle-based <url normalizedValue=\"https://unitybiotechnology.com/\">Ois\u00edn Biotechnologies</url> which was founded in 2016 and has raised around $4m;       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://unitybiotechnology.com/\">Senolytic Therapeutics</url> whose scientific development is based in Spain and which was established last September (it won't disclose its financing other than to say it has a first round, which will allow it to reach clinical trials); and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://unitybiotechnology.com/\">Cleara Biotech</url>, formed this June backed by $3m in funding and based in the Netherlands. In addition, Scottish company       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://unitybiotechnology.com/\">CellAge</url>, also founded in 2016, has raised about $100,000 to date, partly through a crowdfunding campaign.</p><p>It isn't about just slowing down the clock but actually turning it back and rejuvenating people</p><p>  Aubrey de Grey    </p><p>\"The concept is totally getting the imagination of investors [because] it isn't about just slowing down the clock but actually turning it back and rejuvenating people,\" says <url normalizedValue=\"https://unitybiotechnology.com/\">Aubrey</url>      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://unitybiotechnology.com/\">de Grey</url>, who for nearly a decade through his campaigning charity the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://unitybiotechnology.com/\">Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (Sens) Research Foundation</url> has been urging scientists to work towards eliminating ageing and extending healthy lifespan indefinitely. \"I've never seen a field grow so quickly,\" says Laura Niedernhofer, a researcher who studies ageing at the University of Minnesota Medical School, adding that there isn't even as yet any human data. \"There is a recognition that there is potential here to go to a root cause [of ageing].\"</p><p>Senescent cells were first described in the late 1950s but remained largely a curiosity until 2008 when their dark nature was revealed by Judith Campisi, a researcher based at the <url normalizedValue=\"https://unitybiotechnology.com/\">Buck Institute for Research on Aging</url> in California, and others. She found that the cells secrete a cocktail of foul factors, which poison the surrounding tissue. Niedernhofer likens them to that bad strawberry in the punnet, rotting everything around it. Among the excretions are substances that produce inflammation, which if sustained is one of the major drivers of practically every important age-related disease. The effect explains the seeming paradox that even the diseased organs of very old people don't contain high absolute numbers of senescent cells: it doesn't take many.</p><p>That discovery and others made some people wonder what would happen if you cleared these cranky cells away. In 2011 Jan van Deursen and colleagues at the nonprofit medical organisation the <url normalizedValue=\"https://unitybiotechnology.com/\">Mayo Clinic</url> showed that eliminating senescent cells in mice via a genetic trick delayed some of the ravages of age in prematurely aged mice. The paper sparked the formation of Unity (Van Deursen is a scientific co-founder). A       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://unitybiotechnology.com/\">follow-up study</url> published in 2016 that repeated the experiment but this time in naturally aged animals, sealed the possibilities. \"That [2016 paper] was literally the proof of concept for the entire industry,\" says Gary Hudson, co-founder and Executive Chairman of Ois\u00edn Biotechnologies.</p><p>To date about a dozen drugs have been reported that can mop up zombie cells. Clearance of the cells in mice has been shown to delay or alleviate everything from frailty to cardiovascular dysfunction to osteoporosis to, most recently, neurological disorders - though whether killing senescent cells extends life is complicated. Most of the benefit seen in mice seems to be in extending healthspan, the time free of frailty or disease, and as a result median lifespan (being sick, after all, is risky). True longevity - the maximum time the animals remain alive for - remains relatively unchanged, though studies published in <url normalizedValue=\"https://unitybiotechnology.com/\">July</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://unitybiotechnology.com/\">September</url> 2018 show an extension of remaining lifespan in mice that were treated when they were very old.</p><p>The race between Unity and its competitors is to excite interest in their different approaches to killing senescent cells and move them through the clinical trials needed to demonstrate that their therapies work safely in people.</p><p> Related:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://unitybiotechnology.com/\">Extreme biohacking: the tech guru who spent $250,000 trying to live for ever</url></p><p>Unity's method is based on targeting the biological pathways senescent cells use to resist the normal death of ageing cells. Inhibit the right pathway and death can be \"nudged\" to occur. The company's approach is to find small molecules (so called \"senolytics\") that can do this. But because small molecules, by their nature, can get everywhere in the body, the approach is prone to unwanted side-effects.</p><p>The company's way round the problem is to start with localised treatment, which is possible in a few organs such as the knee, eye and lung that essentially \"trap\" the drugs so they can't leak elsewhere in the body where they can cause toxicity to other cells. \"It is a walk-before-you-run strategy,\" says Keith Leonard, Unity chairman and CEO. \"A pill or an injection that would clean out senescent cells throughout your entire body would be a brilliant future but we have to be very careful.\"</p><p>Following fair success in mice, in June Unity began an early stage clinical trial of its first drug in the knees of patients with moderate to severe osteoarthritis, an age-associated chronic disease that causes joint pain. The trial, involving 40 patients injected locally in the space around the knee, is expected to run for about nine months. The drug itself was selected because it appears to kill the two types of senescent cell that accumulate in the knee. (One complication with senescent cells is that because they all spring from different normal cell types they retain their own individuality; a drug might kill senescent skin cells, fat cells or blood vessel cells but is unlikely to kill all three.)</p><p>Beyond that, it has another drug in the pipeline with which it hopes to target eye disease and beyond that, more drugs in a competitive bake-off for lung disease.</p><p>\"We are now in the midst of chapter one,\" says Unity co-founder and president Nathaniel David. \"And chapter one concludes with the successful demonstration in human beings that the elimination of senescent cells takes a feature of ageing that was untreatable and uncurable, and makes it a treatable medical condition.\"</p><p>Ois\u00edn is trying to do something more ambitious: killing all a person's zombie cells in one go. The idea is to load the body with nanoparticles that insert a \"suicide gene\" into every cell. It only triggers if a cell has a lot of a particular protein (p16) that acts as a marker of zombie cells, albeit imperfectly.</p><p>Ois\u00edn is planning to run what co-founder Hudson calls a \"stealth ageing trial\" in people with a variety of late-stage cancers next year (there are lots of cancers for which no treatment is available so the regulatory bar to the clinic is lower). That will test a version of its anti-ageing therapeutic modified to target cancer, but it may also be possible to see - by virtue of observable age characteristics - whether the drug has had any effect on senescent cells. Not everyone is convinced Ois\u00edn's method can work. \"Not every cell that expresses high p16 is senescent; and not every senescent cell has high p16,\" notes James Kirkland, a researcher who studies ageing at the Mayo Clinic.</p><p>It isn't like cancer: mouse studies suggest that getting rid of just 30% of senescent cells is enough to have an impact</p><p>Other approaches from Senolytic Therapeutics and CellAge could respectively make Unity and Ois\u00edn's methods more precise. Cleara's approach, meanwhile, which uses an engineered peptide molecule, targets a particular subtype of senescent cell, which, says scientific co-founder Peter de Keizer, will make it safer.</p><p>Although killing zombie cells seems like a good idea, which method, if any, will be successful in humans is an open question. \"I have been around long enough that everything looks good in mice and when you get to people that is where things go wrong,\" says Kirkland, who is also running a handful of clinical trials at Mayo for repurposed cancer drugs and natural products that have been shown to kill senescent cells in mice.</p><p>If eliminating senescent cells does improve specific age-related diseases in humans, the next step will be to go broader. That's tough because regulators don't recognise ageing as a treatable condition (which is why the companies' clinical trials don't focus on ageing per se but instead on specific age-related diseases). There is hope on the horizon, however, with the recent approval by the FDA of a novel clinical trial to assess the power of the drug metformin [see below] against what is ageing in all but name. \"There now exists a template,\" says De Grey.</p><p>On the positive side, if there is an eventual treatment it wouldn't have to be taken every day. Imagine an annual or biennial therapy, starting from middle age, that sweeps away any senescent cells building up. And because you wouldn't chronically be on the drug, the risk of side-effects would be minimised.</p><p>The drugs also wouldn't have to be super-efficient at killing senescent cells, says Niedernhofer: mouse studies suggest just getting rid of 30% of them is enough to have an impact. It isn't like cancer where to cure it, you have to kill every cancer cell.</p><p>Even with the uncertain road ahead, the prospect is tantalising: everybody wants to keep going as far as possible in healthy circumstances. I leave Unity's labs not full of fear for my knees but full of hope. Sign me up for my annual dose of zombie cell-killing, age-defying treatment.</p><p>                   Five more ways to cheat death                   Metformin                   </p><p>This well-established, cheap diabetes drug seems to have some bonus age-defying side-effects in the form of an extended lifespan and fewer age-related diseases for those taking it. A clinical trial in elderly people, set to start next year if funding comes through, aims to get to the bottom of whether it really is an anti-ageing drug. One way metformin works is to inhibit senescent cells' nasty secretions.</p><p>                   Rapamycin                   </p><p>Strictly limiting calories is known to extend the lifespan of animals. Could the drug rapamycin be caloric restriction in a pill? The drug is used to suppress the immune system of organ transplant patients but is also thought to mimic the body's starvation response. In mice, it extends lifespan by 25% and it has been shown, counterintuitively, to boost the immunity of older people. The startup <url normalizedValue=\"https://unitybiotechnology.com/\">resTORbio</url> is currently trialling a derivative of the compound to cut respiratory tract infections.</p><p>                   Boosting NAD+                   </p><p>Unresolved DNA damage in our cells is one of the main drivers of ageing. Boosting the chemical NAD+ in the body activates a particular protein that removes that damage. Mice treated with a drug to boost NAD+ got fitter with increased muscle tone and blood flow. A small clinical trial of the NAD+ booster, which is actually a dietary supplement, is currently under way.</p><p>                   Cellular rejuvenation                   </p><p>What if you could temporarily convert regular cells into stem cells again so they automatically repair themselves? This has been done in mice with a genetic trick, extending the lifespan of those with a premature ageing disease by 30% and helping normal old animals to better repair their muscles and pancreas after injury. More research is currently being done in the lab to translate the approach to the clinic. It focuses on achieving similar effects in old tissues and organs, but using drugs instead.</p><p>                   Fix your lifestyle                   </p><p>Exercise, reducing stress and a healthy diet stave off multiple age-related diseases, in essence slowing ageing. Studies also indicate that so called intermittent fasting, which restricts when you eat rather than how much you eat, promotes a longer lifespan in both animals and people.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBSRVR-48010868</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBSRVR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TDX-X061-F021-63PH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">143296</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2216\"/><timeReceived>3:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Guardian Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Observer(London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 6, 2018 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000DMCM</classCode><className>UNITY BIOTECHNOLOGY INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00023HP</classCode><className>PAYPAL HOLDINGS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS541714 RESEARCH &amp;

We've introduced the new STEIP methodology to give us a comprehensive view of how the industry is evolving, and we've combined our new research with CMO interviews and WARC content to give our users a sound guide to the year ahead.\"<br/>The STEIP methodology was developed by WARC's sister brands within the Ascential group of companies. The Marketer's Toolkit 2020 was created in association with Ascential brands: Cannes Lions, Edge, MediaLink, Money 20/20 and WGSN.<br/>Top insights highlighted in WARC's Marketer's Toolkit 2020 are:<br/>Society - The Greta effect<br/>The ongoing rise of conscious consumerism after environmental issues came to the fore in 2019 means brand purpose is evolving into brand activism. The challenge for marketers in 2020 is to respond to environmental challenges in ways that go deep into every part of their organisations, and which are likely to accelerate their response to this trend with particular focus on packaging and supply chain.<br/>Responding to WARC's Toolkit survey, more than 75% of marketers agree that brands need to take a stand on social issues.<br/>Steve Challouma, Marketing Director, Birds Eye, says: \"Issues like plastics in packaging, food waste, nutrition in food, they transcend businesses and brands... they are things that companies should be doing in a broad sense, irrespective of their brand purpose.\"<br/>Technology - Context and Connected TV: Reinventing Programmatic<br/>After years of hype about consumer tech, brands appear more cautious about further technology investment - most respondents agreed that brands had overinvested in tech at the expense of creativity.<br/>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and payment technology will be key priorities in 2020. Voice will remain a minority pursuit, and 5G is expected to have an impact as an enabler of other technology.<br/>There are big changes in advertising technology, as the limitations of audience-based buying become clear. A renewed focus on context will dovetail with the emergence of connected TV to create new opportunities in programmatic.<br/>50% of respondents either agree or strongly agree that programmatic has \"failed to live up to its potential\".<br/>Cheryl Calverley, Chief Marketing Officer, Eve Sleep, says: \"Most programmatic is brand-damaging in the way it ends up being executed.I'm really wary of addressable TV. From my point of view, TV is about driving fame, broadly, and fame is around massive collaborative experience. My problem with addressable TV is it massively fragments [audiences].\"<br/>Marc Pritchard, Chief Brand Officer, Procter &amp; Gamble, comments: \"Context does matter. Different platforms have different usage experiences for the user. What we're working on is the ability to be able to engage people in every one of those [channels]. That's a new type of creativity.\"<br/>Economy - The pivot back to brand<br/>Brands are re-assessing how they balance their spending in response to a crisis of short-termism, and an over investment in performance marketing. This is set to be a major trend for 2020, though there are significant hurdles to increased brand building investment.<br/>70% of marketers agree that brands have over-invested in performance at the expense of brand-building.<br/>Tariq Hassan, Chief Marketing Officer, Petco, says: \"It starts with a leadership point of view. It starts with viewing the word 'brand building' as about [more than] what marketing does, but rather about being a 'brand culture' as an organisation.\"<br/>Bernd Pichler, Chief Marketing Officer, ICONIQ Motors, observes: \"I don't start with choosing the media mix. I start with, \"What does the brand stand for?\" This has to be very crystal clear, and it has to be very authentic and credible.\"<br/>The rapid growth of investment in online video is expected to continue, with Instagram and YouTube set to benefit and a significant number of brands spending on TikTok for the first time.<br/>Search is also expected to be a focus for 2020, with Amazon's fast-growing advertising business set to benefit alongside Google.<br/>Industry - Building brands in walled gardens<br/>As digital platforms like Amazon and Alibaba grow ever-more influential, marketers are increasingly tasked with building brands within ecosystems over which they have no control, creating a growing reliance on 'walled gardens' that combine paid advertising and payment tech or e-commerce fulfilment.<br/>23% of brands plan to increase adspend with Amazon in 2020, with only 3% of marketers anticipating a decrease in investment.<br/>Ivan Pollard, Chief Marketing Officer, General Mills, comments: \"It's not just about driving a sale in e-commerce... How do you make all of your marketing shoppable? The platforms absolutely offer an opportunity to make a sale, to build a brand, and to understand your consumer.\"<br/>Experience will remain a buzzword in 2020, as marketers prioritise CX. Creative agencies and consultancies will battle to combine CX with brand thinking.<br/>In-housing of adtech will continue as brands take charge of their data -- 34% of respondents say they will be managing more adtech in-house in 2020. In-housing of creativity remains a trend, but a significant minority of brands are putting more work out-of-house.<br/>Gill Zhou, VP of Marketing, Communications and Citizenship, IBM China, notes: \"Creativity is still very important, but those who learn about data, statistics and algorithms have become 'mainstream' marketers.\"<br/>Policy - Privacy-first marketing<br/>Data privacy is both a trend in regulation, and a growing consumer demand. As such, it is one of the most important global themes for marketers in 2020.<br/>The implementation of stronger data protection rights will have significant implications for marketers. The introduction of the California Consumer Privacy Act in January 2020 is already forcing brands and media owners to look again at their data management practices.<br/>While the new regulations change the data landscape, there are opportunities for brands to present themselves as 'privacy first' to consumers wary of how their data is being used.<br/>86% of respondents to WARC's Marketer's Toolkit survey agree, or strongly agree that \"big tech firms should be subject to greater regulation\"; 66% of respondents strongly agree that consumers will take greater control of their data in 2020.<br/>Jill Haskin, Chief Marketing Officer, The Hershey Company, says: \"For us, a big part of it is \"Do we agree with how our partners are using data?\" We just want to get a lot more transparency from our partners... How are they keeping [data]?.. We want to have not [just] what's the legal thing but what we ethically think is right.\"<br/>WARC's Marketer's Toolkit 2020 is available to download from lp.warc.com/marketers_toolkit_2020.html. More information from a deep-dive into each of the five chapters, available now to WARC subscribers, will follow over the coming weeks.<br/>Two free-to-attend events to discuss trends from the Marketer's Toolkit will take place in London on 29 November ( http://lp.warc.com/register-for-warc-event-marketers-toolkit-2020.html ) and in New York on 12 December (lp.warc.com/register-for-trends-from-the-marketers-toolkit-event-nyc.html).<br/>About\u00a0WARC<br/>- advertising evidence, insights and best practice<br/>WARC provides the latest evidence, expertise and guidance to make marketers more effective.

We''ve introduced the new STEIP methodology to give us a comprehensive view of how the industry is evolving, and we''ve combined our new research with CMO interviews and WARC content to give our users a sound guide to the year ahead.\"<br/><br/>The STEIP methodology was developed by WARC''s sister brands within the Ascential group of companies. The Marketer''s Toolkit 2020 was created in association with Ascential brands: Cannes Lions, Edge, MediaLink, Money 20/20 and WGSN.<br/><br/>Top insights highlighted in WARC''s Marketer''s Toolkit 2020 are:<br/>\u2022 Society - The Greta effect<br/>The ongoing rise of conscious consumerism after environmental issues came to the fore in 2019 means brand purpose is evolving into brand activism. The challenge for marketers in 2020 is to respond to environmental challenges in ways that go deep into every part of their organisations, and which are likely to accelerate their response to this trend with particular focus on packaging and supply chain.<br/><br/>Responding to WARC''s Toolkit survey, more than 75% of marketers agree that brands need to take a stand on social issues.<br/><br/>Steve Challouma, Marketing Director, Birds Eye, says: \"Issues like plastics in packaging, food waste, nutrition in food, they transcend businesses and brands... they are things that companies should be doing in a broad sense, irrespective of their brand purpose.\"<br/>\u2022 Technology - Context and Connected TV: Reinventing Programmatic<br/>After years of hype about consumer tech, brands appear more cautious about further technology investment - most respondents agreed that brands had overinvested in tech at the expense of creativity.<br/><br/>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and payment technology will be key priorities in 2020. Voice will remain a minority pursuit, and 5G is expected to have an impact as an enabler of other technology.<br/><br/>There are big changes in advertising technology, as the limitations of audience-based buying become clear. A renewed focus on context will dovetail with the emergence of connected TV to create new opportunities in programmatic.<br/><br/>50% of respondents either agree or strongly agree that programmatic has \"failed to live up to its potential\".<br/><br/>Cheryl Calverley, Chief Marketing Officer, Eve Sleep, says: \"Most programmatic is brand-damaging in the way it ends up being executed.I''m really wary of addressable TV. From my point of view, TV is about driving fame, broadly, and fame is around massive collaborative experience. My problem with addressable TV is it massively fragments [audiences].\"<br/><br/>Marc Pritchard, Chief Brand Officer, Procter &amp; Gamble, comments: \"Context does matter. Different platforms have different usage experiences for the user. What we''re working on is the ability to be able to engage people in every one of those [channels]. That''s a new type of creativity.\"<br/>\u2022 Economy - The pivot back to brand<br/>Brands are re-assessing how they balance their spending in response to a crisis of short-termism, and an over investment in performance marketing. This is set to be a major trend for 2020, though there are significant hurdles to increased brand building investment.<br/><br/>70% of marketers agree that brands have over-invested in performance at the expense of brand-building.<br/><br/>Tariq Hassan, Chief Marketing Officer, Petco, says: \"It starts with a leadership point of view. It starts with viewing the word ''brand building'' as about [more than] what marketing does, but rather about being a ''brand culture'' as an organisation.\"<br/><br/>Bernd Pichler, Chief Marketing Officer, ICONIQ Motors, observes: \"I don''t start with choosing the media mix. I start with, \"What does the brand stand for?\" This has to be very crystal clear, and it has to be very authentic and credible.\"<br/><br/>The rapid growth of investment in online video is expected to continue, with Instagram and YouTube set to benefit and a significant number of brands spending on TikTok for the first time.<br/><br/>Search is also expected to be a focus for 2020, with Amazon''s fast-growing advertising business set to benefit alongside Google.<br/>\u2022 Industry - Building brands in walled gardens<br/>As digital platforms like Amazon and Alibaba grow ever-more influential, marketers are increasingly tasked with building brands within ecosystems over which they have no control, creating a growing reliance on ''walled gardens'' that combine paid advertising and payment tech or e-commerce fulfilment.<br/><br/>23% of brands plan to increase adspend with Amazon in 2020, with only 3% of marketers anticipating a decrease in investment.<br/><br/>Ivan Pollard, Chief Marketing Officer, General Mills, comments: \"It''s not just about driving a sale in e-commerce... How do you make all of your marketing shoppable? The platforms absolutely offer an opportunity to make a sale, to build a brand, and to understand your consumer.\"<br/><br/>Experience will remain a buzzword in 2020, as marketers prioritise CX. Creative agencies and consultancies will battle to combine CX with brand thinking.<br/><br/>In-housing of adtech will continue as brands take charge of their data -- 34% of respondents say they will be managing more adtech in-house in 2020. In-housing of creativity remains a trend, but a significant minority of brands are putting more work out-of-house.<br/><br/>Gill Zhou, VP of Marketing, Communications and Citizenship, IBM China, notes: \"Creativity is still very important, but those who learn about data, statistics and algorithms have become ''mainstream'' marketers.\"<br/>\u2022 Policy - Privacy-first marketing<br/>Data privacy is both a trend in regulation, and a growing consumer demand. As such, it is one of the most important global themes for marketers in 2020.<br/><br/>The implementation of stronger data protection rights will have significant implications for marketers. The introduction of the California Consumer Privacy Act in January 2020 is already forcing brands and media owners to look again at their data management practices.<br/><br/>While the new regulations change the data landscape, there are opportunities for brands to present themselves as ''privacy first'' to consumers wary of how their data is being used.<br/><br/>86% of respondents to WARC''s Marketer''s Toolkit survey agree, or strongly agree that \"big tech firms should be subject to greater regulation\"; 66% of respondents strongly agree that consumers will take greater control of their data in 2020.<br/><br/>Jill Haskin, Chief Marketing Officer, The Hershey Company, says: \"For us, a big part of it is \"Do we agree with how our partners are using data?\" We just want to get a lot more transparency from our partners... How are they keeping [data]?.. We want to have not [just] what''s the legal thing but what we ethically think is right.\"<br/><br/>WARC''s Marketer''s Toolkit 2020 is available to download here. More information from a deep-dive into each of the five chapters, available now to WARC subscribers, will follow over the coming weeks.<br/><br/>Two free-to-attend events to discuss trends from the Marketer''s Toolkit will take place in London on 29 November and in New York on 12 December.<br/><br/>MENAFN2511201900702288ID1099321420</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MENENG-1099321420</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MENENG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XKD-3JY1-F04Y-T3P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300954</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1286\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MENAFN.COM All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MENA English (Middle East and North Africa Financial Network)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"38985\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 25, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The toolkit is based on a\u00a0survey of nearly 800\u00a0marketers\u00a0around the world and interviews with 10 leading brand\u00a0marketers and serves as a guide to help marketers be aware of the near-term trends, which will help them stay ahead in the market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report adopted the STEIP methodology which covers the five drivers of change; Society, Technology, Economy, Industry, Policy, etc.</p><p>SOCIETY</p><p>Brands are responding to two-stand out trends that are going to have a broad impact on marketing strategies in 2020. The first one is the growing concern around consumer privacy online and the second is the rise of conscious consumerism.<br/>More than 75% of marketers agree that brands need to take a stand on social issues. However, almost half of the marketers also agree it is harder for brands to influence culture at scale in the current climate.<br/>The potential pitfalls are,<br/>Adopting a short-term approach just to jump on a bandwagon could cost a brand its reputation.<br/>Ignoring the intention-behavior gap. There is a huge gap in the sustainability space between what the consumers say they want and what they actually do. Brands may have to incentivize using behavioral economic techniques to make sustainable products look desirable, affordable and convenient.<br/>Falling behind the retailers. Brands providing packaged goods and should stay one step ahead of retailers in their efforts to respond to conscious consumerism.</p><p>TECHNOLOGY</p><p>After years of hype about consumer tech, brands appear more cautious about investing in new technology.<br/>Artificial intelligence and payment tech will be the key priorities brands will be looking at. The latter is gaining more interest as compared to the former as a reflection of the growth of e-commerce.<br/>Voice, despite the hype, will remain a minority pursuit as marketers figure out where the opportunities lie.<br/><br/>5G is expected to have an impact as an enabler around enhanced content strategies. But there is currently a sense of 'wait and see' about this development.</p><p>Although programmatic has been transformative for some areas of ad trading, half of the respondents believe it has failed to live up to its potential.<br/>The limits of audience-based buying are clear in concerns around context and brand safety and have now become more important than ever when it comes to the cost of media planning.</p><p>ECONOMY</p><p>Brands are now re-assessing how they balance their spending plans for 2020. Senior marketers increasingly recognise that they have over-invested in short- term marketing tactics at the expense of their brands.<br/>Adspend is forecasted to increase globally by 6% in 2020. Priority in video will be number one along with mobile and search as a means to drive growth and increase brand building.<br/>Instagram and YouTube are the key beneficiaries of the focus on video, though there is also significant interest in TikTok.<br/>Budgets for Google search will naturally increase but there is also a growing interest in Amazon as an ad platform.</p><p>INDUSTRY</p><p>Customer experience will remain an industry buzzword across the industry in 2020 and agencies and consultancies will battle to combine Customer Experience with brand thinking.<br/>In-housing is happening to a greater extent in advertising technology as brands begin to take charge of their data.<br/>30% of client-side respondents say they already handle adtech in-house and 34% will bring more of this work in-house in 2020.<br/>Agencies, on the whole, are investing to respond to the changing market by recruiting business analysis and consultancy skills. Creative agencies are also prioritising a range of specialist skills, including in-house production and experience design.</p><p>POLICY</p><p>Data privacy is both a trend in regulation and a growing consumer demand and is one of the most important global themes for marketers in 2020.<br/>45% of marketers expect tighter regulation in 2020, with the focus on privacy.<br/>Although provisions around data protection are now in place for the majority, there is still more work to do.</p><p>Less than half of marketers feel that the issue of brand safety is being taken seriously by marketers, and almost all would like there to be greater regulation of big tech firms.<br/>Non-compliance with these regulations can be costly both financially and brand wise.<br/>The problem with data usage is that it is so broad, it's hard to audit every bit of it.<br/>Brands must also ensure they do not overlook customer consent, otherwise, they risk losing trust and liable to face legal penalties.<br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/84/780/88/157518973425.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/84/780/88/157518973425.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/84/780/69/157518973612.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/84/780/69/157518973612.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/84/780/67/157518973816.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/84/780/67/157518973816.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/84/780/88/157518973990.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/84/780/88/157518973990.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/84/780/20/157518974171.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/84/780/20/157518974171.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/84/780/85/157518974347.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/84/780/85/157518974347.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/84/780/17/157518974537.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/84/780/17/157518974537.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/84/780/62/157518974725.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/84/780/62/157518974725.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COMMU-160970276</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COMMU2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XMP-4101-JDJN-6286-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">381110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"827\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MediaQuest Corp.

We've introduced the new STEIP methodology to give us a comprehensive view of how the industry is evolving, and we've combined our new research with CMO interviews and WARC content to give our users a sound guide to the year ahead.\"</p><p>The STEIP methodology was developed by WARC's sister brands within the Ascential group of companies. The Marketer's Toolkit 2020 was created in association with Ascential brands: Cannes Lions, Edge, MediaLink, Money 20/20 and WGSN.</p><p>Top insights highlighted in WARC's Marketer's Toolkit 2020 are:</p><p>Society - The Greta effect</p><p>The ongoing rise of conscious consumerism after environmental issues came to the fore in 2019 means brand purpose is evolving into brand activism. The challenge for marketers in 2020 is to respond to environmental challenges in ways that go deep into every part of their organisations, and which are likely to accelerate their response to this trend with particular focus on packaging and supply chain.</p><p>Responding to WARC's Toolkit survey, more than 75% of marketers agree that brands need to take a stand on social issues.</p><p>Steve Challouma, Marketing Director, Birds Eye, says, \"Issues like plastics in packaging, food waste, nutrition in food transcend businesses and brands... they are things that companies should be doing in a broad sense, irrespective of their brand purpose.\"</p><p>Technology - Context and Connected TV: Reinventing Programmatic</p><p>After years of hype about consumer tech, brands appear more cautious about further technology investment - most respondents agreed that brands had overinvested in tech at the expense of creativity.</p><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and payment technology will be key priorities in 2020. Voice will remain a minority pursuit, and 5G is expected to have an impact as an enabler of other technology.</p><p>There are big changes in advertising technology, as the limitations of audience-based buying become clear. A renewed focus on context will dovetail with the emergence of connected TV to create new opportunities in programmatic.</p><p>50% of respondents either agree or strongly agree that programmatic has \"failed to live up to its potential\".</p><p>Cheryl Calverley, Chief Marketing Officer, Eve Sleep, says, \"Most programmatic is brand-damaging in the way it ends up being executed. I'm really wary of addressable TV. From my point of view, TV is about driving fame, broadly, and fame is around massive collaborative experience. My problem with addressable TV is it massively fragments (audiences).\"</p><p>Marc Pritchard, Chief Brand Officer, Procter &amp; Gamble, says, \"Context does matter. Different platforms have different usage experiences for the user. What we're working on is the ability to be able to engage people in every one of those (channels). That's a new type of creativity.\"</p><p>Economy - The pivot back to brand</p><p>Brands are re-assessing how they balance their spending in response to a crisis of short-termism, and an overinvestment in performance marketing. This is set to be a major trend for 2020, though there are significant hurdles to increased brand-building investment.</p><p>70% of marketers agree that brands have over-invested in performance at the expense of brand-building.</p><p>Tariq Hassan, Chief Marketing Officer, Petco, says, \"It starts with a leadership point of view. It starts with viewing the word 'brand building' as about (more than) what marketing does, but rather about being a 'brand culture' as an organisation.\"</p><p>Bernd Pichler, Chief Marketing Officer, ICONIQ Motors, observes, \"I don't start with choosing the media mix. I start with, \"What does the brand stand for?\" This has to be very crystal clear, and it has to be very authentic and credible.\"</p><p>The rapid growth of investment in online video is expected to continue, with Instagram and YouTube set to benefit and a significant number of brands spending on TikTok for the first time.</p><p>Search is also expected to be a focus for 2020, with Amazon's fast-growing advertising business set to benefit alongside Google.</p><p>Industry - Building brands in walled gardens</p><p>As digital platforms like Amazon and Alibaba grow ever-more influential, marketers are increasingly tasked with building brands within ecosystems over which they have no control, creating a growing reliance on 'walled gardens' that combine paid advertising and payment tech or e-commerce fulfilment.</p><p>23% of brands plan to increase adspend with Amazon in 2020, with only 3% of marketers anticipating a decrease in investment.</p><p>Ivan Pollard, Chief Marketing Officer, General Mills, says, \"It's not just about driving a sale in e-commerce... How do you make all of your marketing shoppable? The platforms absolutely offer an opportunity to make a sale, to build a brand, and to understand your consumer.\"</p><p>Experience will remain a buzzword in 2020, as marketers prioritise CX. Creative agencies and consultancies will battle to combine CX with brand thinking.</p><p>In-housing of adtech will continue as brands take charge of their data - 34% of respondents say they will be managing more adtech in-house in 2020. In-housing of creativity remains a trend, but a significant minority of brands are putting more work out-of-house.</p><p>Gill Zhou, VP of Marketing, Communications and Citizenship, IBM China, says, \"Creativity is still very important, but those who learn about data, statistics and algorithms have become 'mainstream' marketers.\"</p><p>Policy - Privacy-first marketing</p><p>Data privacy is both a trend in regulation, and a growing consumer demand. As such, it is one of the most important global themes for marketers in 2020.</p><p>The implementation of stronger data protection rights will have significant implications for marketers. The introduction of the California Consumer Privacy Act in January 2020 is already forcing brands and media owners to look again at their data management practices.</p><p>While the new regulations change the data landscape, there are opportunities for brands to present themselves as 'privacy first' to consumers wary of how their data is being used.</p><p>86% of respondents to WARC's Marketer's Toolkit survey agree, or strongly agree, that \"big tech firms should be subject to greater regulation\"; 66% of respondents strongly agree that consumers will take greater control of their data in 2020.</p><p>Jill Haskin, Chief Marketing Officer, The Hershey Company, says, \"For us, a big part of it is \"Do we agree with how our partners are using data?\" We just want to get a lot more transparency from our partners...

The target of the lawsuit is Optional Practical Training (OPT), which allows international students to remain in the US for a limited period of time post-graduation. As the authors of this piece are both international students from the UK, Patrick a graduate student at George Mason University, and Alice currently finishing her OPT year working at a university-based research center, the subject hits close to home. We promise we're not trying to steal your jobs. </p><p>The current COVID-19 pandemic has already been used as a justification[2] for curtailing immigration, and could add more fuel to the fire given concerns over high US unemployment. However, ending or limiting OPT will have a detrimental effect on US citizens both now and in the future. OPT is a period of work authorization[3] for international students in F1-visa status following the completion of a degree in the US The work must be related to the student's field of study and generally lasts for 12 months, but may be extended an additional 24 months for students in STEM fields. The OPT program plays a key role[4] in attracting international students to US universities. The 'Washtech' lawsuit challenges[5] DHS authority in the initial ruling, and questions whether appropriate rulemaking procedures were followed in 2008 and 2016. Restricting the OPT program has also been on the Trump administration's regulatory agenda[6] for the last four years, and a target date of August 2020 has been set to enact amendments. 'Washtech' clai[7]ms[8] that the OPT program leads to reduced employment opportunities for US citizens. However, a team of scholars at the National Foundation for American Policy[9] found that the OPT program had no effect on US employment, and that there was actually a negative relationship between unemployment and the number of OPT applicants between 2008 and 2016. Similarly, Business Roundtable[10] modeled a scenario in which new immigration policy led to a 60 percent decline in OPT participation. They found that this would cause real US GDP to decline by about 0.25 percentage points by 2028, and lead to the loss of 255,000 jobs held by native-born workers. In July 2019[11], several large business associations successfully petitioned to become party to the lawsuit in order to defend OPT suggesting that they are fearful of how changes could affect their bottom line. In November 2019, over 100 US colleges, ranging from Ivy League schools to state university systems, signed on to an amicus brief opposing the lawsuit. Restricting OPT will stifle economic growth by creating persistent gaps in the labor market. It will disable businesses' ability to acquire foreign talent based on market needs and scarcity of domestic workers. Research[12] undertaken after the 2009 recession shows that this could be particularly advantageous during downturns. Over the past few years, burdensome visa rules have influenced international students to choose countries[13] with a more liberal stance on immigration, leading to a decrease in enrollment for U.S institutions. In Canada[14], for instance, foreign students automatically qualify for work permits upon graduation. If OPT were to be limited or ended, US universities would likely continue to see significant drops in the enrollment of foreign students. During the 2018-19 academic year[15], international students contributed $39 billion to the US economy, and supported 455,622 American jobs. The Trump administration and 'Washtech' claim to want to protect US jobs, but creating an unfriendly environment for international students will lead to the destruction of the very jobs that they support. In addition, foreign students contribute to US exports when they spend money on university tuition, housing, dining, or other expenses while present in the US The Trump administration pledged[16] to reduce the US 'trade deficit[17],' but restricting the flow of foreign students will reduce America's fifth largest export[18] and widen the deficit further. The possibility of working in the US attracts some of the world's brightest young minds to its universities which drives innovation and economic growth. Studies have shown that international students are highly entrepreneurial and are far more likely to found startups and file patents than their American counterparts. A Mercatus Center study[19] demonstrated that for every foreign worker hired in an industry, 5 to 7.5 domestic jobs are created for Americans in the same industry. In the 2019 edition of their Fortune 500 report[20], the New American Economy Research Fund showed that 45 percent of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants. Innovation and entrepreneurial spirit create jobs and promote prosperity. Limiting or abolishing the OPT program will redirect the next generation of entrepreneurs toward countries with a more liberal stance on immigration, and deprive the US of future innovation and the job creation that would come with it. 'Washtech' and the Trump administration's baseless claim that restricting the OPT program will reduce 'foreign competition' is a fallacy. In the short term, US unemployment will increase as international student enrollment declines, while in the longer term, US innovation will lag inflicting serious collateral damage on us all.
