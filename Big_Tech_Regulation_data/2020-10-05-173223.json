It's the latest in a trove of conservative literature trying to dance around the fact that high-tax, highly regulated, bureaucratic states can be economic powerhouses. The writers deal with the \"problem\" by burying reality under a pile of \"buts\" and \"howevers.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent years, California has indeed suffered from gridlocked government, punishing pension obligations and debt -- plus the housing meltdown. It's been addressing these challenges. And though one cannot vouch for the wisdom of every regulation, the state's environmental ethic is a big reason smart people put up with the warts.</p><p> But only Silicon Valley is doing well, The Economist says. Manufacturing stinks. \"IPhones are 'designed by Apple in California,'\" the article notes, \"but made in Shenzhen.\"</p><p> Apple nonetheless employs 16,000 Californians in and around Cupertino and plans to expand that number to 24,000. The Apple workers reportedly earn an average of $125,000. There must be something going for Apple in California.</p><p> There's this fantasy that if our environmental regulations just went lax, America would have some renaissance in factory employment. Thing is, manufacturing output in this country has actually tripled in the last 60 years, Bloomberg Businessweek reports.</p><p>U.S. factories are simply being run with fewer, well-trained people operating computers. The low-skilled, low-wage, labor-intensive factory jobs are not coming back, and why should we want them?</p><p> The Economist seems vexed that Gov. Jerry Brown would sign a bill raising the minimum wage to $10 an hour in 2016 -- as though Wendy's could sell burgers in Bakersfield from a store in Nevada. By the way, in 1968, the national minimum wage was $10.77 in today's dollars.</p><p> Only Silicon Valley?! Check out The Wall Street Journal's new \"Billion-Dollar Startup Club.\" These are companies valued at $1 billion or more by venture capital firms.</p><p> Of the 37 billion-dollar startups, 26 are based in the U.S. -- 22 of them in California. Of the four U.S. startups not located in California, three are in New York City -- not exactly your low-tax haven and, at the moment, freezing cold. The other one is in Jacksonville, Fla.</p><p> Those who strike it rich will do tax planning, and that may include buying homes in low-tax places. But the big tech innovators are still building their companies where their brainiacs want to be. Kings of the creative class demand the stimulation found in great urban neighborhoods. And they want a nice countryside to hike in.</p><p> Two years ago, The Wall Street Journal published an emotional essay titled \"California Declares War on Suburbia.\" The writer was especially upset that the Association of Bay Area Governments had proposed limiting new housing beyond the San Francisco and San Jose \"urban fringe\" to 3 percent of the total. Most new building would be multifamily homes.</p><p> Boy, do they hate San Francisco. But the strict building rules have kept San Francisco -- and its environs -- a beautiful place. That's why tech people working in surrounding areas insist on making their nests in San Francisco when they could live cheaper, bigger and closer to work.</p><p> Universities are another magnet and incubator for new companies. They tend to spawn the liberal, active-government cultures in which innovation thrives. There's some irony that the premier tech center of Texas is progressive Austin, thanks in great part to the University of Texas, a creature of state government.</p><p> To the states with good education, an open-minded community and an attractive environment go the tech spoils. Taxation does matter, and there's such a thing as dumb regulations. But for the knowledge economy, that's not everything or even, it seems, the big thing. California shows how.</p><p> Froma Harrop is a nationally syndicated columnist.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DLYGAZ-14BA4A1DD890D180</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2897D5C6534A05 DLYGAZ2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BD6-38F1-F0NV-F3JG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388131</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"647\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Daily Gazette Co.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

Sen. Bernie Sanders would go the furthest, proposing an investment of $2.5 trillion over 10 years to build and rehabilitate nearly 10 million affordable homes over the next decade. That\u2019s a staggering amount, considering the U.S. is building about 1.3 million housing units a year \u2014 period.</p><p> Sen. Elizabeth Warren would invest $500 billion, in what the accounting firm Moody\u2019s found would create more than 3 million new affordable housing units and reduce rents by 10 percent. Former hedge fund chief Tom Steyer would spend $470 billion.</p><p> \u201cThe solutions and numbers may feel very big, and even overwhelming, but this is the scale of the problem,\u201d said David Zisser, the associate director of the affordable housing advocacy group Housing California. \u201cI suspect that $2.5 trillion (that Sanders is proposing) is probably about right.\u201d</p><p> Not surprisingly, the party\u2019s most progressive candidates would fund their fix by taxing the rich. Warren would expand the estate tax, while Sanders would use a wealth tax on the richest 0.1 percent of Americans. His plan also calls for a 25 percent house-flipping tax on non-owner-occupied property sold within five years of purchase, and a 2 percent tax on the value of vacant homes.</p><p> Experts warn throwing money at affordable housing won\u2019t go that far without also changing local zoning rules that limit where apartment buildings can be built. Warren, Steyer and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg would give grants to cities that reform those zoning practices, while South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sanders would use a stick instead of a carrot, making federal housing or transportation funds to cities contingent on zoning reform.</p><p> Other candidates take a different tack by focusing on renters, with proposals from Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Bloomberg, Buttigieg, Sanders and others to greatly increase the availability of housing vouchers \u2014 federal funding helping low-income people pay their rent. And Bloomberg, Buttigieg and Klobuchar would expand tax credits that encourage developers to build affordable housing.</p><p> In one of the most drastic proposals, Sanders has called for a national rent-control law capping annual rent increases at 3 percent or 1.5 times the rate of inflation \u2014 more stringent than a similar California law passed last year \u2014 even though some experts warn that would stifle new housing construction. None of the other candidates support that idea.</p><p> But they do offer a variety of unique proposals. Buttigieg and Sanders have endorsed a program in which the federal government would give grants to cities to purchase abandoned or foreclosed homes and give them to low-income people who live in historically redlined or racially segregated areas.</p><p> After 10 years of living in the home as their primary residence, the \u201chomesteader\u201d would fully own the property.</p><p> Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign says he would focus on policies that get homeless people into homes as quickly as possible instead of making shelter a condition of staying sober or participating in other programs. And Warren would deny federal grants to police departments that arrest homeless people for living on the streets.</p><p> All of the candidates would go further than Trump, who has talked tough about cracking down on homelessness in California without laying out many specifics, cut funding for public housing repairs in his proposed budgets, and pushed state and local governments to cut regulations that get in the way of building affordable housing.</p><p> Fighting wildfires</p><p> All of the candidates have outlined policies to slash U.S. carbon emissions and fight climate change. But some also have focused on what the federal government can do to support California and other wildfire-prone Western states facing increasingly deadly and costly wildfires \u2014 many of which were sparked by damaged power lines from PG&amp;E and other utilities.</p><p> The president can play a big role in fighting wildfires in the state because 57 percent of California forests are owned and managed by the feds. Ken Pimlott, a former Cal Fire chief, said the federal government should be investing more on fire prevention efforts, instead of just supporting the state after huge fires break out.</p><p> \u201cHistorically it has been state and local governments working in these areas \u2014 but with the size of the problem we\u2019re facing, this is clearly a federal issue too,\u201d Pimlott said.</p><p> Steyer \u2014 the only Californian still in the race \u2014 has called for spending a total of $130 billion on forest health and fire safety as well as other agricultural policies. The fires that have devastated communities around California \u201cserve as a reminder of how uncertain our future will be if we don\u2019t address the climate crisis immediately,\u201d Steyer said.</p><p> Bloomberg has come out with the most specific plan, calling for doubling federal funding to $10 billion to manage forests and to help communities protect themselves against fires, with half of that going to forest restoration and mitigation work. He would also increase FEMA funding for fireproofing homes.</p><p> Sanders is the only candidate who\u2019s called for a public takeover of the California utility giant Pacific Gas and Electric Co., criticizing the company for prioritizing corporate payouts over fire safety in an online video ad released last week.</p><p> Warren, Bloomberg, and Klobuchar have called for federal investments in microgrid technology \u2014 energy systems disconnected from the main electricity grid \u2014 which experts say can help reduce fire risk and avoid the blackouts that plagued Northern California during last year\u2019s fire season.</p><p> Several of the candidates would start new programs to put more people to work defending against fires. Bloomberg calls for a \u201cWildfire Corps,\u201d a team of thousands of workers who would be trained in leading fire resilience work. Steyer has a similar proposal for a \u201cCivilian Climate Corps.\u201d</p><p> Trump has urged California to improve its forest management \u2014 memorably, calling for the state to \u201crake\u201d its forests \u2014 and approved disaster relief funds for communities devastated by fires. But he\u2019s done little to change the federal government\u2019s approach to wildfires.</p><p> Regulating Big Tech companies</p><p> The Democratic candidates agree that tech giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple have too much power. But they\u2019re divided on what to do about it.</p><p> Two contenders \u2014 Warren and Sanders \u2014 have endorsed breaking up those companies, in a seismic shift for Silicon Valley. Warren has championed the idea, laying out a plan to break up companies with revenue of more than $25 billion that offer online marketplaces while participating on those platforms, like Amazon selling its own products that compete with other vendors using its site.</p><p> That would bring balance to an industry where a few companies have \u201cbulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else,\u201d Warren argues in her plan.</p><p> The other candidates have called for a variety of new regulations on the tech industry and said they\u2019d be open to breaking up companies in some cases \u2014 but none would go as far as Warren or Sanders.</p><p> Biden said he would let the Justice Department, \u201cnot politics,\u201d decide which antitrust cases to bring. Bloomberg has said Warren and Sanders don\u2019t \u201cknow what they\u2019re talking about\u201d on the issue, although he\u2019d be open to some more limited breakups. And Klobuchar said in an interview she favored a broader revamp of U.S. antitrust laws that went beyond a \u201cbumper sticker solution.\u201d</p><p> Several candidates have also called for amending or ending laws related to online misinformation. Warren has proposed \u201ctough civil and criminal penalties\u201d for people who knowingly share false information about when and how to vote in U.S. elections.</p><p> Currently, under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, social media companies aren\u2019t legally responsible for content their users post. Biden has called for repealing that law, which would lead to a massive shift in tech policy, while Bloomberg has suggested he wants to amend it.</p><p> And many of the candidates have called for new regulations on data privacy, although there are few specifics. Buttigieg wants to pass a federal privacy law that requires companies to limit and protect the user data they collect, while Klobuchar has suggested taxing companies that exploit user data.</p><p> What about Trump? He has sounded off about bias among the big tech companies, and his Department of Justice has launched a major investigation into whether the firms have pushed anticompetitive policies.</p><p> Legal immigration and H-1B visas</p><p> All of the candidates have opposed Trump\u2019s crackdown on undocumented immigrants and called for an end to practices like separating migrant families at the border. But there\u2019s been far less conversation about reforming the legal immigration system, even though the large majority of immigrants in California and around the country enter the country legally.</p><p> Only a few of the candidates have weighed in on the issue of H-1B visas \u2014 the program that lets highly skilled foreigners work in the U.S., and has helped Silicon Valley companies recruit hundreds of thousands of employees. The program has faced uncertainty under Trump, and critics say it allows outsourcing companies to replace American workers with lower-paid foreigners.</p><p> Bloomberg and Steyer support raising the annual 85,000 cap on H-1B visas \u2014 a limit that\u2019s reached within days of applications opening each year. Klobuchar has also introduced legislation in the Senate to more than double the number of visas available.</p><p> They would all pair those increases with reforms to the system such as mandating higher wages to ensure U.S. workers aren\u2019t displaced. Bloomberg is also proposing a \u201cstartup visa\u201d for international entrepreneurs, similar to a program in Canada.</p><p> \u201cWhether they are starting businesses in Silicon Valley or on Main Street, job-creating immigrants should be welcomed to the U.S. and not sent away to our competitors,\u201d the former mayor says in his plan.</p><p> Sanders\u2019 campaign said he would require employers to pay substantially higher wages for H-1B visa-holders, and make them portable between jobs \u201cso workers are not trapped at a sponsoring employer.\u201d He would also put in place tougher enforcement standards to ensure H-1B visa holders aren\u2019t replacing American workers.</p><p> In another reform, Buttigieg, Sanders and Steyer said they\u2019d allow the spouses of H-1B visa holders to work \u2014 a direct contrast with the Trump administration, which is moving to revoke spouses\u2019 work authorization.</p><p> Beyond H-1B visas, Biden and Bloomberg would both get rid of caps that limit how many employment-based green cards are given out each year to citizens of any one country, which have led to huge backlogs for immigrants from China and India. They\u2019d also set up procedures to adjust the number of employment visas available based on unemployment and other economic conditions in the U.S.</p><p> That\u2019s a smart idea for modernizing our immigration policy, said Sarah Pierce, an analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington.</p><p> \u201cWe need a system that\u2019s dynamic and responds to the market, instead of this ridiculous system that\u2019s been set in statute for decades,\u201d she said. \u201cThe process should be a lot more thoughtful.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

It's the latest in a trove of conservative literature trying to dance around the fact that high-tax, highly regulated, bureaucratic states can be economic powerhouses. The writers deal with the \"problem\" by burying reality under a pile of \"buts\" and \"howevers.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent years, California has indeed suffered from gridlocked government, punishing pension obligations and debt - plus the housing meltdown.</p><p>It's been addressing these challenges. And though one cannot vouch for the wisdom of every regulation, the state's environmental ethic is a big reason smart people put up with the warts.</p><p>But only Silicon Valley is doing well, The Economist says. Manufacturing stinks. \"IPhones are 'designed by Apple in California,'\" the article notes, \"but made in Shenzhen.\"</p><p>Apple nonetheless employs 16,000 Californians in and around Cupertino and plans to expand that number to 24,000.</p><p>The Apple workers reportedly earn an average of $125,000. There must be something going for Apple in California.</p><p>There's this fantasy that if our environmental regulations just went lax, America would have some renaissance in factory employment.</p><p>Thing is, manufacturing output in this country has actually tripled in the last 60 years, Bloomberg Businessweek reports.</p><p>U.S. factories are simply being run with fewer, well-trained people operating computers. The low-skilled, low-wage, labor-intensive factory jobs are not coming back, and why should we want them?</p><p>The Economist seems vexed that Gov. Jerry Brown would sign a bill raising the minimum wage to $10 an hour in 2016 - as though Wendy's could sell burgers in Bakersfield from a store in Nevada.</p><p>By the way, in 1968, the national minimum wage was $10.77 in today's dollars.</p><p>Only Silicon Valley?! Check out The Wall Street Journal's new \"Billion-Dollar Startup Club.\" These are companies valued at $1 billion or more by venture capital firms.</p><p>Of the 37 billion-dollar startups, 26 are based in the U.S. - 22 of them in California. Of the four U.S. startups not located in California, three are in New York City - not exactly your low-tax haven and, at the moment, freezing cold.</p><p>The other one is in Jacksonville, Fla.</p><p>Those who strike it rich will do tax planning, and that may include buying homes in low-tax places. But the big tech innovators are still building their companies where their brainiacs want to be. Kings of the creative class demand the stimulation found in great urban neighborhoods. And they want a nice countryside to hike in.</p><p>Two years ago, The Wall Street Journal published an emotional essay titled \"California Declares War on Suburbia.\"</p><p>The writer was especially upset that the Association of Bay Area Governments had proposed limiting new housing beyond the San Francisco and San Jose \"urban fringe\" to 3 percent of the total. Most new building would be multifamily homes.</p><p>Boy, do they hate San Francisco. But the strict building rules have kept San Francisco - and its environs - a beautiful place.</p><p>That's why tech people working in surrounding areas insist on making their nests in San Francisco when they could live cheaper, bigger and closer to work.</p><p>Universities are another magnet and incubator for new companies.</p><p>They tend to spawn the liberal, active-government cultures in which innovation thrives.</p><p>There's some irony that the premier tech center of Texas is progressive Austin, thanks in great part to the University of Texas, a creature of state government.</p><p>To the states with good education, an open-minded community and an attractive environment go the tech spoils.</p><p>Taxation does matter, and there's such a thing as dumb regulations.</p><p>But for the knowledge economy, that's not everything or even, it seems, the big thing. California shows how.</p><p>Harrop is a columnist for</p><p>the Providence Journal.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHRGAZ-2014031516</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHRGAZ2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BDH-GD21-JCB7-11V4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">146813</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"641\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Charleston Newspapers</copyright><publicationName>Charleston Gazette (West Virginia)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"01\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>January 31, 2014, Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000258H</classCode><className>APPLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0004CEB</classCode><className>WALL STREET JOURNAL</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS423430 COMPUTER &amp;

Regulations have made housing unaffordable for young families and their cities are being hollowed out with fewer kids. ... Last year, I wrote[2] that expensive housing in America's richest cities was pushing away families with children, leading to a #8216;childless city.#8217; California's biggest metros are on the bleeding edge of this trend. </p><p>Since the end of the Great Recession, home prices in Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Francisco have increased by 70 percent[3], 80 percent[4], and 116 percent[5], respectively. This has driven middle-class families to either move inland or leave entirely. San Francisco has the lowest percentage of children[6] under 18 of any major city in the U.S., and Los Angeles County has seen a 17 percent decline[7] in the number of kids in the past 10 years.Read: Silicon Valley abandons the culture that made it the envy of the world[8]Births are falling, due to declining fertility among all groups, including Latinos, who make up about one-third of the state's population. And deaths are increasing as the population ages. The state's annual natural growth\u2014births minus deaths\u2014has plummeted from more than 300,000[9] in 2008 to 180,000 today. According to figures shared by the California Department of Finance, the median age is rising 40 percent faster than that of the rest of the U.S. population. ...Most of the housing stock in these cities is old and people are spending extravagantly to try to bring the small houses up to date. Restrictions make building new homes difficult to impossible and when people do go that route regulations drive up the cost. One of the new regulations required solar panels which when hooked up to the grid are worthless when the state requires a blackout fearing fires. They do that rather than manage the forests to prevent fires. Not many people can afford million-dollar mortgages.

But as Marisa Lagos from member station KQED in San Francisco reports, the issue's far from settled.             </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MARISA LAGOS:                 The California Consumer Privacy Act was hailed as the most sweeping data privacy law in the U.S. But even here, lawmakers don't think their work is done. Republican Assemblyman Jordan Cunningham says it's an issue that transcends partisan differences.             </p><p>JORDAN CUNNINGHAM:                 And, you know, when I talked to my constituents about it, they're overwhelmingly supportive of the notion of individual privacy and the importance of passing laws that make sure that the individual consumer doesn't get lost in this rush to new technologies.             </p><p>MARISA LAGOS:                 This focus on privacy picked up steam after a spate of scandals at Facebook, including last year's revelation that a political research firm improperly captured information about tens of millions of Facebook users. California's law is the first of its kind in the U.S., allowing Californians to ask a business what personal information has been collected by a company about them and to tell the company to erase that information. The thing is the law hasn't even taken effect yet. It kicks in next January.             </p><p>                But there are already more than 40 new bills in Sacramento that run the gamut from tweaking technical language to more sweeping changes, like allowing consumers to sue companies for violating the law. And at least eight other states are now considering legislation with some going even further. In Massachusetts, for example, a proposed bill lets the public sue companies directly. Vermont has enacted a law that will force companies that buy and sell personal data to register with the state. All that state action has spurred Congress to at least start talking about whether tech companies are too big and powerful. Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal grilled tech lobbyists at a recent hearing.             </p><p>                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                </p><p>RICHARD BLUMENTHAL:                 Let me begin by asking how many of you believe that Americans deserve the same level of privacy now as a floor that California provides for its people.             </p><p>MARISA LAGOS:                 There's one Senate bill with broad Democratic support to require websites and apps to protect personal data. And Senators Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, both presidential candidates, are campaigning on getting tough on big tech. Could all this movement lead to a rare bipartisan agreement in Congress? Terrell McSweeny is a former federal trade commissioner.             </p><p>TERRELL MCSWEENY:                 I would say there are a lot of efforts that are bipartisan. I think we can reasonably assume that there's going to be a lot of focus and energy around this discussion at the federal level.             </p><p>MARISA LAGOS:                 But getting anything done in D.C. is difficult, McSweeny says.             </p><p>TERRELL MCSWEENY:                 So we might see more action at the state level in the next year than we will at the federal level.             </p><p>MARISA LAGOS:                 All these moves could even be influencing the big tech companies. Earlier this week, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced plans to transform the social media company into a privacy-focused platform that is more centered around private messages than public posts. Mary Stone Ross, a former CIA analyst who helped craft the California law, says Zuckerberg's move is clearly a response to pressure from states like California.             </p><p>MARY STONE ROSS:                 I think that they're trying to get ahead of all these proposed regulations by saying, look; like, we realize that we have had mistakes around privacy in the past. But we're changing. This is a play to look better when they go walk through the halls of Congress.             </p><p>MARISA LAGOS:                 In the meantime, California lawmakers are pushing ahead to make its data privacy laws stronger. And in other states around the country, lawmakers are just getting started.

Good Thursday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Thursday, November 8th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have breaking news to report this morning. There's been a mass shooting in a California bar. At least 12 people have been killed including a sheriff's deputy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GEOFF DEAN, VENTURY COUNTY SHERIFF: Sergeant Helus died at the -- the sergeant passed away at the hospital about an hour ago.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ventura County sheriff's spokesman says that the gunman is also dead. We will bring you the very latest developments as they come in, in California.</p><p>Plus, Jeff Sessions fired -- what's next for the Department of Justice and the Russia investigation? That's coming up.</p><p>New overnight -- a new era for Tesla. The company replacing Elon Musk as chairman with Robyn Denholm. We are looking at her tough job ahead of her of keeping Musk in line.</p><p>And then hit send too soon? Facebook now has a fix for that. How you can unsend messages through Facebook.</p><p>Markets this morning are pulling back after that powerful rally yesterday. Take a look at markets right now with futures indicating a lower opening for the broader averages. Dow Industrials set to be down 60 points at the start of trading, a quarter of a percent lower. The Nasdaq is down a half of a percent, 37 points lower. Investors are waiting on the Federal Reserve decision that's due today at 2:15 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>Meanwhile, yesterday big day -- stocks rallied sharply. Dow Industrials yesterday was up better than 500 points.</p><p>European markets -- no follow through today. The FT 100 is up 21 points but the CAC 40 is down a half a point and the DAX index is down 18 points.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets mostly higher overnight. Take a look. Asian markets as you can see, the Shanghai composite was lower but Japan was up almost 2 percent.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning. And joining me to break it all down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; Townhall.com political editor, Fox News contributor Guy Benson; and the \"Wall Street Journal\" editor at large, Gerry Baker. Good to see you this morning.</p><p>GERRY BAKER, EDITOR AT LARGE, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\": Thank you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us.</p><p>BAKER: Yes, thank you.</p><p>GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Good morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Horrific news.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Horrific news on the shooting. And of course, there are other issues to talk about. But we've been following all morning this mass shooting in California, 12 people have been killed; 13 if you count the gunman. Among the dead, the sheriff's deputy.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with all the details right now -- Lauren.</p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Yes, it's the middle of the night in California where we have learned that at least 12 people including that sheriff's deputy are dead. A gunman opened fire at a country music bar in Thousand Oaks, California. That's about 40 miles west of Los Angeles.</p><p>The scene is contained. The shooter is dead inside the building. They did find a handgun. They did not find an assault rifle but they do continue to search. Authorities say hundreds of people were inside the Borderline Bar and Grill because it was hosting a college country night.</p><p>We're going to show you some witnesses, describing the chaos that they heard and they experienced after those shots were fired.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I just started hearing these big pops -- pop, pop, pop. There was probably three or four. I hit the ground. I look up. The security guard's dead. I don't want to say dead but he was shot. He was down. And the gunman was throwing smoke grenades all over the place.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: You have to remember, this was college night. So the families of these victims are being notified. It is horrific. It is heart- wrenching.</p><p>And that's what you heard from Sheriff Geoff Dean as he was telling us about his friend, the sergeant deputy who died in that bar.</p><p>So, he was 29 years on the force. It really is a heart-wrenching story -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok. Lauren -- thank you. And we'll come back to you as news develops.</p><p>Joining me right now is Texas Congressman Louie Gohmert. Congressman Gohmert -- good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>REP. LOUIE GOHMERT (R), TEXAS: Good to see you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Obviously, you are the vice chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security. Your reaction to this horrific news that we're reporting this morning and how do you stop something like this?</p><p>GOHMERT:: Well, John Adams said it clearly back in 1796 as our second president. Our constitution was intended for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate for the governing of any other. And we have to get back to teaching right and wrong.</p><p>But right now, our hearts and prayers do go out to family members and those who experienced this horrific shooting. And the deputy that just -- I mean, I know hundreds -- I've worked with hundreds of law enforcement and it's still just -- I tear up when I think about guys that run to the sound of the guns instead of running the other direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's right.</p><p>GOHMERT:: Real heroes. And we heard the sheriff say we don't know if there's terrorism. Well, we know that there was terrorism. Somebody comes in with smoke bombs and wanting to shoot multiple people, clearly they intended -- that person intended to terrorize.</p><p>But of course, we know terrorism is a euphemism for radical Islam. And the sheriff is -- what he was really saying is we don't know if it was radical Islam like the shooting at the bar in Orlando.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GOHMERT:: But that is yet to be determined.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GOHMERT:: But when you wear black. You're bringing smoke grenades, clearly it was premeditated murder. And it's unfortunate that we don't have the chance to actually put him to death. I don't know that that would have happened in California.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GOHMERT:: But right now, for all the victims, there is just so much shock and so much hurting and I've seen enough of it in my life. It never gets easier.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: No, it doesn't. and it's really hard to watch the witnesses, very tearful, talking about what they saw. It's just an incredible story. And we will find the motive and bring it to our viewers.</p><p>Want to switch gears and ask about the divided Congress, sir. Because Democrats retook the House obviously or they're retaking the House. Republicans are gearing up for anticipated -- some hurdles on issues from taxes to trade.</p><p>The President and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi both spoke out yesterday on plans for bipartisanship. Listen to this. I've got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I give her a great deal of credit for what she's done and what she's accomplished. Hopefully we can all work together next year to continue delivering for the American people.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: We, as Democrats, are here to strengthen the institution in which we serve and not to have it be a rubber stamp for President Trump. We believe that we have a responsibility to seek common ground where we can; where we cannot, we must stand our ground.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know there's a lot of planning yesterday -- Congressman, with Republicans, party leaders, trying to map this course for the divided Congress. How is this going to look with now the Democrats in the majority in the House?</p><p>GOHMERT:: Well actually, Maria -- it's been a divided Congress for the last nearly two years. It's just that in the past two years, it's been divided between a majority of the Republicans in the House and what we wanted to do to build a wall where it was needed, to secure the border, to avoid amnesty, those kind of things -- that was what the majority of Republicans wanted to do. And then the division was with our own leadership that we're not going to help the President accomplish his major promises that got him elected president.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GOHMERT:: So this time now, it will be divided come January between political parties. But I'm delighted to hear Nancy Pelosi talk in those terms. It beats the heck out of the Democrat chairman over Energy and Commerce that handled the Obamacare when Republicans were saying look, let's work together on dealing with pre-existing conditions --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GOHMERT:: -- and taking care of people through age 26. I was ok going 30 or 40 if you're living with your parents.</p><p>But the chairman said we don't need Republican -- we don't want Republican input and we don't need Republican votes. And so it's really nice to hear Nancy Pelosi talking in these terms. We'll see how long that lasts.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Let me turn to Jeff Sessions. Some people are saying look, this is right here, one of the first things that the Democrats are going to be complaining about, and they are. The President fired the U.S. Attorney General, replacing him with Sessions' chief of staff, Matthew Whitaker yesterday. A permanent replacement expected to be nominated at a later date.</p><p>What's your reaction to this? Obviously, no surprise. We were all expecting Jeff Sessions to resign right after the midterm elections. But does this create a problem for the President, given we've already heard from the Democrats saying somebody else is overseeing the Mueller probe, we don't like it.</p><p>GOHMERT:: Well, the Democrats ought to love it because they should have seen that this was coming. And I love Jeff Sessions. He's a fine, decent, moral, ethical man. And I think he was a little naive in not appreciating the people that work for Rosenstein that wanted to diminish him in the President's eyes and gave him bad advice including to recuse himself.</p><p>He relied too heavily on the advice of people he called career but I would say were Democrat operatives, just been there a while.</p><p>But I was a little surprised. Matthew Whitaker's a great guy. He's a wonderful man. But Democrats ought to be loving Matt because his job as chief of staff to Jeff Sessions was to look out for Jeff Sessions and he did not keep him away from the bad advice of people that wanted to destroy Jeff. And so they ought to love the fact that Matt's been raised -- he didn't do a good job protecting his boss, Jeff, from the radicals -- and I'm not talking radical Islam, I'm just talking radical Democrats that loved Sally Yates, loved Obama, hated Trump. He should have protected Jeff better from bad advice and now he's going to be acting AG. And so they ought to be loving it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, agenda item number one will likely be ok, Robert Mueller, let's see what you have. Where are we on this? Where do you think we are in the Robert Mueller probe? How will Matthew Whitaker deal with this differently?</p><p>I mean in terms of the investigations going on in your chamber into the DOJ, the FBI, and that cabal of people who would tried to stop Donald Trump, where are those investigations? Do they go away at this point?</p><p>GOHMERT:: No, absolutely not. We need to conclude them and even though our -- well, in January the former speaker, the current speaker, his advice to us was when there's no drama, we win. When there's no drama, we win.</p><p>That's ridiculous. That's coming from somebody that wants to avoid a fight apparently because what we see is, and President Trump has shown it, when we fight, there's some drama but we win. And so our --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, they're going to be fighting with the President though -- Congressman. I mean we've heard from Gerry Nadler. We've heard from, you know, Elijah Cummings --</p><p>GOHMERT:: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: -- who are going to be -- and Adam Schiff who are going to be the leaders of, you know, the chairmen of some important committees there.</p><p>GOHMERT:: But they're not yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what is the President going to do with all of these investigations that are going to pile up once the new Congress gets in session?</p><p>GOHMERT:: I heard someone say he's going to need to add more lawyers to the White House and I think he's right about that --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GOHMERT:: -- because he's going to be overwhelmed with discovery requests and subpoenas.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So does anything get done for the American people legislatively, sir?</p><p>GOHMERT:: I sure hope so because I hope the Democrats don't make the mistake of hurting Americans like they did with Obamacare, destroying seniors' health care, removing $716 billion from Medicare.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about immigration -- congressman? You've got a caravan crisis right now; thousands of troops are deployed at the border as we speak. The migrant caravan continues moving northbound from Mexico.</p><p>GOHMERT:: Now, the President is going to protect the country. He made that very clear when I was talking to him about it in Houston. He is going to protect the country. He doesn't need Congress to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But don't you need the Democrats' help? They're now in charge of, you know, they're the majority in the House. I mean Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell weighed in on the future plans for the border wall funding yesterday. Here's what he said. I've got to get your reaction.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: We're certainly going to try to help the President achieve what he would like to do with regard to the wall and border security. And that will obviously have to be done on some kind of bipartisan, excuse me, some kind of bipartisan discussion.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: So I go back to the first question. I mean how is this going to work? Will you see bipartisan work together? You represent the people of Texas. Your take on this?</p><p>GOHMERT:: Well, we haven't seen any bipartisanship really at work here, even to the point that they would destroy an honorable man like Kavanaugh. So -- but hopefully there will be a change of heart. That's hope that springs eternal in him and Brett. And with God all things are possible.</p><p>But we just haven't seen any evidence that that's what they really want to do. But let's face it, I love hearing Mitch McConnell say we're going to help the President with a wall because I know the House leadership sure hasn't done that for the last nearly two years.</p><p>So we've got a little window here before we lose it and actually if we took a step we could pass funding for the wall without having to have cloture in the Senate. And I understand we're going to hopefully work on that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll be watching. Congressman -- it's good to see you as always. Thanks so much, sir.</p><p>GOHMERT:: Great to see you. Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Louie Gohmert joining us there.</p><p>Breaking news overnight, 12 people are dead including a sheriff's deputy after a gunman opened fire at a California bar. The very latest, next.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Breaking news this morning, a mass shooting in southern California.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with all the details now -- Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: We've been following the story all morning -- Maria.</p><p>At least 12 people, including a sheriff's deputy, killed in a shooting at a country bar in southern California. The suspect, in addition, is dead. The shooting happening last night around 11:20 local time in Thousand Oaks, California. That's about 40 miles west of Los Angeles.</p><p>The bar was packed at the time with college students. They were hosting a college country night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN: We have no idea if there's a terrorism link to this event or not. As you know, these are ongoing investigations and that information will come out as soon as we're able to determine exactly who the suspect was and what motive he might have had for this horrific event.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: All right. Talking about what the motive was and they don't know yet.</p><p>The officer who was killed identified as Ventura County Sheriff's Department Sergeant Ron Helus. He is survived by a wife and his son. He was actually getting ready to retire next year.</p><p>Also breaking overnight, Tesla's board has a new chair. Robyn Denholm is going to replace Elon Musk who'll step down from the position as part of a settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Tesla had until November 13th to announce a new chairman under the SEC agreement which found that Musk's tweets in August about taking his company private were fraudulent.</p><p>Denholm has served on Tesla's board since 2014. Now, Elon Musk tweeted he \"Would like to thank Robyn for joining the team. Great respect. Very much look forward to working together.\"</p><p>Taking a look at shares of Tesla in the premarket, down about a quarter percent.</p><p>And rising interest rates are making would-be home buyers nervous. The number of mortgage applications fell 4 percent last week to its lowest level since 2014. The Mortgage Bankers Association says applications to buy a home fell the most, by 5 percent; refinancing applications dropping 3 percent. Higher rates of course the result of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates eight times since December of 2015. And they are, of course, meeting this week as well -- Maria.</p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Yes. We will find out today but we're not expecting a rate hike today from that two-day meeting at the Fed.</p><p>Breaking overnight a deadly mass shooting in a California bar. A dozen people have been killed, including a sheriff's deputy when a gunman opened fire during a college night. The very latest straight ahead.</p><p>We are also keeping a watch on markets this morning, and earnings where the 2018 midterms had a big effect yesterday. Markets were up better than 500 points on the Dow. We've got that and a lot more. This morning, bit of a pullback.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>We have breaking news this morning out of California. Twelve people have been killed including a sheriff's deputy in a mass bar shooting.</p><p>We are watching markets as well after yesterday's big rally. We're seeing a pullback this morning. Dow Industrials expected to be down about 50 points at the start of trading, down a quarter of a percent. The Nasdaq is down 31 after a huge rally yesterday on the midterm elections.</p><p>We are waiting on the Fed decision, of course. that's due out at 2:15 p.m. Eastern. We're not expecting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates after a two-day meeting..</p><p>European indices are mixed. The FT 100 is up 26 points, the CAC in Paris was flat and the DAX index in Germany is down 20 as well.</p><p>And in Asia overnight markets finished mostly higher with the exception of China.</p><p>Joining us right now is Spruce Point Capital Management founder and chief investment officer, Ben Axler. And Ben -- it's good to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BEN AXLER, FOUNDER &amp; CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SPRUCE POINT CAPITAL MANAGEMENT: Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Were you surprised at that big rally in stocks yesterday?</p><p>AXLER: Not at all. I think the market's base case was that the Democrats were going to take the house. Obviously political uncertainty is never good for markets. Markets got what they wanted. Now we move on to the Fed and interest rate.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wo what would you do in terms of money right now? Do you want to put money into work in stocks or no?</p><p>AXLER: So we're -- we're a short selling firm. We play defense a lot. We think right now is not a great time to be overly exposed to stocks given where we are in the business cycle, rate rising cycle. We're in a lax regulatory environment as well.</p><p>We're focused really on companies that are flattering their numbers with aggressive counting (ph), receiving high valuations for speculative business models.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And just to be clear -- you're shorting those companies?</p><p>AXLER: Absolutely. We're shorting them with an activist bent. We put our research on our Web site and try to find, you know, the good companies from the bad companies.</p><p>BENSON: On the politics side, do you think the markets sort of like divided government where, you know, you have the tax cuts, you had the deregulation, things are doing very well in the economy so maybe some gridlock is sort of ok in Washington?</p><p>AXLER: That seems to always be the case, yes. I mean historically speaking, gridlock is somewhat bullish for markets. But we're really focused mosh on the rate-rising cycle. And think that the market is going to be more discriminating now.</p><p>The easy money is made in a lower rate-cutting environment. Rate-rising cycle -- the market is focused the quality of the companies, the valuations and how the companies are putting their capital to work.</p><p>BAKER: What about the tech sector? You know, the big tech companies took a bit of a beating in the last month or so, had some good bit of a recovery yesterday. I'm interested in your point about, you know, companies that are maybe have got some questionable numbers.</p><p>Where do you see now, because they've been so much behind the surge in equity prices in the last couple of years? And they now dominate many of the major indexes. Where do you see -- where do you see the major tech companies going in the next year or so?</p><p>AXLER: Yes. We had some really good success shorting tech companies this past month. The market is much more discriminating now on the quality of the business. So one of our best shorts was a company call To You (ph). It trades at 10 times revenues, losing $40 million a year, the stock was at an all-time high. Brokers putting $100 price target on it. Now, the stock's at $50.</p><p>So it really comes down now to the quality of the business. Are they making money? Do they have a path to profitability? And I think you're going to see more discrimination between those that have a real business model and those that don't.</p><p>BAKER: And rates do you see, you know, we're going to see the Fed today, the Fed's not going to do anything today. But you know, short-term rates gone up with long-term rates -- have gone up as well as the last year. How much is that starting -- I mean I don't see that's having an overall effect on the market -- but how does that affect some of the individual companies that you're look at? How do you weigh that as you look at --</p><p>AXLER: Tremendously. So we've had good success in the past month shorting companies with low or declining organic growth and a lot of debt, particularly companies exposed to short-term debt.</p><p>We recently shorted a company call Dollarama in Canada, $1.8 billion of debt coming due in the next 24 months. The companies is discounting the companies that are going to have to refinance; they're going to have to refinance at a higher rate. The market's discriminating between those with longer term maturities and those were shorter.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Are you short Tesla?</p><p>AXLER: We're not short Tesla. We try to find companies that have a less crowded short position. You know, as we've seen, Tesla's a battle ground stock, it can move 10, 15, 20 percent on a tweet from, you know, Elon Musk. We're trying to find situations where the market doesn't already know what the short pieces (ph) is, less crowding, lower short squeeze risk.</p><p>MCDOWELL: What are some other shorts that are too crowded for you to really want to anticipate?</p><p>AXLER: Well, I mean --</p><p>MCDOWELL: I mean participate, rather.</p><p>AXLER: Yes, I mean our threshold generally, we see a short interest higher than 30 percent, that's sort of indication to us that hey the market already sees that there's a structural problem here. When the shorts are that high sometimes the cost of borrowing the stock is high.</p><p>So we're trying to find situations that aren't crowded where we're actually getting paid right now to short given the general collateral rates of, you know, a percent, percent and-a-half. Those are the situations we want to be involved in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Ok.</p><p>BAKER: What's the best short you've done in the last few months?</p><p>AXLER: So we shorted Maxar Technologies. That was a merger between McDonald Dettweiler (ph), and a merger between McDonald debt Wyler and digital globe which shorted it in the 50 50s. the stock went down to about $15 a share. They just compare the satellite assets. A lot of debt, no growth. The market is figuring these situations out quickly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what's your take on the broader market? I know you have specific, you know, shorts in some of the smaller companies that are unknown. But your take on the broader markets? We had a huge rally yesterday. A bit of a pullback this morning.</p><p>AXLER: My take is that we're in the later stages of the cycle. I think the market can continue to grind a little bit higher. We've been pretty vocal that we think we're in a sort of low single digit return environment with a lot of volatility. Volatility presents trading opportunities, clearly.</p><p>But investors need to play defense. You know, not every stock's a buy. A tremendous amount of the brokers are still putting buy targets and 20 percent upside scenarios on stocks. And that's need to, you know, scrutinize their portfolio carefully, play defense. But they can still make money on the long side. It's just going to be a little harder.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Ben -- it's good to have you.

We have been following all morning. 12 people have been killed in a mass shooting in a California bar. Among the dead, a sheriff's deputy. Lauren Simonetti with all the details right now, Lauren.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: Hi Maria. It is the wee hours of the morning in Thousand Oaks, California, some 40 miles west of Los Angeles. Just hours ago, tragedy unfolded for the families of at least 12 victims. Our local affiliate talking to some of the parents of the students at that Borderline Bar and Grill. They're now trying to get in touch with their sons and daughters. Victims are witnessing the chaos that unfolded.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was on the like side area, you could say, by the stage and where I was looking was directly of where the guy walked in and started shooting. And, yes, I just -- I can't believe I saw it with my own two eyes. It just freaks me out. Because where I was looking, you know, just by all means some guy just walks in, pulls out a gun and start shooting people. Still just puts me in shock because out here in like Thousand Oaks, just Ventura county area, it's our safe haven. You know, nothing like this happens.</p><p>I saw two shots and then I heard about five or six and then that's when I was out of the building. But people I guess there was like smoke -- like grenades going off. I wasn't in the building when that one happened. Everyone was --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: A handgun was found at the scene. No assault rifle. But a search is still being done. Ventura county sheriff Geoff Dean describing the scene earlier this morning.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN: It's a horrific scene in there. There's blood everywhere. And the suspect is part of that.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI: Multiple law enforcement agencies are on the ground. And the Los Angeles Times is reporting that some of the people inside that bar for country night, and you only had to be 18 to get in to line dance, some of those people were also last year in Las Vegas at the mass shooting at the music festival there, Maria.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's incredible. And that's what you mentioned earlier, Guy Benson. We'll have more on that coming up. Thank you so much, Lauren.</p><p>We want to turn now to the midterm aftermath. Both President Trump and potential House speaker Nancy Pelosi sounding off yesterday about the results and sounding open to reaching across the aisle on certain issues. The Wall Street Journal's editorial board issuing a warning on any potential deal, titled this The Nancy Pelosi Method is an op-ed this morning. Mr. Trump has no fix policy compass on most issues. So there's a serious risk he'll be lured into anti-growth traps. The U.S. could do worse than two years of virtuous gridlock when nothing economically damaging happens in Washington.</p><p>Joining us right now is former Hillary for America senior advisor, Democratic strategist, Adrienne Elrod and chairman of the American Conservative Union, Matt Schlapp. Matt, your reaction to the Journal's comments. Thank you so much to you both for joining us this morning.</p><p>ADRIENNE ELROD, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION: Yes, good to be with you, Maria. I scratch my head when I read Wall Street Journal editorials like this. The president has no policy focus? Come on. We've been watching him in action for two years. He's deregulatory. He believes that taxes should be lowered. You know, his approach to government is when it should do something, it should do it extremely well and extremely efficiently.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP: But there are plenty of things the government should do. So I think it's a rather absurd editorial. And I'm glad the president is saying that he's going to reach out across the aisle and work with Nancy Pelosi. I'm glad he's saying he's going to think about his tone.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>SCHLAP: And how he approaches things. I applaud everything he is saying.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right, I just think that the editorial is trying to also though make the point, Adrienne, that no agreement is better than a bad agreement. Because if the Dems come in Adrienne and start -- you know, trying to reverse the tax cut plan, reverse the rollback in regulations, that could be damaging to the economy. Your reaction, Adrienne?</p><p>ELROD: Yes, well, first of all, I'm glad that President Trump and that leader Pelosi have made it clear that they both want to work together. I think bipartisanship is thoroughly needed right now in this country. And frankly, a lot of independents voted for Democrats in the midterms because they want bipartisanship, but they want cooperation. So, a lot of voters out there in America expect this. I think we'll see compromises on potentially infrastructure and a couple other -- you know, kitchen table issues that matter most to Americans.</p><p>I hope Republicans will come to the table on health care and help make some critical fix there's as opposed to repealing health care, Obamacare.</p><p>But, you know, look, I think we're off to a good start. Let's hope that this sort of conciliatory approach between both Trump and Pelosi continues.</p><p>BENSON: Hi Matt, it's Guy Benson. You said you're applauding everything Trump is saying after the election. But one of the things that he said yesterday was he went down this list of defeated House Republicans from swing districts, tough districts --</p><p>SCHLAPP: Yes.</p><p>BENSON: -- and named them. You know, Barbara Comstock and Peter Roskam and Carlos Curbelo sort of dancing on their political grave and mocking them for not sort of embracing him or kissing the ring. Is that helpful?</p><p>SCHLAPP: Yes, I didn't -- I watched that press conference, Guy. I didn't find him mocking them at all. He was making the point which is there are plenty of reporters who are out there trying to say that this midterms were a bad result for the president. Those of us who work closely in Washington, D.C. for a long time, realize that the House majority wasn't really doing much anyway. I've been really disappointed in the fact that they can't get the number of seats they need in the Senate as well, where it takes 60 for legislations.</p><p>So, I think a lot of voters very rationally. Republicans, conservatives and Trump supporters very rationally said it seems like the real action is in the Senate. Let's get these judges confirmed. We're going to probably have another Supreme Court vacancy the next 18 months. This is where we should focus.</p><p>Those politicians, Republicans, who are still trying to have their cake and eat it too, they love to diss the president, to be disrespectful. They don't show up at the airport to shake his hand when he comes to their stated district. By the same token they wanted these Trump supporters to be supporting them and the fact is Guy, I think many of these politicians were quite frankly, too political in how they approached this.</p><p>Nobody out there in the electorate believes that when you stand up for the president and his policies that are good in your state and in your district and the economy's good almost everywhere in this country, they don't think that you're Donald Trump.</p><p>Donald Trump is a very unique guy. And I think they worry that he will hurt them politically. What --actually, what's happening is that they don't get the support of the Trump support because it looks like they're being disrespectful. It was bad politics.</p><p>BAKER: Adrienne, this is Gerry Baker with the Wall Street Journal, if I may, the one concern I think the people do have is that the one area where they may be able to find agreement, Democrats in the House and the president, maybe the Senate, is the possibility to spend a lot more money. I mean, when people go to Washington, they get elected, the one thing that everybody can always agree on and I do think again on -- not that I'm defending what the Wall Street Journal editorial board said, but I do think one of the concerns people have about this president is maybe if somebody comes along with a big plan to spend a lot of money, he may find that quite simply.</p><p>Now, we already have a fiscal deficit which is going to hit -- you know, trillion dollars, five percent of GDP. That's absolutely the unprecedented this stage of an economic cycle to have a deficit at that large. What's the chances that we just end up seeing the one thing we do in the next couple of years is adding even more to the country's debt?</p><p>ELROD: Well, I will tell you this. When I came to Congress when I started working in Washington back in 2002, in Congress, there was something called the Blue Dog Caucus which still does exists. But it's unfortunately a much smaller group of Democrats. But these were Democrats oftentimes from southern states who were very fiscally responsible who wanted to work with Republicans across the aisle to do something about the debt. And so, I think Democrats and Republicans, away that we can really find common ground here is to actually do something about the debt. It's out of control. Building the wall for example would absolutely skyrocket the debt. So, you know, finding approaches where we are being fiscally responsible would be a good thing for both parties to come together on.</p><p>MCDOWELL: The wall is not the problem, Adrienne. It is entitlements in this country, largely, where two-thirds of our federal spending is just required --</p><p>SCHLAPP: Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL: -- by Medicare, Social Security, and the like. Very, very small sliver is discretionary spending in this country.</p><p>And Matt Schlapp, to that point, when the Republicans going to get religion on actually cutting spending? Because if you're going to talk about infrastructure spending, how are you going to pay for it? You're going to raise people's gas taxes?</p><p>SCHLAPP: Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL: People in California just voted to keep the gas tax increase in place that Governor Gerry Brown and the Democrats pushed.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Yes, I know Dagen, this is -- your point, I'm going to answer your question with the point you made which is any politician that's not willing to seriously look at entitlements. And look, in all fairness, when President Trump ran for president he said I don't want to -- I don't want to touch these programs. If you don't look at how we bend the curve on these programs, you have absolutely no impact on federal spending.</p><p>When you look at the fact that Republicans came in and said we're going to have earmark reform, made most of us laugh because in the end, you're talking about pennies. Pennies out of trillions of dollars, which you really have to look through are, what are the big drivers? And the big drivers are the part of government that's on auto pilot.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>SCHLAPP: We can't really do anything to change it. And let me tell you, I think both parties are at fault but Adrienne, I have to push back on this Blue Dog. The Democratic Party has become socialists. They've become so radicalized. I really worry, how can we work with a party that has become so off-the-hook on their political philosophy?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Go ahead, Adrienne.</p><p>ELROD: I mean, again, Democrats have had no control over the last two years of the House, Senate and the White House. But yet, my friend Matt Schlapp still likes to blame us for a lot of the fiscal issues we have here in this country.</p><p>SCHLAPP: We did not have 60 votes in the Senate -- we didn't have 60 votes and you know it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>ELROD: Well, you have a lot more votes now. So, congratulations.</p><p>SCHLAPP: Thank God.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much Matt Schlapp, Adrienne ElRod. Good to see you and good issues that we are highlighting there.</p><p>President Trump just tweeted on the mass shooting, writing this in part, I have been fully briefed on the terrible shooting in California, law enforcement and first responders together with the FBI are on the scene. 13 people dead at this time have been reported. Likewise, the shooter is dead along with the first police officer to enter the bar. We will bring you more details as this story develops. Stay with us</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back many we are following breaking news this morning. A gunman kills 12 people in California. Cheryl Casone with more details right now, Cheryl.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: We're following everything we can out of California this morning, Maria. This mass shooting happened last night around 11:20 local time in Thousand Oaks, California. That's about 40 miles west of Los Angeles. Now, the bar where this happened was hosting a college country night. It was packed with students at the time of the shooting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: After the first round it was quiet for about five seconds. And then some guys that were next to me on the floor got up and started sprinting towards the back door and yelled at everyone, get up, run, he's coming. And so it was like 50 people trying to get up and run out the back door all at once.</p><p>Unfortunately, I was one of the ones that got caught on the floor and was trampled on by a couple people. On my way up, I got hit in the head by a bar stool being thrown at a window. And I at that moment, I didn't know whether I was going to be able to get up or not and if that guy was really coming, what was going to happen to me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE: Hundreds of students were in this bar, Maria. A sheriff's deputy was among the 12 victims, Sergeant Ron Helus was the first responder to the scene. He was immediately hit with multiple shots. He is survived by a wife and son. The suspect was also found dead inside that bar.</p><p>Another headline we're following for this morning, Maria. President Trump says he thinks that there's going to be a second summit early next year with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Trump added today's meeting between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a senior North Korean official to lay the ground work for the summit is going to be rescheduled.</p><p>Now, according to South Korea's Foreign minister, U.S. Officials say North Korea canceled the meeting. There's been little progress on getting North Korea to take steps towards denuclearization since that first Trump-Kim summit happened in June in Singapore.</p><p>Well, Facebook's Messenger app is going to give its users a do-over. People who sent a message on the app are now going to have 10 minutes to decide if they want to unsend it. Facebook first began testing the feature last month. Facebook admitted back in April, that they had been quietly deleting messages sent by its CEO, Maria, Mark Zuckerberg.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, who didn't want that, right? When you send something and the decided oops, I better unsend it. Who hasn't done that?</p><p>BAKER: Does that mean -- does that mean there's a 10 --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>BAKER: -- essentially a 10 minute delay before you get a message to someone? I mean, supposing --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Maybe.</p><p>BAKER: You actually want to -- you need to get a message urgently to someone (INAUDIBLE) it's an optional thing, right? --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Gerry Baker, you don't use the Facebook Messenger app then.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's true.</p><p>BAKER: You don't.</p><p>MCDOWELL: You make a phone call like old school.</p><p>BAKER: I would like to get a take-back some messages I sent like two years ago.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO: OK, we are covering breaking news this morning. It is a terrible story, a deadly mass shooting inside of a California bar on college night, 12 people have been killed including a sheriff's deputy. The gunman is also dead. We have the very latest coming up after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. President Trump just tweeting on the mass shooting this morning. Here's what he said. I have been fully briefed on the terrible shooting in California. Law enforcement and first responders together with the FBI are on the scene. 13 people at this time have been reported dead. Likewise, the shooter is dead along with the first police officer to enter the bar. Great bravery shown by police. California Highway Patrol was on scene within three minutes, with first officer to enter shot numerous times. That sheriff's sergeant died in the hospital. God bless all of the victims and families of the victims. Thank you to law enforcement. Writes the president this morning.</p><p>Meanwhile, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh will have a scaled back investiture ceremony today. Fox News Doug McKelway has more. He's at the White House this morning. Doug, good morning to you.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Good morning Maria, and it's going to be a slightly scaled down investiture because of security concerns here in the nation's capital. The traditional walk that most new justices take down the front steps of the Supreme Court building will not happen today out of those security concerns. It also comes at a time when the controversy over Justice Kavanaugh is not dying down at all here in Washington. Listen to what Mitch McConnell said yesterday about the Kavanaugh effect on increasing the Senate -- GOP majority. Here he is.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER: I think it was like an adrenaline shot. We were worried about lack of intensity on our side and I think the Kavanaugh fight certainly provided that. It was extremely helpful. It's noteworthy that the one Democrat in a red state who survived voted for Kavanaugh, Joe Manchin.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY: Meanwhile, Democrats may not let up on Kavanaugh. We understand from a report by Mollie Hemingway in the federalist that she overheard the soon to be chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Jerrold Nadler suggest on a telephone call yesterday that they're going to begin impeachment proceedings against the new Supreme Court Justice. Back to you, Maria.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Doug thank you so much. Doug McKelway is at the White House this morning.</p><p>Breaking news overnight, a deadly mass shooting in California, a dozen people are dead including a sheriff's deputy after a gunman burst into a college bar. Next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, we've got the very latest. We will go back live. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, good Thursday morning everybody.

Good Thursday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, November 8th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> We have breaking news to report this morning.  There's been a mass shooting  in a California bar.  At least 12 people have been killed including a  sheriff's deputy.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GEOFF DEAN, VENTURY COUNTY SHERIFF:  Sergeant Helus died at the -- the  sergeant passed away at the hospital about an hour ago.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ventura County sheriff's spokesman says that the gunman is also  dead.  We will bring you the very latest developments as they come in, in  California.</p><p> Plus, Jeff Sessions fired -- what's next for the Department of Justice and  the Russia investigation?  That's coming up.</p><p> New overnight -- a new era for Tesla.  The company replacing Elon Musk as  chairman with Robyn Denholm.  We are looking at her tough job ahead of her  of keeping Musk in line.</p><p> And then hit send too soon?  Facebook now has a fix for that.  How you can  unsend messages through Facebook.</p><p> Markets this morning are pulling back after that powerful rally yesterday.   Take a look at markets right now with futures indicating a lower opening  for the broader averages.  Dow Industrials set to be down 60 points at the  start of trading, a quarter of a percent lower.  The Nasdaq is down a half  of a percent, 37 points lower.  Investors are waiting on the Federal  Reserve decision that's due today at 2:15 p.m. Eastern.</p><p> Meanwhile, yesterday big day -- stocks rallied sharply.  Dow Industrials  yesterday was up better than 500 points.</p><p> European markets -- no follow through today.  The FT 100 is up 21 points  but the CAC 40 is down a half a point and the DAX index is down 18 points.</p><p> In Asia overnight, markets mostly higher overnight.  Take a look.  Asian  markets as you can see, the Shanghai composite was lower but Japan was up  almost 2 percent.</p><p> All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to break it all  down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; Townhall.com political  editor, Fox News contributor Guy Benson; and the \"Wall Street Journal\"  editor at large, Gerry Baker.  Good to see you this morning.  </p><p> GERRY BAKER, EDITOR AT LARGE, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Thank you -- Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p> BAKER:  Yes, thank you.  </p><p> GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.  </p><p> DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Horrific news.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Horrific news on the shooting.  And of course, there are other  issues to talk about.  But we've been following all morning this mass  shooting in California, 12 people have been killed; 13 if you count the  gunman.  Among the dead, the sheriff's deputy.</p><p> Lauren Simonetti with all the details right now -- Lauren.  </p><p> LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, it's the middle  of the night in California where we have learned that at least 12 people  including that sheriff's deputy are dead.  A gunman opened fire at a  country music bar in Thousand Oaks, California.  That's about 40 miles west  of Los Angeles.</p><p> The scene is contained.  The shooter is dead inside the building.  They did  find a handgun.  They did not find an assault rifle but they do continue to  search.  Authorities say hundreds of people were inside the Borderline Bar  and Grill because it was hosting a college country night.</p><p> We're going to show you some witnesses, describing the chaos that they  heard and they experienced after those shots were fired.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I just started hearing these big pops -- pop, pop, pop.   There was probably three or four.  I hit the ground.  I look up.  The  security guard's dead.  I don't want to say dead but he was shot.  He was  down.  And the gunman was throwing smoke grenades all over the place.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  You have to remember, this was college night.  So the families  of these victims are being notified.  It is horrific.  It is heart- wrenching.</p><p> And that's what you heard from Sheriff Geoff Dean as he was telling us  about his friend, the sergeant deputy who died in that bar.</p><p> So, he was 29 years on the force.  It really is a heart-wrenching story --  Maria.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Lauren -- thank you.  And we'll come back to you as news  develops.</p><p> Joining me right now is Texas Congressman Louie Gohmert.  Congressman  Gohmert -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p> REP. LOUIE GOHMERT (R), TEXAS:  Good to see you -- Maria.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Obviously, you are the vice chairman of the Judiciary  Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security.  Your reaction to  this horrific news that we're reporting this morning and how do you stop  something like this?  </p><p> GOHMERT::  Well, John Adams said it clearly back in 1796 as our second  president.  Our constitution was intended for a moral and religious people.   It is wholly inadequate for the governing of any other.  And we have to get  back to teaching right and wrong.</p><p> But right now, our hearts and prayers do go out to family members and those  who experienced this horrific shooting.  And the deputy that just -- I  mean, I know hundreds -- I've worked with hundreds of law enforcement and  it's still just -- I tear up when I think about guys that run to the sound  of the guns instead of running the other direction.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p> GOHMERT::  Real heroes.  And we heard the sheriff say we don't know if  there's terrorism.  Well, we know that there was terrorism.  Somebody comes  in with smoke bombs and wanting to shoot multiple people, clearly they  intended -- that person intended to terrorize.</p><p> But of course, we know terrorism is a euphemism for radical Islam.  And the  sheriff is -- what he was really saying is we don't know if it was radical  Islam like the shooting at the bar in Orlando.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> GOHMERT::  But that is yet to be determined.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> GOHMERT::  But when you wear black.  You're bringing smoke grenades,  clearly it was premeditated murder.  And it's unfortunate that we don't  have the chance to actually put him to death.  I don't know that that would  have happened in California.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> GOHMERT::  But right now, for all the victims, there is just so much shock  and so much hurting and I've seen enough of it in my life.  It never gets  easier.  </p><p> (CROSSTALK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  No, it doesn't.  and it's really hard to watch the witnesses,  very tearful, talking about what they saw.  It's just an incredible story.   And we will find the motive and bring it to our viewers.</p><p> Want to switch gears and ask about the divided Congress, sir.  Because  Democrats retook the House obviously or they're retaking the House.   Republicans are gearing up for anticipated -- some hurdles on issues from  taxes to trade.</p><p> The President and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi both spoke out  yesterday on plans for bipartisanship.  Listen to this.  I've got to get  your reaction.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I give her a great deal of  credit for what she's done and what she's accomplished.  Hopefully we can  all work together next year to continue delivering for the American people.  </p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  We, as Democrats, are  here to strengthen the institution in which we serve and not to have it be  a rubber stamp for President Trump.  We believe that we have a  responsibility to seek common ground where we can; where we cannot, we must  stand our ground.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  I know there's a lot of planning yesterday -- Congressman, with  Republicans, party leaders, trying to map this course for the divided  Congress.  How is this going to look with now the Democrats in the majority  in the House?  </p><p> GOHMERT::  Well actually, Maria -- it's been a divided Congress for the  last nearly two years.  It's just that in the past two years, it's been  divided between a majority of the Republicans in the House and what we  wanted to do to build a wall where it was needed, to secure the border, to  avoid amnesty, those kind of things -- that was what the majority of  Republicans wanted to do.  And then the division was with our own  leadership that we're not going to help the President accomplish his major  promises that got him elected president.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> GOHMERT::  So this time now, it will be divided come January between  political parties.  But I'm delighted to hear Nancy Pelosi talk in those  terms.  It beats the heck out of the Democrat chairman over Energy and  Commerce that handled the Obamacare when Republicans were saying look,  let's work together on dealing with pre-existing conditions -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> GOHMERT::  -- and taking care of people through age 26.  I was ok going 30  or 40 if you're living with your parents.</p><p> But the chairman said we don't need Republican -- we don't want Republican  input and we don't need Republican votes.  And so it's really nice to hear  Nancy Pelosi talking in these terms.  We'll see how long that lasts.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let me turn to Jeff Sessions.  Some people are  saying look, this is right here, one of the first things that the Democrats  are going to be complaining about, and they are.  The President fired the  U.S. Attorney General, replacing him with Sessions' chief of staff, Matthew  Whitaker yesterday.  A permanent replacement expected to be nominated at a  later date.</p><p> What's your reaction to this?  Obviously, no surprise.  We were all  expecting Jeff Sessions to resign right after the midterm elections.  But  does this create a problem for the President, given we've already heard  from the Democrats saying somebody else is overseeing the Mueller probe, we  don't like it.  </p><p> GOHMERT::  Well, the Democrats ought to love it because they should have  seen that this was coming.  And I love Jeff Sessions.  He's a fine, decent,  moral, ethical man.  And I think he was a little naive in not appreciating  the people that work for Rosenstein that wanted to diminish him in the  President's eyes and gave him bad advice including to recuse himself.</p><p> He relied too heavily on the advice of people he called career but I would  say were Democrat operatives, just been there a while.</p><p> But I was a little surprised.  Matthew Whitaker's a great guy.  He's a  wonderful man.  But Democrats ought to be loving Matt because his job as  chief of staff to Jeff Sessions was to look out for Jeff Sessions and he  did not keep him away from the bad advice of people that wanted to destroy  Jeff.  And so they ought to love the fact that Matt's been raised -- he  didn't do a good job protecting his boss, Jeff, from the radicals -- and  I'm not talking radical Islam, I'm just talking radical Democrats that  loved Sally Yates, loved Obama, hated Trump.  He should have protected Jeff  better from bad advice and now he's going to be acting AG.  And so they  ought to be loving it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  I mean, agenda item number one will likely be ok, Robert  Mueller, let's see what you have.  Where are we on this?  Where do you  think we are in the Robert Mueller probe?  How will Matthew Whitaker deal  with this differently? </p><p> I mean in terms of the investigations going on in your chamber into the  DOJ, the FBI, and that cabal of people who would tried to stop Donald  Trump, where are those investigations?  Do they go away at this point?  </p><p> GOHMERT::  No, absolutely not.  We need to conclude them and even though  our -- well, in January the former speaker, the current speaker, his advice  to us was when there's no drama, we win.  When there's no drama, we win.</p><p> That's ridiculous.  That's coming from somebody that wants to avoid a fight  apparently because what we see is, and President Trump has shown it, when  we fight, there's some drama but we win.  And so our -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, they're going to be fighting with the President though --  Congressman.  I mean we've heard from Gerry Nadler.  We've heard from, you  know, Elijah Cummings -- </p><p> GOHMERT::  Yes.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  -- who are going to be -- and Adam Schiff who are going to be  the leaders of, you know, the chairmen of some important committees there.  </p><p> GOHMERT::  But they're not yet.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what is the President going to do with all of these  investigations that are going to pile up once the new Congress gets in  session?  </p><p> GOHMERT::  I heard someone say he's going to need to add more lawyers to  the White House and I think he's right about that -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> GOHMERT::  -- because he's going to be overwhelmed with discovery requests  and subpoenas.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So does anything get done for the American people  legislatively, sir?  </p><p> GOHMERT::  I sure hope so because I hope the Democrats don't make the  mistake of hurting Americans like they did with Obamacare, destroying  seniors' health care, removing $716 billion from Medicare.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  What about immigration -- congressman?  You've got a caravan  crisis right now; thousands of troops are deployed at the border as we  speak.  The migrant caravan continues moving northbound from Mexico.  </p><p> GOHMERT::  Now, the President is going to protect the country.  He made  that very clear when I was talking to him about it in Houston.  He is going  to protect the country.  He doesn't need Congress to do that.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  But don't you need the Democrats' help?  They're now in charge  of, you know, they're the majority in the House.  I mean Senate Majority  Leader Mitch McConnell weighed in on the future plans for the border wall  funding yesterday.  Here's what he said.  I've got to get your reaction.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  We're certainly  going to try to help the President achieve what he would like to do with  regard to the wall and border security.  And that will obviously have to be  done on some kind of bipartisan, excuse me, some kind of bipartisan  discussion.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  So I go back to the first question.  I mean how is this going  to work?  Will you see bipartisan work together?  You represent the people  of Texas.  Your take on this?  </p><p> GOHMERT::  Well, we haven't seen any bipartisanship really at work here,  even to the point that they would destroy an honorable man like Kavanaugh.   So -- but hopefully there will be a change of heart.  That's hope that  springs eternal in him and Brett.  And with God all things are possible.</p><p> But we just haven't seen any evidence that that's what they really want to  do.  But let's face it, I love hearing Mitch McConnell say we're going to  help the President with a wall because I know the House leadership sure  hasn't done that for the last nearly two years.</p><p> So we've got a little window here before we lose it and actually if we took  a step we could pass funding for the wall without having to have cloture in  the Senate.  And I understand we're going to hopefully work on that.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching.  Congressman -- it's good to see  you as always.  Thanks so much, sir.</p><p> GOHMERT::  Great to see you.  Thank you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Louie Gohmert joining us there.</p><p> Breaking news overnight, 12 people are dead including a sheriff's deputy  after a gunman opened fire at a California bar.  The very latest, next.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> Breaking news this morning, a mass shooting in southern California.</p><p> Cheryl Casone with all the details now -- Cheryl.  </p><p> CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  We've been following  the story all morning -- Maria.</p><p> At least 12 people, including a sheriff's deputy, killed in a shooting at a  country bar in southern California.  The suspect, in addition, is dead.   The shooting happening last night around 11:20 local time in Thousand Oaks,  California.  That's about 40 miles west of Los Angeles.</p><p> The bar was packed at the time with college students.  They were hosting a  college country night.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DEAN:  We have no idea if there's a terrorism link to this event or not.   As you know, these are ongoing investigations and that information will  come out as soon as we're able to determine exactly who the suspect was and  what motive he might have had for this horrific event.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  All right.  Talking about what the motive was and they don't know  yet.</p><p> The officer who was killed identified as Ventura County Sheriff's  Department Sergeant Ron Helus.  He is survived by a wife and his son.  He  was actually getting ready to retire next year.</p><p> Also breaking overnight, Tesla's board has a new chair.  Robyn Denholm is  going to replace Elon Musk who'll step down from the position as part of a  settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Tesla had until  November 13th to announce a new chairman under the SEC agreement which  found that Musk's tweets in August about taking his company private were  fraudulent.</p><p> Denholm has served on Tesla's board since 2014.  Now, Elon Musk tweeted he  \"Would like to thank Robyn for joining the team.  Great respect.  Very much  look forward to working together.\"</p><p> Taking a look at shares of Tesla in the premarket, down about a quarter  percent.</p><p> And rising interest rates are making would-be home buyers nervous.  The  number of mortgage applications fell 4 percent last week to its lowest  level since 2014.  The Mortgage Bankers Association says applications to  buy a home fell the most, by 5 percent; refinancing applications dropping 3  percent.  Higher rates of course the result of the Federal Reserve raising  interest rates eight times since December of 2015.  And they are, of  course, meeting this week as well -- Maria.  </p><p> Back to you.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right. Yes.  We will find out today but we're not expecting  a rate hike today from that two-day meeting at the Fed.</p><p> Breaking overnight a deadly mass shooting in a California bar.  A dozen  people have been killed, including a sheriff's deputy when a gunman opened  fire during a college night.  The very latest straight ahead.</p><p> We are also keeping a watch on markets this morning, and earnings where the  2018 midterms had a big effect yesterday.  Markets were up better than 500  points on the Dow.  We've got that and a lot more.  This morning, bit of a  pullback.</p><p> Stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p> We have breaking news this morning out of California.  Twelve people have  been killed including a sheriff's deputy in a mass bar shooting.</p><p> We are watching markets as well after yesterday's big rally.  We're seeing  a pullback this morning.  Dow Industrials expected to be down about 50  points at the start of trading, down a quarter of a percent.  The Nasdaq is  down 31 after a huge rally yesterday on the midterm elections.</p><p> We are waiting on the Fed decision, of course.  that's due out at 2:15 p.m.  Eastern.  We're not expecting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates  after a two-day meeting..</p><p> European indices are mixed.  The FT 100 is up 26 points, the CAC in Paris  was flat and the DAX index in Germany is down 20 as well.</p><p> And in Asia overnight markets finished mostly higher with the exception of  China.</p><p> Joining us right now is Spruce Point Capital Management founder and chief  investment officer, Ben Axler.  And Ben -- it's good to see you this  morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p> BEN AXLER, FOUNDER &amp; CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SPRUCE POINT CAPITAL  MANAGEMENT:  Thank you for having me.</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Were you surprised at that big rally in stocks yesterday?  </p><p> AXLER:  Not at all.  I think the market's base case was that the Democrats  were going to take the house.  Obviously political uncertainty is never  good for markets.  Markets got what they wanted.  Now we move on to the Fed  and interest rate.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Wo what would you do in terms of money right now?  Do you want  to put money into work in stocks or no?</p><p> AXLER:  So we're -- we're a short selling firm.  We play defense a lot.  We  think right now is not a great time to be overly exposed to stocks given  where we are in the business cycle, rate rising cycle.  We're in a lax  regulatory environment as well.</p><p> We're focused really on companies that are flattering their numbers with  aggressive counting (ph), receiving high valuations for speculative  business models.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  And just to be clear -- you're shorting those companies?  </p><p> AXLER:  Absolutely.  We're shorting them with an activist bent.  We put our  research on our Web site and try to find, you know, the good companies from  the bad companies.  </p><p> BENSON:  On the politics side, do you think the markets sort of like  divided government where, you know, you have the tax cuts, you had the  deregulation, things are doing very well in the economy so maybe some  gridlock is sort of ok in Washington?  </p><p> AXLER:  That seems to always be the case, yes.  I mean historically  speaking, gridlock is somewhat bullish for markets.  But we're really  focused mosh on the rate-rising cycle.  And think that the market is going  to be more discriminating now.  </p><p> The easy money is made in a lower rate-cutting environment.  Rate-rising  cycle -- the market is focused the quality of the companies, the valuations  and how the companies are putting their capital to work.  </p><p> BAKER:  What about the tech sector?  You know, the big tech companies took  a bit of a beating in the last month or so, had some good bit of a recovery  yesterday.  I'm interested in your point about, you know, companies that  are maybe have got some questionable numbers.</p><p> Where do you see now, because they've been so much behind the surge in  equity prices in the last couple of years?  And they now dominate many of  the major indexes.  Where do you see -- where do you see the major tech  companies going in the next year or so?  </p><p> AXLER:  Yes.  We had some really good success shorting tech companies this  past month.  The market is much more discriminating now on the quality of  the business.  So one of our best shorts was a company call To You (ph).   It trades at 10 times revenues, losing $40 million a year, the stock was at  an all-time high.  Brokers putting $100 price target on it.  Now, the  stock's at $50.</p><p> So it really comes down now to the quality of the business.  Are they  making money?  Do they have a path to profitability?  And I think you're  going to see more discrimination between those that have a real business  model and those that don't.  </p><p> BAKER:  And rates do you see, you know, we're going to see the Fed today,  the Fed's not going to do anything today.  But you know, short-term rates  gone up with long-term rates -- have gone up as well as the last year.  How  much is that starting -- I mean I don't see that's having an overall effect  on the market -- but how does that affect some of the individual companies  that you're look at?  How do you weigh that as you look at -- </p><p> AXLER:  Tremendously.  So we've had good success in the past month shorting  companies with low or declining organic growth and a lot of debt,  particularly companies exposed to short-term debt.</p><p> We recently shorted a company call Dollarama in Canada, $1.8 billion of  debt coming due in the next 24 months.  The companies is discounting the  companies that are going to have to refinance; they're going to have to  refinance at a higher rate.  The market's discriminating between those with  longer term maturities and those were shorter.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Are you short Tesla?  </p><p> AXLER:  We're not short Tesla.  We try to find companies that have a less  crowded short position.  You know, as we've seen, Tesla's a battle ground  stock, it can move 10, 15, 20 percent on a tweet from, you know, Elon Musk.   We're trying to find situations where the market doesn't already know what  the short pieces (ph) is, less crowding, lower short squeeze risk.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  What are some other shorts that are too crowded for you to  really want to anticipate?  </p><p> AXLER:  Well, I mean -- </p><p> MCDOWELL:  I mean participate, rather.</p><p> AXLER:  Yes, I mean our threshold generally, we see a short interest higher  than 30 percent, that's sort of indication to us that hey the market  already sees that there's a structural problem here.  When the shorts are  that high sometimes the cost of borrowing the stock is high.</p><p> So we're trying to find situations that aren't crowded where we're actually  getting paid right now to short given the general collateral rates of, you  know, a percent, percent and-a-half.  Those are the situations we want to  be involved in.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ok.</p><p> BAKER:  What's the best short you've done in the last few months?  </p><p> AXLER:  So we shorted Maxar Technologies.  That was a merger between  McDonald Dettweiler (ph), and a merger between McDonald debt Wyler and  digital globe which shorted it in the 50 50s.  the stock went down to about  $15 a share.  They just compare the satellite assets.  A lot of debt, no  growth.  The market is figuring these situations out quickly.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  So what's your take on the broader market?  I know you have  specific, you know, shorts in some of the smaller companies that are  unknown.  But your take on the broader markets?  We had a huge rally  yesterday.  A bit of a pullback this morning.  </p><p> AXLER:  My take is that we're in the later stages of the cycle.  I think  the market can continue to grind a little bit higher.  We've been pretty  vocal that we think we're in a sort of low single digit return environment  with a lot of volatility.  Volatility presents trading opportunities,  clearly.</p><p> But investors need to play defense.  You know, not every stock's a buy.  A  tremendous amount of the brokers are still putting buy targets and 20  percent upside scenarios on stocks.  And that's need to, you know,  scrutinize their portfolio carefully, play defense.  But they can still  make money on the long side.  It's just going to be a little harder.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Ben -- it's good to have  you.  Thanks so much.  </p><p> AXLER:  Thank you.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Ben Axler joining us and we just showed you the screen of  markets pulling back this morning.</p><p> We have breaking news we're following this morning, a horrific scene out of  California, 12 people are dead.  Dozens more are injured after a gunman  burst through the doors of a bar on college night.</p><p> We're bringing you the very latest from the scene, thousand oaks,  California when we come back.</p><p> And then summit postponed -- why a second meeting between President Trump  and Kim Jong-un may not happen until next year.  We've got that news after  this.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Welcome back.  Thanks very  much for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is  Thursday, November 8th.  We have some sad breaking news to report this  morning, at least 12 people are dead after a mass shooting at a bar in  California.  Among the dead, a sheriff's deputy.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GEOFF DEAN, SHERIFF, VENTURA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA:  He gave his all and  tonight as I told his wife, he died a hero because he went -- he went in to  save lives, to save other people.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  A Ventura County Sheriff's spokesman confirmed the gunman is  dead as well.  13 people dead that means.  We'll have the very latest on  the tragedy throughout the morning this morning.  </p><p> Then, security concerns, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh will have a  scaled back investor -- investiture ceremony today.  </p><p> Plus, the Pelosi method with the midterms behind us, how President Trump  will have to deal with the possible future House speaker.  We're dealing  with that this morning.  </p><p> And the sender's remorse, Facebook ready to help if you send a message too  soon, details coming up.  </p><p> Markets are lower today after a powerful rally yesterday.  Dow Industrials  down about 50 points -- 55 points right now, a quarter of a percent lower.   S&amp;P 500 down a third of a percent and the NASDAQ is down almost one half of  a percent right now.  </p><p> Investors are waiting on the Federal Reserve decision that's due at 2:15  p.m. Eastern today.  This after a huge day yesterday, Dow Industrials was  up 545 points yesterday, better than two percent, following the midterm  election news.  The major indices all up better than two percent.  Look at  the NASDAQ up almost 200 points at the close, that was 2.6 percent higher  on the NASDAQ.  </p><p> In Europe this morning no follow up though.  Take a look, European indices  are mixed.  The FT-100 is up 28 points.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is flat  and the DAX Index in Germany is down 21 points.  </p><p> Asian markets overnight mixed as well, best performer Japan, Nikkei average  up 1.8 percent.  </p><p> We begin this half an hour with breaking news.  We have been following all  morning.  12 people have been killed in a mass shooting in a California  bar.  Among the dead, a sheriff's deputy.  Lauren Simonetti with all the  details right now, Lauren.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p> SIMONETTI:  Hi Maria.  It is the wee hours of the morning in Thousand Oaks,  California, some 40 miles west of Los Angeles.  Just hours ago, tragedy  unfolded for the families of at least 12 victims.  Our local affiliate  talking to some of the parents of the students at that Borderline Bar and  Grill.  They're now trying to get in touch with their sons and daughters.   Victims are witnessing the chaos that unfolded.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I was on the like side area, you could say, by the  stage and where I was looking was directly of where the guy walked in and  started shooting.  And, yes, I just -- I can't believe I saw it with my own  two eyes.  It just freaks me out.  Because where I was looking, you know,  just by all means some guy just walks in, pulls out a gun and start  shooting people.  Still just puts me in shock because out here in like  Thousand Oaks, just Ventura county area, it's our safe haven.  You know,  nothing like this happens.  </p><p> I saw two shots and then I heard about five or six and then that's when I  was out of the building.  But people I guess there was like smoke -- like  grenades going off.  I wasn't in the building when that one happened.   Everyone was -- </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  A handgun was found at the scene.  No assault rifle.  But a  search is still being done.  Ventura county sheriff Geoff Dean describing  the scene earlier this morning.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DEAN:  It's a horrific scene in there.  There's blood everywhere.  And the  suspect is part of that.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SIMONETTI:  Multiple law enforcement agencies are on the ground.  And the  Los Angeles Times is reporting that some of the people inside that bar for  country night, and you only had to be 18 to get in to line dance, some of  those people were also last year in Las Vegas at the mass shooting at the  music festival there, Maria.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  And that's what you mentioned earlier, Guy  Benson.  We'll have more on that coming up.  Thank you so much, Lauren.  </p><p> We want to turn now to the midterm aftermath.  Both President Trump and  potential House speaker Nancy Pelosi sounding off yesterday about the  results and sounding open to reaching across the aisle on certain issues.   The Wall Street Journal's editorial board issuing a warning on any  potential deal, titled this The Nancy Pelosi Method is an op-ed this  morning.  Mr. Trump has no fix policy compass on most issues.  So there's a  serious risk he'll be lured into anti-growth traps.  The U.S. could do  worse than two years of virtuous gridlock when nothing economically  damaging happens in Washington.  </p><p> Joining us right now is former Hillary for America senior advisor,  Democratic strategist, Adrienne Elrod and chairman of the American  Conservative Union, Matt Schlapp.  Matt, your reaction to the Journal's  comments.  Thank you so much to you both for joining us this morning.  </p><p> ADRIENNE ELROD, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Thank you, Maria. </p><p> MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Yes, good to be with  you, Maria.  I scratch my head when I read Wall Street Journal editorials  like this.  The president has no policy focus?  Come on.  We've been  watching him in action for two years.  He's deregulatory.  He believes that  taxes should be lowered.  You know, his approach to government is when it  should do something, it should do it extremely well and extremely  efficiently.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> SCHLAPP:  But there are plenty of things the government should do.  So I  think it's a rather absurd editorial.  And I'm glad the president is saying  that he's going to reach out across the aisle and work with Nancy Pelosi.   I'm glad he's saying he's going to think about his tone.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> SCHLAP:  And how he approaches things.  I applaud everything he is saying.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right, I just think that the editorial is trying to also though  make the point, Adrienne, that no agreement is better than a bad agreement.   Because if the Dems come in Adrienne and start -- you know, trying to  reverse the tax cut plan, reverse the rollback in regulations, that could  be damaging to the economy.  Your reaction, Adrienne?  </p><p> ELROD:  Yes, well, first of all, I'm glad that President Trump and that  leader Pelosi have made it clear that they both want to work together.  I  think bipartisanship is thoroughly needed right now in this country.  And  frankly, a lot of independents voted for Democrats in the midterms because  they want bipartisanship, but they want cooperation.  So, a lot of voters  out there in America expect this.  I think we'll see compromises on  potentially infrastructure and a couple other -- you know, kitchen table  issues that matter most to Americans.  </p><p> I hope Republicans will come to the table on health care and help make some  critical fix there's as opposed to repealing health care, Obamacare. </p><p> But, you know, look, I think we're off to a good start.  Let's hope that  this sort of conciliatory approach between both Trump and Pelosi continues.  </p><p> BENSON:  Hi Matt, it's Guy Benson.  You said you're applauding everything  Trump is saying after the election.  But one of the things that he said  yesterday was he went down this list of defeated House Republicans from  swing districts, tough districts --</p><p> SCHLAPP:  Yes.</p><p> BENSON:  -- and named them.  You know, Barbara Comstock and Peter Roskam  and Carlos Curbelo sort of dancing on their political grave and mocking  them for not sort of embracing him or kissing the ring.  Is that helpful?  </p><p> SCHLAPP:  Yes, I didn't -- I watched that press conference, Guy.  I didn't  find him mocking them at all.  He was making the point which is there are  plenty of reporters who are out there trying to say that this midterms were  a bad result for the president.  Those of us who work closely in  Washington, D.C. for a long time, realize that the House majority wasn't  really doing much anyway.  I've been really disappointed in the fact that  they can't get the number of seats they need in the Senate as well, where  it takes 60 for legislations.  </p><p> So, I think a lot of voters very rationally.  Republicans, conservatives  and Trump supporters very rationally said it seems like the real action is  in the Senate.  Let's get these judges confirmed.  We're going to probably  have another Supreme Court vacancy the next 18 months.  This is where we  should focus.  </p><p> Those politicians, Republicans, who are still trying to have their cake and  eat it too, they love to diss the president, to be disrespectful.  They  don't show up at the airport to shake his hand when he comes to their  stated district.  By the same token they wanted these Trump supporters to  be supporting them and the fact is Guy, I think many of these politicians  were quite frankly, too political in how they approached this.  </p><p> Nobody out there in the electorate believes that when you stand up for the  president and his policies that are good in your state and in your district  and the economy's good almost everywhere in this country, they don't think  that you're Donald Trump.  </p><p> Donald Trump is a very unique guy.  And I think they worry that he will  hurt them politically.  What --actually, what's happening is that they  don't get the support of the Trump support because it looks like they're  being disrespectful.  It was bad politics.  </p><p> BAKER:  Adrienne, this is Gerry Baker with the Wall Street Journal, if I  may, the one concern I think the people do have is that the one area where  they may be able to find agreement, Democrats in the House and the  president, maybe the Senate, is the possibility to spend a lot more money.   I mean, when people go to Washington, they get elected, the one thing that  everybody can always agree on and I do think again on -- not that I'm  defending what the Wall Street Journal editorial board said, but I do think  one of the concerns people have about this president is maybe if somebody  comes along with a big plan to spend a lot of money, he may find that quite  simply.  </p><p> Now, we already have a fiscal deficit which is going to hit -- you know,  trillion dollars, five percent of GDP.  That's absolutely the unprecedented  this stage of an economic cycle to have a deficit at that large.  What's  the chances that we just end up seeing the one thing we do in the next  couple of years is adding even more to the country's debt?  </p><p> ELROD:  Well, I will tell you this.  When I came to Congress when I started  working in Washington back in 2002, in Congress, there was something called  the Blue Dog Caucus which still does exists.  But it's unfortunately a much  smaller group of Democrats.  But these were Democrats oftentimes from  southern states who were very fiscally responsible who wanted to work with  Republicans across the aisle to do something about the debt.  And so, I  think Democrats and Republicans, away that we can really find common ground  here is to actually do something about the debt.  It's out of control.   Building the wall for example would absolutely skyrocket the debt.  So, you  know, finding approaches where we are being fiscally responsible would be a  good thing for both parties to come together on.  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  The wall is not the problem, Adrienne.  It is entitlements in  this country, largely, where two-thirds of our federal spending is just  required --</p><p> SCHLAPP:  Yes.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  -- by Medicare, Social Security, and the like.  Very, very small  sliver is discretionary spending in this country.  </p><p> And Matt Schlapp, to that point, when the Republicans going to get religion  on actually cutting spending?  Because if you're going to talk about  infrastructure spending, how are you going to pay for it?  You're going to  raise people's gas taxes?  </p><p> SCHLAPP:  Right.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  People in California just voted to keep the gas tax increase in  place that Governor Gerry Brown and the Democrats pushed.  </p><p> SCHLAPP:  Yes, I know Dagen, this is -- your point, I'm going to answer  your question with the point you made which is any politician that's not  willing to seriously look at entitlements.  And look, in all fairness, when  President Trump ran for president he said I don't want to -- I don't want  to touch these programs.  If you don't look at how we bend the curve on  these programs, you have absolutely no impact on federal spending.  </p><p> When you look at the fact that Republicans came in and said we're going to  have earmark reform, made most of us laugh because in the end, you're  talking about pennies.  Pennies out of trillions of dollars, which you  really have to look through are, what are the big drivers?  And the big  drivers are the part of government that's on auto pilot.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p> SCHLAPP:  We can't really do anything to change it.  And let me tell you, I  think both parties are at fault but Adrienne, I have to push back on this  Blue Dog.  The Democratic Party has become socialists.  They've become so  radicalized.  I really worry, how can we work with a party that has become  so off-the-hook on their political philosophy?  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Go ahead, Adrienne.  </p><p> ELROD:  I mean, again, Democrats have had no control over the last two  years of the House, Senate and the White House.  But yet, my friend Matt  Schlapp still likes to blame us for a lot of the fiscal issues we have here  in this country.  </p><p> SCHLAPP:  We did not have 60 votes in the Senate -- we didn't have 60 votes  and you know it.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p> ELROD:  Well, you have a lot more votes now.  So, congratulations.</p><p> SCHLAPP:  Thank God.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much Matt Schlapp, Adrienne ElRod.  Good to see  you and good issues that we are highlighting there.  </p><p> President Trump just tweeted on the mass shooting, writing this in part, I  have been fully briefed on the terrible shooting in California, law  enforcement and first responders together with the FBI are on the scene.   13 people dead at this time have been reported.  Likewise, the shooter is  dead along with the first police officer to enter the bar.  We will bring  you more details as this story develops.  Stay with us</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back many we are following breaking news this morning.   A gunman kills 12 people in California.  Cheryl Casone with more details  right now, Cheryl.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  We're following everything we can out of California this morning,  Maria.  This mass shooting happened last night around 11:20 local time in  Thousand Oaks, California.  That's about 40 miles west of Los Angeles.   Now, the bar where this happened was hosting a college country night.  It  was packed with students at the time of the shooting.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  After the first round it was quiet for about five  seconds.  And then some guys that were next to me on the floor got up and  started sprinting towards the back door and yelled at everyone, get up,  run, he's coming.  And so it was like 50 people trying to get up and run  out the back door all at once.  </p><p> Unfortunately, I was one of the ones that got caught on the floor and was  trampled on by a couple people.  On my way up, I got hit in the head by a  bar stool being thrown at a window.  And I at that moment, I didn't know  whether I was going to be able to get up or not and if that guy was really  coming, what was going to happen to me.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> CASONE:  Hundreds of students were in this bar, Maria.  A sheriff's deputy  was among the 12 victims, Sergeant Ron Helus was the first responder to the  scene.  He was immediately hit with multiple shots.  He is survived by a  wife and son.  The suspect was also found dead inside that bar.  </p><p> Another headline we're following for this morning, Maria.  President Trump  says he thinks that there's going to be a second summit early next year  with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.  Trump added today's meeting between  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a senior North Korean official to lay  the ground work for the summit is going to be rescheduled.  </p><p> Now, according to South Korea's Foreign minister, U.S. Officials say North  Korea canceled the meeting.  There's been little progress on getting North  Korea to take steps towards denuclearization since that first Trump-Kim  summit happened in June in Singapore.  </p><p> Well, Facebook's Messenger app is going to give its users a do-over.   People who sent a message on the app are now going to have 10 minutes to  decide if they want to unsend it.  Facebook first began testing the feature  last month.  Facebook admitted back in April, that they had been quietly  deleting messages sent by its CEO, Maria, Mark Zuckerberg.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Well, who didn't want that, right?  When you send something and  the decided oops, I better unsend it.  Who hasn't done that?</p><p> BAKER:  Does that mean -- does that mean there's a 10 -- </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p> BAKER:  -- essentially a 10 minute delay before you get a message to  someone?  I mean, supposing --</p><p> MCDOWELL:  Maybe.</p><p> BAKER:  You actually want to -- you need to get a message urgently to  someone (INAUDIBLE) it's an optional thing, right? --  </p><p> MCDOWELL:  Gerry Baker, you don't use the Facebook Messenger app then.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p> BAKER:  You don't.</p><p> MCDOWELL:  You make a phone call like old school.  </p><p> BAKER:  I would like to get a take-back some messages I sent like two years  ago.  </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p> (CROSSTALK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  OK, we are covering breaking news this morning.  It is a  terrible story, a deadly mass shooting inside of a California bar on  college night, 12 people have been killed including a sheriff's deputy.   The gunman is also dead.  We have the very latest coming up after this.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump just tweeting on the mass  shooting this morning.  Here's what he said.  I have been fully briefed on  the terrible shooting in California.  Law enforcement and first responders  together with the FBI are on the scene.  13 people at this time have been  reported dead.  Likewise, the shooter is dead along with the first police  officer to enter the bar.  Great bravery shown by police.  California  Highway Patrol was on scene within three minutes, with first officer to  enter shot numerous times.  That sheriff's sergeant died in the hospital.   God bless all of the victims and families of the victims.  Thank you to law  enforcement.  Writes the president this morning.  </p><p> Meanwhile, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh will have a scaled back  investiture ceremony today.  Fox News Doug McKelway has more.  He's at the  White House this morning.  Doug, good morning to you.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria, and it's going  to be a slightly scaled down investiture because of security concerns here  in the nation's capital.  The traditional walk that most new justices take  down the front steps of the Supreme Court building will not happen today  out of those security concerns.  It also comes at a time when the  controversy over Justice Kavanaugh is not dying down at all here in  Washington.  Listen to what Mitch McConnell said yesterday about the  Kavanaugh effect on increasing the Senate -- GOP majority.  Here he is.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  I think it was like  an adrenaline shot.  We were worried about lack of intensity on our side  and I think the Kavanaugh fight certainly provided that.  It was extremely  helpful.  It's noteworthy that the one Democrat in a red state who survived  voted for Kavanaugh, Joe Manchin.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MCKELWAY:  Meanwhile, Democrats may not let up on Kavanaugh.  We understand  from a report by Mollie Hemingway in the federalist that she overheard the  soon to be chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Jerrold Nadler suggest  on a telephone call yesterday that they're going to begin impeachment  proceedings against the new Supreme Court Justice.  Back to you, Maria.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  All right, Doug thank you so much.  Doug McKelway is at the  White House this morning.  </p><p> Breaking news overnight, a deadly mass shooting in California, a dozen  people are dead including a sheriff's deputy after a gunman burst into a  college bar.  Next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, we've got the very latest.   We will go back live.  Stay with us.  </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Thursday morning everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday,  November 8th.  Your top stories right now just before 8:00 a.m. on the East  Coast.</p><p> We have breaking news that we have been covering, there has been a mass  shooting in a California bar, at least 12 people were killed including a  sheriff's deputy.

Good Thursday  morning, everybody.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday, November 8th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now at 7:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have breaking news to report this morning.  There's been a mass shooting  in a California bar.  At least 12 people have been killed including a  sheriff's deputy.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEOFF DEAN, VENTURY COUNTY SHERIFF:  Sergeant Helus died at the -- the  sergeant passed away at the hospital about an hour ago.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ventura County sheriff's spokesman says that the gunman is also  dead.  We will bring you the very latest developments as they come in, in  California.</p><p>Plus, Jeff Sessions fired -- what's next for the Department of Justice and  the Russia investigation?  That's coming up.</p><p>New overnight -- a new era for Tesla.  The company replacing Elon Musk as  chairman with Robyn Denholm.  We are looking at her tough job ahead of her  of keeping Musk in line.</p><p>And then hit send too soon?  Facebook now has a fix for that.  How you can  unsend messages through Facebook.</p><p>Markets this morning are pulling back after that powerful rally yesterday.   Take a look at markets right now with futures indicating a lower opening  for the broader averages.  Dow Industrials set to be down 60 points at the  start of trading, a quarter of a percent lower.  The Nasdaq is down a half  of a percent, 37 points lower.  Investors are waiting on the Federal  Reserve decision that's due today at 2:15 p.m. Eastern.</p><p>Meanwhile, yesterday big day -- stocks rallied sharply.  Dow Industrials  yesterday was up better than 500 points.</p><p>European markets -- no follow through today.  The FT 100 is up 21 points  but the CAC 40 is down a half a point and the DAX index is down 18 points.</p><p>In Asia overnight, markets mostly higher overnight.  Take a look.  Asian  markets as you can see, the Shanghai composite was lower but Japan was up  almost 2 percent.</p><p>All those stories coming up this morning.  And joining me to break it all  down -- Fox Business Network's Dagen McDowell; Townhall.com political  editor, Fox News contributor Guy Benson; and the \"Wall Street Journal\"  editor at large, Gerry Baker.  Good to see you this morning.  </p><p>GERRY BAKER, EDITOR AT LARGE, \"WALL STREET JOURNAL\":  Thank you -- Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much for joining us.  </p><p>BAKER:  Yes, thank you.  </p><p>GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Good morning.  </p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Horrific news.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Horrific news on the shooting.  And of course, there are other  issues to talk about.  But we've been following all morning this mass  shooting in California, 12 people have been killed; 13 if you count the  gunman.  Among the dead, the sheriff's deputy.</p><p>Lauren Simonetti with all the details right now -- Lauren.  </p><p>LAUREN SIMONETTI, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, it's the middle  of the night in California where we have learned that at least 12 people  including that sheriff's deputy are dead.  A gunman opened fire at a  country music bar in Thousand Oaks, California.  That's about 40 miles west  of Los Angeles.</p><p>The scene is contained.  The shooter is dead inside the building.  They did  find a handgun.  They did not find an assault rifle but they do continue to  search.  Authorities say hundreds of people were inside the Borderline Bar  and Grill because it was hosting a college country night.</p><p>We're going to show you some witnesses, describing the chaos that they  heard and they experienced after those shots were fired.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I just started hearing these big pops -- pop, pop, pop.   There was probably three or four.  I hit the ground.  I look up.  The  security guard's dead.  I don't want to say dead but he was shot.  He was  down.  And the gunman was throwing smoke grenades all over the place.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  You have to remember, this was college night.  So the families  of these victims are being notified.  It is horrific.  It is heart- wrenching.</p><p>And that's what you heard from Sheriff Geoff Dean as he was telling us  about his friend, the sergeant deputy who died in that bar.</p><p>So, he was 29 years on the force.  It really is a heart-wrenching story --  Maria.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.  Lauren -- thank you.  And we'll come back to you as news  develops.</p><p>Joining me right now is Texas Congressman Louie Gohmert.  Congressman  Gohmert -- good to see you this morning.  Thanks very much for joining us.</p><p>REP. LOUIE GOHMERT (R), TEXAS:  Good to see you -- Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Obviously, you are the vice chairman of the Judiciary  Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security.  Your reaction to  this horrific news that we're reporting this morning and how do you stop  something like this?  </p><p>GOHMERT::  Well, John Adams said it clearly back in 1796 as our second  president.  Our constitution was intended for a moral and religious people.   It is wholly inadequate for the governing of any other.  And we have to get  back to teaching right and wrong.</p><p>But right now, our hearts and prayers do go out to family members and those  who experienced this horrific shooting.  And the deputy that just -- I  mean, I know hundreds -- I've worked with hundreds of law enforcement and  it's still just -- I tear up when I think about guys that run to the sound  of the guns instead of running the other direction.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's right.</p><p>GOHMERT::  Real heroes.  And we heard the sheriff say we don't know if  there's terrorism.  Well, we know that there was terrorism.  Somebody comes  in with smoke bombs and wanting to shoot multiple people, clearly they  intended -- that person intended to terrorize.</p><p>But of course, we know terrorism is a euphemism for radical Islam.  And the  sheriff is -- what he was really saying is we don't know if it was radical  Islam like the shooting at the bar in Orlando.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GOHMERT::  But that is yet to be determined.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GOHMERT::  But when you wear black.  You're bringing smoke grenades,  clearly it was premeditated murder.  And it's unfortunate that we don't  have the chance to actually put him to death.  I don't know that that would  have happened in California.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GOHMERT::  But right now, for all the victims, there is just so much shock  and so much hurting and I've seen enough of it in my life.  It never gets  easier.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  No, it doesn't.  and it's really hard to watch the witnesses,  very tearful, talking about what they saw.  It's just an incredible story.   And we will find the motive and bring it to our viewers.</p><p>Want to switch gears and ask about the divided Congress, sir.  Because  Democrats retook the House obviously or they're retaking the House.   Republicans are gearing up for anticipated -- some hurdles on issues from  taxes to trade.</p><p>The President and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi both spoke out  yesterday on plans for bipartisanship.  Listen to this.  I've got to get  your reaction.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I give her a great deal of  credit for what she's done and what she's accomplished.  Hopefully we can  all work together next year to continue delivering for the American people.  </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  We, as Democrats, are  here to strengthen the institution in which we serve and not to have it be  a rubber stamp for President Trump.  We believe that we have a  responsibility to seek common ground where we can; where we cannot, we must  stand our ground.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I know there's a lot of planning yesterday -- Congressman, with  Republicans, party leaders, trying to map this course for the divided  Congress.  How is this going to look with now the Democrats in the majority  in the House?  </p><p>GOHMERT::  Well actually, Maria -- it's been a divided Congress for the  last nearly two years.  It's just that in the past two years, it's been  divided between a majority of the Republicans in the House and what we  wanted to do to build a wall where it was needed, to secure the border, to  avoid amnesty, those kind of things -- that was what the majority of  Republicans wanted to do.  And then the division was with our own  leadership that we're not going to help the President accomplish his major  promises that got him elected president.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GOHMERT::  So this time now, it will be divided come January between  political parties.  But I'm delighted to hear Nancy Pelosi talk in those  terms.  It beats the heck out of the Democrat chairman over Energy and  Commerce that handled the Obamacare when Republicans were saying look,  let's work together on dealing with pre-existing conditions -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>GOHMERT::  -- and taking care of people through age 26.  I was ok going 30  or 40 if you're living with your parents.</p><p>But the chairman said we don't need Republican -- we don't want Republican  input and we don't need Republican votes.  And so it's really nice to hear  Nancy Pelosi talking in these terms.  We'll see how long that lasts.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  Let me turn to Jeff Sessions.  Some people are  saying look, this is right here, one of the first things that the Democrats  are going to be complaining about, and they are.  The President fired the  U.S. Attorney General, replacing him with Sessions' chief of staff, Matthew  Whitaker yesterday.  A permanent replacement expected to be nominated at a  later date.</p><p>What's your reaction to this?  Obviously, no surprise.  We were all  expecting Jeff Sessions to resign right after the midterm elections.  But  does this create a problem for the President, given we've already heard  from the Democrats saying somebody else is overseeing the Mueller probe, we  don't like it.  </p><p>GOHMERT::  Well, the Democrats ought to love it because they should have  seen that this was coming.  And I love Jeff Sessions.  He's a fine, decent,  moral, ethical man.  And I think he was a little naive in not appreciating  the people that work for Rosenstein that wanted to diminish him in the  President's eyes and gave him bad advice including to recuse himself.</p><p>He relied too heavily on the advice of people he called career but I would  say were Democrat operatives, just been there a while.</p><p>But I was a little surprised.  Matthew Whitaker's a great guy.  He's a  wonderful man.  But Democrats ought to be loving Matt because his job as  chief of staff to Jeff Sessions was to look out for Jeff Sessions and he  did not keep him away from the bad advice of people that wanted to destroy  Jeff.  And so they ought to love the fact that Matt's been raised -- he  didn't do a good job protecting his boss, Jeff, from the radicals -- and  I'm not talking radical Islam, I'm just talking radical Democrats that  loved Sally Yates, loved Obama, hated Trump.  He should have protected Jeff  better from bad advice and now he's going to be acting AG.  And so they  ought to be loving it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  I mean, agenda item number one will likely be ok, Robert  Mueller, let's see what you have.  Where are we on this?  Where do you  think we are in the Robert Mueller probe?  How will Matthew Whitaker deal  with this differently? </p><p>I mean in terms of the investigations going on in your chamber into the  DOJ, the FBI, and that cabal of people who would tried to stop Donald  Trump, where are those investigations?  Do they go away at this point?  </p><p>GOHMERT::  No, absolutely not.  We need to conclude them and even though  our -- well, in January the former speaker, the current speaker, his advice  to us was when there's no drama, we win.  When there's no drama, we win.</p><p>That's ridiculous.  That's coming from somebody that wants to avoid a fight  apparently because what we see is, and President Trump has shown it, when  we fight, there's some drama but we win.  And so our -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, they're going to be fighting with the President though --  Congressman.  I mean we've heard from Gerry Nadler.  We've heard from, you  know, Elijah Cummings -- </p><p>GOHMERT::  Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  -- who are going to be -- and Adam Schiff who are going to be  the leaders of, you know, the chairmen of some important committees there.  </p><p>GOHMERT::  But they're not yet.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what is the President going to do with all of these  investigations that are going to pile up once the new Congress gets in  session?  </p><p>GOHMERT::  I heard someone say he's going to need to add more lawyers to  the White House and I think he's right about that -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>GOHMERT::  -- because he's going to be overwhelmed with discovery requests  and subpoenas.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So does anything get done for the American people  legislatively, sir?  </p><p>GOHMERT::  I sure hope so because I hope the Democrats don't make the  mistake of hurting Americans like they did with Obamacare, destroying  seniors' health care, removing $716 billion from Medicare.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  What about immigration -- congressman?  You've got a caravan  crisis right now; thousands of troops are deployed at the border as we  speak.  The migrant caravan continues moving northbound from Mexico.  </p><p>GOHMERT::  Now, the President is going to protect the country.  He made  that very clear when I was talking to him about it in Houston.  He is going  to protect the country.  He doesn't need Congress to do that.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  But don't you need the Democrats' help?  They're now in charge  of, you know, they're the majority in the House.  I mean Senate Majority  Leader Mitch McConnell weighed in on the future plans for the border wall  funding yesterday.  Here's what he said.  I've got to get your reaction.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SENATOR MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  We're certainly  going to try to help the President achieve what he would like to do with  regard to the wall and border security.  And that will obviously have to be  done on some kind of bipartisan, excuse me, some kind of bipartisan  discussion.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  So I go back to the first question.  I mean how is this going  to work?  Will you see bipartisan work together?  You represent the people  of Texas.  Your take on this?  </p><p>GOHMERT::  Well, we haven't seen any bipartisanship really at work here,  even to the point that they would destroy an honorable man like Kavanaugh.   So -- but hopefully there will be a change of heart.  That's hope that  springs eternal in him and Brett.  And with God all things are possible.</p><p>But we just haven't seen any evidence that that's what they really want to  do.  But let's face it, I love hearing Mitch McConnell say we're going to  help the President with a wall because I know the House leadership sure  hasn't done that for the last nearly two years.</p><p>So we've got a little window here before we lose it and actually if we took  a step we could pass funding for the wall without having to have cloture in  the Senate.  And I understand we're going to hopefully work on that.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We'll be watching.  Congressman -- it's good to see  you as always.  Thanks so much, sir.</p><p>GOHMERT::  Great to see you.  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Louie Gohmert joining us there.</p><p>Breaking news overnight, 12 people are dead including a sheriff's deputy  after a gunman opened fire at a California bar.  The very latest, next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>Breaking news this morning, a mass shooting in southern California.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with all the details now -- Cheryl.  </p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  We've been following  the story all morning -- Maria.</p><p>At least 12 people, including a sheriff's deputy, killed in a shooting at a  country bar in southern California.  The suspect, in addition, is dead.   The shooting happening last night around 11:20 local time in Thousand Oaks,  California.  That's about 40 miles west of Los Angeles.</p><p>The bar was packed at the time with college students.  They were hosting a  college country night.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN:  We have no idea if there's a terrorism link to this event or not.   As you know, these are ongoing investigations and that information will  come out as soon as we're able to determine exactly who the suspect was and  what motive he might have had for this horrific event.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  All right.  Talking about what the motive was and they don't know  yet.</p><p>The officer who was killed identified as Ventura County Sheriff's  Department Sergeant Ron Helus.  He is survived by a wife and his son.  He  was actually getting ready to retire next year.</p><p>Also breaking overnight, Tesla's board has a new chair.  Robyn Denholm is  going to replace Elon Musk who'll step down from the position as part of a  settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Tesla had until  November 13th to announce a new chairman under the SEC agreement which  found that Musk's tweets in August about taking his company private were  fraudulent.</p><p>Denholm has served on Tesla's board since 2014.  Now, Elon Musk tweeted he  \"Would like to thank Robyn for joining the team.  Great respect.  Very much  look forward to working together.\"</p><p>Taking a look at shares of Tesla in the premarket, down about a quarter  percent.</p><p>And rising interest rates are making would-be home buyers nervous.  The  number of mortgage applications fell 4 percent last week to its lowest  level since 2014.  The Mortgage Bankers Association says applications to  buy a home fell the most, by 5 percent; refinancing applications dropping 3  percent.  Higher rates of course the result of the Federal Reserve raising  interest rates eight times since December of 2015.  And they are, of  course, meeting this week as well -- Maria.  </p><p>Back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right. Yes.  We will find out today but we're not expecting  a rate hike today from that two-day meeting at the Fed.</p><p>Breaking overnight a deadly mass shooting in a California bar.  A dozen  people have been killed, including a sheriff's deputy when a gunman opened  fire during a college night.  The very latest straight ahead.</p><p>We are also keeping a watch on markets this morning, and earnings where the  2018 midterms had a big effect yesterday.  Markets were up better than 500  points on the Dow.  We've got that and a lot more.  This morning, bit of a  pullback.</p><p>Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.</p><p>We have breaking news this morning out of California.  Twelve people have  been killed including a sheriff's deputy in a mass bar shooting.</p><p>We are watching markets as well after yesterday's big rally.  We're seeing  a pullback this morning.  Dow Industrials expected to be down about 50  points at the start of trading, down a quarter of a percent.  The Nasdaq is  down 31 after a huge rally yesterday on the midterm elections.</p><p>We are waiting on the Fed decision, of course.  that's due out at 2:15 p.m.  Eastern.  We're not expecting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates  after a two-day meeting..</p><p>European indices are mixed.  The FT 100 is up 26 points, the CAC in Paris  was flat and the DAX index in Germany is down 20 as well.</p><p>And in Asia overnight markets finished mostly higher with the exception of  China.</p><p>Joining us right now is Spruce Point Capital Management founder and chief  investment officer, Ben Axler.  And Ben -- it's good to see you this  morning.  Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p>BEN AXLER, FOUNDER &amp; CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SPRUCE POINT CAPITAL  MANAGEMENT:  Thank you for having me.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Were you surprised at that big rally in stocks yesterday?  </p><p>AXLER:  Not at all.  I think the market's base case was that the Democrats  were going to take the house.  Obviously political uncertainty is never  good for markets.  Markets got what they wanted.  Now we move on to the Fed  and interest rate.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Wo what would you do in terms of money right now?  Do you want  to put money into work in stocks or no?</p><p>AXLER:  So we're -- we're a short selling firm.  We play defense a lot.  We  think right now is not a great time to be overly exposed to stocks given  where we are in the business cycle, rate rising cycle.  We're in a lax  regulatory environment as well.</p><p>We're focused really on companies that are flattering their numbers with  aggressive counting (ph), receiving high valuations for speculative  business models.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  And just to be clear -- you're shorting those companies?  </p><p>AXLER:  Absolutely.  We're shorting them with an activist bent.  We put our  research on our Web site and try to find, you know, the good companies from  the bad companies.  </p><p>BENSON:  On the politics side, do you think the markets sort of like  divided government where, you know, you have the tax cuts, you had the  deregulation, things are doing very well in the economy so maybe some  gridlock is sort of ok in Washington?  </p><p>AXLER:  That seems to always be the case, yes.  I mean historically  speaking, gridlock is somewhat bullish for markets.  But we're really  focused mosh on the rate-rising cycle.  And think that the market is going  to be more discriminating now.  </p><p>The easy money is made in a lower rate-cutting environment.  Rate-rising  cycle -- the market is focused the quality of the companies, the valuations  and how the companies are putting their capital to work.  </p><p>BAKER:  What about the tech sector?  You know, the big tech companies took  a bit of a beating in the last month or so, had some good bit of a recovery  yesterday.  I'm interested in your point about, you know, companies that  are maybe have got some questionable numbers.</p><p>Where do you see now, because they've been so much behind the surge in  equity prices in the last couple of years?  And they now dominate many of  the major indexes.  Where do you see -- where do you see the major tech  companies going in the next year or so?  </p><p>AXLER:  Yes.  We had some really good success shorting tech companies this  past month.  The market is much more discriminating now on the quality of  the business.  So one of our best shorts was a company call To You (ph).   It trades at 10 times revenues, losing $40 million a year, the stock was at  an all-time high.  Brokers putting $100 price target on it.  Now, the  stock's at $50.</p><p>So it really comes down now to the quality of the business.  Are they  making money?  Do they have a path to profitability?  And I think you're  going to see more discrimination between those that have a real business  model and those that don't.  </p><p>BAKER:  And rates do you see, you know, we're going to see the Fed today,  the Fed's not going to do anything today.  But you know, short-term rates  gone up with long-term rates -- have gone up as well as the last year.  How  much is that starting -- I mean I don't see that's having an overall effect  on the market -- but how does that affect some of the individual companies  that you're look at?  How do you weigh that as you look at -- </p><p>AXLER:  Tremendously.  So we've had good success in the past month shorting  companies with low or declining organic growth and a lot of debt,  particularly companies exposed to short-term debt.</p><p>We recently shorted a company call Dollarama in Canada, $1.8 billion of  debt coming due in the next 24 months.  The companies is discounting the  companies that are going to have to refinance; they're going to have to  refinance at a higher rate.  The market's discriminating between those with  longer term maturities and those were shorter.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you short Tesla?  </p><p>AXLER:  We're not short Tesla.  We try to find companies that have a less  crowded short position.  You know, as we've seen, Tesla's a battle ground  stock, it can move 10, 15, 20 percent on a tweet from, you know, Elon Musk.   We're trying to find situations where the market doesn't already know what  the short pieces (ph) is, less crowding, lower short squeeze risk.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  What are some other shorts that are too crowded for you to  really want to anticipate?  </p><p>AXLER:  Well, I mean -- </p><p>MCDOWELL:  I mean participate, rather.</p><p>AXLER:  Yes, I mean our threshold generally, we see a short interest higher  than 30 percent, that's sort of indication to us that hey the market  already sees that there's a structural problem here.  When the shorts are  that high sometimes the cost of borrowing the stock is high.</p><p>So we're trying to find situations that aren't crowded where we're actually  getting paid right now to short given the general collateral rates of, you  know, a percent, percent and-a-half.  Those are the situations we want to  be involved in.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ok.</p><p>BAKER:  What's the best short you've done in the last few months?  </p><p>AXLER:  So we shorted Maxar Technologies.  That was a merger between  McDonald Dettweiler (ph), and a merger between McDonald debt Wyler and  digital globe which shorted it in the 50 50s.  the stock went down to about  $15 a share.  They just compare the satellite assets.  A lot of debt, no  growth.  The market is figuring these situations out quickly.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  So what's your take on the broader market?  I know you have  specific, you know, shorts in some of the smaller companies that are  unknown.  But your take on the broader markets?  We had a huge rally  yesterday.  A bit of a pullback this morning.  </p><p>AXLER:  My take is that we're in the later stages of the cycle.  I think  the market can continue to grind a little bit higher.  We've been pretty  vocal that we think we're in a sort of low single digit return environment  with a lot of volatility.  Volatility presents trading opportunities,  clearly.</p><p>But investors need to play defense.  You know, not every stock's a buy.  A  tremendous amount of the brokers are still putting buy targets and 20  percent upside scenarios on stocks.  And that's need to, you know,  scrutinize their portfolio carefully, play defense.  But they can still  make money on the long side.  It's just going to be a little harder.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right.  We will leave it there.  Ben -- it's good to have  you.  Thanks so much.  </p><p>AXLER:  Thank you.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Ben Axler joining us and we just showed you the screen of  markets pulling back this morning.</p><p>We have breaking news we're following this morning, a horrific scene out of  California, 12 people are dead.  Dozens more are injured after a gunman  burst through the doors of a bar on college night.</p><p>We're bringing you the very latest from the scene, thousand oaks,  California when we come back.</p><p>And then summit postponed -- why a second meeting between President Trump  and Kim Jong-un may not happen until next year.  We've got that news after  this.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Good Thursday morning everybody.  Welcome back.  Thanks very  much for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is  Thursday, November 8th.  We have some sad breaking news to report this  morning, at least 12 people are dead after a mass shooting at a bar in  California.  Among the dead, a sheriff's deputy.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GEOFF DEAN, SHERIFF, VENTURA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA:  He gave his all and  tonight as I told his wife, he died a hero because he went -- he went in to  save lives, to save other people.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  A Ventura County Sheriff's spokesman confirmed the gunman is  dead as well.  13 people dead that means.  We'll have the very latest on  the tragedy throughout the morning this morning.  </p><p>Then, security concerns, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh will have a  scaled back investor -- investiture ceremony today.  </p><p>Plus, the Pelosi method with the midterms behind us, how President Trump  will have to deal with the possible future House speaker.  We're dealing  with that this morning.  </p><p>And the sender's remorse, Facebook ready to help if you send a message too  soon, details coming up.  </p><p>Markets are lower today after a powerful rally yesterday.  Dow Industrials  down about 50 points -- 55 points right now, a quarter of a percent lower.   S&amp;P 500 down a third of a percent and the NASDAQ is down almost one half of  a percent right now.  </p><p>Investors are waiting on the Federal Reserve decision that's due at 2:15  p.m. Eastern today.  This after a huge day yesterday, Dow Industrials was  up 545 points yesterday, better than two percent, following the midterm  election news.  The major indices all up better than two percent.  Look at  the NASDAQ up almost 200 points at the close, that was 2.6 percent higher  on the NASDAQ.  </p><p>In Europe this morning no follow up though.  Take a look, European indices  are mixed.  The FT-100 is up 28 points.  The CAC Quarante in Paris is flat  and the DAX Index in Germany is down 21 points.  </p><p>Asian markets overnight mixed as well, best performer Japan, Nikkei average  up 1.8 percent.  </p><p>We begin this half an hour with breaking news.  We have been following all  morning.  12 people have been killed in a mass shooting in a California  bar.  Among the dead, a sheriff's deputy.  Lauren Simonetti with all the  details right now, Lauren.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Hi Maria.  It is the wee hours of the morning in Thousand Oaks,  California, some 40 miles west of Los Angeles.  Just hours ago, tragedy  unfolded for the families of at least 12 victims.  Our local affiliate  talking to some of the parents of the students at that Borderline Bar and  Grill.  They're now trying to get in touch with their sons and daughters.   Victims are witnessing the chaos that unfolded.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I was on the like side area, you could say, by the  stage and where I was looking was directly of where the guy walked in and  started shooting.  And, yes, I just -- I can't believe I saw it with my own  two eyes.  It just freaks me out.  Because where I was looking, you know,  just by all means some guy just walks in, pulls out a gun and start  shooting people.  Still just puts me in shock because out here in like  Thousand Oaks, just Ventura county area, it's our safe haven.  You know,  nothing like this happens.  </p><p>I saw two shots and then I heard about five or six and then that's when I  was out of the building.  But people I guess there was like smoke -- like  grenades going off.  I wasn't in the building when that one happened.   Everyone was -- </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  A handgun was found at the scene.  No assault rifle.  But a  search is still being done.  Ventura county sheriff Geoff Dean describing  the scene earlier this morning.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN:  It's a horrific scene in there.  There's blood everywhere.  And the  suspect is part of that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Multiple law enforcement agencies are on the ground.  And the  Los Angeles Times is reporting that some of the people inside that bar for  country night, and you only had to be 18 to get in to line dance, some of  those people were also last year in Las Vegas at the mass shooting at the  music festival there, Maria.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's incredible.  And that's what you mentioned earlier, Guy  Benson.  We'll have more on that coming up.  Thank you so much, Lauren.  </p><p>We want to turn now to the midterm aftermath.  Both President Trump and  potential House speaker Nancy Pelosi sounding off yesterday about the  results and sounding open to reaching across the aisle on certain issues.   The Wall Street Journal's editorial board issuing a warning on any  potential deal, titled this The Nancy Pelosi Method is an op-ed this  morning.  Mr. Trump has no fix policy compass on most issues.  So there's a  serious risk he'll be lured into anti-growth traps.  The U.S. could do  worse than two years of virtuous gridlock when nothing economically  damaging happens in Washington.  </p><p>Joining us right now is former Hillary for America senior advisor,  Democratic strategist, Adrienne Elrod and chairman of the American  Conservative Union, Matt Schlapp.  Matt, your reaction to the Journal's  comments.  Thank you so much to you both for joining us this morning.  </p><p>ADRIENNE ELROD, DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST:  Thank you, Maria. </p><p>MATT SCHLAPP, CHAIRMAN, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE UNION:  Yes, good to be with  you, Maria.  I scratch my head when I read Wall Street Journal editorials  like this.  The president has no policy focus?  Come on.  We've been  watching him in action for two years.  He's deregulatory.  He believes that  taxes should be lowered.  You know, his approach to government is when it  should do something, it should do it extremely well and extremely  efficiently.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  But there are plenty of things the government should do.  So I  think it's a rather absurd editorial.  And I'm glad the president is saying  that he's going to reach out across the aisle and work with Nancy Pelosi.   I'm glad he's saying he's going to think about his tone.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>SCHLAP:  And how he approaches things.  I applaud everything he is saying.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right, I just think that the editorial is trying to also though  make the point, Adrienne, that no agreement is better than a bad agreement.   Because if the Dems come in Adrienne and start -- you know, trying to  reverse the tax cut plan, reverse the rollback in regulations, that could  be damaging to the economy.  Your reaction, Adrienne?  </p><p>ELROD:  Yes, well, first of all, I'm glad that President Trump and that  leader Pelosi have made it clear that they both want to work together.  I  think bipartisanship is thoroughly needed right now in this country.  And  frankly, a lot of independents voted for Democrats in the midterms because  they want bipartisanship, but they want cooperation.  So, a lot of voters  out there in America expect this.  I think we'll see compromises on  potentially infrastructure and a couple other -- you know, kitchen table  issues that matter most to Americans.  </p><p>I hope Republicans will come to the table on health care and help make some  critical fix there's as opposed to repealing health care, Obamacare. </p><p>But, you know, look, I think we're off to a good start.  Let's hope that  this sort of conciliatory approach between both Trump and Pelosi continues.  </p><p>BENSON:  Hi Matt, it's Guy Benson.  You said you're applauding everything  Trump is saying after the election.  But one of the things that he said  yesterday was he went down this list of defeated House Republicans from  swing districts, tough districts --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes.</p><p>BENSON:  -- and named them.  You know, Barbara Comstock and Peter Roskam  and Carlos Curbelo sort of dancing on their political grave and mocking  them for not sort of embracing him or kissing the ring.  Is that helpful?  </p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes, I didn't -- I watched that press conference, Guy.  I didn't  find him mocking them at all.  He was making the point which is there are  plenty of reporters who are out there trying to say that this midterms were  a bad result for the president.  Those of us who work closely in  Washington, D.C. for a long time, realize that the House majority wasn't  really doing much anyway.  I've been really disappointed in the fact that  they can't get the number of seats they need in the Senate as well, where  it takes 60 for legislations.  </p><p>So, I think a lot of voters very rationally.  Republicans, conservatives  and Trump supporters very rationally said it seems like the real action is  in the Senate.  Let's get these judges confirmed.  We're going to probably  have another Supreme Court vacancy the next 18 months.  This is where we  should focus.  </p><p>Those politicians, Republicans, who are still trying to have their cake and  eat it too, they love to diss the president, to be disrespectful.  They  don't show up at the airport to shake his hand when he comes to their  stated district.  By the same token they wanted these Trump supporters to  be supporting them and the fact is Guy, I think many of these politicians  were quite frankly, too political in how they approached this.  </p><p>Nobody out there in the electorate believes that when you stand up for the  president and his policies that are good in your state and in your district  and the economy's good almost everywhere in this country, they don't think  that you're Donald Trump.  </p><p>Donald Trump is a very unique guy.  And I think they worry that he will  hurt them politically.  What --actually, what's happening is that they  don't get the support of the Trump support because it looks like they're  being disrespectful.  It was bad politics.  </p><p>BAKER:  Adrienne, this is Gerry Baker with the Wall Street Journal, if I  may, the one concern I think the people do have is that the one area where  they may be able to find agreement, Democrats in the House and the  president, maybe the Senate, is the possibility to spend a lot more money.   I mean, when people go to Washington, they get elected, the one thing that  everybody can always agree on and I do think again on -- not that I'm  defending what the Wall Street Journal editorial board said, but I do think  one of the concerns people have about this president is maybe if somebody  comes along with a big plan to spend a lot of money, he may find that quite  simply.  </p><p>Now, we already have a fiscal deficit which is going to hit -- you know,  trillion dollars, five percent of GDP.  That's absolutely the unprecedented  this stage of an economic cycle to have a deficit at that large.  What's  the chances that we just end up seeing the one thing we do in the next  couple of years is adding even more to the country's debt?  </p><p>ELROD:  Well, I will tell you this.  When I came to Congress when I started  working in Washington back in 2002, in Congress, there was something called  the Blue Dog Caucus which still does exists.  But it's unfortunately a much  smaller group of Democrats.  But these were Democrats oftentimes from  southern states who were very fiscally responsible who wanted to work with  Republicans across the aisle to do something about the debt.  And so, I  think Democrats and Republicans, away that we can really find common ground  here is to actually do something about the debt.  It's out of control.   Building the wall for example would absolutely skyrocket the debt.  So, you  know, finding approaches where we are being fiscally responsible would be a  good thing for both parties to come together on.  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  The wall is not the problem, Adrienne.  It is entitlements in  this country, largely, where two-thirds of our federal spending is just  required --</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  -- by Medicare, Social Security, and the like.  Very, very small  sliver is discretionary spending in this country.  </p><p>And Matt Schlapp, to that point, when the Republicans going to get religion  on actually cutting spending?  Because if you're going to talk about  infrastructure spending, how are you going to pay for it?  You're going to  raise people's gas taxes?  </p><p>SCHLAPP:  Right.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  People in California just voted to keep the gas tax increase in  place that Governor Gerry Brown and the Democrats pushed.  </p><p>SCHLAPP:  Yes, I know Dagen, this is -- your point, I'm going to answer  your question with the point you made which is any politician that's not  willing to seriously look at entitlements.  And look, in all fairness, when  President Trump ran for president he said I don't want to -- I don't want  to touch these programs.  If you don't look at how we bend the curve on  these programs, you have absolutely no impact on federal spending.  </p><p>When you look at the fact that Republicans came in and said we're going to  have earmark reform, made most of us laugh because in the end, you're  talking about pennies.  Pennies out of trillions of dollars, which you  really have to look through are, what are the big drivers?  And the big  drivers are the part of government that's on auto pilot.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Right.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  We can't really do anything to change it.  And let me tell you, I  think both parties are at fault but Adrienne, I have to push back on this  Blue Dog.  The Democratic Party has become socialists.  They've become so  radicalized.  I really worry, how can we work with a party that has become  so off-the-hook on their political philosophy?  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Go ahead, Adrienne.  </p><p>ELROD:  I mean, again, Democrats have had no control over the last two  years of the House, Senate and the White House.  But yet, my friend Matt  Schlapp still likes to blame us for a lot of the fiscal issues we have here  in this country.  </p><p>SCHLAPP:  We did not have 60 votes in the Senate -- we didn't have 60 votes  and you know it.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.</p><p>ELROD:  Well, you have a lot more votes now.  So, congratulations.</p><p>SCHLAPP:  Thank God.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you so much Matt Schlapp, Adrienne ElRod.  Good to see  you and good issues that we are highlighting there.  </p><p>President Trump just tweeted on the mass shooting, writing this in part, I  have been fully briefed on the terrible shooting in California, law  enforcement and first responders together with the FBI are on the scene.   13 people dead at this time have been reported.  Likewise, the shooter is  dead along with the first police officer to enter the bar.  We will bring  you more details as this story develops.  Stay with us</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back many we are following breaking news this morning.   A gunman kills 12 people in California.  Cheryl Casone with more details  right now, Cheryl.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  We're following everything we can out of California this morning,  Maria.  This mass shooting happened last night around 11:20 local time in  Thousand Oaks, California.  That's about 40 miles west of Los Angeles.   Now, the bar where this happened was hosting a college country night.  It  was packed with students at the time of the shooting.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  After the first round it was quiet for about five  seconds.  And then some guys that were next to me on the floor got up and  started sprinting towards the back door and yelled at everyone, get up,  run, he's coming.  And so it was like 50 people trying to get up and run  out the back door all at once.  </p><p>Unfortunately, I was one of the ones that got caught on the floor and was  trampled on by a couple people.  On my way up, I got hit in the head by a  bar stool being thrown at a window.  And I at that moment, I didn't know  whether I was going to be able to get up or not and if that guy was really  coming, what was going to happen to me.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CASONE:  Hundreds of students were in this bar, Maria.  A sheriff's deputy  was among the 12 victims, Sergeant Ron Helus was the first responder to the  scene.  He was immediately hit with multiple shots.  He is survived by a  wife and son.  The suspect was also found dead inside that bar.  </p><p>Another headline we're following for this morning, Maria.  President Trump  says he thinks that there's going to be a second summit early next year  with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.  Trump added today's meeting between  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a senior North Korean official to lay  the ground work for the summit is going to be rescheduled.  </p><p>Now, according to South Korea's Foreign minister, U.S. Officials say North  Korea canceled the meeting.  There's been little progress on getting North  Korea to take steps towards denuclearization since that first Trump-Kim  summit happened in June in Singapore.  </p><p>Well, Facebook's Messenger app is going to give its users a do-over.   People who sent a message on the app are now going to have 10 minutes to  decide if they want to unsend it.  Facebook first began testing the feature  last month.  Facebook admitted back in April, that they had been quietly  deleting messages sent by its CEO, Maria, Mark Zuckerberg.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Well, who didn't want that, right?  When you send something and  the decided oops, I better unsend it.  Who hasn't done that?</p><p>BAKER:  Does that mean -- does that mean there's a 10 -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Thank you, Cheryl.</p><p>BAKER:  -- essentially a 10 minute delay before you get a message to  someone?  I mean, supposing --</p><p>MCDOWELL:  Maybe.</p><p>BAKER:  You actually want to -- you need to get a message urgently to  someone (INAUDIBLE) it's an optional thing, right? --  </p><p>MCDOWELL:  Gerry Baker, you don't use the Facebook Messenger app then.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  That's true.</p><p>BAKER:  You don't.</p><p>MCDOWELL:  You make a phone call like old school.  </p><p>BAKER:  I would like to get a take-back some messages I sent like two years  ago.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Exactly.</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  OK, we are covering breaking news this morning.  It is a  terrible story, a deadly mass shooting inside of a California bar on  college night, 12 people have been killed including a sheriff's deputy.   The gunman is also dead.  We have the very latest coming up after this.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back.  President Trump just tweeting on the mass  shooting this morning.  Here's what he said.  I have been fully briefed on  the terrible shooting in California.  Law enforcement and first responders  together with the FBI are on the scene.  13 people at this time have been  reported dead.  Likewise, the shooter is dead along with the first police  officer to enter the bar.  Great bravery shown by police.  California  Highway Patrol was on scene within three minutes, with first officer to  enter shot numerous times.  That sheriff's sergeant died in the hospital.   God bless all of the victims and families of the victims.  Thank you to law  enforcement.  Writes the president this morning.  </p><p>Meanwhile, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh will have a scaled back  investiture ceremony today.  Fox News Doug McKelway has more.  He's at the  White House this morning.  Doug, good morning to you.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOUG MCKELWAY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Good morning Maria, and it's going  to be a slightly scaled down investiture because of security concerns here  in the nation's capital.  The traditional walk that most new justices take  down the front steps of the Supreme Court building will not happen today  out of those security concerns.  It also comes at a time when the  controversy over Justice Kavanaugh is not dying down at all here in  Washington.  Listen to what Mitch McConnell said yesterday about the  Kavanaugh effect on increasing the Senate -- GOP majority.  Here he is.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. MITCH MCCONNELL (R-KY), SENATE MAJORITY LEADER:  I think it was like  an adrenaline shot.  We were worried about lack of intensity on our side  and I think the Kavanaugh fight certainly provided that.  It was extremely  helpful.  It's noteworthy that the one Democrat in a red state who survived  voted for Kavanaugh, Joe Manchin.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MCKELWAY:  Meanwhile, Democrats may not let up on Kavanaugh.  We understand  from a report by Mollie Hemingway in the federalist that she overheard the  soon to be chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Jerrold Nadler suggest  on a telephone call yesterday that they're going to begin impeachment  proceedings against the new Supreme Court Justice.  Back to you, Maria.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  All right, Doug thank you so much.  Doug McKelway is at the  White House this morning.  </p><p>Breaking news overnight, a deadly mass shooting in California, a dozen  people are dead including a sheriff's deputy after a gunman burst into a  college bar.  Next hour, MORNINGS WITH MARIA, we've got the very latest.   We will go back live.  Stay with us.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Welcome back, good Thursday morning everybody.  Thanks so much  for joining us this morning.  I'm Maria Bartiromo.  And it is Thursday,  November 8th.  Your top stories right now just before 8:00 a.m. on the East  Coast.</p><p>We have breaking news that we have been covering, there has been a mass  shooting in a California bar, at least 12 people were killed including a  sheriff's deputy.  The gunman also dead, Ventura county sheriff describing  the scene inside that bar.  Watch.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEAN:  It's a horrific scene in there.  There's blood everywhere.  And the  suspect is part of that.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We have the very latest.  Coming up, the developments as they  come in.</p><p>Plus, Jeff Sessions was fired. </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL  RIGHTS RESERVED.

Many have complained that the bill is both confusing and likely to hit them with hefty compliance costs. </p><p>\u201cBusinesses have been waiting, waiting, waiting to see how these amendments come out and this only really leaves a few weeks now [to prepare],\u201d said Rafi Azim-Khan, partner and head of privacy team at Pillsbury Law. \u201cWhether they get everything done and everything right \u2014 that\u2019s going to be an open question.\u201d</p><p>The CCPA applies to any company with at least $25m in annual gross revenues that does business in California, or collects and processes data on California residents \u2014 even if they do not have a physical presence in the state. </p><p>In addition, businesses that buy or sell the data of more than 50,000 California consumers, or derive 50 per cent of their annual revenues from selling their data, are subject to the rules.\u00a0</p><p>The shake-up is part of a move to protect individual privacy rights in response to high-profile data protection scandals such as Facebook\u2019s Cambridge Analytica debacle, and major customer data breaches at Equifax and Capital One.\u00a0</p><p>Though considered less burdensome than Europe\u2019s general data protection regulation (GDPR), which came into force in May 2018, experts say the CCPA is likely to set the standard for privacy across the US, after efforts by big tech firms to urge Congress to introduce a softer, more sweeping national bill fell flat.\u00a0</p><p>In preparation, the California regulator has been bolstering its resources; it was granted $4.7m in funding and 23 new hires, including several enforcement attorneys, in the 2019-2020 fiscal year from the Department of Finance, specifically to implement the new rules.</p><p>\u201cOnce the new law takes effect, the California attorney-general will overnight become one of the most powerful privacy regulators in the world,\u201d said Lindsey Tonsager, partner at global law firm Covington.\u00a0</p><p>If consumers decided to stop their data from being collected or sold \u2014 businesses are expected to put an \u201copt out\u201d button on the homepage of their website \u2014 it could cause ripples through the online marketing industry and hurt sales at those which make the bulk of their money through customised advertising. </p><p>But experts said the bigger worry for businesses was the cost of compliance.</p><p>A March survey of 250 US privacy professionals, conducted by compliance technology company Trustarc, found that nearly four in 10 expect to spend at least $500,000 adhering to the rules, while for close to a fifth, that figure is more than $1m.\u00a0</p><p>Smaller businesses with fewer resources will bear the brunt, since global companies such as Google and Facebook may already have the required systems in place, after adopting the EU standards, known as GDPR, as their default. </p><p>\u201cCompanies that already had to apply to the EU GDPR are ahead of the curve,\u201d said Ms Tonsager. \u201cSmaller and medium businesses are having to spend \u2014 millions of dollars in some cases \u2014 to comply,\u201d she said, adding that these costs could be \u201cindirectly passed through to consumers\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>Above all, many will be investing in ways to update legacy systems to field users\u2019 requests to see their data within 45 days, and to ensure they can verify the identity of users without having to collect even more information on them.\u00a0</p><p>They must also weigh whether to attempt the tricky process of carving out the personal information of California residents from other US users, or simply roll out the changes they make across the country. </p><p>Even assessing which types of information fall under the scope of the rules in the first instance has proven challenging, according to Whitney Merrill, privacy and data counsel at San Francisco-based Brex, which offers corporate cards to start-ups.</p><p>\u201cWe have been making sure that we have a firm understanding of the law,\u201d Ms Merrill said. \u201cEspecially since \u2014 I\u2019ll be frank \u2014 it was very quickly written, and any privacy advocate would tell you it\u2019s poorly written.\u201d </p><p>According to data published by eMarketer, only 42 per cent of 1,500 US businesses surveyed in July this year were prepared or expected to be prepared by the deadline; the remainder either expected to miss the deadline or were making no preparations at all.\u00a0</p><p>But the cost of falling short of the rules is high. The California attorney-general can seek as much as $7,500 per person for any general breach of the rules, if it is intentional. But in the case of a hack, individual citizens can sue for as much as $750 each even if no damage was caused, or actual damages, whichever is greater.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a heavy price to pay if you\u2019re on the wrong side of the regulations,\u201d said Elizabeth Gallagher, chief revenue officer at software development company Lineate. \u201cThis will affect your reputation as well as your bottom line\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>Companies operating in Europe have already felt the pain under GDPR; this year, British Airways was hit with a\u00a0\u00a3183m fine for failing to comply with the rules while Google suffered a\u00a0 \u20ac50m\u00a0fine. \u00a0Unsurprisingly, as in Europe, a brisk market of start-ups is springing up with the promise of providing software solutions to aid compliance.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s hitting [businesses] like a tonne of bricks right now,\u201d said Dominic Sartorio, senior vice-president of product and development at cloud security group Protegrity. \u201cThat realisation is setting in.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-19a66bcadfa311e99743db5a370481bc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X4N-J8S1-DXP9-946K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1076\"/><timeReceived>2:37 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 26, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002M0H</classCode><className>EQUIFAX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

After two months of lockdown he emailed his employees to say that they could stay away from the office and keep working from home if they wanted. For ever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">California has always had an outsized presence in the American imagination, amplified by its image as the place where the futures of work, leisure, transport and communities are dreamt up. Hollywood and Silicon Valley give it enormous global reach.The mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, crystallised the moment of flux thrown up by Covid-19 when he said in April: \"Is normal really what we want to come back to?\" Many Californians have a one-word answer and have been busy planning for a more idealistic future, with plans to empty prisons, slash homelessness, improve internet access for poorer households and boost voter turnout.</p><p>Some big changes have already happened. About 3,500 inmates have been released from state prisons since February due to fears of a coronavirus outbreak and a need to cut costs. \"I don't see us going back to the old days,\" said George Gasc\u00f3n, a former San Francisco police chief now running to be district attorney in Los Angeles who has campaigned against mass incarceration. \"Crime hasn't gone up.\"</p><p>He added: \"There are going to be conversations that were viewed as radically left a few months ago that are not going to be that way any more.\"</p><p>Other seemingly intractable social problems have been put in reverse. Project Roomkey, an effort to move the most vulnerable of California's 150,000 homeless people off the streets, has found shelter for thousands in empty hotels, motels and other spaces.</p><p>\"It happened more immediately than anything I could have imagined before, with a sense of urgency that we needed a long time ago but finally came because of Covid-19,\" Andy Bales, who runs the Union Rescue Mission in Skid Row, downtown Los Angeles, said.</p><p>However, he added: \"I don't believe there's been an upgrade in overall infrastructure yet to make the changes last.\" Nowhere in America is more associated with vast wealth or left-wing thinking than California. At the same time it has the worst poverty rate of any American state by some measures.</p><p>Technology companies have donated hundreds of thousands of free wifi connections and tens of thousands of devices to help disadvantaged pupils learn at home during the lockdown. But state politicians believe they can increase pressure on internet providers to do more for the 1.2 million children who lack a device or high-speed connection to benefit from remote learning.</p><p>California may be trying to lead the way out of the pandemic. It also led the country into the outbreak. Patricia Dowd, a 57-year-old auditor, dropped dead in her kitchen in San Jose on February 6 after developing flu-like symptoms. In April tissue samples confirmed that she had coronavirus, making her America's earliest known victim.</p><p>Since her death state officials have been largely effective in managing the pandemic by tackling it early and decisively and by emphasising science over politics. The state's 4,900 deaths are only a few hundred more than the toll in Connecticut, which has less than a tenth as many people. The governor, Gavin Newsom, has seen his approval rating increase from 53 per cent in February to 65 per cent in a poll last week. Democratic activists and politicians have pressed for years for an expansion of postal voting to make democracy more accessible. Some Republicans, including President Trump, have complained without substantial evidence that it encourages electoral fraud.</p><p>Mr Newsom, 52, has seized the moment, ordering counties to post a ballot for November's presidential election to all voters to protect public health and voting rights.</p><p>A new Great Depression stands to cost California as much as any other state, if not more. Its population of roughly 40 million is bigger than that of Canada, Australia or Poland. If it were an independent nation it would be the fifth largest economy in the world.</p><p>By early May, 24 per cent of workers in Los Angeles were out of employment, roughly equal to peak joblessness in the 1930s. The latest figures show statewide unemployment was at 15.5 per cent in April. However, technology jobs in San Francisco and in Santa Clara county, which largely overlaps with Silicon Valley, fell by only 3 to 4 per cent. This resilience is likely to lead the state economy out of the pandemic - for good and ill.</p><p>Big Tech was on the rack before coronavirus arrived. The justice department was reviewing \"market-leading platforms\". Congress was pressing for tougher regulation and some Democratic presidential candidates were calling for companies such as Amazon and Facebook to be broken up.

After two months of lockdown he emailed his employees to say that they could stay away from the office and keep working from home if they wanted. For ever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">California has always had an outsized presence in the American imagination, amplified by its image as the place where the futures of work, leisure, transport and communities are dreamt up. Hollywood and Silicon Valley give it enormous global reach. The mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, crystallised the moment of flux thrown up by Covid-19 when he said in April: \"Is normal really what we want to come back to?\" Many Californians have a one-word answer and have been busy planning for a more idealistic future, with plans to empty prisons, slash homelessness, improve internet access for poorer households and boost voter turnout.</p><p>Some big changes have already happened. About 3,500 inmates have been released from state prisons since February due to fears of a coronavirus outbreak and a need to cut costs. \"I don't see us going back to the old days,\" said George Gasc\u00f3n, a former San Francisco police chief now running to be district attorney in Los Angeles who has campaigned against mass incarceration. \"Crime hasn't gone up.\"</p><p>He added: \"There are going to be conversations that were viewed as radically left a few months ago that are not going to be that way any more.\"</p><p>Other seemingly intractable social problems have been put in reverse. Project Roomkey, an effort to move the most vulnerable of California's 150,000 homeless people off the streets, has found shelter for thousands in empty hotels, motels and other spaces.</p><p>\"It happened more immediately than anything I could have imagined before, with a sense of urgency that we needed a long time ago but finally came because of Covid-19,\" Andy Bales, who runs the Union Rescue Mission in Skid Row, downtown Los Angeles, said.</p><p>However, he added: \"I don't believe there's been an upgrade in overall infrastructure yet to make the changes last.\" Nowhere in America is more associated with vast wealth or left-wing thinking than California. At the same time it has the worst poverty rate of any American state by some measures.</p><p>Technology companies have donated hundreds of thousands of free wifi connections and tens of thousands of devices to help disadvantaged pupils learn at home during the lockdown. But state politicians believe they can increase pressure on internet providers to do more for the 1.2 million children who lack a device or high-speed connection to benefit from remote learning.</p><p>California may be trying to lead the way out of the pandemic. It also led the country into the outbreak. Patricia Dowd, a 57-year-old auditor, dropped dead in her kitchen in San Jose on February 6 after developing flu-like symptoms. In April tissue samples confirmed that she had coronavirus, making her America's earliest known victim.</p><p>Since her death state officials have been largely effective in managing the pandemic by tackling it early and decisively and by emphasising science over politics. The state's 4,900 deaths are only a few hundred more than the toll in Connecticut, which has less than a tenth as many people. The governor, Gavin Newsom, has seen his approval rating increase from 53 per cent in February to 65 per cent in a poll last week. Democratic activists and politicians have pressed for years for an expansion of postal voting to make democracy more accessible. Some Republicans, including President Trump, have complained without substantial evidence that it encourages electoral fraud.</p><p>Mr Newsom, 52, has seized the moment, ordering counties to post a ballot for November's presidential election to all voters to protect public health and voting rights.</p><p>A new Great Depression stands to cost California as much as any other state, if not more. Its population of roughly 40 million is bigger than that of Canada, Australia or Poland. If it were an independent nation it would be the fifth largest economy in the world.</p><p>By early May, 24 per cent of workers in Los Angeles were out of employment, roughly equal to peak joblessness in the 1930s. The latest figures show statewide unemployment was at 15.5 per cent in April. However, technology jobs in San Francisco and in Santa Clara county, which largely overlaps with Silicon Valley, fell by only 3 to 4 per cent. This resilience is likely to lead the state economy out of the pandemic - for good and ill.</p><p>Big Tech was on the rack before coronavirus arrived. The justice department was reviewing \"market-leading platforms\". Congress was pressing for tougher regulation and some Democratic presidential candidates were calling for companies such as Amazon and Facebook to be broken up. Now those companies are enjoying a rise in public trust and governments have leaned on their support for contact tracing.</p><p>The industry is already reimagining their workplaces in America and beyond.

After two months of lockdown he emailed his employees to say that they could stay away from the office and keep working from home if they wanted. For ever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">California has always had an outsized presence in the American imagination, amplified by its image as the place where the futures of work, leisure, transport and communities are dreamt up. Hollywood and Silicon Valley give it enormous global reach.The mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, crystallised the moment of flux thrown up by Covid-19 when he said in April: \"Is normal really what we want to come back to?\" Many Californians have a one-word answer and have been busy planning for a more idealistic future, with plans to empty prisons, slash homelessness, improve internet access for poorer households and boost voter turnout.</p><p>Some big changes have already happened. About 3,500 inmates have been released from state prisons since February due to fears of a coronavirus outbreak and a need to cut costs. \"I don't see us going back to the old days,\" said George Gasc\u00f3n, a former San Francisco police chief now running to be district attorney in Los Angeles who has campaigned against mass incarceration. \"Crime hasn't gone up.\"</p><p>He added: \"There are going to be conversations that were viewed as radically left a few months ago that are not going to be that way any more.\"</p><p>Other seemingly intractable social problems have been put in reverse. Project Roomkey, an effort to move the most vulnerable of California's 150,000 homeless people off the streets, has found shelter for thousands in empty hotels, motels and other spaces.</p><p>\"It happened more immediately than anything I could have imagined before, with a sense of urgency that we needed a long time ago but finally came because of Covid-19,\" Andy Bales, who runs the Union Rescue Mission in Skid Row, downtown Los Angeles, said.</p><p>However, he added: \"I don't believe there's been an upgrade in overall infrastructure yet to make the changes last.\" Nowhere in America is more associated with vast wealth or left-wing thinking than California. At the same time it has the worst poverty rate of any American state by some measures.</p><p>Technology companies have donated hundreds of thousands of free wifi connections and tens of thousands of devices to help disadvantaged pupils learn at home during the lockdown. But state politicians believe they can increase pressure on internet providers to do more for the 1.2 million children who lack a device or high-speed connection to benefit from remote learning.</p><p>California may be trying to lead the way out of the pandemic. It also led the country into the outbreak. Patricia Dowd, a 57-year-old auditor, dropped dead in her kitchen in San Jose on February 6 after developing flu-like symptoms. In April tissue samples confirmed that she had coronavirus, making her America's earliest known victim.</p><p>Since her death state officials have been largely effective in managing the pandemic by tackling it early and decisively and by emphasising science over politics. The state's 4,900 deaths are only a few hundred more than the toll in Connecticut, which has less than a tenth as many people. The governor, Gavin Newsom, has seen his approval rating increase from 53 per cent in February to 65 per cent in a poll last week. Democratic activists and politicians have pressed for years for an expansion of postal voting to make democracy more accessible. Some Republicans, including President Trump, have complained without substantial evidence that it encourages electoral fraud.</p><p>Mr Newsom, 52, has seized the moment, ordering counties to post a ballot for November's presidential election to all voters to protect public health and voting rights.</p><p>A new Great Depression stands to cost California as much as any other state, if not more. Its population of roughly 40 million is bigger than that of Canada, Australia or Poland. If it were an independent nation it would be the fifth largest economy in the world.</p><p>By early May, 24 per cent of workers in Los Angeles were out of employment, roughly equal to peak joblessness in the 1930s. The latest figures show statewide unemployment was at 15.5 per cent in April. However, technology jobs in San Francisco and in Santa Clara county, which largely overlaps with Silicon Valley, fell by only 3 to 4 per cent. This resilience is likely to lead the state economy out of the pandemic - for good and ill.</p><p>Big Tech was on the rack before coronavirus arrived. The justice department was reviewing \"market-leading platforms\". Congress was pressing for tougher regulation and some Democratic presidential candidates were calling for companies such as Amazon and Facebook to be broken up. Now those companies are enjoying a rise in public trust and governments have leaned on their support for contact tracing.</p><p>The industry is already reimagining their workplaces in America and beyond. Facebook and Google have followed Twitter in saying that they are exploring moves for employees to work from home, albeit less ambitious ones.</p><p>These companies have already transchina formed the world of white-collar work many times, according to Margaret O'Mara, a history professor at the University of Washington. They altered \"the ideal of what a business leader looks like\" and expectations of what an aspirational office environment should be, she said, with \"ping-pong tables, climbing walls and free food\". The pandemic has provided an unexpected opportunity for another reassessment, a \"giant real-time experiment in working from home\".</p><p>The impact on workers would be uncertain. Employers could pay less to people in rural Montana than in San Francisco. The pre-pandemic Silicon Valley also contributed heavily to the global erosion of work-life balance. \"How do you create a work culture that allows people to turn off, even if they're physically working and living in the same space?\" asked Dr O'Mara. Solving that \"would be a useful problem for the tech companies to set themselves\".</p><p>Twenty years ago an upstart search engine company supercharged its growth by snapping up cheap jobless engineers and second-hand computers in the aftermath of the dotcom bust. In 2003 it moved into the vast headquarters that become known as the Googleplex. Last month Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, offered every one of the parent company's almost 120,000 global staff a sweetener to help with the next few months: $1,000 each to spend on their home offices.</p><p>Three cases emerge in Beijing after 55-day break Beijing has reported three new cases of coronavirus, raising concerns over a possible outbreak in the capital after a 55-day streak of no infection was broken on Thursday.</p><p>The authorities yesterday said a 25-year-old man who works for the China Meat Research Centre had tested positive. One of his colleagues, a 37-year-old man, also developed symptoms and tested positive. The news comes a day after the city reported a 52-year-old man was diagnosed with the virus.</p><p>somalia Al-Shabaab, an extremist group linked to Al-Qaeda, has unveiled a Covid-19 care facility in Jilib, a stronghold in southern Somalia, and set up a 24-hour hotline saying treatment would be offered to \"all people\". Sheikh Mohamed Bali, an al-Shabaab official, urged people with symptoms \"to come to the medical facility and avoid infecting other Muslims\".</p><p>italy Luca Zaia, the governor of Italy's northern Veneto region, is appealing to British tourists to return as he reopens opera venues following a successful track and trace campaign against the coronavirus. Every other seat at the venues will be left empty. Yesterday, no new cases were registered in the region.</p><p>europe Poland and Sweden are the only EU countries to have not yet passed their Covid-19 peak, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said. The virus's 14-day incidence \"was at the highest level yet observed\" in the two countries, it added.</p><p>russia President Putin took part in a flag-raising ceremony in Moscow in only his second public appearance since late March. Neither Mr Putin, 67, nor the majority present wore masks. Mr Putin embraced guests and shook hands.</p><p>ukraine Olena Zelenska, Ukraine's first lady, has tested positive for the coronavirus amid a rise in infections as the country eases lockdown restrictions.

After two months of lockdown he emailed his employees to say that they could stay away from the office and keep working from home if they wanted. For ever.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">California has always had an outsized presence in the American imagination, amplified by its image as the place where the futures of work, leisure, transport and communities are dreamt up. Hollywood and Silicon Valley give it enormous global reach.The mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, crystallised the moment of flux thrown up by Covid-19 when he said in April: \"Is normal really what we want to come back to?\" Many Californians have a one-word answer and have been busy planning for a more idealistic future, with plans to empty prisons, slash homelessness, improve internet access for poorer households and boost voter turnout.</p><p>Some big changes have already happened. About 3,500 inmates have been released from state prisons since February due to fears of a coronavirus outbreak and a need to cut costs. \"I don't see us going back to the old days,\" said George Gasc\u00f3n, a former San Francisco police chief now running to be district attorney in Los Angeles who has campaigned against mass incarceration. \"Crime hasn't gone up.\"</p><p>He added: \"There are going to be conversations that were viewed as radically left a few months ago that are not going to be that way any more.\"</p><p>Other seemingly intractable social problems have been put in reverse. Project Roomkey, an effort to move the most vulnerable of California's 150,000 homeless people off the streets, has found shelter for thousands in empty hotels, motels and other spaces.</p><p>\"It happened more immediately than anything I could have imagined before, with a sense of urgency that we needed a long time ago but finally came because of Covid-19,\" Andy Bales, who runs the Union Rescue Mission in Skid Row, downtown Los Angeles, said.</p><p>However, he added: \"I don't believe there's been an upgrade in overall infrastructure yet to make the changes last.\" Nowhere in America is more associated with vast wealth or left-wing thinking than California. At the same time it has the worst poverty rate of any American state by some measures.</p><p>Technology companies have donated hundreds of thousands of free wifi connections and tens of thousands of devices to help disadvantaged pupils learn at home during the lockdown. But state politicians believe they can increase pressure on internet providers to do more for the 1.2 million children who lack a device or high-speed connection to benefit from remote learning.</p><p>California may be trying to lead the way out of the pandemic. It also led the country into the outbreak. Patricia Dowd, a 57-year-old auditor, dropped dead in her kitchen in San Jose on February 6 after developing flu-like symptoms. In April tissue samples confirmed that she had coronavirus, making her America's earliest known victim.</p><p>Since her death state officials have been largely effective in managing the pandemic by tackling it early and decisively and by emphasising science over politics. The state's 4,900 deaths are only a few hundred more than the toll in Connecticut, which has less than a tenth as many people. The governor, Gavin Newsom, has seen his approval rating increase from 53 per cent in February to 65 per cent in a poll last week. Democratic activists and politicians have pressed for years for an expansion of postal voting to make democracy more accessible. Some Republicans, including President Trump, have complained without substantial evidence that it encourages electoral fraud.</p><p>Mr Newsom, 52, has seized the moment, ordering counties to post a ballot for November's presidential election to all voters to protect public health and voting rights.</p><p>A new Great Depression stands to cost California as much as any other state, if not more. Its population of roughly 40 million is bigger than that of Canada, Australia or Poland. If it were an independent nation it would be the fifth largest economy in the world.</p><p>By early May, 24 per cent of workers in Los Angeles were out of employment, roughly equal to peak joblessness in the 1930s. The latest figures show statewide unemployment was at 15.5 per cent in April. However, technology jobs in San Francisco and in Santa Clara county, which largely overlaps with Silicon Valley, fell by only 3 to 4 per cent. This resilience is likely to lead the state economy out of the pandemic - for good and ill.</p><p>Big Tech was on the rack before coronavirus arrived. The justice department was reviewing \"market-leading platforms\". Congress was pressing for tougher regulation and some Democratic presidential candidates were calling for companies such as Amazon and Facebook to be broken up. Now those companies are enjoying a rise in public trust and governments have leaned on their support for contact tracing.</p><p>The industry is already reimagining their workplaces in America and beyond. Facebook and Google have followed Twitter in saying that they are exploring moves for employees to work from home, albeit less ambitious ones.</p><p>These companies have already transchina formed the world of white-collar work many times, according to Margaret O'Mara, a history professor at the University of Washington. They altered \"the ideal of what a business leader looks like\" and expectations of what an aspirational office environment should be, she said, with \"ping-pong tables, climbing walls and free food\". The pandemic has provided an unexpected opportunity for another reassessment, a \"giant real-time experiment in working from home\".</p><p>The impact on workers would be uncertain. Employers could pay less to people in rural Montana than in San Francisco. The pre-pandemic Silicon Valley also contributed heavily to the global erosion of work-life balance. \"How do you create a work culture that allows people to turn off, even if they're physically working and living in the same space?\" asked Dr O'Mara. Solving that \"would be a useful problem for the tech companies to set themselves\".</p><p>Twenty years ago an upstart search engine company supercharged its growth by snapping up cheap jobless engineers and second-hand computers in the aftermath of the dotcom bust. In 2003 it moved into the vast headquarters that become known as the Googleplex. Last month Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, offered every one of the parent company's almost 120,000 global staff a sweetener to help with the next few months: $1,000 each to spend on their home offices.</p><p>Three cases emerge in Beijing after 55-day break Beijing has reported three new cases of coronavirus, raising concerns over a possible outbreak in the capital after a 55-day streak of no infection was broken on Thursday.</p><p>The authorities yesterday said a 25-year-old man who works for the China Meat Research Centre had tested positive. One of his colleagues, a 37-year-old man, also developed symptoms and tested positive. The news comes a day after the city reported a 52-year-old man was diagnosed with the virus.</p><p>somalia Al-Shabaab, an extremist group linked to Al-Qaeda, has unveiled a Covid-19 care facility in Jilib, a stronghold in southern Somalia, and set up a 24-hour hotline saying treatment would be offered to \"all people\". Sheikh Mohamed Bali, an al-Shabaab official, urged people with symptoms \"to come to the medical facility and avoid infecting other Muslims\".</p><p>italy Luca Zaia, the governor of Italy's northern Veneto region, is appealing to British tourists to return as he reopens opera venues following a successful track and trace campaign against the coronavirus. Every other seat at the venues will be left empty. Yesterday, no new cases were registered in the region.</p><p>europe Poland and Sweden are the only EU countries to have not yet passed their Covid-19 peak, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said. The virus's 14-day incidence \"was at the highest level yet observed\" in the two countries, it added.</p><p>russia President Putin took part in a flag-raising ceremony in Moscow in only his second public appearance since late March. Neither Mr Putin, 67, nor the majority present wore masks. Mr Putin embraced guests and shook hands.</p><p>ukraine Olena Zelenska, Ukraine's first lady, has tested positive for the coronavirus amid a rise in infections as the country eases lockdown restrictions. Ms Zelenska, 42, said she is selfisolating and that her husband, President Zelensky, and their two children tested negative.</p><p>australia Crowds of up 10,000 people will be allowed into sports stadiums with a capacity of 40,000 or under from next month, Scott Morrison, the prime minister, has said as Covid-19 restrictions are further relaxed.

There's an apparent paradox between trust in the tech industry and a desire for more regulation as thorny issues such as privacy become increasingly important. The survey is meant to gauge the mood of the nation's most populous state when it comes to tech, government, the economy, and the workplace. </p><p>For the 2018 Edelman Trust Barometer[1], the firm interviewed 1,502 people living in California. The group interviewed 500 people in the Bay Area and 500 in Los Angeles, with the rest coming from other parts of the state. Edelman also surveyed more than 33,000 people across the nation. A few highlights? More than 70 percent of California women believe core local industries have not done enough for gender quality at work. And more than seven in 10 Californians believe that industry can and should advocate for societal good. Looking specifically at the tech industry, 79 percentof Californians (83 percent of Bay Area residents and 77 percent of LA area residents) believetech companies have an obligation to speak out against policies that may hurt their employeesor customers, yet 66 percent say the tech industry is reactive, rather than proactive. Above: Californians know the big tech firms but aren't as familiar with social media companies. Image Credit: EdelmanWithin the Bay Area, 62 percent of those surveyed say they trust the tech industry,yet only 38 percent believe the growth of technology hasbenefited them personally, underscoring the potential for the public to turn on the techindustry. In fact, 62 percent of Bay Area residents say 'the tech industry makes the wealthyeven wealthier, but doesn't really help the rest of California.' More than two-thirds of Bay Area residents (67 percent) think the tech industry has been giventoo much freedom and needs more regulation. According to Bay Area respondents, theseregulations should include making tech companies more financially liable for data breaches (89percent support), taxing companies that move their manufacturing overseas (82 percent),taxing companies that replace workers with machines (66 percent), reducing the number ofskilled workers from abroad (66 percent) and preventing tech monopolies (56 percent). 'In the battle to protect its license to innovate around the world, the industry must first dealwith perception at home. All politics is local,' said Kristine Boyden, president of Edelman'sWestern Region, in a statement. The survey also found that the public distrusts social media. While 62percent of Californians trust the tech industry overall, just 37 percent said they trust social media companies. In the Bay Area, social media is even less trusted, with roughly a third(35 percent) of residents saying they trust the industry, making it the least-trusted industry thatEdelmantested. When it comes to what companies comprise the techindustry, Apple is the top company that comes to mind, followed by Google, Microsoft,and Samsung, with social media companies lagging far behind. More than 77 percent of Californians blame social media for the problem of fakenews, and by a 58- to 42-point margin (61 to 39 in the Bay Area) Californians maintain thatsocial media spreads misinformation rather than helping people become more informed about issues. It's therefore not surprising that more than seven in 10 support a variety ofregulations, including 86 percent supporting requirements of the same standards for politicalads on social media as on TV, 78 percent supporting fines on social media companies that host,publicize, or repeat fake news, 75 percent supporting fines against social media companies whenpeople use their platforms to violate the law, and 74 percent supporting a requirement thatsocial media companies review all content posted on their platform for accuracy. Above: Map of Silicon Valley Image Credit: ShutterstockMore than 70 percent of Californiawomen believe the media, entertainment, and technology industries have not done enough toimprove gender equality and fair treatment in the workplace. One-third of California women(32 percent) reported that they had been sexually harassed at work, with 38 percent havingexperienced unfair treatment at work because of their gender. That number goes upsignificantly for Bay Area women (46 percent) and California's college-educated women (49percent). Sixty-five percent of respondents said that women in positions ofpower are more trustworthy than men, a seven-percentage point increase since 2017. The perception that women in power are more truthful thanmen holds across both genders, with 52 percent of men and 77 percent of women citing femaleleaders as more trustworthy. That's not a surprise, given the #MeToo[2] movement and the steady stream of harassment scandals coming out of Silicon Valley. 'Clear actions, grounded in well-articulated values, are a must for companies to build trust fromthe inside out. Beginning with their own employees, then shifting toward the communities inwhich they work and into society at large, there is both expectation and opportunity forbusiness to lead,' said Stacey Zolt Hara, managing director of corporate and public affairs forEdelman Bay Area, in a statement. Above: Social media isn't trusted as much as tech as a whole in California. Image Credit: EdelmanHousing costs remain a huge issue, with 71 percent of Californians (77 percent Bay Area, 70 percent Los Angeles) reporting that the costand availability of housing is a 'very serious' concern. This group far outpaces the 43 percent whoconsider the lack of high-paying jobs a very serious concern. More than half of Californians (57 percent) said they don't believe their children will have a better life than they do. Andbecause of the high cost of living, Edelman found that there has been an increase amongmillennials (58 percent) and parents (65 percent) who are considering leaving California, up seven and 12 percentage points respectively in the last year. Interviews were conducted online from January 12 to January 22.

Jerry Brown, requires Companies to Disclose the Types of Data they Collect about Consumers and with Whom they Share that Information. Companies will be Forced to Let Consumers Opt-Out of having their Data Sold.The Law will also Prohibit Companies from Charging a Consumer or Treating them Differently because they Opted-Out of having their Data Sold. </p><p>Companies will also be Required to Secure Customer Data or Risk being Fined by California's Attorney General, according to the Legislation.The Protections won't take effect until 2020, meaning the Fight between Lawmakers, Advocates, and Tech Companies to further Shape the Regulations, or Water them Down, is still far from over.California's New Privacy Protections have been heralded as the Strongest Consumer Privacy Measure in Decades and are part of a growing Movement to give People more Control over their Data. While the spirit of the Law is similar to Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which went into effect last month, it doesn't go as far as GDPR, which is now considered the Strongest Data Privacy Law in the World. In response to GDPR, which took effect last month, many Large Tech Companies, even those based in the U.S., Revamped their Privacy Policies and Created Tools to give Users more Control over the Types of Data that is Collected.James Steyer, Founder and CEO of Nonprofit Tech Watchdog Common Sense, said the Passage of the Bill is a \"huge victory\" but isn't perfect. \"I would like to see even more aspects of privacy opt-in versus opt-out, but this is a huge improvement,\" Steyer said.The vote wasn't without a bit of last-minute drama. Lawmakers had until Thursday afternoon to Pass the Bill, entitled the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. If they did, Alastair Mactaggart, a Wealthy Real Estate Developer, said he would pull an even Tougher Measure that had Secured a Spot on the State's November Ballot. Mactaggart's Californians for Consumer Privacy Bill would give Consumers even more Power over their data, such as the Ability to Sue Companies that may have Mishandled their Privacy and Security.The Internet Association, the Lobbying Force representing many Large Technology Companies, had expressed its Disapproval for the Ballot Measure. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's Chief Operating Officer, told Reporters at an Event held at Facebook Headquarters on Thursday Morning that the Social Network supported the Legislative Action.Once Signed, the Bill will provide in 2020, California Residents with the Strongest Consumer Privacy Protections in the United States. It is also expected to have Wide-Ranging Implications for Everyone in the United States.Privacy Rights Activists have said they believe the Next Steps could be Instituting Stronger Privacy Protections at the Federal Level.Regardless of whether Congress Acts, Steyer said California's law will have a ripple effect and be a positive for all Americans. \"California's law will become the law of the land,\" he said. \"Waiting for Congress and this current executive breach to be functional is like a joke.\"NYC Wins When Everyone Can Vote!

Volatile day yesterday for the stock market.  The Dow  swinging from high to low more than 850 points, finishing up more than 260  points.  The S&amp;P tacking on about a percent yesterday and the NASDAQ about  a third of one percent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett saying the  President is happy with economy going into the end of the year.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KEVIN HASSETT, CHAIRMAN, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS:  I think the  President thinks that the economy the -- is doing well that the economic  fundamentals are sound and I think he is very pleased to see that the  markets are moving back to sort of where they belong given the  fundamentals.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SIMONETTI: So investors are building on yesterday's rally today in the U.S.   And Europe is rallying also.  The FTSE in London is up 133 points, that is  now two percent.  So we are grinding higher as the morning goes on.  Asian  markets mostly higher overnight.  The Nikkei down a third of one percent.   The only one in the red.  It is day seven of the government shutdown and it  does not look like it will end before the New Year.  We're going to break  it all down for you.  </p><p>And then it's deadline day for Sears.  The struggling retailer has until  the end of today to find a bidder for its assets or it could disappear  entirely.</p><p>Plus, the fight for higher wages.  Up to 22 states including New York,  Maine, and Oregon set to raise their minimum wage in 2019.  The fallout for  business as a result, that's coming up.</p><p>And will the real Alexa -- please stand up?  A fake Alexa app topping the  charts in the app store.  You won't believe it.  You could be vulnerable.   Here with me to break it all down, Fox News Contributor, \"GREG GUTFELD  SHOW\" correspondent, National Review reporter Kat Timpf; Beyond Sport  Global Ambassador and Fox News Contributor, John Layfield; and former state  department spokesperson and co-host of \"BENSON &amp; HARF\" on Fox News Radio,  Marie Harf.  All right.  Good morning guys.  </p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST:  Good morning.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Final hour here.  </p><p>HARF:  One more hour left.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  How do you feel?</p><p>HARF:  Oh, I feel great.  I feel great, yes.  It's get to get an early  start, you know.  Be up at 3:30 in the morning.  It's everyone's favorite  thing.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And you just flew in last night.</p><p>HARF:  I just flew in last night, yes.  Absolutely.  But I was in bed by  8:30.  So, it's good.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Good girl.  Good girl.  Bringing the energy this morning.  Also  joining the conversation, the former CKE Restaurant CEO as well as former  labor secretary nominee, Andy Puzder, and Texas Congressman Michael  Burgess.  So, you don't want to miss a beat.  Let's get straight to our top  story this hour and that is Wall Street's wild week.  Futures set to open  higher this morning.</p><p>Of course this is not how we close but it's how we're opening on the heels  of another volatile trading day.  This has become the new norm.  The Dow  did stage a comeback, it was late yesterday.  In fact it was a record-swing  of almost 900 points wrapping up this volatile week for the markets.  Let's  bring in Kingsview Asset Management CIO Scott Martin to try to make sense  of all of it.  What do you think, Scott?</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Let's make some sense of it, Lauren.   At least try.  Here's the thing.  You know, here's what's good that's  happening right now is that the markets are starting to heal I believe.  I  mean, Monday was an absolutes destructive day as I've said over the last  few weeks and gotten some ribbing for it mind you is if this is a barf  bottom type of day, Monday was certainly going into Christmas it really  tried ruin everybody's holidays.</p><p>And now we're seeing this market really recover nicely.  In fact yesterday,  you know, when we had a big sell-off, it looked like it was going to break  again, it didn't, it came back.  Now, the only thing that I'll tell you  that's still kind of hanging out there is we need to see some volume come  back because volume has been way more prevalent on the down days than it  has the up days.  So, some conviction buying is I think the next leg up  here.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  And what do you make of gold rallying?  </p><p>MARTIN:  We love gold.  We own gold.  I kind of feel like gold member here  by saying I love gold, you know, like the movie.  But the reality is true  though because gold right now unlike say your bonds which just have been  rallying back as interest rates have come down but certainly unlike your  stocks have really been that low volatility kind of just get me over the  hump trade.  And so, right now with U.S. dollar in our opinion kind of  maybe peaking out, intending to trend lower here in the 2019, I think gold  is a great addition to your portfolio.</p><p>If you're looking for something other than say just traditional stocks and  bonds.  </p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Scott, how you doing?   Congratulations to Chicago Bears, I think your defense out there is the  best I've seen since the 86 Bears.  But I want to ask you -- I want to ask  you about gold, you know, you get in gold as you say is safe haven and most  people that get into gold are worried about what's going on in markets.   You mentioned healing, it doesn't seem like much has changed.  We still  have all this unpredictability.  Are you bullish going forward?</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  We are bullish here, John, but I think, you know, the  interesting thing you have to think about is near term, this volatility is  going to stick around.  You made a good point.  It's not like any of the  stuff just because we because we rally, you know what, about 15 points on  the Dow, it's going to go away.  You know, these concerns over the trade  wars, these concerns over the Fed's involvement frankly concerns we have  that economic data is possibly slowing.</p><p>There's probably going to be some earnings compression.  So, you're right,  you know, it's not like just a few days kind of -- kind of cure these ills  but the reality is this is starting the process of some market healing to  wear.  If you got that long-term time horizon say, you know, couple of  years, three years in advance, these are great buying opportunities.  I  will throw into, John, that Bears defense is missing somebody like you one  that I think because they're going to get beaten in the playoffs.</p><p>And I like the Minnesota Vikings anyway, so I'm getting crushed here.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Scott --</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Yes.  You had your reign on the Bears, I forgot you're a Vikings  fan.  Yes.  You live in Chicago.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>HARF:  He's wearing a purple tie.</p><p>MARTIN:  See that?  You got it.  </p><p>HARF:  We all know the real football is played on Saturdays in college  football, we were talking about that earlier.  Scott -- </p><p>MARTIN:  Ohio State -- yes.  </p><p>HARF:  Yes, exactly.  I'm a huge Buckeye fan, Scott.  So thank you for  bringing that up.  I will watch the Rose Bowl.  Let's turn to 2019 in IPOs.   Could be a record year.  We're looking at companies like Uber, Palantir,  others, possibly accelerating towards earlier in year.  What's your  prediction for what IPOs might look like?  </p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  You know, Maria, IPOs are good sign of a -- of a good  economy, a good market because think about it, you know, you and I have a  private lemonade stand if you will, you know, outside of Columbus, Ohio  which I'm form the other side of Columbus, I know you're from the east  side, I'm from the west side of Columbus.  </p><p>HARF:  Hey.</p><p>MARTIN:  Like if we had a lemonade stand that was private -- that's right,  Clark County, Ohio.  Here's the thing though.  If we had a private lemonade  stand that we want to take public per se, we would do that in the market  environment where we thought we could get a good price appreciation or get  investors, get interest as far as capital.  And so it's a good sign that  companies are looking to come to market.</p><p>However, I think what we've learned from the IPO market is that it's a  dicey game.  You know, look at -- look at companies that we probably all  use like Spotify, look at Blue Apron, you know, trading under a dollar now  (INAUDIBLE) was the one that got destroyed that I really liked for a long  time.  There's just areas in the market that sometimes overinflate.  So, if  you're an individual investor sometimes the IPO if you're a public investor  is too late to get in.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  What about mergers and acquisitions, do you expect to see a lot  of M&amp;A?  And I'm asking in the context of some companies maybe in  healthcare or other sectors are more powerful together and they can weather  the pending storm if you will, together, but other companies and we're  seeing that with general electric and united technologies, they're  segmenting into different businesses.  Which way do you see going in 2019?</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  It's going to be funny.  There's going to be like two kinds  I think, Lauren.  There's going to be ones that are M&amp;A out of absolute  desperation, right?  You know, companies that need to combine to kind of  stay alive or there's other ones that are going to be opportunistic.  But I  tell you the best two areas probably for mergers and acquisitions going  forward is probably healthcare as you mentioned and certainly technology.</p><p>Because here's the best part about the sell-off so far.  A lot of these  companies are getting down to bear basement valuations in our opinion.  So,  if you're a bigger company, that maybe needs an additional aspect to your  business and you see a company especially looking the small cap space.  I  mean, my god some of these names are down near 30, 40 percent just from  October.  You got to start minding that area to see if you can pick up a  company on the cheap.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Do you think a lot of these private equity companies, well,  they are -- I mean, they've got cash but are you worried that some others  won't be able to get access to credit next year?  </p><p>MARTIN:  It's possible.  You know, this whole credit thing though to me is  a little bit overblown, you know, now whether you believe Secretary Mnuchin  about, you know, making these calls and making sure liquidities out there  and everybody is able to get their money and their access, that's one thing  but the reality is to me the credit markets are not really that frozen yet  and then not showing signs of freezing.</p><p>And one of the best things that happened in this market selloff is rates  have started to come down again.  And it's not like credit is dried up.   Yes, spreads have blown out a little bit but not terribly so if you look at  how financials have performed, if you look at oil stock have performed,   crude oil is down big.  So, it's not yet that crisis motor.  And let's say  indications that there's going to be a crisis mode yet, so I'm not too  worried about that aspect of things.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Scott, you got such a wonderful take on the markets.  One of the  reasons I enjoy listening to you every time I see you on T.V. but --  </p><p>MARTIN:  Thanks.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- besides from small caps, are you staying away from -- looking  at small caps, what are you buying right now and are you staying away from  tariffs sensitive stocks like in Apple who if the tariffs get ramped up  could lose their supply chain?</p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  You know, there's going to be an opportunity I think in  those areas.  You know, we've talked a lot about industrials.  I think  we've been on a couple of shows together talking about industrial stocks  because they just got thrown out with the bathtub, the baby, the bathwater,  everything in the bathroom really because, you know, this whole tariff war  thing was really getting accelerated and you look at companies like  Caterpillar, Deere, 3M, they just got totally tossed.</p><p>And those are good buying opportunities.  And if you look at how those  three companies have performed versus the S&amp;P 500 over the last 30 days  they've been outperforming.  So, in our opinion those are good areas to  start looking to pick up because I think a lot of that bad news, John, is  already in those stocks.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Let's talk retail, we spend what?  $850 billion this holiday  season but not at Sears, not at J.C. Penney.  It's deadline day for Sears  bid to acquire the company.  They're doing bankruptcy court today at 4:00.   J.C. Penney is $0.97, J.C. Penney is a penny stock.  What do you make of  the retail?  </p><p>MARTIN:  Yes.  I don't think that's what J.C. Penney had in mind when they  name the company back in the day.  I'll tell you.  Look, these days,  Lauren, you've got to stay on top of your game if you're in retail.  I  mean, retail is very kind of especially focused now.  I mean, you look at  some of the new companies that are out there like Canada Goose for example,  you know, that stock has done very well because of -- especially Under  Armour has even come back a little bit from the dead because of their  specialty focus.</p><p>But consumers are fickle. So, if we're in retail right now, we're staying  away from big box and we own Amazon just because the dominance there and  John knows this too, we've looked a couple nibbles or taken a couple bites  at Wal-Mart as well because of their dominance in the space. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Hey, Scott, where is Sienna right now?  Because we want to give  her special shout-out, she turns eight years old today?  Happy birthday.   Oh.</p><p>MARTIN:  Oh, yes.  Thank you, guys.  You're so sweet.  There's a picture of  her.  Yes.  I actually even took that picture, so not only picking stocks  but taking pictures.  Yes.  She's at home watching the -- she's at home  watching the T.V. waiting for daddy to come back home and spend her  birthday with her.  So happy birthday, sweetheart.  She's eight years old  today.  And we really appreciate it.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  You're done with us.  Go spend the day with Sienna.  Thank you  Scott Martin. </p><p>MARTIN:  See you, guys.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  The President is tweeting again and it is a long  one.  It's on trade.  The United States losses so much money on trade with  Mexico under NAFTA over $75 billion a year not including drug money which  would be many times that account that I would consider closing the southern  border a profit making operation.  We build a wall or he goes on, close the  southern border.  Bring our car industry back into the United States where  it belongs.</p><p>Go back to pre-NAFTA before so many of our companies and jobs were so  foolishly sent to Mexico.  Either we build, (finish) the wall or we close  the border.  He goes on.  Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador are doing  nothing for the United States but taking our money, word that is that a new  caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it.  We  will be cutting off all aid to these three countries taking advantage of  the U.S. for years.  Initial reaction, Marie?  </p><p>HARF:  Initial reaction is this isn't helpful right now, when -- I should  say it doesn't look like the President is in a negotiating mood with the  Democrats, right?

We're going to have more on the  shutdown showdown because the partisan divide in Washington shows no signs  of easing anytime soon.  Ahead, we'll be talking with one lawmaker to see  if a deal can get done.  Plus, several states are raising their minimum  wage.  The former CKE Restaurant CEO Andy Puzder, he's up next to break  down this growing trend of higher minimum wages.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The New Year means rising minimum wages.  In New York City,  it's going to up to $15.00 an hour and the minimum wage is set to rise in  21 other states.  Either due to automatic increases or residents who voted  to raise it.  Let's bring in the former CKE Restaurant CEO, former labor  secretary nominee and the author of The Capitalist Comeback, Andy Puzder.   Thanks for coming on this morning. </p><p>ANDY PUZDER, FORMER CEO, CKE RESTAURANT:  Great to be here, Lauren.  Thank  you.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  So, I mean, the minimum wages are tough for businesses to stay  in business, right?  </p><p>PUZDER:  Well, they can be.  If you don't -- it -- there's really no  problem raising the minimum wage.  If you don't raise it to the point where  it kills entry level jobs.  And the real problem is, when you go to a  number like $15.00, the best research, all the best research whether it's  from the Congressional budget office of San Francisco, Fed, the London  School of Economics, the Harvard Business School, a broad range of research  shows that when you raise it dynamically, when you raise it to a number  like $15.00, you actually the very working that just supposed to be trying  to help.</p><p>You price them out of the labor market.  Even the New York Times had an  article back in 1987 that was titled, The Right Minimum Wage Is Zero that  talk about pricing, working poor out of labor market.  That's particularly  a problem when one, automation is becoming more prevalent, you can automate  just about any repetitive task, there's even a machine that makes burgers.  </p><p>And two, the market seems to be addressing the problem of wage increases  without a mandatory minimum wage increase from the government.  Even on the  drive here, we went by fast food restaurants this morning that advertise in  Nashville where there is no minimum wage increase, it's still 7-1/4.  But  the signs in the restaurants are higher, we get $11.00, $12.00 an hour  which is a huge increase from where it was just a few years ago.  </p><p>So, this is a big problem and the market is taking care of it.  Government  should get out of the way.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  You also talked about automation and that brings me to the push  for universal basic income.  A lot of folks in Silicon Valley say, you  know, automation has killed many people's jobs.  So let's do universal  basic income, basically every one doesn't matter how much you make, doesn't  matter your employment status, you get a stipend. They tried it in  California, in Canada and it didn't really work the test there.  48 percent  of Americans say they would support this but there are major problems.  </p><p>PUZDER:  There are -- there are things that would work like they earned  income tax credit.  That does reduce poverty and it's a -- it's something  that encourages people to work and as their income from work increases,  their government benefits decrease but universal income not only is it a  bad idea, not only does it discourage work, not only does it kill the  incentive to work which is something from which people get pride -- the  pride of accomplishment and the, you know, the feeling that you've really  done something with your life.</p><p>Not only does universal income not solve the problem, the underlying  problem of, you know, what makes people happy, what makes people satisfied  but it's just -- it just -- it -- it's just a bad plan in general, it's  again, the government stepping in and trying to solve a problem that  doesn't need to be solved.  We have seven million job openings right now.   I don't know what Silicon Valley is so upset about.</p><p>There are seven million unfilled jobs right now and more people are working  than have ever worked in the history of the country.  So this -- I think  this is a solution looking for a problem at the moment.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Hey Andy, that push for 15, that's an arbitrary number, they  chose that because it lose on bumper stickers, it sounds good on the  slogan.  There's no economic rationale to say 15 as compared to say 14 or  16 but that number should be somewhere.  Where do you think that minimum  wage number should be?</p><p>PUZDER:  Look, a few years ago, Barack Obama -- President Obama was pushing  for 10 an hour.  At this point, you can't hire people for less than $10.00  an hour.  So I think if you went to $9.00 to $10.00 an hour, you know, as a  minimum wage, you wouldn't really be killing the entry level positions that  the working poor need.  I think what we need is to study to determine at  what point do you start killing those entry level jobs.  And that number is  going to be different in Birmingham, Alabama than it's going to be in New  York City or Los Angeles or Memphis, Tennessee.</p><p>So regional increases are really a much better way to approach it than a  Federal increase.  A Federal increase, you have to increase it only to the  minimum amount because if you increase beyond the minimum that could be  taken in less economically successful areas, then you're really hurting the  very areas that, you know, where you want to help people.  So, I think  regionally it's good and I think it's got to be determined at what point do  you kill those entry-level positions that the working poor need.</p><p>I'll bet many -- I mean, I started with a minimum wage job.  I bet many of  you did.  They're important jobs.</p><p>TIMF:  I did have a minimum wage job.  </p><p>HARF:  Me too.</p><p>TIMF:  I wasn't very good at it, didn't last long.  </p><p>PUZDER:  You learn a lot though, you learn a lot about business and how to  work and customer service, you learn many things.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Andy Puzder, thank you very much.  </p><p>PUZDER:  My pleasure, thank you.  </p><p>PUZDER:  You too.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.

Sign us up!</p><p>Let's get straight to our top story this half hour, and that is the  shutdown showdown.  The partial government shutdown will most likely  stretch into 2019 with no clear deal in sight on funding for the border  wall.  President Trump taking to Twitter this morning, threatening to close  the southern border if no deal is made.  This comes as Homeland Security  Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen is scheduled to visit the border in Texas today.   Let's bring in Texas Congressman Dr. Michael Burgess.  Congressman, thanks  for joining us.</p><p>REP. MICHAEL BURGESS (R), TEXAS:  Well, thanks for having me on, I  appreciate it.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  This threat from the President on Twitter just moments ago that  he is going to shut down the entire border.  He is not playing, he's  serious.  What do you think happens?</p><p>BURGESS:  Well, that's exactly right, and people are approaching this as if  -- as if the President will have no power in a week when the Democrats take  over the House of Representatives, but that's not right.  The President has  tremendous power, and one of the things that is within his purview, and I  think you saw him exercise this a little bit when the -- when the  difficulties were occurring outside of San Diego when the caravans that  arrived and people were coming over and under the fences that existed.  He  threatened -- complete cessation of traffic.  And very quickly, the town of  Tijuana decided that perhaps they could help more than they were.  And I  think that was a good thing, and I think the government in Mexico has  decided that it can help more than it had been, and I think that's a good  thing.  But make no mistake about it, yes, that power to seal the border,  that is within the President's purview, and --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  OK.  And he can do that.  He legally can do that.</p><p>BURGESS:  I'm grateful that -- I'm grateful that the Secretary is going  down there today.  I think -- I think the President also needs to go down,  he's been down before.  President Obama would never go down to the Texas  border.  I think the President needs to go as well.  You learn some things  when you're down there, you learn some places where a wall would work  great, some places where a wall would not be as helpful, but there are  other measures you can take to secure our border, but it's obviously our  job in the Congress to fund the money to secure the border, and that's what  we need to do. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, it remains to be seen.  The President making several  threats this morning.  He also threatened to cut financial aid to Honduras,  Guatemala, and El Salvador, as there is reports that another caravan is  coming to our borders, and those countries are not the trying to stop it.</p><p>BURGESS:  I have advocated for this since 2014.  Look, I was on another  network, another cable show, and I got criticized because of Mexico is not  paying for the wall.  Look, you could back -- since the Department of State  is not funded yet, you could back all foreign aid for Mexico, those Central  American countries out, and put that in a fund for a border wall, and  you're getting pretty close to the $5 billion you need this year.  It makes  no sense to ask the taxpayer to send money down to prop up governments,  that aren't doing their job, that are corrupt governments, not taking care  of their people, so that their people come to our border, and now the  taxpayer is charged with taking care of, what is it, 14,000 children, that  are in the custody of refugee resetlement, that is not right, and it needs  to stop.</p><p>HARF:  Congressman, Marie Harf here, your colleague -- your Republican  colleague in the Texas delegation Will Hurd, a former CIA officer,  certainly not for open borders, has said that the wall is the least  effective and most costly way of going about dealing with our immigration  problem.  So, there is a difference of opinion here on whether a wall  itself is needed.  What do you say to those 800,000 plus federal employees  who aren't getting paychecks this Christmas because of this disagreement  about a policy?  What do you say to those people, many of whom live in your  home State of Tex as?</p><p>BURGESS:  Well, you're absolutely right.  And an appropriation laps is  always wrong when it happens, and both sides, I feel are -- carry some  blame in this.  Look, the wall is not the solution on the entire Texas  border, and I understand that from having been down there several times,  but there are several places where it does help, and it has worked, and  there are places where fences that were built years ago are not doing the  job, and they should be replaced with hardened facilities.  </p><p>So, although, I may disagree a little bit with Representative Hurd, I don't  disagree entirely.  There are places in the southern part of the lower Rio  Grande Valley sector where you actually need -- if you cleared brush, then  your aerostats and other surveillance mechanisms would work much better.   U.S. Fish and Wildlife won't let the United States clear the brush in some  of those areas.  When someone comes across the river, they disappear into  the brush, you've completely lost them, your $700,000 aerostat above the  ground monitoring things has -- is of no use in that situation.  </p><p>So, we are going to have to take some other approaches on other parts of  the border.  But look, here's the -- here's the thing, this is so  important, it is -- it is wrong for the United States that if the House  sent them a bill a week ago, sent them a bill with funding that would keep  the government open until February, provide disaster relief, provide  funding for the wall, and the Senate will not -- the Senate had a motion to  proceed but then has done nothing.  Look, I know they don't have 60 votes,  but I bet they have 51 votes.  This is an emergency, they need to suspend  their rules and get this done.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Congressman, would you be willing to make a deal for some  border wall funding that includes protections for the DACA recipients that  could possibly be a negotiation where both sides would be able to get  something?  Would you say yes to a deal like that?</p><p>BURGESS:  Well, it would depend on the deal.  And I think that deal has  been tried several times, this year, I think Senator Schumer actually  walked away from such a deal.  I didn't particularly like it when he shut  the government down in January, I didn't like it but was willing to look at  it very carefully in order to keep the government going because I thought  that was important, but then at the end of the day they were not serious,  it was an unserious offer, and it was withdrawn and it hasn't been brought  up again.  Yes, talk about what the other side has to have at this exchange  that after all of this, what this is all about.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Congressman Burgess, would you vote for any piece of  legislation that gets the government open again but doesn't include enough  money for the wall?</p><p>BURGESS:  Well, we get into the definition of \"enough.\"  And there needs to  be --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  What is that?</p><p>BURGESS:  There needs to be money for the wall.  The President has  identifed $5 billion.  We offered 5.7 in the bill we passed last week on  the House of Representatives, with 217 votes.  Nancy Pelosi said we didn't  have the votes.  We clearly had the votes, so I fault the Speaker for not  bringing that vote to the floor sooner when we perhaps would have had more  time to work on this.  But it is -- it is just wrong for us to be spending  the last week of this Congress without coming to a solution, which is why  I'm here in Washington today.  I wish more people were.  I wish we were  working on this.  </p><p>The Speaker certainly could at least call a conference call and call his  members and see where they were, that has not happened.  Certainly, the  White House, has reached out, and I think that's good, but it needs to be  more than one.  One person can't negotiate.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  A lot of people just don't like the fact that this is being  called a wall.  Do you think the President would call it something else,  even though it does the same thing?</p><p>BURGESS:  I think he offered to call it whatever anyone wants to call it.   So, yes, he's -- I think he has moved to whatever semantics you want to  use, but he needs security on the southern border and I agree with him, we  do need that security.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  On January 3rd, does Nancy Pelosi become easier to negotiate  with because she's officially speaker?</p><p>BURGESS:  Well, two things about that:  Number one, no she doesn't become - - she never -- she never will become easier for this President to negotiate  with.  I don't -- she doesn't like this president, refuses to negotiate  with him, and her base will not let her negotiate with the President.  They  will pass something and send it on and it will possibly pass the Senate  because they have not shown any particular profile in courage that I've  been able to see but the President will veto it and it's perfectly within  his right to do so.  And that is -- that is what will unfortunately extend  this process farther for people who think, well, we just get Pelosi in  there and get those Republicans out of the way and things will be working  great.  That's not actually the case.  </p><p>Remember John Boehner's frequent lament, I only control one half of one- third of the federal government.  Well, Speaker Pelosi is going to find  herself in that same position, and it's not always a position of strength.   But here's the other thing about Speaker Pelosi.  And you were talking  about the minimum wage.  Do you remember 2007 when she was sworn as Speaker  and made a number of economic decisions that basically set the stage for  the largest economic disaster this country has seen in years which was a  2008 recession?  And the first step in that was increasing minimum wage, as  your other guest pointed out, just eliminated entry-level jobs in many  locations, and it really turned up to be -- if I think if people look at  that honestly, it was very detrimental to the economy.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Congressman Michael Burgess, thank you so much for coming on,  because you're in Texas, that is ground zero for what we're talking about  these days.  Happy New Year, Sir.  Thank you.</p><p>BURGESS:  Right.  Thank you.  Same to your new listeners.  Thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right, coming up, viewers taking control.

So, Maria  Bartiromo sat down with the co-founders of The Groomsman Suit, Jeanne Foley  and Diana Ganz.  They began their unique founding of the company following  Jeanne's own wedding.  Here you go.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>JEANNE FOLEY, CO-FOUNDER, THE GROOMSMAN SUIT:  We're planning a New Year's  Eve wedding and we just decided tuxedos are the way to go, and gave that  task to my husband and said make it happen.  And so, he went to a big box  store and went the rental route.  And it wasn't really until after the  wedding that I actually realized how much the guys have spent.  </p><p>DIANA GANZ, CO-FOUNDER, THE GROOMSMAN SUIT:  Yes, and Jeanne was the one  that was returning the items the day after her own wedding.</p><p>FOLEY:  Yes.</p><p>GANZ:  Which is, like, so already? </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>FOLEY:  So, I got to enjoy that experience.  </p><p>GANZ:  (INAUDIBLE) on this rental option.</p><p>FOLEY:  But I'm so thankful I got the opportunity to do -- to do that and  go through it because I realized there's this huge hole in the market for  really affordable wedding wear that guys can keep and own.</p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Yes.</p><p>GANZ:  I mean, when you think about what women have, bridesmaids have the  ultimate experience.  You know, it's exciting.  You know, they get to go in  group shop, and they have so many options.  And men -- for men, it's always  been more of this like daunting inconvenient and expensive process to get  suited up for weddings.  But really, suiting is not rocket science.  I  mean, that's really where Jeanne's background came into play.  You know,  she has a fashion design background, and so, when she was outfitting their  wedding and starting to see the price tag -- </p><p>FOLEY:  Yes, that's what really stuck up. </p><p>GANZ:  -- it was like sticker shock.</p><p>FOLEY:  Yes, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Tell us how -- what sets you apart from other suit  manufactures?</p><p>GANZ:  Like we have built a brand and the company as just -- not only  having great product but being that reliable resource to couples when it  comes time to planning their day, and --</p><p>FOLEY:  And just making it really easy.</p><p>GANZ:  Yes.</p><p>FOLEY:  The process, it's no brainer.  You visit our Web site, you pick out  the option you like, set up your wedding group -- </p><p>GANZ:  Coordinate your group.</p><p>FOLEY:  We take care of everything.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And it's better than renting something that you have to go.</p><p>GANZ:  So much better.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You don't know who is in it and -- </p><p>GANZ:  Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  You know, how old it is.</p><p>GANZ:  You're the first one to wear it.  Well, at The Groomsman Suit, too,  our tuxedos are $194.  So, oftentimes, they're less than what you'd paid  for rental anyway.  They're going to fit better because we carry one of the  largest size ranges of any brand and you get to keep it.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love the baby jackets that I see. </p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The line up, and some of the little baby jackets for little  boys were so cute.</p><p>GANZ:  Those are new to our line.  We're actually launching those today.  A  junior line -- kids line from size two T to eight.  And we just realized  that there are other brands weren't doing this.  So, guys were having --  people were having trouble outfitting the ring bearers.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Look at that little jacket for the ring bearers, it's so cute.</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Actually, you also have this new brand of new colors.</p><p>GANZ:  Yes, that's exactly right.</p><p>FOLEY:  Yes.  We're --</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes, so you're sort of actually getting -- expanding here.</p><p>GANZ:  Yes, we started with a very focused selection of a suit in four  colors, but now as we're getting bigger, we wanted to expand the product  line a little bit, so we're adding charcoal gray right there, and our light  blue which will be great for destination wedding season.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  Yes.  The summer and warmer climates.  What about the  accessories?  You've also -- it's not just suits, you've got accessories.</p><p>FOLEY:  Yes.  So, to not grow too fast and get too involved in accessories,  we've partnered with some really, really amazing, niche brands, like JJ  Suspenders for our suspenders.  They do an awesome job.  For our shoes, we  actually were recently connected with a great company called Marc Nolan.   And we're collaborating to do our own line of shoes through him.  So, those  will be available very soon as well.</p><p>GANZ:  And throughout the process of expanding our catalog, we have really  remained focused on keeping everything affordable.  You know, we have -- we  do not want to start adding these luxury items.  Our goal is to really help  men look like a million bucks for a fraction or less.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  I love it.  Congratulations, ladies.</p><p>FOLEY:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  We love entrepreneurial stories, and you guys are knocking the  cover off the ball.  Congrats.</p><p>FOLEY:  Thank you so much.</p><p>GANZ:  Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO:  And the company is The Groomsman Suit.  Check it out.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Thanks again to Jeanne Foley and Diana Ganz.  All right, coming  up, Tesla's new board members.  We have the details on who's joining,  straight ahead.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Some changes in store for Tesla and investors are liking it.   Gerri Willis on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  Gerri?</p><p>GERRI WILLIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  Hey, you've got that right, two  new board members for Tesla: Larry Ellison, the executive chairman and  Oracle founder apparently now has a big stake in Tesla.  It'll be  interesting to see how those two big personalities get along, Elon Musk and  Larry Ellison.  And also, Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, she's the global head  of human resources at Wallgreens and a former executive at Kellogg.  Lots  of controversy over the board and their handling of the company.  We'll see  how this works out.</p><p>In the meantime, Netflix out with an interactive story -- I'm sorry, the  stock is actually up here.  As you can see three percent.  Netflix out with  interactive storytelling for its Bandersnatch, Black Mirror series.  This  is going to be interesting stuff.  There are going to be five possible  endings for a new version of this in this series, and people will be able  to play along, decide what kind of ending they want.  You can watch it at  40 or 90 minutes.  Listen --</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Bandersnatch.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  An adventure game based on a book.  (INAUDIBLE) was a  genius.  See that bloke who had (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  When it's a concept piece, fear of madness is what you  need.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>WILLIS:  So, yes, exciting, right?  They have just done a deal, Netflix,  with a gaming studio called Telltale and lots of questions about whether  this means that the company will move into gaming.  We'll see.  But in the  meantime, guys, as I send it back to you, I just want to say I would love  to choose my own endings.  Do you remember Cold Mountain, right, the girl  didn't get the guy?  I would get them together and then I would be happy,  right?</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Nicole Kidman and Jude Law, of course, I remember that.</p><p>WILLIS:  Right.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Gerri Willis, Happy New Year.</p><p>WILLIS:  You as well.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Have a great weekend.</p><p>WILLIS:  You too.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And thank you to our panel today: Kat Timpf, John Layfield, and  Marie Harf, thanks -- and thank you for having me, to the viewers, filling  in for Maria Bartiromo this week.  And that does it or for us.  \"VARNEY &amp;  COMPANY\" is up next.

The Internet collectively hitting back at  Instagram over an app redesign.  The outrage coming up.</p><p>We can get outraged about a lot of stuff these days.</p><p>Here with me to break it all down: Fox News contributor, +ACI-GREG GUTFELD  SHOW+ACI- correspondent, and +ACI-National Review reporter Kat Timpf+ADs-  Beyond Sports global ambassador and Fox News contributor John Layfield+ADs-  and former State Department spokesperson and co-host of +ACI-BENSON AND  HARF+ACI- on Fox News Radio, Marie Harf.

So you don't want to  miss it.</p><p>Let's get it all started with our top story this hour, and that is the  shutdown standoff.  Three days out from 2019 and lawmakers remain far from  an agreement to fund the government paving the way for the shutdown to  stretch well into 2019.</p><p>The border wall impasse is now in the hands of House Democrats who assume  the majority on January 3rd.  That's a key date.</p><p>House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows weighing in yesterday.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), NORTH CAROLINA:  In the last 48 hours, I would say  that the needle has moved towards a very long shutdown, just because of the  impasse that we're seeing and the unwillingness of Democrats to actually  engage in meaningful dialogue.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Let's bring in Ohio congressman, member of the House Ways and  Means Committee and Iraq war veteran Brad Wenstrup.  Congressman -- thanks  for joining us this morning.</p><p>REP. BRAD WENSTRUP (R), OHIO:  Good morning.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  You know, as Democrats take control of the House January 3rd,  what's at stake and what does Congress do?  How do they move forward from  here?  Because they showed up yesterday and then they left.  </p><p>WENSTRUP:  Yes.  Well, it's going to be very interesting.  It already has  been very interesting.  And as you know, the House, we did pass a bill that  would fund the government and enhance border security.</p><p>I would actually like to take some of our senators and including maybe  Senator Brown from Ohio and Senator Schumer and bring them to my district  and make them understand the need for border security.  What we have seen  in our district is violence from illegal immigrants.  But also we've seen  the effects of drugs in our communities, so much so that it's been a  tremendous burden, not only in our district but across the country.</p><p>And you look at the loss in not only dollars but in human treasure.  That  by itself should be enough reason for people to want to make sure that we  have border security.</p><p>Drugs are flowing freely across our border from China, in through Mexico,  heroin coming across from Mexico -- it's well-documented.  And I'd like  them to sit and maybe talk to some of the addicts, talk to some of those  that treat the addicts and also talk to the family of those that have lost  family members because it's a very severe problem.  It's part of the  problem.</p><p>Also, as a doctor, do we really want ebola and other diseases just entering  our country?  There are so many good quality reasons for us to enhance our  border security but somehow it's gotten all muddled on a debate on  immigration which, by the way, we're for a robust immigration system that's  legal and works.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  But you're in Ohio right now, I believe, sir.  You're not in  Washington, D.C. -- </p><p>WENSTRUP:  Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  -- and something's got to get done.  So how do we get lawmakers  -- what sweetener will the Republicans offer that the Democrats will agree  to, to fix the problems as you just highlighted for us that are happening  at the border and unfortunately, yes, in Ohio you're on ground zero for the  drug problem that we have.  </p><p>WENSTRUP:  Absolutely.  And if they don't want to do anything about that,  that is what they should be feeling guilty about is that they are walking  away from a very serious problem that's killing more Americans than  anything else.</p><p>But besides that, that's part -- got to be part of the conversation.  I  think that there are Republicans and probably the President too that maybe  could take a little bit different number but we've got to get moving in the  process.  </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  What number -- what number will the President accept, under  +ACQ-5 billion?  What number is that?  </p><p>WENSTRUP:  Well, that I don't know.  I can't speak for the President.  I  can't speak for the entire body of the House of Representatives but we put  our number out there.</p><p>We're willing to have a conversation and negotiate this but we want to  drive home the point that this is a very serious issue and probably the  primary responsibility of the government.  And if the government isn't even  doing that, trying to keep Americans safe then we have a problem.</p><p>And I think that's the message that has to get to the senators that think  that this is all about immigration and it's not.  This is a very serious  problem.  Besides national security, you've got the very serious health  issues that face Americans.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  How much of this is all about resistance and trying to not give  President Trump a checkmark next to his campaign promise of building a  wall?  Is there a chance it's called something else and it still gets built  because Democrats have supported barriers in the past and there's money for  those barriers?  </p><p>WENSTRUP:  Yes.  Maybe if you make them think it was their idea, then  they'll go for it.  But this is all about posturing for so many people.   It's about politics and power.  And rather than doing what's best for  America and that's a shame in my opinion.</p><p>So maybe you do change it in some way, shape or form where they might feel  that it was their idea.  Sometimes you have to do that in negotiations to  get things done.  But in the meantime, I think you pretty much hit it.   This is about politics and power and not wanting to show that you are  willing to work with others.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen, she is at the  southern border today and tomorrow.  She's going to check this in Arizona.   Her trip comes in the wake of two deaths of young migrant children from  Guatemala that were detained by U.S. authorities.</p><p>Congressman, what needs to get done to build this wall, to secure the  President's funding, and also now to make sure that migrants are safe?  </p><p>WENSTRUP:  Well, I think in large part it's going to take the American  people to speak up loud and clear to all their representatives, especially  their senators as we sit here today, to let them know that they want this  done on behalf of their families and everything else.  The situation at the  border today with those deaths is extremely sad.</p><p>You know, you have people that are wanting to leave countries that are  borderless, that are lawless, and that are unhealthy.  And as a result, are  we seeing that America wants us to become that?  That they want us to -- do  we have people in America, senators that want us to be borderless, lawless  and unhealthy?</p><p>I don't think that that's the answer.  I don't think that's going to solve  the problem.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  A lot of the migrants coming in those caravans that are  basically stopped at our border say that they were lied to by the  organizers and the activists of the caravans who kind of encouraged them to  keep going, keep pushing closer to the U.S. border and then all of a sudden  they're not being let in.  They feel lied to.</p><p>But that's the new reality.</p><p>WENSTRUP:  Well, I'm sure that they -- </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  You can't just get in.  </p><p>WENSTRUP:  -- yes.  I'm sure that they do.  And shame on those that  supported them through this and then left them and abandoned them at their  greatest time of need.  It was a great deception.  And probably very  politically-motivated rather than actually caring for people.</p><p>And think about what could have been done with the funds that people put  into that caravan that maybe could have helped them even in their own  homeland rather than leaving them in the desperate situation that they're  in today.  Shame on them.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Let me ask you about this on the NAFTA front.  President Trump  is reportedly considering withdrawing from NAFTA in an attempt to pressure  Congress to approve his new trilateral trade deal with Mexico and Canada,  the USMCA.  As a lawmaker from Ohio, what is your reaction to this move?  </p><p>WENSTRUP:  Well, I'd like to see the process play out, you know.  I think  the President and his team negotiated openly and honestly with Canada and  with Mexico.  And we should play out the process of evaluating that deal  and deciding whether we approve it or not.</p><p>But I applaud them for the hard work that was put into that to try and get  a better deal for America.  And I hope we can play out that process without  there having to be political negotiations within our own country.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  How are steel and aluminum tariffs as a result of the trade  dispute with china affecting those in your district?  </p><p>WENSTRUP:  Well, it's been -- it's been somewhat mixed.  You know, the  industries that I talked to in our district that have been involved with  that said it really hasn't hurt them too much.  Obviously there have been  some changes but they would like to see things settled and move forward and  so we have some certainty of what lies ahead.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  And one final question on this shutdown.  I'm curious, you  know, in your view how long is this going to last and what do you think the  ultimate deal closer is?</p><p>The President wants a deal.  It doesn't seem Democrats do.  But what do you  think gets us that deal?  Is it an infrastructure bill?  Is it a deal for  DACA?  What is it?</p><p>WENSTRUP:  Well, you know, we've seen the President and Congress willing to  come forward with a DACA deal.  That would be fine with me if we want to  talk about those types of things that we've already put into bills in the  House of Representatives.</p><p>So bring it forward.  But I haven't seen much coming publicly from the  senate or even privately of what they want to talk about or what they may  want.  So that remains to be seen.</p><p>In the meantime, in the House of Representatives and the days remaining, we  have put forward what we suggest.  Let's hear something back because that's  how negotiations are supposed to work.</p><p>I wish I could give you a timeline and say it's definitely going to end at  a certain time but I don't know that.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  You sound pessimistic as do many of your colleagues.  </p><p>WENSTRUP:  Actually I'm an optimistic person.  I think at the end of the  day Americans are going to fine.  I'm more of a thank America first person  than blame America first.  But you know, our founders made the process  difficult.  And it can be.  And that's what we're in right now.</p><p>But at the end of the day we really need to sit down because I think the  public will get very tired of it and that usually will bring politicians to  the table.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  Congressman Brad Wenstrup -- thank you for coming  on this morning.  We appreciate it.  </p><p>WENSTRUP:  You bet.  Thank you very much.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.</p><p>Coming up, bitcoin's wild year -- how cryptocurrency dreams went bust and  what we can expect in the New Year.</p><p>Plus, Instagram says I'm sorry.  Users hating an update so much they did  away with it seconds later.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  A mystery hacker exposing the identities of North Korean  defectors.</p><p>Kristina Partsinevolos with the details -- Kristina.  </p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Lauren -- no  one is sure who stole the names, birthdays and addresses of nearly a  thousand North Korean defectors.  The information was taken from a  resettlement agency in South Korea and then leaked.  The center helps  provide people who have escaped oppression and poverty in North Korea with  jobs as well as medical and legal support. </p><p>North Korean hackers have been in the past accused of cyberattacks on South  Korean state agencies and businesses.  But it's unknown who is responsible  for this breach.</p><p>Former American Express CEO Ken Chenault announcing plans to step down from  the boards of IBM and Procter +ACY- Gamble in February.  The news  triggering speculation he might be named Facebook's first independent  chairman.  Chenault is a director at the company and Facebook says he will  continue to serve in that capacity.  Independent Facebook shareholders have  been pushing the company to break up Mark Zuckerberg's dual roles as CEO  and chairman.  Facebook shares though are higher ever so slightly in  premarket trading.</p><p>And Facebook, we're going to stick with that, said it fixed a bug on  Instagram yesterday that led to a temporary change in the appearance of its  feed for a large number of users.  The bug led to a small test being  distributed widely.  Some users had to tap and swipe their feeds  horizontally to view new posts, much like Tinder.  Similar also to the  stories feature. </p><p>The brief change sparked outrage on Twitter with many comparing it to  Snapchat's unpopular design.  I unfortunately missed out on that.  I'm  happy I didn't see it.  I don't know if it was really a bug or maybe  they're testing it out. </p><p>But Lauren -- I think you saw it.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I saw it.  I hated it, actually.  Now they know their answer --  nobody liked it.</p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Exactly -- get right of it.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  So whatever it was, don't do it.  Anyone else see it?  </p><p>TIMPF:  No.  </p><p>HARF:  If that was a trial balloon for them, that was a failure.  You're  right -- they got their answer.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Kat -- I feel like you're big on Instagram.  Am I wrong?</p><p>TIMPF:  Yes.  I'm big on Instagram but I didn't see this because I was on a  plane. </p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>TIMPF:  It was like the only hour of the world that I was not on Instagram  so I missed it.  I would have been outraged.  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Lucky you.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Coming up -- curving vaping.  The head of the FDA wants a  meeting with the e-cigarette executives to discuss the rise of teen vaping.</p><p>Plus take care of your selfie.  Why doctors are warning to watch for wrist  pain as they struggle to get the perfect shot.  Oh my goodness.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Cryptocurrency in the New Year.  After bitcoin took a huge dive  in 2018, all eyes are looking ahead to what happens in 2019.  One year ago,  bitcoin was at just over +ACQ-19,000.  Well today, its value has fallen to  just about +ACQ-3,600.</p><p>Let's bring in BLAKFX COO and EVP, Kara Coppa.  Thanks for coming on.</p><p>KARA COPPA, COO +ACY- EVP, BLAKFX:  Glad to be here.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I thought bitcoin was going to like -- what did John McAfee say  it's going to +ACQ-500,000 by 2020?  </p><p>COPPA:  Yes.  We all thought he was going crazy.  But I think the cyber  security issues were a big problem this year.  +ACQ-1 billion so far in  2018 were lost.  Biggest heist in world history in humanity.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  So how do we prevent something like that from happening in  2019.  </p><p>COPPA:  Cyber security.  So there's a lot of issues with block chain.  It  is a new technology.  BLAKFX has uncovered many issues.  We have 18-plus  patents pending to fix all those.  We have lots of solutions to fix all  those problems and make it more secure, ensure that your money stays that  way.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  What is the future of cryptocurrency?  You know, the appeal is  that it's anonymous and untraceable.  And if that's the case, then  governments can't tax it and federal banks can't control the ebb and flow  of currency so that they can't control inflation.</p><p>So it makes central banks and governments either insolvent or worthless  which governments are going to fight that.  So is cryptocurrency the  future?  Is it going to be a store of value or is it going to be a fiat  currency?  </p><p>COPPA:  Yes.  So I think we're working with the governments right now  especially in Malta, a block chain and helping them to create cyber  security regulations to ensure that there is no theft and to ensure that we  can move forward with this as a currency in the future.</p><p>I think that as we see more asset-backed tokens, them tokenizing buildings,  highways, sports teams -- right.  Fractionalizing different types of assets  so that other people can get involved.  It can go mainstream but it has to  be secure.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  But do you think -- I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to cut you off.  I  apologize -- Kara.  Do you think it will be a currency?  Do you think it  will be a currency that will be widespread or do you think it's just going  to be a store of value like gold?  </p><p>COPPA:  Yes.  I think 2019 we'll start to see governments come on-board and  launch their own cryptocurrencies.  Dubai for example by 2020, they will  have their entire -- their initiative is to have the entire government on  block chain.  </p><p>TIMPF:  That is a stunning goal that you talk about there.  Governments on  the other side are talking about some of the security problems not just  with theft but with terrorist organizations being able to use it, drug  traffickers, because it's anonymous, because it's untraceable.  How are  governments working on that piece of the security issue?  </p><p>COPPA:  Yes.  I think once you do make it secure then you don't have to  have it anonymous, right.  You can have governments part of that bigger  picture.  And when you bring in banks and governments into this cutting  edge technology, it goes a long way.</p><p>I think that's also another prediction that we'll see here in 2019.  We'll  see a lot of alliances.  So we'll see government sector coming in together,  different exchanges and cyber security companies coming together to make it  a much better -- a tighter technology.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  What is your best guess of which cryptocurrency makes it?  When  you talk about cryptocurrency -- I understand block chain is different,  these governments doing this, like you see in the Baltic States that's a  phenomenal thing for the government with the national IDs that they can do.</p><p>But as far as the cryptocurrencies -- bitcoin now, it costs more to mine it  than it does to actually make it.  Does Etheria make it?  Does bitcoin make  it?  Do you have a prediction as far as which cryptocurrency is going to  make it at least in 2019?  </p><p>COPPA:  Yes.  I don't.  I think that remains to be seen.  I think bitcoin  was a great proof of concept.  I think it will be around for a really long  time.  But it's more of a something collectible, if you will.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  It seems like it was such a fad but not enough places actually  accepted it.  </p><p>COPPA:  Another issue, right.  So you need to have common liquidity pools,  right.  If you can't move your money from fiat to crypto and move it into  e-commerce and be able to purchase something, it's really useless.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, what's the point of having it.</p><p>COPPA:  Exactly.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Ok.  So there will be a point of having it in 2019 or are we  looking more toward 2020?  It seems like big issues that you have to fix.  </p><p>COPPA:  Yes.  There are some major security issues but I think that, again,  BLAKFX has fixed many of those and we're building really tight, secure  solutions to license different companies and I think that will go a long  way in making a much more stable environment.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  Kara Coppa -- thank you so much for sharing that  with us.</p><p>COPPA:  Thank you.  Thank you very much.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  We'll see what happens.  </p><p>But we do want to get to this because the President has tweeted on the  southern border.  He writes, +ACI-We will be forced to close the southern  border entirely if the obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to  finish the wall and also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our  country is saddled with.  Hard to believe there was a Congress and  President who would approve.+ACI-  Ok.</p><p>Coming up, market volatility in focus.

Although, I wonder how many selfies you  would have to take to actually get selfie wrist.  I mean, there's some  people I think that's all they do, like Instagram influencers, all they do  is take selfies.  So maybe that's a hazard of the job.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, stay tuned because we'll find out how hazardous it really  is.  </p><p>All right, let's talk Wall Street because stocks are looking to open higher  this morning, continuing the rally that we saw over the past two days,  after a late comeback on Wall Street.  </p><p>Joining me now, Wells Fargo senior global equity strategist, Scott Ren.   Hi, Scott.</p><p>SCOTT WREN, SENIOR GLOBAL EQUITY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO:  Good morning,  Lauren.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  This volatility is starting (INAUDIBLE) to feel a little bit  boring or prosaic.  What's with these moves every day?  </p><p>WREN:  Well, you know, I think you can boil it down to just a couple  events.  One is, and we've been talking to clients about this all year.  Is  the Fed going to make a mistake and is global growth going to slow down?   Now, there's a lot of underlying moving parts, whether it's trade friction,  whether it's Brexit, whether -- you know, it's a shutdown, whatever.  But  the issues that overall are really pushing this market and have struck fear  into some investors is Fed mistake and global slowdown.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  A lot of people say if they reinstate the uptick rule,  especially when stocks are selling off in a big way and failure to have  that rule compounds the losses, that reinstating it could smooth out some  of this volatility especially when the algorithms and the computers are  involved, your thoughts.  </p><p>WREN:  Well, it could.  And you know, there's a lot of -- you know, a lot  of people that are talking about algorithmic trading right now which  clearly -- I mean, that's a decent amount of the volume.  But really, when  you look at it over the last year and-a-half, you know, just your good old  fashioned trend lines, technical analysis, there's a lot of activity around  those levels and really when you watch it trade around these various  levels, I mean, it's just good old fashioned technical trading, whether  it's algorithmic or not.  </p><p>So, I think obviously that pushes a lot of volume.  There -- you know,  you're quicker on the trigger in those kinds of things.  There is an effect  on the market.  </p><p>But, you know, for us, I mean, it comes down to fundamentals, are the  forward fundamentals good or bad?  And for us, you know, we think we'll see  good GDP growth, not great, but good GDP growth here, decent growth abroad,  not much inflation and from these valuation levels, stocks look pretty  attractive.  </p><p>And you know, this cycle, there's been a lot of things that were not  typical in this -- in this cycle.  But as you move into these later stages,  the final third of the cycle, you know, things like inflation, Fed raising  rates, tight labor market, global growth, those are concerns that happen  later stages of every cycle that causes volatility to increase.  So, I  would argue that's not all that common.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Scott, is there inflation, though?  </p><p>WREN:  I'm sorry, Lauren?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Is there inflation though?  I mean, you can argue that there's  deflation right now.  </p><p>WREN:  Well, there's not.  You know, yes, there's really not.  I mean,  that's one thing that is a factor here is inflation, there doesn't seem to  be much inflation pressure.  We certainly don't expect any but one could  argue certainly that the Fed and what they've hinted at their rate hikes,  they're afraid of inflation, which is seems kind of odd to -- odd to us.   But not much inflation, decent growth, valuations from here look pretty  good.  </p><p>So, for us, I mean, we want our clients in stocks, we want them stepping in  here.  Easier said than done though for retail investors.  </p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Scott, the last couple of days, you  had the Christmas Eve selloff and you had money step in.  Didn't seem like  to be a technical reaction, seemed to be like money was actually stepping  in.  And now, at that point, you can have that exacerbated some by the  algorithms that are going forward.  But yesterday, also, you had selloff,  you had money step in.  Is this to you a bear market bounce or is this very  bullish, a bullish signal that money is stepping in, trying to find value?  </p><p>WREN:  Well, for us, you know, I would argue that Monday had a real panic  capitulation type of feel to it.  I mean, we closed on the absolute lows.   We closed right above a big trend line that comes in from the 2011 low in  the S&amp;P 500.  So, I think on Wednesday we saw a massive short covering  rally.  Because let's face it, this move-down happened fast.  There were a  lot of people that jumped on the down train way too late.  And so, we saw a  big scramble there.  </p><p>And really, yesterday was an ideal trading day.  You know, we would have  liked to have -- to have seen really what happened yesterday, we thought  OK, we're going to cough up a little bit of this early, maybe 200, 300  points in the Dow and then to finish positive on the day would have been a  good technical indicator that this bottom's in place or we're awful close  to it and really being down 600 points plus in the Dow and rallying back  and really in the last hour and-a-half and closing positive, if you're a  trader, that's a pretty good sign.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Scott, it's been almost 50 years since you've had consumers --  companies come in with 10 percent plus earnings and have a pullback like  we've had, '87 you had this, 2011 you had this.  Is this an aberration of  the market or is this more of the political uncertainty that's going on out  there, rather than just the Fed and the slowdown that's coming?  </p><p>WREN:  Well, political uncertainty is playing into it.  But I would say,  you know, there's very partial, very, very partial shutdown, I don't think  that's all that big of a factor.  The bigger factor are these macro issues  and what's typically happening late in a cycle.  You know, is the ECB going  to start to tighten which I'm not sure why they'd want to do that but are  they going to start to tighten?  You know, is the Fed going to go through  with two hikes next year and you know, one in 2020?  Those are the kind of  questions that are going to drive the market or the answers to those  questions are going to drive the market over the next year.  That's what  we're trying to figure out.  What we think we're going to see some decent  global growth.  That needs to happen for us to reach our earnings  expectations and for the market to work its way higher.  But we're looking  for good returns here in 2019 and really I think that's what's likely to  happen.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Many people blame the Fed and Jay Powell for scaring the  market.  It was October 3rd, actually, which was the start of this downturn  that we've seen and I know Kevin Hassett tried to tell everybody and calm  the markets.  Powell is absolutely 100 percent safe at the Fed.  And we  didn't move up a little bit on that.  And now, there's talk of a sit-down  between Jay Powell and President Trump.  </p><p>So, my thoughts are, A, how much do you think this selloff that we've seen,  not this week but the selloff in general is the Fed?  And B, what is a  meeting going to do?  </p><p>WREN:  Well, we think quite a bit of it is the Fed or fear about what the  Fed is going to do.  Now, the meeting -- you know, the president's entitled  to his opinion and clearly President Trump is going to state his opinion  when he has one.  But as Jay Powell said and we firmly believe, I mean, the  Fed is not looking at what the president might be saying or anyone else  might be saying when they make their decisions and do presidents meet with  Fed chairs?  Yes, they do.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Privately.  </p><p>WREN:  And you know -- yes, that's true, privately.  And I think that's a  good -- you know, I think that's a good idea.  I mean, they should be in  contact frequently.  </p><p>But the Fed is an independent organization.  I think there's been -- it's  been blown way out of proportion to think that the Fed is going to be  influenced by not just the president's opinion, they certainly hear it, but  by any political opinions.  I mean, that's not what -- these guys are  trying to do the best job they can do, given the conditions that they see.   And it's a tough job.  You're trying to fine-tune a $20 trillion economy.   It's not easy.  But you know, it's our firm belief the Fed is independent.  </p><p>Now, whether they make a mistake or not, that's a whole different question.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Right.</p><p>WREN:  But I don't think they're going to be influenced by the -- by the  president.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  They're also orchestrating quantitative tightening at this  point.  So, there's a lot going on.  But the Fed doesn't seem too worried  about the health of the economy, nor does the White House, even though the  market does.  And yet we've got -- </p><p>WREN:  I mean, we're not -- you know, we're not -- you know, Lauren, our  number is 2.7 for 2019.  So is that going than -- is that going to be  slower than this year?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  A little bit.  </p><p>WREN:  Yes, I mean, it is.  You know, I think the Fed's too low at least  based on our analysis at 2.3.  So, we're a little more optimistic than  that.  And you know, that's good growth, it's not great growth but it's  certainly good.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, but consumers aren't.  We've got a measure of consumer  confidence yesterday, down for the second month in a row, it dropped about  eight points.  What are we so worried about?  </p><p>WREN:  Well, what I think people are any -- we've had good consumer  confidence readings, clearly this Christmas shopping season was really,  really good.  So, a lot of times what consumers say and what they do are  two different things.  And I think that's what you're seeing right now.   Consumers are starting to open up their statements and they see what  happened to their 401(k) balances over the course of the last few months.   They're not happy about that.  So I think that has some influence.  But  really when you're talking sub four percent unemployment -- you know, it's  tough for consumers to be too down when you're seeing those kind of  conditions.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  But then you look at Capitol Hill and it's like the lights are  off, Scott, so.  </p><p>WREN:  It is.  It is.  So there's a lot going on.  But I think for what we  want our clients to focus on is that we're going to have good growth, we're  going to have modest inflation, valuations are not stretched and this  expansion still has some legs in it.  We think there's a low probability of  a recession over the next 12 to 15 months.  So, you know, we want our  clients invested because we think we're going to see higher highs before  things over.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, take a chill pill then.  Happy New Year Scott Wren, thank  you for joining us.  </p><p>WREN:  All right, same to you guys.  Thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  What's going on this volatile market?</p><p>All right, coming up, Ryan Reynolds charmed audiences as \"Dead Pool\" twice  this year.  But he isn't the most bankable celebrity of 2018.  We're going  to tell you who is.  </p><p>Plus, a selfie could actually be a hazard to your health.  The new warning  from doctors over getting wrist pain while taking the perfect snapshot.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The Food and Drug Administration stepping up its fight against  what it calls an epidemic of teen vaping.  Kristina Partsinevelos has the  details.  An epidemic, Kristina.  </p><p>KRISTINA PARTSINEVELOS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT:  Yes, it is an  epidemic.  Because the FDA commissioner right now Scott Gottlieb says he  will meet soon with the heads of e-cigarette companies to discuss their  commitments to address this problem.  The FDA has been cracking down on e- cig sales to minors, announcing a proposal last month to restrict the sale  of most flavored e-cigs which are popular among teenagers.  The surgeon  general is calling for more steps to fight teen vaping including higher  taxes and bans on smoking e-cigarettes indoors.  </p><p>The creator of the wildly popular video game Fortnite epic games said the  game made $3 billion in profits this year and amassed 200 million players  since its fall 2017 debut.  Even though the game is free.  The revenue  comes from players who make in-game purchases and new numbers show iPhone  users alone were spending more than a million dollars every day on Fortnite  purchases.  Nearly $40 million a month.  Thanks to Fortnite's success,  privately held Epic Games valuation in September was about $15 billion.  </p><p>And one San Francisco doctor is warning of a new injury.  Wait for this.   Caused by taking too many selfies.  It's being called selfie wrist and can  result in a numbing and tingling sensation experienced in the wrist and  fingers.  The doctor is seeing this condition more often and says it's a  form of carpal tunnel syndrome.  And because we have to -- you know, go to  the stars for real news, Kim Kardashian-West has been told by doctors to  dial back the selfie-taking.  She's been diagnosed with selfie wrist.  But  an update on this too is that Kim Kardashian says that she's no longer  taking selfies because she published a selfie book and now she wants to  live in the real world.  Lauren, I'm more concerned about the posture thing  because people are always on the phones like this.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Let me pick my jaw back up, OK.  I always thought Kim  Kardashian had someone taking her pictures.</p><p>TIMPF:  She had -- yes, she has people to do that for her, right?  </p><p>HARF:  To take her selfies, yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  When was the last time you guys took a selfie?  </p><p>HARF:  This morning.  </p><p>TIMPF:  This morning.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Really?  </p><p>TIMPF:  Just a few hours ago.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I don't take selfies.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I'm a 52-year-old male.  You're not -- you're not allowed to  take selfies.  </p><p>TIMPF:  Sure you are.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Absolutely not.  </p><p>HARF:  Love yourself.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  You could get paid a lot of money for being an influencer on  Instagram.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Good Lord, I think it's a -- I think it's a -- it's a phobia.   There's some problem with people who just take --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I know.</p><p>TIMPF:  Take a picture with your flat tummy t, there you go.</p><p>HARF:  It also hurts your eyes.  Like that' a real -- I was reading this  story about how people now have to go to the eye doctor more because of the  screens and the computers are doing real damage to your eyes.  So put it  down, people.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I get concerned about the younger generation who will only know  selfies and social media and kind of evaluating themselves in that -- </p><p>TIMPF:  Based on likes.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Based on likes and (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>HARF:  And in comparison to people, right, whose lives look so perfect  online.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  My daughter is three, and she said mommy let me see the  picture.  She catches me taking a picture of her.  I just, no, I took it.   Don't worry about what it looks like.  You look fine.  What a worrisome.</p><p>HARF:  I think holidays without cell phones, I'm really into this right  now, putting your phone away for like Christmas dinner.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  That's a trend.</p><p>HARF:  It's a trend.  And people are doing it and people are saying the  holidays are much better.  You don't have to document every part of your  meal at Christmas, it's OK.  </p><p>TIMPF:  How am I going to play words with friends?  </p><p>HARF:  Well, that's a different issue, I think.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Any thoughts on the teen vaping story?  </p><p>TIMPF:  I'm a big vapor.  I love vaping.  Vaping is my life.  Vape life for  life.  And I am disturbed that we can't sell mango pods for JUUL in the  stores anymore because of the teens.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  That was your flavor?  </p><p>TIMPF:  It is my flavor.  And I'm still purchasing them online.  But I know  it's not good for me but I thought this was a free country.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Right.</p><p>TIMPF:  You know, if I want to have a little nicotine buzz all day long  then -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  So, what prevents you -- like a teenager from buying them  online also?  </p><p>TIMPF:  I think that you have to -- you have to do age verification.  But I  think it probably will be easie r --  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  When they deliver them?</p><p>TIMPF:  No, I think they're going to setup some sort of age verification  system online.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  OK.</p><p>TIMPF:  We get a code and (INAUDIBLE) that's going to be happening.</p><p>HARF:  But also maybe when they deliver with alcohol.  When they deliver  you have to show that you're over 21.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Right, that's what I was thinking.</p><p>HARF:  And also that you're not drunk when you sign for alcohol, seriously.   True story.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  The local New York gullies don't do that.  </p><p>HARF:  That's true -- that's true.  Maybe in Washington it's different.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Coming up, a different sort of dynamic duo.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  He's the master of disguise.  </p><p>JOHN C. REILLY, ACTOR AS JOHN WATSON:  What have you done with Sherlock?  </p><p>WILL FERRELL, ACTOR AS SHERLOCK HOLMES:  Why Watson, I never left.  </p><p>REILLY:  Amazing.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, they laughed.  Reviews are in for the new flick, \"Holmes  and Watson\".  And we are going to tell you why critics say the mystery  missed out and folks left the theater.  Coming up.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REILLY:  Your majesty.</p><p>FERRELL:  Would you mind if we had a picture together, Watson.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Who's going to take the photograph?  </p><p>REILLY:  I will take it.  You see, it's sort of a self photograph.  </p><p>FERRELL:  He's a real fan.  </p><p>REILLY:  I swear, I never do this.  Hi, girl.  </p><p>FERRELL:  Hi, girl.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  You're watching a clip from the new movie, \"Holmes and Watson\",  starring step brothers Will Ferrell and John C. Riley.  But the film opened  on Christmas day to scathing reviews.  People actually walked out of the  theater.  Some critics are calling this the worst film of 2018.  He's  laughing.  \"IN THE FOXLIGHT\" host, Michael Tammero. </p><p>MICHAEL TAMMERO, FOX NEWS CHANNEL HOST AND VP FOR MARKETING:  So bad, you  just have to laugh.  You know --</p><p>SIMONETTI:  You have to leave.  So bad you got to leave.</p><p>TAMMERO:  Leave, which is what a lot of people are doing with this movie  which opened up on Christmas day.  When they don't screen the movie to  critics before it opens, it's generally a sign that the movie is a stinker.   This movie has the dignity of having zero percent on rotten tomatoes which  makes it utterly rotten, thoroughly terrible.  It will be lucky if it gets  10 to $16 million at the Box Office.  So, not a great way to end a  fantastic year at the Box Office.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  It was a record year.  But first, let's talk about some  bankable stars this year.  We were talking about Will Ferrell in a -- in  that movie.  He's among the year's top 25 most bankable stars, he's number  20 on 24/7 Wall Street's newest list.  Let's show you some of the others.   The top three here are Will Smith, grosses $132 million.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Yes, did not have a movie this year which is sort of surprising.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I know.</p><p>TAMMERO:  Followed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks.  None of them had  movies this year.  I mean, so what they did with this one is they looked at  -- they sampled 2,000 actors.  They all had to have at least five leading  actor credits and at least three or two movies that grossed over $100  million.  </p><p>So, Will Smith had 30 roles and his average Box Office is about $132  million which makes him the top most bankable star of 2018 apparently.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Wow.</p><p>TAMMERO:  At the bottom I find really interesting is Ryan Reynolds came in  last.  He's only had 16 roles.  It sort of makes sense.  \"Dead Pool\" was  his top grossing movie and his average Box Office is about $73 million.  So  a few more \"Dead Pool\" movies which are probably in the offing will pull  him up into that list.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right, this was a fantastic year for the movies.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Fantastic.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  People were actually going.  It wasn;t just sold, ticket prices  go up so they're pulling in the revenue but attendance was up too.  What  were the final numbers?  </p><p>TAMMERO:  That's the big takeaway this year.  Look, if you build it, they  will come.  Right out of the gate, in 2018 with \"Black Panther\", that was a  huge, huge Box Office hit.  And \"Aquaman\", to end the year on a big note,  $11.5 billion, the biggest Box Office in American history, over $41 billion  worldwide and the driver for that was the domestic Box Office.  </p><p>Now, all you hear about is China, China, China and the overseas market.   This year the American Box Office really led the way.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  What's the number we're looking at for global Box Office for  this year?  </p><p>TAMMERO:  $41 billion, yes.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, and that would be a record.  \"A Star is Born\", hello.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  \"A Star is Born\", hello.  And look, you know, and \"Vice\" is  another one that's probably going to do really well this weekend.  It  starts with Golden Globes -- it leads the Golden Globes nominations with  six.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Dick Cheney movie.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Yes, Dick Cheney movie.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  OK.</p><p>TAMMERO:  Not my fave of the year.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Really?</p><p>TAMMERO:  Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  What was -- what didn't you like about it?</p><p>TAMMERO:  It's just you have to have a real -- you have to have sort of  know the historical context to know the story.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  A niche audience?  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Yes.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  What's coming out there looking forward to in 2019?  </p><p>TAMMERO:  You know, Disney has been doing a lot of this live action movies,  taking animated films and turning them into live action.  \"Dumbo\" it comes  out this year.  It looks really good.  The trailer broke my heart.  So they  have three of those coming out this year.  Including \"Aladdin\" with Will  Smith, hello.  Which will -- you know, something to look forward to and the  last and final \"Star Wars\" movie, next December.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  The final one?  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Of the -- of the Skywalker trilogy.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  So, they're bringing it back for December because this December  we like to (INAUDIBLE) \"Star Wars\" which was a big deal.</p><p>TAMMERO:  We didn't have one, there was two this year -- there was two this  year.  And one did not do so well.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  That's true.</p><p>TAMMERO:  So, they gave us a break.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  To more movies in the New Year.  Michael Tammero, thank you  very much.  </p><p>TAMMERO:  Absolutely, good to see you, Lauren.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Good to see you as well.</p><p>Still ahead, the storm front, what a blizzard warning means for your  morning commute and a holiday weekend, are we getting snowed in when the  ball drops?

You don't have any time,  girl, you're busy today.  All right.  Good morning, everybody, I am Lauren  Simonetti in for Maria Bartiromo.  It is Friday, December 28th, here are  you top stories at 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time.  </p><p>Wall Street is looking to extend gains to day number three, Futures this  morning sharply higher, Dow gaining a hundred and twenty-three, half of one  percent, similar percentage gains across the board, this after a roller  coaster session for the markets yesterday.  Get this, the Dow swung more  than 850 points during the session, finishing higher more than one percent.   The S&amp;P 500 picking up nearly one percent, the NASDAQ tacking on just over  a third of one percent.  </p><p>Council of Economic Advisers Chairman, Kevin Hassett, saying the President  is happy with the economy going into the end of the year. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>KEVIN HASSETT, COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS CHAIRMAN:  I think the  President thinks that the economy the -- is doing well, that the economic  fundamentals are sound, and I think he's very pleased to see that the  markets are moving back to sort of where they belong given the  fundamentals. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Seeing follow-through in Europe, gains across the board, 1.8  percent to the upside for all three markets on your screen.  Asian markets  mostly higher as well.  The Nikkei, the outlier here, it is down a third of  one percent, and negative for the first time on a year in seven years.  </p><p>Well, day number seven of the government shutdown in Washington and it does  not look like it will end before the New Year.  Meanwhile, a new poll shows  more Americans blaming President Trump for the government shutdown.  We're  going to break it all down for you.  </p><p>Then outside, there is some wicked weather, millions of Americans hit by  blizzard conditions and we'll tell you where this storm is heading next.   Plus, did you look outside?  Blue skies at night in New York.  We have the  details on what exactly what happened and more of this pretty incredible  yet beautiful video.  Aliens?  Maybe.  All right.  It's deadline day for  Sears, the struggling retailer has until the end of today to find a bidder  for its assets or it could disappear entirely.  </p><p>All of that coming up with me and this morning, we also have FOX News  Contributor and \"GREG GUTFELD SHOW\" Correspondent, and National Review  Reporter, that is one big title, Kat Timpf, in white, Beyond Sport Global  Ambassador and FOX News Contributor, John Layfield, and Former State  Department Spokesperson and Co-host of \"BENSON &amp; HARF\" on FOX News Radio,  Marie Harf.  Happy Friday. </p><p>KAT TIMPF, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Happy Friday. </p><p>MARIE HARF, FOX NEWS RADIO HOST:  Happy Friday.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  What a strange week.  </p><p>HARF:  Yes.  I mean what a way to end the year.  So many ups and downs and  it just feels like the news hasn't stopped at all. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I know.  Are we ending the year up or down, though?  What do  you guys think?  </p><p>TIMPF:  I have no -- both.  </p><p>HARF:  It's a roller coaster.  </p><p>JOHN LAYFIELD, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  Yes, I think both -- I think is safe  to say. </p><p>HARF:  Yes.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I think everybody is going to need a glass of champagne on New  Year's Eve, right?  Or -- </p><p>TIMPF:  At least one.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Or just a shot of whiskey.  </p><p>HARF:  Just one.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Only (INAUDIBLE) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  And just -- and then you just see that veteran then you can  live to a hundred and twelve years old.  That lives a hundred and twelve -- </p><p>TIMPF:  Exactly.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  That's right.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  - by smoking cigars and drinking whiskey.  Anyway, all right.   Also coming up this morning, Wells Fargo Investment Institute Senior Global  Equity strategist, Scott Wren, Ohio Congressman, House Ways and Means  Committee member and Iraq War Veteran, Brad Wenstrup, former CKE Restaurant  CEO and Former Labor Secretary Nominee, Andy Puzder, and Texas Congressman,  Medical Doctor, and member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee,  Michael Burgess.  You don't want to miss it, and we're -- we got a lot to  discuss and we're going to start with our top story this hour, and that is  the market.  </p><p>Once again, front and center, but it's a good day today or at least it's  shaping up to be after a wild day of trading on Wall Street.  Yesterday,  the Dow staging a late comeback, swinging more than 850 points from high to  low, and that's been what we've seen the past six sessions.  We've seen one  percent plus moves in both directions for the Dow Jones Industrial Average,  let's talk about it and bring in the founder, CEO, and Chief Investment  Strategist at Mainstay Capital Management, David Kudla.  David, good  morning. </p><p>DAVID KUDLA, CEO, MAINSTAY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT:  Good morning, Lauren. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  What do you make of the volatility? </p><p>KUDLA:  Well, it has been quite extreme in the past week, in the past  month, and really the past quarter.  It is what we expect now going into  2019.  We had it very nice in 2017, the first part of 2018, but we've seen  extreme volatility pick up through all of this year and this is what we  need to expect more of.  And a lot of it is because there's this confusion  or maybe a seeking of what is the economic outlook for next year.  </p><p>We had as little as a month and a half ago people thinking that the -- we - - the Federal Reserve might hike four, five -- even five times next year.   That went down to maybe a couple of times.  Now the Fed Futures prediction  of how much the Fed will raise next year is showing us that they wouldn't  raise at all.  But the Fed dot plot, their own forecast, shows two raises  and those that think that we're headed for recession.  So, we have this  very divergent view about the economy -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>KUDLA:  And that is causing a lot of volatilities as we move between those  different views. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  It's true.  Wall Street thinks one thing, they are  suspecting or predicting a sharp slowdown in the New Year.  And Main Street  might think the opposite.  Kevin Hassett was on after the bell yesterday,  and he said, you know, Wall Street does engage all the momentum that we're  seeing.  In the economy, small businesses are not part of Wall Street and  they're doing great right now. </p><p>KUDLA:  Yes.  If you -- if we look at the consumer, which is two-thirds of  our economy and just look at the holiday spending season, look at the  fourth quarter, we look at November retail sales, October revised higher,  the -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>KUDLA:  -- holiday shopping season from November 1st through December 24th,  best in six years. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  </p><p>KUDLA:  Amazon having record sales.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  But consumer confidence was down two months in a row.  Sorry to  interrupt you, David, but we do have that number, that it fell two months  in a row.  What do you make of that?</p><p>KUDLA:  Well, that's a lagging indicator and a lot of that is a result of  what's happened in the stock market over the past quarter.  And so we'll  see some of those -- the soft data like that will soften as the wealth  effect or lack thereof, kicks in of what the stock market's been doing.   But, you know, we're looking at two to two and a half percent growth next  year, not a recession. </p><p>Unemployment, it's still near a 49-year low, and, you know, we just don't  think a recession is right around the corner, we think the economy is still  doing quite well.  I think the biggest thing for the stock market is where  do corporate earnings really come in?  We think that we can still get eight  or nine percent earnings growth in the fourth quarter, but -- or in the --  throughout 2019, but there are those that think that earnings are going to  fall off a cliff. </p><p>If that's the case, we have trouble.  If earnings, you know, we can't match  the record earnings that we had in 2018, but if we get decent earnings in  2019, just eight or nine percent, we don't even need multiple expansion, we  can do OK.  Stocks can do OK through 2019. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  David, if you go from say 20 percent right now in corporate  earnings to about eight or nine percent, I think the estimate right now,  consensus is around seven percent, so eight or nine would be a little bit  higher than that, that is not falling off a cliff, as you say, but that  doesn't pretend itself to the volatility that we've seen.  Is this  volatility really on different views of the economy?  And what's going to  happen next year or is it about the things the market can't control like  Brexit, like this trade warm and so many things that's going on with these  capricious politicians we have around the globe? </p><p>KUDLA:  Yes, it -- you know, when we look at -- when we look abroad, when  we look at Europe, whether it's yellow vest in France, whether it's Brexit,  the problems in England, whether it's Italy arguing with the E.U. about  future, you know, Europe has a lot of problems and we're avoiding Europe.   We have this year for the last three quarters and will be going into 2019  because of the problems there, we're staying with U.S. stocks, we're  starting to look at emerging markets but, yes, that's -- </p><p>You know, we do have a lot of anxiety indigestion for the markets that's  coming from D.C.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>KUDLA:  And recently, the China-U.S. trade issues are a concern because  that's where government action does affect real economies, and affects the  stock market, so how that all works itself out in the New Year will  definitely matter.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.</p><p>KUDLA:  But, you know, it is -- we look -- as we look further into the  year, you know, it'll be a function of how -- when do we get into the first  quarter?  What do those corporate earnings start to look like?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  David, the Wall Street Journal is out with the story titled  \"The Investment That Cost Apple $9 billion in 2018 and it references the  effect, market prices have had on company's decisions to buy back their  stocks, specifically Apple. </p><p>Buy backs have helped support the market.  Do you think we're going to see  companies then buying this dip? </p><p>KUDLA:  We've seen a little bit of that, you know.  The funny thing about  stock buybacks by corporations is they tend to buy high and that's not  because they don't know when to buy stocks, it's more a function of the  reason or their -- or their ability to buy -- to initiate those buybacks,  it's typically when the economy is doing well, when the company is doing  well because they're buying that with a free cash flow so they tend to  initiate more stock buybacks during good economic times when they high  revenue, high profits, high free cash flow.  So, they tend to be buying  high, not buying low. </p><p>There have been some companies step in with stock prices lowered and  initiate stock buyback programs here late in the year.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>KUDLA:  But, you know, if we do see more of an economic slowdown next year,  we could see that.  This year with the Corporate Tax Reform and the strong  economy, we had over one trillion, a new record, in stock buybacks in 2018. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Are you concerned at all about companies and the amount of cash  that they're holding and also we saw the Steven Mnuchin, the now infamous  call to the banks earlier this week, considered their about ability to  lend, are you -- are you concerned about any of these things? </p><p>KUDLA:  No, you know, a lot of us were left scratching our heads why that  letter was sent out, why those calls were made to the bank.  There wasn't a  concern about liquidity.  We think that was a reason for some of the market  volatility on Monday, on Christmas Eve, because that probably wasn't needed  and what we've seen though is maybe a sturdier hand now.  I think the more  amicable tone of President Trump towards Jay Powell at the Fed -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  </p><p>KUDLA:  -- comments that -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, do you think there's a face-to-face meeting between the  President and Jay Powell?  Because that's what's been reported as a  possible.  Would that help the market's sentiment right now? </p><p>KUDLA:  I think it absolutely would.  And they say it's going to happen, I  hope it happens because, you know, the fact that they're just meeting face- to-face and talking will be better than comments over Twitter and however  else because -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  </p><p>KUDLA:  -- it's not doing the markets any good. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  So the theme of 2019 then is going to be talking, whether it's  Trump and Powell, or Trump and President Xi of China, just talking will get  these markets to go up, I suppose.  David Kudla, thank you so much for  joining us on this Friday. </p><p>KUDLA:  Thank you.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  Coming up, a wicked winter storm pushing its way to  the east, how millions of Americans in the path will be affected this  weekend and it's not aliens.  The internet going crazy over these  mysterious blue lights above New York City, we're going to tell you what  caused the sky to light up.  Is that blue or green?  Blue green?  </p><p>TIMPF:  Blue.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Teal?  Blue?  OK.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Markets still up with about three hours before the opening  bell, but we have half the gains that we saw earlier, Dow Futures higher by  66 points.  They were up about a hundred and forty just moments ago.  The  byline right now on the Wall Street Journal, Blue Chips log a record  rebound yesterday after the week's biggest point in gain the day before, so  volatility is the name of the game.  We'll see.  </p><p>Speaking of extreme, it's outside, too.  We're watching the weather for you  this morning.  The Midwest taking hit by heavy snow while the East Coast is  gearing up for flash floods.  FOX News Meteorologist, Adam Klotz, live in  the weather center with the bad news.  Good morning, Adam. </p><p>ADAM KLOTZ, FOX NEWS METEOROLOGIST:  Hey there, good morning, Lauren.  You  know what, it's that same snow system that's bringing all the heavy rain  now to portions of the east.  The East Coast and South East (INAUDIBLE)  already stretching all the way back actually to New Orleans up through  Atlanta and then all its way up to New York in the next couple of hours.   Now the backside of this system is still producing a little bit of snow,  enough snow that we still have some blizzard watches warnings, winter  advisory stretching across portions of the Upper Midwest, this is going to  be kind of moving out of the area within the next couple of hours so really  winding down.  </p><p>The worst of the snow in this area has moved off and it becomes more of a  rain event.  This entire system is running into some very warm air.  You'll  see it here in our future radar and you can pay attention to the timestamp  kind of back behind my head, but it runs up throughout the day here on  Friday and early Saturday morning, rain eventually heavy at times  stretching from D.C. up to New York, up to Boston, colder air on the  backside of this, but you noticed it was all just that heavy rain.   Wouldn't be a surprise if there was some flooding especially in the  southeast with this.  </p><p>We've already seen a couple of inches of rain in Atlanta here early this  morning.  But all this moisture is running into some very warm air.  Again,  cold on the backside so where it's snowing, temperatures are still back  down into the 20's, you get far enough behind it, and you see some spots  down into single digits, but currently on the East Coast, it is well above  our seasonal averages, as you're looking at 56 degrees here in New York  City, 70 degrees in Raleigh.  This continues.  It stays warm throughout the  entire day here on Friday, warm into Saturday. </p><p>Now there is cold air behind the system, so once this moves off coast, it  cools down a little bit for us on Friday -- or on Sunday, excuse me, but  then we warm back up on Monday and Tuesday, which means by the time we get  into the New Year or close to the New Year, New Year's Eve, 47 degrees is  the high there for New Year's Eve.  It -- actually, by the time the ball  drops, it'll only be down close to 40 degrees.  </p><p>So, Lauren, it is going to be a mild start to this New Year even though  we're talking about a big snowstorm in the middle of the country. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  And if you're in Times Square, that's a lot of people probably  going to, you know, enjoy the nice weather. </p><p>KLOTZ:  Yes.  It was like -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>KLOTZ:  -- negative four last year, so this is better. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Oh.  That's right.  </p><p>KLOTZ:  Yes.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Adam, thank you. </p><p>KLOTZ:  Uh-hmm.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Kat Timpf, you plan to spend New Year's right in Times Square,  right?  </p><p>TIMPF:  Not this year, no.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  What are you guys doing?  </p><p>TIMPF:  I did last year when it was below zero for FOX and I couldn't feel  my feet.  Richard Fowler had to kind of drag me back to the van because I  couldn't walk.  It was so cold.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  It was crazy.  Yes.  </p><p>TIMPF:  Yes, it was nuts.  What about you?  What are you doing for New  Year's?  </p><p>HARF:  I'm going to Northern New Hampshire, so it's going to be very cold  and I hope a lot of snow. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  And you're headed south, sort of?  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I'm headed south to see my dad today and then come back to D.C.  for New Year's Eve.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  I can't believe.  This is, like, it.  Monday is New Year's Eve. </p><p>HARF:  I know.  I can't.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Wow.  It always happens so fast.  </p><p>HARF:  2019 is here.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  It's been a full year, a wild year, especially on Wall Street.   Maria Bartiromo is going to wrap up the highs and the lows of the year in  business for us in just a bit.  Plus it is deadline day for Sears.  The  retailer is bankrupt, it needs to find a buyer for its assets by the end of  the day today or face liquidation.  They'll sell the -- </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Roller coaster year for business.  Maria Bartiromo takes a look  back at the highs and lows of 2018. </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>MARIA BARTIROMO, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR:  The year in business will  likely go down, remembered mostly of how it's ending, with head-spinning  moves in the stock market and uncertainty gripping the globe.  The stock  market rocked with wild moves up and down, but sadly for investors, it's  been more down than up. </p><p>In Europe, Brexit on the brink. </p><p>THERESA MAY, PRIME MINISTER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM:  I continue to believe  that we can leave with a good deal and that is it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Paris in pieces.  Citizens rioting over a new gas tax designed  to curve carbon emissions, all this as America's economy is humming in ways  not seen in years.  The President's tax plan kicking in January 1st,  helping to send second quarter GDP north of four percent, and the  unemployment rate all the way down to 3.7 percent. </p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, UNITED STATES TREASURY SECRETARY:  The fact that a business  can write off 100 percent of an investment is an enormous incentive to get  people to make capital investment and that capital investment creates more  jobs.  </p><p>LARRY KUDLOW, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL:  Blue-collar workers  having their best increase in many, many years.  The American economy is  crushing it. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  But the euphoria faded by midyear as the President's America  First Policy meant renegotiating old trade deals.  President Trump telling  me in April that the United States will not back down until it has better  terms with the rest of the world, notably China. </p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We're going -- </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Are you going to back down on the tariffs against China? </p><p>TRUMP:  No, no, no.  No.  China wants to make a deal and so do I, but it's  got to be fair deal for this country.  </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The administration calling out China over I.P. theft, the  forced transfer of technology, spying on Americans and lopsided  protectionist tariffs.  But while doing so, global growth worries  persisted.  President Trump also calling out his own Federal Reserve  Chairman for raising interest rates. </p><p>TRUMP:  I think the Fed is making a mistake.  They're so tight.  I think  the Fed has gone crazy. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  Higher rates and the China tensions roiling the equity markets  by years end with a big hit in the fourth quarter.  The business world also  still roiled by the Me Too Movement, including media mogul Les Moonves of  CBS, fired and deprived of a massive severance package after an  investigation uncover years of alleged sexual harassment.  </p><p>It was also a year of big challenges for big tech. </p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, CEO, FACEBOOK:  We didn't take a broad enough view of our  responsibility.  It was my mistake and I'm sorry. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica data scandal revealed that  Cambridge Analytica took the personal data of millions of people's  Facebook's profiles without their consent.  And it was used for political  purposes.  Facebook stock taking a beating and others such as Google under  the microscope for privacy issues, leading to call for tighter regulations. </p><p>2018 saw a big change for the internet, if you noticed, net neutrality was  repealed by the Trump Administration.  Despite promises of doom, the  internet seems to work the same as before.  But it is not the same as  before for believers of Bitcoin.  A year ago, the cryptocurrency riding  high near $20,000, but by year-end crashing below 5,000.  The year-end  Midterm Election set the tone for the year ahead with new uncertainty with  the Democrats in the majority in the House, creating new questions over  what can get done legislatively. </p><p>TRUMP:  I am proud to shut down the government for border security. </p><p>BARTIROMO:  2019 begins with a new Congress and a divided government.  That  traditionally has been good for business in the stock market.  No wonder  the list of IPOs ready to launch is growing.  But the U.S. will need to  ratify the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada, as well as finish its  work with China among other things.  </p><p>And in this era of a nontraditional precedent where business and politics  overlap, you can be sure that more surprises are in store for the New Year. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  So bottom lining that, 2018 was the year of the big surprise in  my opinion. </p><p>HARF:  Absolutely.  </p><p>TIMPF:  Right.  </p><p>HARF:  And we're one year out basically from the tax cuts having taking  effect.  We're seeing the impact of that sort of a mixed bag as we look  back on those tax cuts.  Corporate profits are up, some workers got  benefits, some plants have kept closing like in my home state of Ohio,  Lordstown, Ohio.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Oh.  </p><p>HARF:  So that's a big one.  That's going to be a big issue seeing how  these tax cuts play out over the next few months.  Also as Maria mentioned,  trade and NAFTA, new Congress coming in, it is not a given that they will  approve the new NAFTA.  I think it's likely, but it's not a given and so  that will be another political fight and, of course, China trade.  This is  the big ticket item the President has to get something done on.  I think  his supporters who are impacted, soybean farmers, steel producers, they've  been willing to give him some leeway here sometime, but I don't think it's  indefinite.  So, as we look to 2019, that time may run out -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  </p><p>HARF:  -- at some point.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  We do have hope there's going to be a January sit-down -- </p><p>HARF:  That's right.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  -- between both sides, Washington and Beijing, to try to get  something done -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Yes.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  -- as the 90-day trade truce that expires in March is -- that  clock is ticking. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  Yes.  And you look at the take from Maria, you had a market that  was doing pretty well the first six months, and all of a sudden this trade  war kicks in.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  And you have so much unpredictability and so much volatility, it  started from that point.  I think Brexit right here is underestimated.  I  think Brexit next year could fall completely apart.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  David Kudla -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I think -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  -- said he's not touching Europe. </p><p>LAYFIELD:  I think the E.U. could fall apart.  If Brexit is a hard Brexit,  then E.U. -- then Italy will probably drop out of the E.U. as well and the  E.U. dissolves.  That is big deal going on in Europe and that is not priced  in on the market yet.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  That is very interesting call because we're fixated on the  Federal Reserve and the status of Jay Powell, and what's going on with  China as being our two biggest headwinds, but Brexit and -- </p><p>LAYFIELD:  It's all things you can't -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  -- two countries perhaps going out of the E.U.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  That's right.  And the whole E.U could dissolve on that.  If  England -- if U.K. has to stay in, that will send a message to Italy, \"You  got to get your debt under control,\" Italy will probably rein in its debt  and stay in the E.U.  If Brexit is a hard Brexit, which looks like it  certainly could be -- </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  </p><p>LAYFIELD:  -- I think Italy drops out as well.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  They never plan for the hard Brexit.  That was the problem.   Anything to add?  </p><p>TIMPF:  I just think it's been crazy to see everything that's happened with  Facebook this year.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  </p><p>TIMPF:  I think they've had such a bad year, and now Google, too, with all  the privacy stuff. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Are you still on Facebook? </p><p>TIMPF:  I'm still on Facebook, yes, but I'm concerned about some of my  private messages, the fact that people have read those, I mean you don't  think about it -- you don't really think about it.  You think of it as  being, \"Oh, private message?\"</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Nothing's private.  </p><p>TIMPF:  \"It's a private message,\" but nothing's private.  There's no such  thing. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right.  </p><p>HARF:  Yes.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Coming up, the shutdown showdown in Washington and right now no  end in sight, we're going to take a look at what could happen when  Democrats take control of the House next week and blue skies at night.   What caused this stunning blue scene over New York City late last night?   We missed it.  We were sleeping.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Welcome back.  I'm Lauren Simonetti, in for Maria Bartiromo,  this morning.  It is Friday, December 28th, your top stories at 6:30 a.m.  Eastern Time.</p><p>Wall Street pulling away from premarket highs up actually, look at this,  volatility reign supreme, we're up just 60, now, we're up about 200 points  on the Dow.  So it could be another good day, but of course, everything can  change come 3:00 p.m., in that final hour.</p><p>A wild session for the major averages yesterday, the Dow swinging more than  850 points during the session, it did finish higher by more than one  percent, the S&amp;P 500 picked up just about a percent, and the NASDAQ tacked  on just over a third of one percent.</p><p>Take a look at European indices, this morning.  Green across the board,  London, Paris, and Frankfurt, all up 1.8 percent.  Asian markets, mostly  higher overnight, the Nikkei however, down a third of a percent.</p><p>The border battle heating up with the government shutdown, now, in day  seven, and President Trump doubles down on his call for the border wall,  after an alleged cop-killer in California was in the U.S., illegally, the  fallout, ahead.</p><p>Then, blue skies over New York, but it was night time, we have the details  on what exactly happened and more of this incredible video.</p><p>Plus, it's deadline day for Sears, the struggling iconic retailer has until  the end of today, to find a bidder for its assets or it could disappear  entirely.</p><p>And we're ringing in the New Year in style, we've got the top wine choices  to help you celebrate 2019, all that coming up.</p><p>Our top story this half hour, is the shutdown showdown, the partial  government shutdown most likely stretching into 2019 with no clear end in  sight, even some of the President's closest allies are losing hope of a  quick agreement to end the shutdown.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R-NC), CHAIR OF THE HOUSE FREEDOM CAUCUS:  Having  discussions with the President prior to the Christmas break, he was fully  engaged in making a number of different options available to Democrats, and  yet, it's been met with really just resistance and no acceptance  whatsoever.</p><p>As you know, they've now said that we're not going to have votes this week,  here in the house, so any suggestion that this would end quickly, are  quickly fading.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  This comes as a new Reuters poll shows the majority of  Americans blame President Trump for the shutdown, while only 33 percent  blamed the Democrats in Congress.</p><p>Joining me now is Daily Caller News Foundation Editor-in-Chief, Christopher  Bedford, Chris, good morning.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER BEDFORD, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF, DAILY CALLER NEWS FOUNDATION:  Good  morning.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Does it matter who we blame?  It matters the solution here,  right?</p><p>BEDFORD:  Yes, it doesn't really matter that much who you blame, we're two  years away from anybody voting, and despite everyone in Washington, always  freaking out over poll this or poll that, when the government shuts down,  it doesn't seem to have a huge electoral effect, with that -- except with  the major -- possible exception of a Virginia election a few years ago,  when Virginia was so heavily affected by the shutdown.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  The President could have gotten some support for his border  wall and the need to contain and stop illegal immigration, with the news  coming out of Northern California, that an illegal immigrant killed a legal  immigrant, that police officer originally from Fiji.  Does that aid his  push?</p><p>BEDFORD:  It might aid a little bit, at least, in the hearts and minds of  Americans.  This is a classic story, a very tragic story of an immigrant  from Fiji, who comes here and joins a law enforcement agency, he's serving  and protecting and he's got a 5-month-old child and a wife, and he's shot  by someone who's here, illegally, when he pulls him over for suspected  drunk driving.</p><p>That's a really tragic story on Christmas week, and it's a kind of story  that says it paints a difference between those who come here, legally, and  try to help, and try to serve their community, and those who don't, and  they live in the shadows and they break the law.</p><p>And while there are some people that aren't shooting police officers,  obviously, it shows you the worries here, but the problem is, the Democrats  have no incentive here to give the President a win on anything.  They were  sailing into this, thinking that the President was going to fold on his  campaign promise for a border wall, about two weeks ago.</p><p>Now, it's looking like he's not going to.  But Democrats, their voters will  punish them and their members will punish them if they give the President a  win on anything.</p><p>HARF:  Chris, Marie Harf here, good morning.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Good morning.</p><p>HARF:  I want to ask you a question.  Play this out a little bit.  Nancy  Pelosi takes over speaker, and just a few days, the House will pass likely  a clean funding bill with no border wall funding wall in it, the Senate may  pass something similar they did earlier, this month, by unanimous consent,  if something like that were to pass out of Congress and go to President  Trump's desk with no border wall funding in it, will he and should he veto  it?</p><p>BEDFORD:  I suspect that he would veto it because this is a -- this is a  campaign promise of his.  He'd look like, maybe if they had done these two  weeks ago, he might have let something like that by, but the pressure has  built, he's becoming -- he's come pretty stubborn on this matter.</p><p>And he's really seen a lot of his base start to let him know and tell him,  hey, President, we voted for you, in order to get this border wall passed,  you had two years to do it, nothing happened.  Now, it's down to the last  minute, and if you fold again to the Democrats, that's not going to empower  them.</p><p>Of course, it's possible that he tries to attach it to an infrastructure  bill, but again, I don't see any incentive for Nancy Pelosi House of  Representatives to give him a win on anything like this.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Hey Chris, when you talk about the overall economic impact, I  agree with you, history show that government shutdown doesn't have an  overall economic impact long term because you get money later, it certainly  does and do much (INAUDIBLE) 800,000 people who aren't getting checks at  Christmas because of these childish politicians can't get along and worse  in D.C.</p><p>I think it's embarrassing and disgusting on all of them, both parties.   But, when you look at what's going on this past week, with this government  shutdown, we're in a stalemate right here.  Both sides think they have a  winning hand.</p><p>Look at what happened with the first Secretary of Defense that resigned,  and General Mattis, it seems to lend itself that this White House is either  at worst in chaos or at best unpredictable.  This is what you think is  hurting the image of the White House as much, and also the markets?</p><p>BEDFORD:  The good news for the government employees who were out of a  paycheck, is if the government figures this out by January 10th, then  they're never going to even miss a paycheck.  They'll be OK because they  don't have a scheduled pay period until January 11th.  Although, there's a  sense of uncertainty you don't want.</p><p>But this has been a really, really bad two weeks for the White House, I was  with a number of Conservatives over Christmas and over the break, talking  about this, and I had never heard some of these Trump supporters be so down  on the President, whether it's over Secretary Mattis, which was a step too  far for a lot of the people who support the President, or whether it's over  this final, final battle after two years of Republican control for the  wall.</p><p>But a number of Conservatives and people on the hard right told me, that  they said that if the President had folded on this issue, then they would - - he would've lost their support entirely.  So, I think the President has  gotten that message.</p><p>But this is a function of some of the dysfunction in the White House, where  the way President Trump has traditionally run his businesses, as but a very  small, very lean team of people who are close to him, and that doesn't work  as well with the sprawling federal government, you need to have as many  people on there, as possible, working for you at the same time, and empty  jobs are not getting filled.</p><p>TIMPF:  Hi, it's Katherine, I just have a question, in terms of how this  all ends, what do you think would be better, politically, for the President  if he ends the shutdown or do you think Conservatives would see it as him  folding, if he doesn't get border wall funding?</p><p>BEDFORD:  I think Conservatives will see it as him folding, absolutely.   The best possible outcome for the President would be some kind of  compromise where Democrats say they'll give a little bit more for a wall,  but maybe it wouldn't be a wall, maybe it'll be steel slots, or something.   He'll claim a victory there, and then, he won't at least -- no one would go  home empty handed.</p><p>However, if the Democrats also have a possibility to appear to be adults in  the room, to give him some kind of compromise like that, and say look, we  are the House of Representatives, opened up government, but I also think  that right now, both sides don't have that much to lose.</p><p>They're two years out from an election, I know this is really cynical, but  they don't have that much to lose because voters will forget about some of  the squabbling and what they will remember, is if Democrats voted for the  wall, or if Republicans did not vote for the wall.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes.  And meanwhile, yesterday they gavelled in and gavelled  out, as if this is no big deal, and they're all looking ahead to 2020, even  though we're not even in 2019 yet, that's how politics work.</p><p>We have a poll from The Des Moines Register, as well as CNN, it was from  earlier this month, and it shows that the top Democratic contenders for  2020, among Iowa voters, are Former Vice President Joe Biden, he's leading,  followed by Senator Bernie Sanders and Congressman Beto O'Rourke.</p><p>Now, this is coming as new reports say Michael Bloomberg, Chris, could be  willing to spend upwards of $100 million of his own money, in a campaign  for the White House, do you think Bloomberg could get in here?</p><p>BEDFORD:  I don't think this is the time for Bloomberg.  I remember his ads  he just ran a few weeks ago, where he was saying, I used to be Republican,  and now, I'm a Democrat.  That's not the kind of bipartisan, I'm willing to  switch on principles, kind of thing, at the last minute.</p><p>Vote or movement that's getting voters going on right now, the voters are  very much divided.  Democrats are not interested in working with  Republicans and vice versa, and no one's really looking for a moderate  person.  You see, for the John Kasichs, or the Michael Bloombergs, there's  not a huge rising chorus to get those people to run nationally.</p><p>Mitt Romney, he has to go to be a senator for Utah, he's not -- this is not  his time to run for President, same thing with someone like Paul Ryan.  So,  I think that Bloomberg stands less of a chance.</p><p>And some of the problems for Democrats right now, with their base having  put so much emphasis on different identity politics, are those leaders.   Those leading three are all white men, except for maybe, Beto, who's not  white, I guess, when he runs against a Cuban, but they're generally white  men, and that is not something the Democrats are looking for and that's  going to come up a lot in their primaries.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Marie, what do you think the Democratic ticket in 2020 looks  like then?</p><p>HARF:  I think we have no idea.  You know, that poll is basically a name  recognition poll, at this point, and if you look at polls from the same  time, in the 2016 cycle, in the 2008 cycle, where Hillary Clinton -- no,  Barack Obama was in poll, and anywhere close to that, in 2006, right?</p><p>At this point, in the 2008 cycle, there's going to be 20, 25 people in  primary, and I actually think it will -- the process will work out.  People  that can survive on the national stage will do better, and people who  can't, won't.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  But these big names -- </p><p>HARF:  We have no idea.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  -- bring in the money.</p><p>HARF:  They do.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  I was like, how can Hillary Clinton run again?  But, she can  fundraise.</p><p>HARF:  Yes, but she's not -- well, I hope she doesn't run again, I should  say that.  But you know, fundraising has also changed, we see Beto who  raised so much from small dollar donors online.  Fundraising is very  different today than it was even 10 years ago, in terms of getting those  big donors, grassroots donors matter now, a lot more.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Where does the Democratic Party go from here?  You know, 2009,  the Republican Party was in disarray, much like the Democratic Party is  right now, the tea party rose.  For a while, it influenced elections and it  kind of -- </p><p>HARF:  Yes.</p><p>LAYFIELD:  Right now, the Socialist Party is rising for the same reasons  because they are mad at the political leadership.  Where does that go from  here?</p><p>HARF:  There's going to be fight in the Democratic Party in 2020, because  there are some high-profile progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who  did win, but the reason Democrats won the -- won the majority in the House,  is because of moderates who won in the Midwest, in the plain states, in the  south.</p><p>There's going to be a fight over who can win, and the most important thing  will be, who can beat Donald Trump.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  It's going to be a very interesting year.</p><p>HARF:  Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Christopher Bedford, thank you for joining us.</p><p>BEDFORD:  Thank you.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  And for all of that.  You gave us a lot to talk about here  onset.</p><p>All right, coming up, retail wreck, J.C. Penney shares falling below a  buck, making it a penny stock, $0.97 for the first time, in its very long  history.  This, as Sears hits the deadline today, to find a buyer for its  assets or disappear forever.</p><p>Plus, no New Year's Eve is complete without a glass of bubbly, we've got a  look at some of the top wine picks to ring in 2019.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Mysterious blue light, filling the New York City's skyline last  night.  Kristina Partsinevelos, what was this light all about?  </p><p>PARTSINEVELOS:  Oh, that sky was sparking rapid speculation on social  media, some suggested it could be a strange weather phenomenon, some even  say the aliens -- yes, it's true, but turns out it was a blown transformer  in Queens that shined brightly.  The small explosion caused some scattered  power outages in the city including at La Guardia International Airport;  the outage there resulted in multiple flight delays.  Thankfully, though,  no one was hurt but we love the speculation online.  </p><p>Last year's special election in Alabama reportedly drawing the attention of  the state's Attorney General Steve Marshall telling Washington Post a  disinformation campaign targeting GOP Senate Candidate Roy Moore may have  violated state campaign laws and affected the outcome of the race.  Moore  was defeated by Democrat Doug Jones.  Marshall says his office is  collecting information about the Russian-styled disinformation campaign  called \"Project Birmingham.\"  Meanwhile, LinkedIn Founder, Reid Hoffman, is  apologizing for giving money to the group allegedly behind the campaign.   Hoffman says, he was unaware of its tactics.  </p><p>And bids to acquire Sears are due and U.S. bankers see court today at 4:00  p.m.  But Sears Chairman Eddie Lampert, the only buyer who has expressed  interest in keeping Sears in business is reportedly struggling to come up  with financing to make good on its $4.6 billion offer to buy the company.  </p><p>And since we're speaking of struggling retailers, J.C. Penny just became a  penny stock.  Shares of the company fell as low as $0.32 before closing  down 7.5 percent at $0.97.  It's the first time they've ever closed before  a dollar since J.C. Penny went public in late 1970s.  Shares of the company  down nearly 70 percent this year.  I heard one of you whistle.  Has anybody  went to J.C. Penny just within the last year or so?  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, that's the problem.  I mean, retail is strong right now  but not for everybody.  I don't know.  Anyone go to J.C. Penny in the last  year?  </p><p>TIMPF:  No, most certainly not.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Anyone see the blue light last night?  </p><p>TIMPF:  I was asleep.  I was asleep at 8:30.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  If you saw it at home, tweet us.  Apparently, had to be in  Queens.  Coming up, it's almost time to ring in 2019 and nothing says  celebration like a bottle of bubbly.  We've got wide array of wines you can  toast to when the ball drops.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Perfect song.  The countdown to 2019 is on.  Nothing says a  celebration like a glass of bubbly, but that's not the only drink you can  choose to ring in the New Year with.  Joining me now is Wheeling Forward  Co-Founder and University Club Head, Sommelier Yannick Benjamin.  Thanks  for coming on.  </p><p>YANNICK BENJAMIN, FOUNDER, WHEELING FORWARD:  Well, thanks for having me.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  You brought your goods.  </p><p>BENJAMIN:  Yes.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  This is an alternative to champagne, a sparkling wine.  </p><p>BENJAMIN:  Right.  So, this is from the (INAUDIBLE).  It's from Maurice  Bonime, and so it's an alternative to champagne, it's from -- this region  is called the garden of France.  So, a beautiful little place, it's Chenin  blanc.  You get it in retail store about $12.00, so significantly less than  champagne.  So, if you want to save some money and then invest in other  wines, you can also do that too. </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Two questions: do you get the same champagne hangover?  </p><p>BENJAMIN:  Little bit less because less chemicals or whatever.  But, you  know, it's a natural wine, wonderful, beautiful -- yes, you'll be fine.   And the most important thing, it'll put big smile on the face.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  And the second question was: do you actually speak French or  have you just perfected -- </p><p>BENJAMIN:  My parents are French, actually.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  OK.  So -- all right, you do.  And what is this over hear?</p><p>BENJAMIN:  So, this one over here, this is fun.  This is from the famous  region of Bordeaux, which is commonly known for red wines, but they do so  much more than that.  They some really great sparkling wines out there,  some dry whites, but this is a sweet wine.  And we often think sweet wines  with dessert, but you can actually do as an (INAUDIBLE), which cheeses just  to start it off.  My mom is from Bordeaux.  So, commonly, we would have  sweet wine to start off the meal or even to just celebrate, to just kind of  do a little toast for the new year.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Right, and you brought two reds.  </p><p>BENJAMIN:  Yes, for sure.  Yes, this is a dry red over hear.  This is a  (INAUDIBLE).  100 percent (INAUDIBLE).  I like this; give it a nice little  chill so people like red wines, just flavorful, beautiful red fruit aromas  to it -- little cranberry notes to it.  So, just a perfect little red wine  for --  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Delicious -- I'm a red wine kind of gal.  And then, I'm very  excited to talk to you about, about this one that I see is open.</p><p>BENJAMIN:  Yes, I popped it open.  So, I wanted you to -- I decanted it for  you, I put it back in the bottle so you can taste later on.  But this is my  private label for my nonprofit called (INAUDIBLE) which is an homage to my  parents, it's called the Dreamer.  100 percent of the proceeds goes to  (INAUDIBLE), which is a nonprofit to help other people with physical  disabilities -- we help them find housing, education, all that good stuff.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  How much have you raised thus far?  </p><p>BENJAMIN:  I don't know the number of I how much money I raised, but I can  tell you we have two wellness and physical fitness centers, so it's been  very successful.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, help you raised money right now.  How much is this  bottle?  </p><p>BENJAMIN:  This one, you can find for $49.99.  But again, a 100 --  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  He says, you're joking -- it's for a good cause.</p><p>BENJAMIN:  It's for a good cause, but you can go on our Web site,  (INAUDIBLE) and you can purchase it.  Or there's a great wine store down in  (INAUDIBLE) called (INAUDIBLE).  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Well, you blended it yourself.  </p><p>BENJAMIN:  Yes, I did.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  So, what goes into -- what are the trends in wine right now?  </p><p>BENJAMIN:  The trends in wines, yes, I think people want, you know, hands  off, minimal, organic and honest wines.  Wines that when you're tasting, it  really -- you know, it takes you back to that place: beautiful aromas,  beautiful taste and food friendly as well.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  OK.  Well, I'm going to smell it for the aroma.  I love when  you -- </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  People who really know wine can pick -- I smell cinnamon bun in  this one.  </p><p>BENJAMIN:  There's a little (INAUDIBLE) on it, so there's some vanilla  notes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  OK, I'm might pick up vanilla now that you say it.  Maybe I'll  smell it more if I pick up the glass.  Sorry.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER) </p><p>SIMONETTI:  It's very strong.  This is robust red.  </p><p>BENJAMIN:  Yes, it's pinot noir but just, you know, silky, smooth and all  that kind of stuff, yes.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  All right, and how much the sales typically go up at the end of  the year because people are celebrating the holidays.  </p><p>BENJAMIN:  Oh my gosh, it's crazy; there's no end to it.  You know, but  January, they stop.  For sure.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yes, everyone is too hangover and poor.  And poor in January.  </p><p>BENJAMIN:  And poor, exactly.</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Maybe, you should continue to buy wine and champagne to drink  away your paycheck sorrows.  </p><p>BENJAMIN:  That's right.  That's right.  Wine is a commodity.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Yannick Benjamin, thank you so much.  </p><p>BENJAMIN:  Thank you so much for having me.  </p><p>SIMONETTI:  Thank you for everything that you do.  All right, still ahead,  everybody, Instagram's mea cupla; the social media service apologizing for  a new update that users including myself absolutely hated yesterday, did  you see it?  We're going to tell you next about that on MORNINGS WITH  MARIA.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>SIMONETTI:  Good morning.  I'm Lauren Simonetti, in for Maria Bartiromo  today.  It is Friday, December 28th.  Here are your top stories at 7:00  a.m. Eastern Time.  The bulls came out for a run this morning.  They're  still running; it could change any second now, but Dow is up 121 points,  S&amp;P up 13, NASDAQ tacking on 21 after a roller coaster day yesterday and  quite frankly, for the fourth quarter.  The Dow swinging more than 150  points during yesterday's session.  It did finish higher by more than one  percent.  The S&amp;P 500 picking up just about one percent and the NASDAQ  tacking on just over a third of a percent.  Meanwhile, in Europe, green  across the screen.  They're all up 1.6 percent.  Asian markets overnight  mostly higher.  The Nikkei in Japan down a third of one percent and it is - - </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Sen. Bernie Sanders would go the furthest, proposing an investment of $2.5 trillion over 10 years to build and rehabilitate nearly 10 million affordable homes over the next decade. That\u2019s a staggering amount, considering the U.S. is building about 1.3 million housing units a year.</p><p> Sen. Elizabeth Warren would invest $500 billion, in what the accounting firm Moody\u2019s found would create more</p><p> than 3 million new affordable housing units and reduce rents by 10%. Former hedge fund chief Tom Steyer would spend $470 billion.</p><p> \u201cThe solutions and numbers may feel very big, and even overwhelming, but this is the scale of the problem,\u201d said David Zisser, the associate director of the affordable housing advocacy group Housing California. \u201cI suspect that $2.5 trillion (that Sanders is proposing) is probably about right.\u201d</p><p> Not surprisingly, the party\u2019s most progressive candidates would fund their fix by taxing the rich.</p><p> Warren would change the estate tax, while Sanders would use a wealth tax on the richest 0.1% of Americans. His plan also calls for a 25% house-flipping tax on non-owner-occupied property sold within five years of purchase, and a 2% tax on the value of vacant homes.</p><p> Experts warn throwing money at affordable housing won\u2019t go that far without also changing local zoning rules that limit where apartment buildings can be built.</p><p> Warren, Steyer and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg would give grants to cities that reform those zoning practices, while former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sanders would use a stick instead of a carrot, making federal housing or transportation funds to cities contingent on zoning reform.</p><p> Other candidates take a different tack by focusing on renters, with proposals from Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Bloomberg, Buttigieg, Sanders and others to greatly increase the availability of housing vouchers \u2014 federal funding helping low-income people pay their rent.</p><p> In one of the most drastic proposals, Sanders has called for a national rent-control law capping annual rent increases at 3% or 1.5 times the rate of inflation \u2014 more stringent than a similar California law passed last year \u2014 even though some experts warn that would stifle new housing construction. None of the other candidates support that idea.</p><p> But they do offer a variety of unique proposals. Buttigieg, for example, has put forward a program in which the federal government would give grants to cities to purchase abandoned or foreclosed homes and give them to low-income people who live in historically redlined or racially segregated areas. After 10 years of living in the home as their primary residence, the \u201chomesteader\u201d would fully own the property.</p><p> Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign says he would focus on policies that get homeless people into homes as quickly as possible instead of making shelter a condition of staying sober or participating in other programs.</p><p> And Warren would deny federal grants to police departments that arrest homeless people for living on the streets.</p><p> All of the candidates would go further than Trump, who has talked tough about cracking down on homelessness in California without laying out many specifics, cut funding for public housing repairs in his proposed budgets, and pushed state and local governments to cut regulations that get in the way of building affordable housing.</p><p> Fighting wildfires</p><p> All of the candidates have outlined policies to slash U.S. carbon emissions and fight climate change. But some have also focused on what the federal government can do to support California and other wildfire-prone Western states facing increasingly deadly and costly wildfires \u2014 many of which were sparked by damaged power lines from PG&amp;E and other utilities.</p><p> The president can play a big role in fighting wildfires in the state, because 57% of California forests are owned and managed by the feds.</p><p> Ken Pimlott, a former Cal Fire chief, said the federal government should be investing more on fire prevention efforts instead of just supporting the state after huge fires break out.</p><p> \u201cHistorically, it has been state and local governments working in these areas \u2014 but with the size of the problem we\u2019re facing, this is clearly a federal issue, too,\u201d Pimlott said.</p><p> Steyer \u2014 the only Californian still in the race \u2014 has called for spending a total of $130 billion on forest health and fire safety as well as other agricultural policies. The fires that have devastated communities around California \u201cserve as a reminder of how uncertain our future will be if we don\u2019t address the climate crisis immediately,\u201d Steyer said.</p><p> Bloomberg has come out with the most specific plan, calling for doubling federal funding to manage forests and to help communities protect themselves against fires to $10 billion, with half of that going to forest restoration and mitigation work. He would also increase Federal Emergency Management Agency funding for fireproofing homes.</p><p> Sanders is the only candidate who\u2019s called for a public takeover of the California utility giant Pacific Gas and Electric Co., criticizing the company for prioritizing corporate payouts over fire safety in an online video ad released last week.</p><p> Warren, Bloomberg and Klobuchar have called for federal investments in microgrid technology \u2014 energy systems disconnected from the main electricity grid \u2014 which experts say can help reduce fire risk and avoid the blackouts that plagued Northern California during last year\u2019s fire season.</p><p> Several of the candidates would start new programs to put more people to work defending against fires.</p><p> Bloomberg calls for a Wildfire Corps, a team of thousands of workers who would be trained in leading fire resilience work. Steyer has a similar proposal for a Civilian Climate Corps.</p><p> Trump has urged California to improve its forest management \u2014 memorably, calling for the state to \u201crake\u201d its forests \u2014 and approved disaster relief funds for communities devastated by fires. But he\u2019s done little to change the federal government\u2019s approach to wildfires.</p><p> Regulating Big Tech</p><p> The Democratic candidates agree that tech giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple have too much power. But they\u2019re divided on what to do about it.</p><p> Two contenders \u2014 Warren and Sanders \u2014 have endorsed breaking up those companies, in a seismic shift for Silicon Valley.</p><p> Warren has championed the idea, laying out a plan to break up companies with revenue of more than $25 billion that offer online marketplaces while participating on those platforms \u2014 like Amazon selling its own products.</p><p> That would bring balance to an industry where a few companies have \u201cbulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else,\u201d Warren argues in her plan.</p><p> The other candidates have called for a variety of new regulations on the tech industry and said they\u2019d be open to breaking up companies in some cases, but none would go as far as Warren or Sanders.</p><p> Biden said he would let the Justice Department, \u201cnot politics,\u201d decide which antitrust cases to bring. Bloomberg has said Warren and Sanders don\u2019t \u201cknow what they\u2019re talking about\u201d on the issue, although he\u2019d back some more limited breakups.</p><p> Several candidates also have  called for amending or ending laws related to online misinformation. Warren has proposed \u201ctough civil and criminal penalties\u201d for people who knowingly share false information about when and how to vote in U.S. elections.</p><p> Currently, under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, tech companies can\u2019t be held legally responsible for what their users post.</p><p> Biden has called for repealing that law, while Bloomberg has suggested he wants to amend it.</p><p> And many of the candidates have called for new regulations on data privacy, although there are few specifics.</p><p> Buttigieg wants to pass a federal privacy law that requires companies to limit and protect the user data they collect, while Klobuchar has suggested taxing companies that exploit user data.</p><p> What about President Trump? He has sounded off about bias among the big tech companies, and his Department of Justice has launched a major investigation into whether the firms have pushed anti-competitive policies.</p><p> Legal immigration and H-1B visas</p><p> All of the candidates have opposed Trump\u2019s crackdown on undocumented immigrants and called for an end to practices like separating migrant families at the border. But there\u2019s been far less conversation about reforming the legal immigration system, even though the large majority of immigrants in California and around the country enter the country legally.</p><p> Only a few of the candidates have weighed in on the issue of H-1B visas \u2014 the program that lets highly skilled foreigners work in the U.S. and has helped Silicon Valley companies recruit hundreds of thousands of employees. The program has faced uncertainty under Trump, and critics say it allows outsourcing companies to replace American workers with lower-paid foreigners.</p><p> Bloomberg and Steyer support raising the annual 85,000 cap on H-1B visas \u2014 a limit that\u2019s reached within days of applications opening each year. Klobuchar has also introduced legislation in the Senate to more than double the number of visas available.</p><p> Several of the candidates would pair those increases with reforms to the system. Bloomberg would raise the cap while putting in place \u201cstronger wage requirements\u201d and ensuring U.S. workers aren\u2019t displaced, and he\u2019s also proposing a \u201cstartup visa\u201d for international entrepreneurs, similar to a program in Canada.</p><p> \u201cWhether they are starting businesses in Silicon Valley or on Main Street, job-creating immigrants should be welcomed to the U.S. and not sent away to our competitors,\u201d the former mayor says in his plan.</p><p> Sanders\u2019 campaign said he would require employers to pay substantially higher wages for H-1B visa-holders, and make them portable between jobs \u201cso workers are not trapped at a sponsoring employer.\u201d He would also put in place tougher enforcement standards to ensure H-1B visa holders aren\u2019t replacing American workers.</p><p> In another reform, Buttigieg, Sanders and Steyer said they\u2019d allow the spouses of H-1B visa holders to work \u2014 a direct contrast with the Trump administration, which is moving to revoke spouses\u2019 work authorization.</p><p> Beyond H-1B visas, Biden and Bloomberg would both get rid of caps that limit how many employment-based green cards are given out each year to citizens of any one country, which have led to huge backlogs for immigrants from China and India. They\u2019d also set up procedures to adjust the number of employment visas available based on unemployment and other economic conditions in the U.S.</p><p> That\u2019s a smart idea for modernizing our immigration policy, said Sarah Pierce, an analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington.</p><p> \u201cWe need a system that\u2019s dynamic and responds to the market, instead of this ridiculous system that\u2019s been set in statute for decades,\u201d she said. \u201cThe process should be a lot more thoughtful.\u201d</p><p> Contact Casey Tolan at

Sen. Bernie Sanders would go the furthest, proposing an investment of $2.5 trillion over 10 years to build and rehabilitate nearly 10 million affordable homes over the next decade. That\u2019s a staggering amount, considering the U.S. is building about 1.3 million housing units a year.</p><p> Sen. Elizabeth Warren would invest $500 billion, in what the accounting firm Moody\u2019s found would create more</p><p> than 3 million new affordable housing units and reduce rents by 10%. Former hedge fund chief Tom Steyer would spend $470 billion.</p><p> \u201cThe solutions and numbers may feel very big, and even overwhelming, but this is the scale of the problem,\u201d said David Zisser, the associate director of the affordable housing advocacy group Housing California. \u201cI suspect that $2.5 trillion (that Sanders is proposing) is probably about right.\u201d</p><p> Not surprisingly, the party\u2019s most progressive candidates would fund their fix by taxing the rich.</p><p> Warren would change the estate tax, while Sanders would use a wealth tax on the richest 0.1% of Americans. His plan also calls for a 25% house-flipping tax on non-owner-occupied property sold within five years of purchase, and a 2% tax on the value of vacant homes.</p><p> Experts warn throwing money at affordable housing won\u2019t go that far without also changing local zoning rules that limit where apartment buildings can be built.</p><p> Warren, Steyer and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg would give grants to cities that reform those zoning practices, while former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sanders would use a stick instead of a carrot, making federal housing or transportation funds to cities contingent on zoning reform.</p><p> Other candidates take a different tack by focusing on renters, with proposals from Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Bloomberg, Buttigieg, Sanders and others to greatly increase the availability of housing vouchers \u2014 federal funding helping low-income people pay their rent.</p><p> In one of the most drastic proposals, Sanders has called for a national rent-control law capping annual rent increases at 3% or 1.5 times the rate of inflation \u2014 more stringent than a similar California law passed last year \u2014 even though some experts warn that would stifle new housing construction. None of the other candidates support that idea.</p><p> But they do offer a variety of unique proposals. Buttigieg, for example, has put forward a program in which the federal government would give grants to cities to purchase abandoned or foreclosed homes and give them to low-income people who live in historically redlined or racially segregated areas. After 10 years of living in the home as their primary residence, the \u201chomesteader\u201d would fully own the property.</p><p> Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign says he would focus on policies that get homeless people into homes as quickly as possible instead of making shelter a condition of staying sober or participating in other programs.</p><p> And Warren would deny federal grants to police departments that arrest homeless people for living on the streets.</p><p> All of the candidates would go further than Trump, who has talked tough about cracking down on homelessness in California without laying out many specifics, cut funding for public housing repairs in his proposed budgets, and pushed state and local governments to cut regulations that get in the way of building affordable housing.</p><p> Fighting wildfires</p><p> All of the candidates have outlined policies to slash U.S. carbon emissions and fight climate change. But some have also focused on what the federal government can do to support California and other wildfire-prone Western states facing increasingly deadly and costly wildfires \u2014 many of which were sparked by damaged power lines from PG&amp;E and other utilities.</p><p> The president can play a big role in fighting wildfires in the state, because 57% of California forests are owned and managed by the feds.</p><p> Ken Pimlott, a former Cal Fire chief, said the federal government should be investing more on fire prevention efforts instead of just supporting the state after huge fires break out.</p><p> \u201cHistorically, it has been state and local governments working in these areas \u2014 but with the size of the problem we\u2019re facing, this is clearly a federal issue, too,\u201d Pimlott said.</p><p> Steyer \u2014 the only Californian still in the race \u2014 has called for spending a total of $130 billion on forest health and fire safety as well as other agricultural policies. The fires that have devastated communities around California \u201cserve as a reminder of how uncertain our future will be if we don\u2019t address the climate crisis immediately,\u201d Steyer said.</p><p> Bloomberg has come out with the most specific plan, calling for doubling federal funding to manage forests and to help communities protect themselves against fires to $10 billion, with half of that going to forest restoration and mitigation work. He would also increase Federal Emergency Management Agency funding for fireproofing homes.</p><p> Sanders is the only candidate who\u2019s called for a public takeover of the California utility giant Pacific Gas and Electric Co., criticizing the company for prioritizing corporate payouts over fire safety in an online video ad released last week.</p><p> Warren, Bloomberg and Klobuchar have called for federal investments in microgrid technology \u2014 energy systems disconnected from the main electricity grid \u2014 which experts say can help reduce fire risk and avoid the blackouts that plagued Northern California during last year\u2019s fire season.</p><p> Several of the candidates would start new programs to put more people to work defending against fires.</p><p> Bloomberg calls for a Wildfire Corps, a team of thousands of workers who would be trained in leading fire resilience work. Steyer has a similar proposal for a Civilian Climate Corps.</p><p> Trump has urged California to improve its forest management \u2014 memorably, calling for the state to \u201crake\u201d its forests \u2014 and approved disaster relief funds for communities devastated by fires. But he\u2019s done little to change the federal government\u2019s approach to wildfires.</p><p> Regulating Big Tech</p><p> The Democratic candidates agree that tech giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple have too much power. But they\u2019re divided on what to do about it.</p><p> Two contenders \u2014 Warren and Sanders \u2014 have endorsed breaking up those companies, in a seismic shift for Silicon Valley.</p><p> Warren has championed the idea, laying out a plan to break up companies with revenue of more than $25 billion that offer online marketplaces while participating on those platforms \u2014 like Amazon selling its own products.</p><p> That would bring balance to an industry where a few companies have \u201cbulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else,\u201d Warren argues in her plan.</p><p> The other candidates have called for a variety of new regulations on the tech industry and said they\u2019d be open to breaking up companies in some cases, but none would go as far as Warren or Sanders.</p><p> Biden said he would let the Justice Department, \u201cnot politics,\u201d decide which antitrust cases to bring. Bloomberg has said Warren and Sanders don\u2019t \u201cknow what they\u2019re talking about\u201d on the issue, although he\u2019d back some more limited breakups.</p><p> Several candidates also have  called for amending or ending laws related to online misinformation. Warren has proposed \u201ctough civil and criminal penalties\u201d for people who knowingly share false information about when and how to vote in U.S. elections.</p><p> Currently, under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, tech companies can\u2019t be held legally responsible for what their users post.</p><p> Biden has called for repealing that law, while Bloomberg has suggested he wants to amend it.</p><p> And many of the candidates have called for new regulations on data privacy, although there are few specifics.</p><p> Buttigieg wants to pass a federal privacy law that requires companies to limit and protect the user data they collect, while Klobuchar has suggested taxing companies that exploit user data.</p><p> What about President Trump? He has sounded off about bias among the big tech companies, and his Department of Justice has launched a major investigation into whether the firms have pushed anti-competitive policies.</p><p> Legal immigration and H-1B visas</p><p> All of the candidates have opposed Trump\u2019s crackdown on undocumented immigrants and called for an end to practices like separating migrant families at the border. But there\u2019s been far less conversation about reforming the legal immigration system, even though the large majority of immigrants in California and around the country enter the country legally.</p><p> Only a few of the candidates have weighed in on the issue of H-1B visas \u2014 the program that lets highly skilled foreigners work in the U.S. and has helped Silicon Valley companies recruit hundreds of thousands of employees. The program has faced uncertainty under Trump, and critics say it allows outsourcing companies to replace American workers with lower-paid foreigners.</p><p> Bloomberg and Steyer support raising the annual 85,000 cap on H-1B visas \u2014 a limit that\u2019s reached within days of applications opening each year. Klobuchar has also introduced legislation in the Senate to more than double the number of visas available.</p><p> Several of the candidates would pair those increases with reforms to the system. Bloomberg would raise the cap while putting in place \u201cstronger wage requirements\u201d and ensuring U.S. workers aren\u2019t displaced, and he\u2019s also proposing a \u201cstartup visa\u201d for international entrepreneurs, similar to a program in Canada.</p><p> \u201cWhether they are starting businesses in Silicon Valley or on Main Street, job-creating immigrants should be welcomed to the U.S. and not sent away to our competitors,\u201d the former mayor says in his plan.</p><p> Sanders\u2019 campaign said he would require employers to pay substantially higher wages for H-1B visa-holders, and make them portable between jobs \u201cso workers are not trapped at a sponsoring employer.\u201d He would also put in place tougher enforcement standards to ensure H-1B visa holders aren\u2019t replacing American workers.</p><p> In another reform, Buttigieg, Sanders and Steyer said they\u2019d allow the spouses of H-1B visa holders to work \u2014 a direct contrast with the Trump administration, which is moving to revoke spouses\u2019 work authorization.</p><p> Beyond H-1B visas, Biden and Bloomberg would both get rid of caps that limit how many employment-based green cards are given out each year to citizens of any one country, which have led to huge backlogs for immigrants from China and India. They\u2019d also set up procedures to adjust the number of employment visas available based on unemployment and other economic conditions in the U.S.</p><p> That\u2019s a smart idea for modernizing our immigration policy, said Sarah Pierce, an analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington.</p><p> \u201cWe need a system that\u2019s dynamic and responds to the market, instead of this ridiculous system that\u2019s been set in statute for decades,\u201d she said. \u201cThe process should be a lot more thoughtful.\u201d</p><p> Contact Casey Tolan at 510-208-6425.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRSENT-4684556</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EABABCBCF9B2DC6 PRSENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y73-W101-JBCN-416Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">153562</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Press Enterprise, Inc.

Sen. Bernie Sanders would go the furthest, proposing an investment of $2.5 trillion over 10 years to build and rehabilitate nearly 10 million affordable homes over the next decade. That\u2019s a staggering amount, considering the U.S. is building about 1.3 million housing units a year.</p><p> Sen. Elizabeth Warren would invest $500 billion, in what the accounting firm Moody\u2019s found would create more</p><p> than 3 million new affordable housing units and reduce rents by 10%. Former hedge fund chief Tom Steyer would spend $470 billion.</p><p> \u201cThe solutions and numbers may feel very big, and even overwhelming, but this is the scale of the problem,\u201d said David Zisser, the associate director of the affordable housing advocacy group Housing California. \u201cI suspect that $2.5 trillion (that Sanders is proposing) is probably about right.\u201d</p><p> Not surprisingly, the party\u2019s most progressive candidates would fund their fix by taxing the rich.</p><p> Warren would change the estate tax, while Sanders would use a wealth tax on the richest 0.1% of Americans. His plan also calls for a 25% house-flipping tax on non-owner-occupied property sold within five years of purchase, and a 2% tax on the value of vacant homes.</p><p> Experts warn throwing money at affordable housing won\u2019t go that far without also changing local zoning rules that limit where apartment buildings can be built.</p><p> Warren, Steyer and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg would give grants to cities that reform those zoning practices, while former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sanders would use a stick instead of a carrot, making federal housing or transportation funds to cities contingent on zoning reform.</p><p> Other candidates take a different tack by focusing on renters, with proposals from Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Bloomberg, Buttigieg, Sanders and others to greatly increase the availability of housing vouchers \u2014 federal funding helping low-income people pay their rent.</p><p> In one of the most drastic proposals, Sanders has called for a national rent-control law capping annual rent increases at 3% or 1.5 times the rate of inflation \u2014 more stringent than a similar California law passed last year \u2014 even though some experts warn that would stifle new housing construction. None of the other candidates support that idea.</p><p> But they do offer a variety of unique proposals. Buttigieg, for example, has put forward a program in which the federal government would give grants to cities to purchase abandoned or foreclosed homes and give them to low-income people who live in historically redlined or racially segregated areas. After 10 years of living in the home as their primary residence, the \u201chomesteader\u201d would fully own the property.</p><p> Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign says he would focus on policies that get homeless people into homes as quickly as possible instead of making shelter a condition of staying sober or participating in other programs.</p><p> And Warren would deny federal grants to police departments that arrest homeless people for living on the streets.</p><p> All of the candidates would go further than Trump, who has talked tough about cracking down on homelessness in California without laying out many specifics, cut funding for public housing repairs in his proposed budgets, and pushed state and local governments to cut regulations that get in the way of building affordable housing.</p><p> Fighting wildfires</p><p> All of the candidates have outlined policies to slash U.S. carbon emissions and fight climate change. But some have also focused on what the federal government can do to support California and other wildfire-prone Western states facing increasingly deadly and costly wildfires \u2014 many of which were sparked by damaged power lines from PG&amp;E and other utilities.</p><p> The president can play a big role in fighting wildfires in the state, because 57% of California forests are owned and managed by the feds.</p><p> Ken Pimlott, a former Cal Fire chief, said the federal government should be investing more on fire prevention efforts instead of just supporting the state after huge fires break out.</p><p> \u201cHistorically, it has been state and local governments working in these areas \u2014 but with the size of the problem we\u2019re facing, this is clearly a federal issue, too,\u201d Pimlott said.</p><p> Steyer \u2014 the only Californian still in the race \u2014 has called for spending a total of $130 billion on forest health and fire safety as well as other agricultural policies. The fires that have devastated communities around California \u201cserve as a reminder of how uncertain our future will be if we don\u2019t address the climate crisis immediately,\u201d Steyer said.</p><p> Bloomberg has come out with the most specific plan, calling for doubling federal funding to manage forests and to help communities protect themselves against fires to $10 billion, with half of that going to forest restoration and mitigation work. He would also increase Federal Emergency Management Agency funding for fireproofing homes.</p><p> Sanders is the only candidate who\u2019s called for a public takeover of the California utility giant Pacific Gas and Electric Co., criticizing the company for prioritizing corporate payouts over fire safety in an online video ad released last week.</p><p> Warren, Bloomberg and Klobuchar have called for federal investments in microgrid technology \u2014 energy systems disconnected from the main electricity grid \u2014 which experts say can help reduce fire risk and avoid the blackouts that plagued Northern California during last year\u2019s fire season.</p><p> Several of the candidates would start new programs to put more people to work defending against fires.</p><p> Bloomberg calls for a Wildfire Corps, a team of thousands of workers who would be trained in leading fire resilience work. Steyer has a similar proposal for a Civilian Climate Corps.</p><p> Trump has urged California to improve its forest management \u2014 memorably, calling for the state to \u201crake\u201d its forests \u2014 and approved disaster relief funds for communities devastated by fires. But he\u2019s done little to change the federal government\u2019s approach to wildfires.</p><p> Regulating Big Tech</p><p> The Democratic candidates agree that tech giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple have too much power. But they\u2019re divided on what to do about it.</p><p> Two contenders \u2014 Warren and Sanders \u2014 have endorsed breaking up those companies, in a seismic shift for Silicon Valley.</p><p> Warren has championed the idea, laying out a plan to break up companies with revenue of more than $25 billion that offer online marketplaces while participating on those platforms \u2014 like Amazon selling its own products.</p><p> That would bring balance to an industry where a few companies have \u201cbulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else,\u201d Warren argues in her plan.</p><p> The other candidates have called for a variety of new regulations on the tech industry and said they\u2019d be open to breaking up companies in some cases, but none would go as far as Warren or Sanders.</p><p> Biden said he would let the Justice Department, \u201cnot politics,\u201d decide which antitrust cases to bring. Bloomberg has said Warren and Sanders don\u2019t \u201cknow what they\u2019re talking about\u201d on the issue, although he\u2019d back some more limited breakups.</p><p> Several candidates also have  called for amending or ending laws related to online misinformation. Warren has proposed \u201ctough civil and criminal penalties\u201d for people who knowingly share false information about when and how to vote in U.S. elections.</p><p> Currently, under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, tech companies can\u2019t be held legally responsible for what their users post.</p><p> Biden has called for repealing that law, while Bloomberg has suggested he wants to amend it.</p><p> And many of the candidates have called for new regulations on data privacy, although there are few specifics.</p><p> Buttigieg wants to pass a federal privacy law that requires companies to limit and protect the user data they collect, while Klobuchar has suggested taxing companies that exploit user data.</p><p> What about President Trump? He has sounded off about bias among the big tech companies, and his Department of Justice has launched a major investigation into whether the firms have pushed anti-competitive policies.</p><p> Legal immigration and H-1B visas</p><p> All of the candidates have opposed Trump\u2019s crackdown on undocumented immigrants and called for an end to practices like separating migrant families at the border. But there\u2019s been far less conversation about reforming the legal immigration system, even though the large majority of immigrants in California and around the country enter the country legally.</p><p> Only a few of the candidates have weighed in on the issue of H-1B visas \u2014 the program that lets highly skilled foreigners work in the U.S. and has helped Silicon Valley companies recruit hundreds of thousands of employees. The program has faced uncertainty under Trump, and critics say it allows outsourcing companies to replace American workers with lower-paid foreigners.</p><p> Bloomberg and Steyer support raising the annual 85,000 cap on H-1B visas \u2014 a limit that\u2019s reached within days of applications opening each year. Klobuchar has also introduced legislation in the Senate to more than double the number of visas available.</p><p> Several of the candidates would pair those increases with reforms to the system. Bloomberg would raise the cap while putting in place \u201cstronger wage requirements\u201d and ensuring U.S. workers aren\u2019t displaced, and he\u2019s also proposing a \u201cstartup visa\u201d for international entrepreneurs, similar to a program in Canada.</p><p> \u201cWhether they are starting businesses in Silicon Valley or on Main Street, job-creating immigrants should be welcomed to the U.S. and not sent away to our competitors,\u201d the former mayor says in his plan.</p><p> Sanders\u2019 campaign said he would require employers to pay substantially higher wages for H-1B visa-holders, and make them portable between jobs \u201cso workers are not trapped at a sponsoring employer.\u201d He would also put in place tougher enforcement standards to ensure H-1B visa holders aren\u2019t replacing American workers.</p><p> In another reform, Buttigieg, Sanders and Steyer said they\u2019d allow the spouses of H-1B visa holders to work \u2014 a direct contrast with the Trump administration, which is moving to revoke spouses\u2019 work authorization.</p><p> Beyond H-1B visas, Biden and Bloomberg would both get rid of caps that limit how many employment-based green cards are given out each year to citizens of any one country, which have led to huge backlogs for immigrants from China and India. They\u2019d also set up procedures to adjust the number of employment visas available based on unemployment and other economic conditions in the U.S.</p><p> That\u2019s a smart idea for modernizing our immigration policy, said Sarah Pierce, an analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington.</p><p> \u201cWe need a system that\u2019s dynamic and responds to the market,

Sen. Bernie Sanders would go the furthest, proposing an investment of $2.5 trillion over 10 years to build and rehabilitate nearly 10 million affordable homes over the next decade. That\u2019s a staggering amount, considering the U.S. is building about 1.3 million housing units a year.</p><p> Sen. Elizabeth Warren would invest $500 billion, in what the accounting firm Moody\u2019s found would create more</p><p> than 3 million new affordable housing units and reduce rents by 10%. Former hedge fund chief Tom Steyer would spend $470 billion.</p><p> \u201cThe solutions and numbers may feel very big, and even overwhelming, but this is the scale of the problem,\u201d said David Zisser, the associate director of the affordable housing advocacy group Housing California. \u201cI suspect that $2.5 trillion (that Sanders is proposing) is probably about right.\u201d</p><p> Not surprisingly, the party\u2019s most progressive candidates would fund their fix by taxing the rich.</p><p> Warren would change the estate tax, while Sanders would use a wealth tax on the richest 0.1% of Americans. His plan also calls for a 25% house-flipping tax on non-owner-occupied property sold within five years of purchase, and a 2% tax on the value of vacant homes.</p><p> Experts warn throwing money at affordable housing won\u2019t go that far without also changing local zoning rules that limit where apartment buildings can be built.</p><p> Warren, Steyer and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg would give grants to cities that reform those zoning practices, while former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sanders would use a stick instead of a carrot, making federal housing or transportation funds to cities contingent on zoning reform.</p><p> Other candidates take a different tack by focusing on renters, with proposals from Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Bloomberg, Buttigieg, Sanders and others to greatly increase the availability of housing vouchers \u2014 federal funding helping low-income people pay their rent.</p><p> In one of the most drastic proposals, Sanders has called for a national rent-control law capping annual rent increases at 3% or 1.5 times the rate of inflation \u2014 more stringent than a similar California law passed last year \u2014 even though some experts warn that would stifle new housing construction. None of the other candidates support that idea.</p><p> But they do offer a variety of unique proposals. Buttigieg, for example, has put forward a program in which the federal government would give grants to cities to purchase abandoned or foreclosed homes and give them to low-income people who live in historically redlined or racially segregated areas. After 10 years of living in the home as their primary residence, the \u201chomesteader\u201d would fully own the property.</p><p> Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign says he would focus on policies that get homeless people into homes as quickly as possible instead of making shelter a condition of staying sober or participating in other programs.</p><p> And Warren would deny federal grants to police departments that arrest homeless people for living on the streets.</p><p> All of the candidates would go further than Trump, who has talked tough about cracking down on homelessness in California without laying out many specifics, cut funding for public housing repairs in his proposed budgets, and pushed state and local governments to cut regulations that get in the way of building affordable housing.</p><p> Fighting wildfires</p><p> All of the candidates have outlined policies to slash U.S. carbon emissions and fight climate change. But some have also focused on what the federal government can do to support California and other wildfire-prone Western states facing increasingly deadly and costly wildfires \u2014 many of which were sparked by damaged power lines from PG&amp;E and other utilities.</p><p> The president can play a big role in fighting wildfires in the state, because 57% of California forests are owned and managed by the feds.</p><p> Ken Pimlott, a former Cal Fire chief, said the federal government should be investing more on fire prevention efforts instead of just supporting the state after huge fires break out.</p><p> \u201cHistorically, it has been state and local governments working in these areas \u2014 but with the size of the problem we\u2019re facing, this is clearly a federal issue, too,\u201d Pimlott said.</p><p> Steyer \u2014 the only Californian still in the race \u2014 has called for spending a total of $130 billion on forest health and fire safety as well as other agricultural policies. The fires that have devastated communities around California \u201cserve as a reminder of how uncertain our future will be if we don\u2019t address the climate crisis immediately,\u201d Steyer said.</p><p> Bloomberg has come out with the most specific plan, calling for doubling federal funding to manage forests and to help communities protect themselves against fires to $10 billion, with half of that going to forest restoration and mitigation work. He would also increase Federal Emergency Management Agency funding for fireproofing homes.</p><p> Sanders is the only candidate who\u2019s called for a public takeover of the California utility giant Pacific Gas and Electric Co., criticizing the company for prioritizing corporate payouts over fire safety in an online video ad released last week.</p><p> Warren, Bloomberg and Klobuchar have called for federal investments in microgrid technology \u2014 energy systems disconnected from the main electricity grid \u2014 which experts say can help reduce fire risk and avoid the blackouts that plagued Northern California during last year\u2019s fire season.</p><p> Several of the candidates would start new programs to put more people to work defending against fires.</p><p> Bloomberg calls for a Wildfire Corps, a team of thousands of workers who would be trained in leading fire resilience work. Steyer has a similar proposal for a Civilian Climate Corps.</p><p> Trump has urged California to improve its forest management \u2014 memorably, calling for the state to \u201crake\u201d its forests \u2014 and approved disaster relief funds for communities devastated by fires. But he\u2019s done little to change the federal government\u2019s approach to wildfires.</p><p> Regulating Big Tech</p><p> The Democratic candidates agree that tech giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple have too much power. But they\u2019re divided on what to do about it.</p><p> Two contenders \u2014 Warren and Sanders \u2014 have endorsed breaking up those companies, in a seismic shift for Silicon Valley.</p><p> Warren has championed the idea, laying out a plan to break up companies with revenue of more than $25 billion that offer online marketplaces while participating on those platforms \u2014 like Amazon selling its own products.</p><p> That would bring balance to an industry where a few companies have \u201cbulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else,\u201d Warren argues in her plan.</p><p> The other candidates have called for a variety of new regulations on the tech industry and said they\u2019d be open to breaking up companies in some cases, but none would go as far as Warren or Sanders.</p><p> Biden said he would let the Justice Department, \u201cnot politics,\u201d decide which antitrust cases to bring. Bloomberg has said Warren and Sanders don\u2019t \u201cknow what they\u2019re talking about\u201d on the issue, although he\u2019d back some more limited breakups.</p><p> Several candidates also have  called for amending or ending laws related to online misinformation. Warren has proposed \u201ctough civil and criminal penalties\u201d for people who knowingly share false information about when and how to vote in U.S. elections.</p><p> Currently, under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, tech companies can\u2019t be held legally responsible for what their users post.</p><p> Biden has called for repealing that law, while Bloomberg has suggested he wants to amend it.</p><p> And many of the candidates have called for new regulations on data privacy, although there are few specifics.</p><p> Buttigieg wants to pass a federal privacy law that requires companies to limit and protect the user data they collect, while Klobuchar has suggested taxing companies that exploit user data.</p><p> What about President Trump? He has sounded off about bias among the big tech companies, and his Department of Justice has launched a major investigation into whether the firms have pushed anti-competitive policies.</p><p> Legal immigration and H-1B visas</p><p> All of the candidates have opposed Trump\u2019s crackdown on undocumented immigrants and called for an end to practices like separating migrant families at the border. But there\u2019s been far less conversation about reforming the legal immigration system, even though the large majority of immigrants in California and around the country enter the country legally.</p><p> Only a few of the candidates have weighed in on the issue of H-1B visas \u2014 the program that lets highly skilled foreigners work in the U.S. and has helped Silicon Valley companies recruit hundreds of thousands of employees. The program has faced uncertainty under Trump, and critics say it allows outsourcing companies to replace American workers with lower-paid foreigners.</p><p> Bloomberg and Steyer support raising the annual 85,000 cap on H-1B visas \u2014 a limit that\u2019s reached within days of applications opening each year. Klobuchar has also introduced legislation in the Senate to more than double the number of visas available.</p><p> Several of the candidates would pair those increases with reforms to the system. Bloomberg would raise the cap while putting in place \u201cstronger wage requirements\u201d and ensuring U.S. workers aren\u2019t displaced, and he\u2019s also proposing a \u201cstartup visa\u201d for international entrepreneurs, similar to a program in Canada.</p><p> \u201cWhether they are starting businesses in Silicon Valley or on Main Street, job-creating immigrants should be welcomed to the U.S. and not sent away to our competitors,\u201d the former mayor says in his plan.</p><p> Sanders\u2019 campaign said he would require employers to pay substantially higher wages for H-1B visa-holders, and make them portable between jobs \u201cso workers are not trapped at a sponsoring employer.\u201d He would also put in place tougher enforcement standards to ensure H-1B visa holders aren\u2019t replacing American workers.</p><p> In another reform, Buttigieg, Sanders and Steyer said they\u2019d allow the spouses of H-1B visa holders to work \u2014 a direct contrast with the Trump administration, which is moving to revoke spouses\u2019 work authorization.</p><p> Beyond H-1B visas, Biden and Bloomberg would both get rid of caps that limit how many employment-based green cards are given out each year to citizens of any one country, which have led to huge backlogs for immigrants from China and India. They\u2019d also set up procedures to adjust the number of employment visas available based on unemployment and other economic conditions in the U.S.</p><p> That\u2019s a smart idea for modernizing our immigration policy, said Sarah Pierce, an analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington.</p><p> \u201cWe need a system that\u2019s dynamic and responds to the market, instead of this ridiculous system that\u2019s been set in statute for decades,\u201d she said. \u201cThe process should be a lot more thoughtful.\u201d</p><p> Contact Casey Tolan at 510-208-6425.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDLNDF-4684525</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2896158A443F3F RDLNDF2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y73-W101-JBCN-418H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429766</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MediaNews Group, Inc. and Los Angeles Newspaper Group, Inc.

Sen. Bernie Sanders would go the furthest, proposing an investment of $2.5 trillion over 10 years to build and rehabilitate nearly 10 million affordable homes over the next decade. That\u2019s a staggering amount, considering the U.S. is building about 1.3 million housing units a year.</p><p> Sen. Elizabeth Warren would invest $500 billion, in what the accounting firm Moody\u2019s found would create more</p><p> than 3 million new affordable housing units and reduce rents by 10%. Former hedge fund chief Tom Steyer would spend $470 billion.</p><p> \u201cThe solutions and numbers may feel very big, and even overwhelming, but this is the scale of the problem,\u201d said David Zisser, the associate director of the affordable housing advocacy group Housing California. \u201cI suspect that $2.5 trillion (that Sanders is proposing) is probably about right.\u201d</p><p> Not surprisingly, the party\u2019s most progressive candidates would fund their fix by taxing the rich.</p><p> Warren would change the estate tax, while Sanders would use a wealth tax on the richest 0.1% of Americans. His plan also calls for a 25% house-flipping tax on non-owner-occupied property sold within five years of purchase, and a 2% tax on the value of vacant homes.</p><p> Experts warn throwing money at affordable housing won\u2019t go that far without also changing local zoning rules that limit where apartment buildings can be built.</p><p> Warren, Steyer and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg would give grants to cities that reform those zoning practices, while former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sanders would use a stick instead of a carrot, making federal housing or transportation funds to cities contingent on zoning reform.</p><p> Other candidates take a different tack by focusing on renters, with proposals from Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Bloomberg, Buttigieg, Sanders and others to greatly increase the availability of housing vouchers \u2014 federal funding helping low-income people pay their rent.</p><p> In one of the most drastic proposals, Sanders has called for a national rent-control law capping annual rent increases at 3% or 1.5 times the rate of inflation \u2014 more stringent than a similar California law passed last year \u2014 even though some experts warn that would stifle new housing construction. None of the other candidates support that idea.</p><p> But they do offer a variety of unique proposals. Buttigieg, for example, has put forward a program in which the federal government would give grants to cities to purchase abandoned or foreclosed homes and give them to low-income people who live in historically redlined or racially segregated areas. After 10 years of living in the home as their primary residence, the \u201chomesteader\u201d would fully own the property.</p><p> Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign says he would focus on policies that get homeless people into homes as quickly as possible instead of making shelter a condition of staying sober or participating in other programs.</p><p> And Warren would deny federal grants to police departments that arrest homeless people for living on the streets.</p><p> All of the candidates would go further than Trump, who has talked tough about cracking down on homelessness in California without laying out many specifics, cut funding for public housing repairs in his proposed budgets, and pushed state and local governments to cut regulations that get in the way of building affordable housing.</p><p> Fighting wildfires</p><p> All of the candidates have outlined policies to slash U.S. carbon emissions and fight climate change. But some have also focused on what the federal government can do to support California and other wildfire-prone Western states facing increasingly deadly and costly wildfires \u2014 many of which were sparked by damaged power lines from PG&amp;E and other utilities.</p><p> The president can play a big role in fighting wildfires in the state, because 57% of California forests are owned and managed by the feds.</p><p> Ken Pimlott, a former Cal Fire chief, said the federal government should be investing more on fire prevention efforts instead of just supporting the state after huge fires break out.</p><p> \u201cHistorically, it has been state and local governments working in these areas \u2014 but with the size of the problem we\u2019re facing, this is clearly a federal issue, too,\u201d Pimlott said.</p><p> Steyer \u2014 the only Californian still in the race \u2014 has called for spending a total of $130 billion on forest health and fire safety as well as other agricultural policies. The fires that have devastated communities around California \u201cserve as a reminder of how uncertain our future will be if we don\u2019t address the climate crisis immediately,\u201d Steyer said.</p><p> Bloomberg has come out with the most specific plan, calling for doubling federal funding to manage forests and to help communities protect themselves against fires to $10 billion, with half of that going to forest restoration and mitigation work. He would also increase Federal Emergency Management Agency funding for fireproofing homes.</p><p> Sanders is the only candidate who\u2019s called for a public takeover of the California utility giant Pacific Gas and Electric Co., criticizing the company for prioritizing corporate payouts over fire safety in an online video ad released last week.</p><p> Warren, Bloomberg and Klobuchar have called for federal investments in microgrid technology \u2014 energy systems disconnected from the main electricity grid \u2014 which experts say can help reduce fire risk and avoid the blackouts that plagued Northern California during last year\u2019s fire season.</p><p> Several of the candidates would start new programs to put more people to work defending against fires.</p><p> Bloomberg calls for a Wildfire Corps, a team of thousands of workers who would be trained in leading fire resilience work. Steyer has a similar proposal for a Civilian Climate Corps.</p><p> Trump has urged California to improve its forest management \u2014 memorably, calling for the state to \u201crake\u201d its forests \u2014 and approved disaster relief funds for communities devastated by fires. But he\u2019s done little to change the federal government\u2019s approach to wildfires.</p><p> Regulating Big Tech</p><p> The Democratic candidates agree that tech giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple have too much power. But they\u2019re divided on what to do about it.</p><p> Two contenders \u2014 Warren and Sanders \u2014 have endorsed breaking up those companies, in a seismic shift for Silicon Valley.</p><p> Warren has championed the idea, laying out a plan to break up companies with revenue of more than $25 billion that offer online marketplaces while participating on those platforms \u2014 like Amazon selling its own products.</p><p> That would bring balance to an industry where a few companies have \u201cbulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else,\u201d Warren argues in her plan.</p><p> The other candidates have called for a variety of new regulations on the tech industry and said they\u2019d be open to breaking up companies in some cases, but none would go as far as Warren or Sanders.</p><p> Biden said he would let the Justice Department, \u201cnot politics,\u201d decide which antitrust cases to bring. Bloomberg has said Warren and Sanders don\u2019t \u201cknow what they\u2019re talking about\u201d on the issue, although he\u2019d back some more limited breakups.</p><p> Several candidates also have  called for amending or ending laws related to online misinformation. Warren has proposed \u201ctough civil and criminal penalties\u201d for people who knowingly share false information about when and how to vote in U.S. elections.</p><p> Currently, under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, tech companies can\u2019t be held legally responsible for what their users post.</p><p> Biden has called for repealing that law, while Bloomberg has suggested he wants to amend it.</p><p> And many of the candidates have called for new regulations on data privacy, although there are few specifics.</p><p> Buttigieg wants to pass a federal privacy law that requires companies to limit and protect the user data they collect, while Klobuchar has suggested taxing companies that exploit user data.</p><p> What about President Trump? He has sounded off about bias among the big tech companies, and his Department of Justice has launched a major investigation into whether the firms have pushed anti-competitive policies.</p><p> Legal immigration and H-1B visas</p><p> All of the candidates have opposed Trump\u2019s crackdown on undocumented immigrants and called for an end to practices like separating migrant families at the border. But there\u2019s been far less conversation about reforming the legal immigration system, even though the large majority of immigrants in California and around the country enter the country legally.</p><p> Only a few of the candidates have weighed in on the issue of H-1B visas \u2014 the program that lets highly skilled foreigners work in the U.S. and has helped Silicon Valley companies recruit hundreds of thousands of employees. The program has faced uncertainty under Trump, and critics say it allows outsourcing companies to replace American workers with lower-paid foreigners.</p><p> Bloomberg and Steyer support raising the annual 85,000 cap on H-1B visas \u2014 a limit that\u2019s reached within days of applications opening each year. Klobuchar has also introduced legislation in the Senate to more than double the number of visas available.</p><p> Several of the candidates would pair those increases with reforms to the system. Bloomberg would raise the cap while putting in place \u201cstronger wage requirements\u201d and ensuring U.S. workers aren\u2019t displaced, and he\u2019s also proposing a \u201cstartup visa\u201d for international entrepreneurs, similar to a program in Canada.</p><p> \u201cWhether they are starting businesses in Silicon Valley or on Main Street, job-creating immigrants should be welcomed to the U.S. and not sent away to our competitors,\u201d the former mayor says in his plan.</p><p> Sanders\u2019 campaign said he would require employers to pay substantially higher wages for H-1B visa-holders, and make them portable between jobs \u201cso workers are not trapped at a sponsoring employer.\u201d He would also put in place tougher enforcement standards to ensure H-1B visa holders aren\u2019t replacing American workers.</p><p> In another reform, Buttigieg, Sanders and Steyer said they\u2019d allow the spouses of H-1B visa holders to work \u2014 a direct contrast with the Trump administration, which is moving to revoke spouses\u2019 work authorization.</p><p> Beyond H-1B visas, Biden and Bloomberg would both get rid of caps that limit how many employment-based green cards are given out each year to citizens of any one country, which have led to huge backlogs for immigrants from China and India. They\u2019d also set up procedures to adjust the number of employment visas available based on unemployment and other economic conditions in the U.S.</p><p> That\u2019s a smart idea for modernizing our immigration policy, said Sarah Pierce, an analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington.</p><p> \u201cWe need a system that\u2019s dynamic and responds to the market, instead of this ridiculous system that\u2019s been set in statute for decades,\u201d she said. \u201cThe process should be a lot more thoughtful.\u201d</p><p> Contact Casey Tolan at

Sen. Bernie Sanders would go the furthest, proposing an investment of $2.5 trillion over 10 years to build and rehabilitate nearly 10 million affordable homes over the next decade. That\u2019s a staggering amount, considering the U.S. is building about 1.3 million housing units a year.</p><p> Sen. Elizabeth Warren would invest $500 billion, in what the accounting firm Moody\u2019s found would create more</p><p> than 3 million new affordable housing units and reduce rents by 10%. Former hedge fund chief Tom Steyer would spend $470 billion.</p><p> \u201cThe solutions and numbers may feel very big, and even overwhelming, but this is the scale of the problem,\u201d said David Zisser, the associate director of the affordable housing advocacy group Housing California. \u201cI suspect that $2.5 trillion (that Sanders is proposing) is probably about right.\u201d</p><p> Not surprisingly, the party\u2019s most progressive candidates would fund their fix by taxing the rich.</p><p> Warren would change the estate tax, while Sanders would use a wealth tax on the richest 0.1% of Americans. His plan also calls for a 25% house-flipping tax on non-owner-occupied property sold within five years of purchase, and a 2% tax on the value of vacant homes.</p><p> Experts warn throwing money at affordable housing won\u2019t go that far without also changing local zoning rules that limit where apartment buildings can be built.</p><p> Warren, Steyer and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg would give grants to cities that reform those zoning practices, while former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sanders would use a stick instead of a carrot, making federal housing or transportation funds to cities contingent on zoning reform.</p><p> Other candidates take a different tack by focusing on renters, with proposals from Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Bloomberg, Buttigieg, Sanders and others to greatly increase the availability of housing vouchers \u2014 federal funding helping low-income people pay their rent.</p><p> In one of the most drastic proposals, Sanders has called for a national rent-control law capping annual rent increases at 3% or 1.5 times the rate of inflation \u2014 more stringent than a similar California law passed last year \u2014 even though some experts warn that would stifle new housing construction. None of the other candidates support that idea.</p><p> But they do offer a variety of unique proposals. Buttigieg, for example, has put forward a program in which the federal government would give grants to cities to purchase abandoned or foreclosed homes and give them to low-income people who live in historically redlined or racially segregated areas. After 10 years of living in the home as their primary residence, the \u201chomesteader\u201d would fully own the property.</p><p> Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign says he would focus on policies that get homeless people into homes as quickly as possible instead of making shelter a condition of staying sober or participating in other programs.</p><p> And Warren would deny federal grants to police departments that arrest homeless people for living on the streets.</p><p> All of the candidates would go further than Trump, who has talked tough about cracking down on homelessness in California without laying out many specifics, cut funding for public housing repairs in his proposed budgets, and pushed state and local governments to cut regulations that get in the way of building affordable housing.</p><p> Fighting wildfires</p><p> All of the candidates have outlined policies to slash U.S. carbon emissions and fight climate change. But some have also focused on what the federal government can do to support California and other wildfire-prone Western states facing increasingly deadly and costly wildfires \u2014 many of which were sparked by damaged power lines from PG&amp;E and other utilities.</p><p> The president can play a big role in fighting wildfires in the state, because 57% of California forests are owned and managed by the feds.</p><p> Ken Pimlott, a former Cal Fire chief, said the federal government should be investing more on fire prevention efforts instead of just supporting the state after huge fires break out.</p><p> \u201cHistorically, it has been state and local governments working in these areas \u2014 but with the size of the problem we\u2019re facing, this is clearly a federal issue, too,\u201d Pimlott said.</p><p> Steyer \u2014 the only Californian still in the race \u2014 has called for spending a total of $130 billion on forest health and fire safety as well as other agricultural policies. The fires that have devastated communities around California \u201cserve as a reminder of how uncertain our future will be if we don\u2019t address the climate crisis immediately,\u201d Steyer said.</p><p> Bloomberg has come out with the most specific plan, calling for doubling federal funding to manage forests and to help communities protect themselves against fires to $10 billion, with half of that going to forest restoration and mitigation work. He would also increase Federal Emergency Management Agency funding for fireproofing homes.</p><p> Sanders is the only candidate who\u2019s called for a public takeover of the California utility giant Pacific Gas and Electric Co., criticizing the company for prioritizing corporate payouts over fire safety in an online video ad released last week.</p><p> Warren, Bloomberg and Klobuchar have called for federal investments in microgrid technology \u2014 energy systems disconnected from the main electricity grid \u2014 which experts say can help reduce fire risk and avoid the blackouts that plagued Northern California during last year\u2019s fire season.</p><p> Several of the candidates would start new programs to put more people to work defending against fires.</p><p> Bloomberg calls for a Wildfire Corps, a team of thousands of workers who would be trained in leading fire resilience work. Steyer has a similar proposal for a Civilian Climate Corps.</p><p> Trump has urged California to improve its forest management \u2014 memorably, calling for the state to \u201crake\u201d its forests \u2014 and approved disaster relief funds for communities devastated by fires. But he\u2019s done little to change the federal government\u2019s approach to wildfires.</p><p> Regulating Big Tech</p><p> The Democratic candidates agree that tech giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple have too much power. But they\u2019re divided on what to do about it.</p><p> Two contenders \u2014 Warren and Sanders \u2014 have endorsed breaking up those companies, in a seismic shift for Silicon Valley.</p><p> Warren has championed the idea, laying out a plan to break up companies with revenue of more than $25 billion that offer online marketplaces while participating on those platforms \u2014 like Amazon selling its own products.</p><p> That would bring balance to an industry where a few companies have \u201cbulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else,\u201d Warren argues in her plan.</p><p> The other candidates have called for a variety of new regulations on the tech industry and said they\u2019d be open to breaking up companies in some cases, but none would go as far as Warren or Sanders.</p><p> Biden said he would let the Justice Department, \u201cnot politics,\u201d decide which antitrust cases to bring. Bloomberg has said Warren and Sanders don\u2019t \u201cknow what they\u2019re talking about\u201d on the issue, although he\u2019d back some more limited breakups.</p><p> Several candidates also have  called for amending or ending laws related to online misinformation. Warren has proposed \u201ctough civil and criminal penalties\u201d for people who knowingly share false information about when and how to vote in U.S. elections.</p><p> Currently, under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, tech companies can\u2019t be held legally responsible for what their users post.</p><p> Biden has called for repealing that law, while Bloomberg has suggested he wants to amend it.</p><p> And many of the candidates have called for new regulations on data privacy, although there are few specifics.</p><p> Buttigieg wants to pass a federal privacy law that requires companies to limit and protect the user data they collect, while Klobuchar has suggested taxing companies that exploit user data.</p><p> What about President Trump? He has sounded off about bias among the big tech companies, and his Department of Justice has launched a major investigation into whether the firms have pushed anti-competitive policies.</p><p> Legal immigration and H-1B visas</p><p> All of the candidates have opposed Trump\u2019s crackdown on undocumented immigrants and called for an end to practices like separating migrant families at the border. But there\u2019s been far less conversation about reforming the legal immigration system, even though the large majority of immigrants in California and around the country enter the country legally.</p><p> Only a few of the candidates have weighed in on the issue of H-1B visas \u2014 the program that lets highly skilled foreigners work in the U.S. and has helped Silicon Valley companies recruit hundreds of thousands of employees. The program has faced uncertainty under Trump, and critics say it allows outsourcing companies to replace American workers with lower-paid foreigners.</p><p> Bloomberg and Steyer support raising the annual 85,000 cap on H-1B visas \u2014 a limit that\u2019s reached within days of applications opening each year. Klobuchar has also introduced legislation in the Senate to more than double the number of visas available.</p><p> Several of the candidates would pair those increases with reforms to the system. Bloomberg would raise the cap while putting in place \u201cstronger wage requirements\u201d and ensuring U.S. workers aren\u2019t displaced, and he\u2019s also proposing a \u201cstartup visa\u201d for international entrepreneurs, similar to a program in Canada.</p><p> \u201cWhether they are starting businesses in Silicon Valley or on Main Street, job-creating immigrants should be welcomed to the U.S. and not sent away to our competitors,\u201d the former mayor says in his plan.</p><p> Sanders\u2019 campaign said he would require employers to pay substantially higher wages for H-1B visa-holders, and make them portable between jobs \u201cso workers are not trapped at a sponsoring employer.\u201d He would also put in place tougher enforcement standards to ensure H-1B visa holders aren\u2019t replacing American workers.</p><p> In another reform, Buttigieg, Sanders and Steyer said they\u2019d allow the spouses of H-1B visa holders to work \u2014 a direct contrast with the Trump administration, which is moving to revoke spouses\u2019 work authorization.</p><p> Beyond H-1B visas, Biden and Bloomberg would both get rid of caps that limit how many employment-based green cards are given out each year to citizens of any one country, which have led to huge backlogs for immigrants from China and India. They\u2019d also set up procedures to adjust the number of employment visas available based on unemployment and other economic conditions in the U.S.</p><p> That\u2019s a smart idea for modernizing our immigration policy, said Sarah Pierce, an analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington.</p><p> \u201cWe need a system that\u2019s dynamic and responds to the market, instead of this ridiculous system that\u2019s been set in statute for decades,\u201d she said. \u201cThe process should be a lot more thoughtful.\u201d</p><p> Contact Casey Tolan at 510-208-6425.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WHITDY-4685130</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289616D9A77F6F WHITDY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y74-B9K1-DXVP-V0DN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">279931</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MediaNews Group, Inc. and Los Angeles Newspaper Group, Inc.

Sen. Bernie Sanders would go the furthest, proposing an investment of $2.5 trillion over 10 years to build and rehabilitate nearly 10 million affordable homes over the next decade. That\u2019s a staggering amount, considering the U.S. is building about 1.3 million housing units a year.</p><p> Sen. Elizabeth Warren would invest $500 billion, in what the accounting firm Moody\u2019s found would create more</p><p> than 3 million new affordable housing units and reduce rents by 10%. Former hedge fund chief Tom Steyer would spend $470 billion.</p><p> \u201cThe solutions and numbers may feel very big, and even overwhelming, but this is the scale of the problem,\u201d said David Zisser, the associate director of the affordable housing advocacy group Housing California. \u201cI suspect that $2.5 trillion (that Sanders is proposing) is probably about right.\u201d</p><p> Not surprisingly, the party\u2019s most progressive candidates would fund their fix by taxing the rich.</p><p> Warren would change the estate tax, while Sanders would use a wealth tax on the richest 0.1% of Americans. His plan also calls for a 25% house-flipping tax on non-owner-occupied property sold within five years of purchase, and a 2% tax on the value of vacant homes.</p><p> Experts warn throwing money at affordable housing won\u2019t go that far without also changing local zoning rules that limit where apartment buildings can be built.</p><p> Warren, Steyer and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg would give grants to cities that reform those zoning practices, while former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sanders would use a stick instead of a carrot, making federal housing or transportation funds to cities contingent on zoning reform.</p><p> Other candidates take a different tack by focusing on renters, with proposals from Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Bloomberg, Buttigieg, Sanders and others to greatly increase the availability of housing vouchers \u2014 federal funding helping low-income people pay their rent.</p><p> In one of the most drastic proposals, Sanders has called for a national rent-control law capping annual rent increases at 3% or 1.5 times the rate of inflation \u2014 more stringent than a similar California law passed last year \u2014 even though some experts warn that would stifle new housing construction. None of the other candidates support that idea.</p><p> But they do offer a variety of unique proposals. Buttigieg, for example, has put forward a program in which the federal government would give grants to cities to purchase abandoned or foreclosed homes and give them to low-income people who live in historically redlined or racially segregated areas. After 10 years of living in the home as their primary residence, the \u201chomesteader\u201d would fully own the property.</p><p> Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign says he would focus on policies that get homeless people into homes as quickly as possible instead of making shelter a condition of staying sober or participating in other programs.</p><p> And Warren would deny federal grants to police departments that arrest homeless people for living on the streets.</p><p> All of the candidates would go further than Trump, who has talked tough about cracking down on homelessness in California without laying out many specifics, cut funding for public housing repairs in his proposed budgets, and pushed state and local governments to cut regulations that get in the way of building affordable housing.</p><p> Fighting wildfires</p><p> All of the candidates have outlined policies to slash U.S. carbon emissions and fight climate change. But some have also focused on what the federal government can do to support California and other wildfire-prone Western states facing increasingly deadly and costly wildfires \u2014 many of which were sparked by damaged power lines from PG&amp;E and other utilities.</p><p> The president can play a big role in fighting wildfires in the state, because 57% of California forests are owned and managed by the feds.</p><p> Ken Pimlott, a former Cal Fire chief, said the federal government should be investing more on fire prevention efforts instead of just supporting the state after huge fires break out.</p><p> \u201cHistorically, it has been state and local governments working in these areas \u2014 but with the size of the problem we\u2019re facing, this is clearly a federal issue, too,\u201d Pimlott said.</p><p> Steyer \u2014 the only Californian still in the race \u2014 has called for spending a total of $130 billion on forest health and fire safety as well as other agricultural policies. The fires that have devastated communities around California \u201cserve as a reminder of how uncertain our future will be if we don\u2019t address the climate crisis immediately,\u201d Steyer said.</p><p> Bloomberg has come out with the most specific plan, calling for doubling federal funding to manage forests and to help communities protect themselves against fires to $10 billion, with half of that going to forest restoration and mitigation work. He would also increase Federal Emergency Management Agency funding for fireproofing homes.</p><p> Sanders is the only candidate who\u2019s called for a public takeover of the California utility giant Pacific Gas and Electric Co., criticizing the company for prioritizing corporate payouts over fire safety in an online video ad released last week.</p><p> Warren, Bloomberg and Klobuchar have called for federal investments in microgrid technology \u2014 energy systems disconnected from the main electricity grid \u2014 which experts say can help reduce fire risk and avoid the blackouts that plagued Northern California during last year\u2019s fire season.</p><p> Several of the candidates would start new programs to put more people to work defending against fires.</p><p> Bloomberg calls for a Wildfire Corps, a team of thousands of workers who would be trained in leading fire resilience work. Steyer has a similar proposal for a Civilian Climate Corps.</p><p> Trump has urged California to improve its forest management \u2014 memorably, calling for the state to \u201crake\u201d its forests \u2014 and approved disaster relief funds for communities devastated by fires. But he\u2019s done little to change the federal government\u2019s approach to wildfires.</p><p> Regulating Big Tech</p><p> The Democratic candidates agree that tech giants like Facebook, Google, Amazon and Apple have too much power. But they\u2019re divided on what to do about it.</p><p> Two contenders \u2014 Warren and Sanders \u2014 have endorsed breaking up those companies, in a seismic shift for Silicon Valley.</p><p> Warren has championed the idea, laying out a plan to break up companies with revenue of more than $25 billion that offer online marketplaces while participating on those platforms \u2014 like Amazon selling its own products.</p><p> That would bring balance to an industry where a few companies have \u201cbulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else,\u201d Warren argues in her plan.</p><p> The other candidates have called for a variety of new regulations on the tech industry and said they\u2019d be open to breaking up companies in some cases, but none would go as far as Warren or Sanders.</p><p> Biden said he would let the Justice Department, \u201cnot politics,\u201d decide which antitrust cases to bring. Bloomberg has said Warren and Sanders don\u2019t \u201cknow what they\u2019re talking about\u201d on the issue, although he\u2019d back some more limited breakups.</p><p> Several candidates also have  called for amending or ending laws related to online misinformation. Warren has proposed \u201ctough civil and criminal penalties\u201d for people who knowingly share false information about when and how to vote in U.S. elections.</p><p> Currently, under section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, tech companies can\u2019t be held legally responsible for what their users post.</p><p> Biden has called for repealing that law, while Bloomberg has suggested he wants to amend it.</p><p> And many of the candidates have called for new regulations on data privacy, although there are few specifics.</p><p> Buttigieg wants to pass a federal privacy law that requires companies to limit and protect the user data they collect, while Klobuchar has suggested taxing companies that exploit user data.</p><p> What about President Trump? He has sounded off about bias among the big tech companies, and his Department of Justice has launched a major investigation into whether the firms have pushed anti-competitive policies.</p><p> Legal immigration and H-1B visas</p><p> All of the candidates have opposed Trump\u2019s crackdown on undocumented immigrants and called for an end to practices like separating migrant families at the border. But there\u2019s been far less conversation about reforming the legal immigration system, even though the large majority of immigrants in California and around the country enter the country legally.</p><p> Only a few of the candidates have weighed in on the issue of H-1B visas \u2014 the program that lets highly skilled foreigners work in the U.S. and has helped Silicon Valley companies recruit hundreds of thousands of employees. The program has faced uncertainty under Trump, and critics say it allows outsourcing companies to replace American workers with lower-paid foreigners.</p><p> Bloomberg and Steyer support raising the annual 85,000 cap on H-1B visas \u2014 a limit that\u2019s reached within days of applications opening each year. Klobuchar has also introduced legislation in the Senate to more than double the number of visas available.</p><p> Several of the candidates would pair those increases with reforms to the system. Bloomberg would raise the cap while putting in place \u201cstronger wage requirements\u201d and ensuring U.S. workers aren\u2019t displaced, and he\u2019s also proposing a \u201cstartup visa\u201d for international entrepreneurs, similar to a program in Canada.</p><p> \u201cWhether they are starting businesses in Silicon Valley or on Main Street, job-creating immigrants should be welcomed to the U.S. and not sent away to our competitors,\u201d the former mayor says in his plan.</p><p> Sanders\u2019 campaign said he would require employers to pay substantially higher wages for H-1B visa-holders, and make them portable between jobs \u201cso workers are not trapped at a sponsoring employer.\u201d He would also put in place tougher enforcement standards to ensure H-1B visa holders aren\u2019t replacing American workers.</p><p> In another reform, Buttigieg, Sanders and Steyer said they\u2019d allow the spouses of H-1B visa holders to work \u2014 a direct contrast with the Trump administration, which is moving to revoke spouses\u2019 work authorization.</p><p> Beyond H-1B visas, Biden and Bloomberg would both get rid of caps that limit how many employment-based green cards are given out each year to citizens of any one country, which have led to huge backlogs for immigrants from China and India. They\u2019d also set up procedures to adjust the number of employment visas available based on unemployment and other economic conditions in the U.S.</p><p> That\u2019s a smart idea for modernizing our immigration policy, said Sarah Pierce, an analyst with the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington.</p><p> \u201cWe need a system that\u2019s dynamic and responds to the market, instead of this ridiculous system that\u2019s been set in statute for decades,\u201d she said. \u201cThe process should be a lot more thoughtful.\u201d</p><p> Contact Casey Tolan at 510-208-6425.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TORDLY-4684476</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2897A487996360 TORDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y73-W101-JBCN-40SX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">429768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2032\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MediaNews Group, Inc. and Los Angeles Newspaper Group, Inc.

Freelance writers and journalists, specifically, face new caps on the number of submissions they can send to an employer each month for publication. Employers like Vox Media, are responding to AB5 by laying off freelance writers entirely. These workers want flexible work arrangements not the traditional employee arrangement that the state wants to force them into. We speak with Jennifer Van Laar, one writer who moved out of California to North Carolina because of AB5 about her experience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TRANSCRIPT</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Beverly Hallberg:</p><p>Hey, everyone. It's Beverly Hallberg. Welcome to a special pop up episode of She Thinks, your favorite podcast from the Independent Women's Forum where we talk with women and sometimes men about the policy issues that impact you and the people you care about most. Enjoy.</p><p>Patrice Onwuka:</p><p>Hi, everyone. I'm Patrice Onwuka, Senior Policy Analyst at the Independent Women's Forum. Welcome to a special pop up episode of She Thinks, your favorite podcast from the Independent Women's Forum where we talk with women and occasionally men about the policy issues that impact you and the people you care most about. Joining us today is Jennifer Van Laar. Currently she's Deputy Managing Editor of RedState.com, and she wrote this fascinating piece entitled Casualty of AB5: I'm Leaving California to Live in Exile in North Carolina. AB5 is a new law in California that will end up reclassifying thousands of workers as employees of companies that they work for rather than independent contractors. Now this is despite the fact that people enjoy being independent contractors or their own bosses. Today we're going to be talking about the impacts on AB5 on a specific group, freelance writers and journalists. Jennifer, welcome to the program.</p><p>Jennifer Van Laar:</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Patrice:</p><p>Terrific. Now tell us about what you do. Where do you write and what do you write about?</p><p>Jennifer:</p><p>For the bulk of my writing, I write at RedState where I'm Deputy Managing Editor. I also do some ghostwriting for different policy groups within California and political candidates.</p><p>Patrice:</p><p>Gotcha. I'm sure that puts a target on your back, but how long have you been a freelance writer?</p><p>Jennifer:</p><p>Since 2012 I've been a freelance writer. I moved back to my home state of California, to my hometown actually, when my dad was sick. He had had a stroke and was disabled, needed help, so I moved back. I was a court reporter in North Carolina, but due to other government regulations in California, I could not be a court reporter here. I changed careers and started at the bottom at age 40 in 2012 and worked my way up to where I am now.</p><p>Patrice:</p><p>Wow. What do you think is the biggest benefit of being a freelance writer versus that reporter that you used to be?</p><p>Jennifer:</p><p>The flexibility is completely the biggest benefit to it because I could not write when I didn't want to and just be able to do things with my son who has a learning disability. He's a junior in high school right now. He was in elementary school when we moved back here and I needed that ability to be home with him in the afternoon, to be able to go to IEP meetings, to be able to go to the school for things, and also like I mentioned, my dad was disabled and I needed to be able to go hang out with him whenever he needed extra care and go to the doctor with him. It was never on a schedule.</p><p>Patrice:</p><p>Well, you're speaking to many women, I think, who are caregivers, both of their children but also of their parents. That flexibility is definitely a value of the workplace that I hear from a lot of women being their number one concern. Now let's switch to AB5. Briefly, as I explained in the introduction, this bill would reclassify independent contractors, many of them, as employees of the companies they work for. It's based on kind of a legal case. I won't go into that. We have some resources on our website that does explain it, but in short it would have an unintended consequence of really forcing a lot of companies to turn people that they employ through contract work into full time employees, which would raise their costs, but it also has impacts on those independent contractors who actually want to be independent contractors. Jennifer, tell us, how did you first hear about AB5?</p><p>Jennifer:</p><p>I heard about AB5 in the spring of last year because I write about politics in California so it'd been on my radar. Everything I heard about it was Uber and Lyft, Uber and Lyft. Having worked in the court reporting industry before as a freelancer there too, they were talking about the Dynamex decision, which you referenced. I just didn't think it would impact me at all because it didn't, on the surface, seem like it would be anything that would affect a freelance writer.</p><p>Patrice:</p><p>But unfortunately it does. As you rightly said, the focus has been on the gig economy, like the Ubers and the Lyfts, those big tech platforms that tend to employ contract workers who some people consider as independent small business owners, and would really force them to make them employees, allowing them to get access to benefits, traditional employee benefits, and over time pay different types of compensation mandates that the state requires. It's interesting that it fell on your radar as an independent ... as a writer and as a journalist. I'm guessing it started to pick up steam in different circles that you move in. Do you think this is a conservative versus liberal issue or is this an issue that spans the political spectrum?</p><p>Jennifer:</p><p>As it stands now, it spans the political spectrum. When it started out, Lorena Gonzalez was so good at characterizing it as these Uber and Lyft drivers and some of these other gig economy people are being taken advantage of by these big corporations that make all this money. Then these people don't get minimum wage, they don't even ... If they get sick, they don't get paid, blah, blah, blah. She was very good at couching it in those terms, but now that a lot of people in Hollywood have been impacted too, whether it's musicians, photographers, videographers, writers, then they're starting to see just how insidious this bill is, because the onus is on us as a freelancer and the company to prove that we're not employees. The assumption is automatically that you are an employee unless you can fit into one of these exemptions. A lot of companies don't want to take that risk of Lorena then deciding, \"No, you did the wrong thing and we're going to fine you $20,000.\"</p><p>Patrice:</p><p>Oh, that's scary. I mean, I think we just saw a headline that Vox Media, which is a major media outlet, they have laid off 200 of their freelance writers because of this. They are saying that they're hiring maybe 20 full time employees and part time employees as writers, but there's no guarantee any of the 200 who were laid off would get those jobs. What happens to all of those freelance writers? Now you mentioned the bill's sponsor. She says that there is an outlet for you writers or journalists if you want to be able to continue to be an independent contractor. She said just form a corporation. Jennifer, why don't you just form a corporation?</p><p>Jennifer:</p><p>Well, she also said, \"Well, you can still be a sole proprietor and do this,\" but she then posts on Twitter, and I say it's a 10 point list, but I honestly have not counted them, \"Oh, if you want to be classified as a \"real business\" then you just have to satisfy all these requirements.\" They're subjective. Some of them are objective requirements, but they could be interpreted different ways. There's a couple reasons why just incorporating doesn't work for me and for a lot of other people. First, in California, just to have an LLC, it's minimum $800 tax. Then you pretty much have to have an attorney or an accountant that you've retained every year to make sure that you're not running afoul of one of the hundreds of other regulations in California. You have to buy a business license in your town. Right from your couch, you have to go buy a business license.</p><p>Jennifer:</p><p>She also ... One of the requirements though of being a, quote, real business, in her eyes is that you have to write for multiple outlets. Well, what if I don't want to? Why do I have to write for numerous outlets or numerous clients to be a legitimate business? The other thing, since I do write about politics and I do antagonize politicians on social media and in the articles I write, I don't want them to have the ability to decide they're going to target me, like liberals have been known to do, and start auditing me or start going after me to hassle me using the resources at their disposal, meaning the government.</p><p>Patrice:</p><p>Jennifer, you laid out three really compelling reasons and concerns with AB5, particularly for freelance writers, one being the increased cost of just starting a business, an LLC or a corporation, if you wanted to do that. Then there's the red tape and the hoops that you have to jump through. Third, there's the potential for political backlash because of the types of writing that you do. Let's elevate this a little bit broader to what this means for journalism. I mean, certainly we've seen how the internet has proliferated the number of opportunities that writers have to amplify their voice and cover lots of topics, but what happens if something like AB5 spreads to other states?</p><p>Jennifer:</p><p>In my mind it has a chilling effect on the freedom of the press and First Amendment rights because you're only going to have a limited number of places where you can write these things or get your story out. Say in politics we're limited to The Hill and Politico and maybe a couple of other outlets to get stories out and they only have W2 writers. Well, that's going to have this whole structure where you're going to basically be told what you can and can't write on. Anyone who says that that doesn't happen is lying. You're not going to have investigative journalism and the whole new media, Breitbart, everything that he started, that's going to be gone, which I don't think is necessarily an unintended consequence of this kind of bill.</p><p>Jennifer:</p><p>In my case, I'm the writer who broke the Katie Hill story this year, which led to her resignation, and that would have never come out if AB5 [inaudible 00:10:46]. I say that not as anything personal on that politician, but I think a job of the media is to hold our leaders accountable. If we don't have the ability to use our voice to do that, our whole country's going to be in a bad place.</p><p>Patrice:</p><p>That's a great point you talked about there, Jennifer, the fact that we need a diversity of voices when it comes to journalism and reporting, because a lot of these major outlets for one reason or another will choose what they cover and how they cover different types of news. That leaves a lot of Americans in the dark on issues of local and national significance. We need independent journalism that's not just based on employees of a particular media company, but we need the voices that are in the wilderness crying out against injustices or bringing accountability just as we need the bigger national stories from the big national outlets. Thank you for shedding some on what the future could look like because of AB5. We'll wrap up with this question. Jennifer, do you think AB5 is going to come to other states or do you think this can be defeated? If defeated, how can it be defeated? What can we do?</p><p>Jennifer:</p><p>Forms of it are already being introduced in New Jersey and New York that I know of. There's a bill in Congress that was amended in December, and I'm still getting all the details on that, to add language similar to AB5 on a national level. It's definitely coming to a state near you. I hope that AB5 can be repealed. I'm working with a coalition of liberal and conservative and everything in between here in California to work on getting that repealed and seeing what we could do there. I wish I had all of the answers for it, but all I'm going to do is every day work to get this repealed so that people can choose when and where and how they exchange their labor for money.</p><p>Patrice:</p><p>Jennifer, we appreciate your efforts. At the Independent Women's Forum, we're keeping an eye on this issue. We actually are soliciting stories from other freelance writers or independent contractors in HR and every and any other industry who's been hurt by this. We want to see those stories. We're going to be amplifying them, sharing them, so that hopefully that helps the efforts that you're doing, Jennifer, but also other efforts to push back on AB5 and other legislation popping up in different states. Jennifer, thank you for joining us today.</p><p>Jennifer:</p><p>Thank you for having me.</p><p>Patrice:</p><p>Terrific.

After two months of lockdown he emailed his employees to say that they could stay away from the office and </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/twitter-staff-allowed-to-work-home-forever-l7tkf0hm9\">keep working from home</url></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> if they wanted. For ever.</p><p>California has always had an outsized presence in the American imagination, amplified by its century-old self-image as the place where the futures of work, leisure, transport and communities are dreamt up. Hollywood and Silicon Valley give it enormous global reach. The mayor of Los Angeles, Eric Garcetti, crystallised the moment of flux thrown up by Covid-19 when he said in April: \"Is normal really what we want to come back to?\"</p><p>Many Californians have a one-word answer and have been busy planning for a more idealistic future, with proposals to empty prisons, slash homelessness, improve internet access for poorer households and boost voter turnout.</p><p>Some big changes pushed by activists for years have already happened. About 3,500 inmates have been released from state prisons since February due to fears of a coronavirus outbreak and a need to cut costs. The jail population is down by 45 per cent in some counties and by an additional 20,000 overall, largely because the state scrapped cash bail for most criminal charges.</p><p>\"I don't see us going back to the old days,\" said George Gasc\u00f3n, a former San Francisco police chief now running to be district attorney in Los Angeles who has campaigned against mass incarceration. \"Crime hasn't gone up. It's going to be harder to argue that you have to incarcerate at the level that we were.\"</p><p>He added: \"California tends to lead the way in many things. There are gonna be conversations that were viewed as radically left a few months ago that are not going to be that way anymore.\"</p><p>Other seemingly intractable social problems have been put in reverse. Project Roomkey, a state effort to move the most vulnerable of California's 150,000 homeless people off the streets, has found shelter for thousands in empty hotels, motels and other spaces.</p><p>\"It happened more immediately than anything I could have imagined before, with a sense of urgency that we needed a long time ago but finally came because of the Covid-19,\" Andy Bales, who runs the Union Rescue Mission in Skid Row, downtown Los Angeles, said.</p><p>However, he fears that a unique opportunity to make enduring change may be missed. \"I don't believe there's been an upgrade in overall infrastructure yet to make the changes last.\"</p><p>Nowhere in America is more associated with vast wealth or left-wing thinking than California. (There are pockets of conservatism but the state's governor, both its senators and 45 of its 52 members of the House of Representatives are all Democrats.)</p><p>At the same time it has the worst poverty rate of any American state by some measures. Technology companies have donated hundreds of thousands of free wifi connections and tens of thousands of devices to help disadvantaged pupils learn at home during the lockdown. But state politicians believe they can use the crisis to increase pressure on internet service providers to do more for the fifth of children - about 1.2 million - who lack the device or high-speed connection to benefit from remote learning.</p><p>California may be self-consciously trying to lead the way out of the pandemic. It also led the country into the outbreak, not that anyone realised at the time. Patricia Dowd, a 57-year-old auditor at a semiconductor manufacturer in San Jose, dropped dead in her kitchen on February 6 after developing flu-like symptoms. In April tissue samples confirmed that she had coronavirus, making her America's earliest known victim.</p><p>Since her death state officials have been largely effective in managing the pandemic by tackling it early and decisively and by emphasising science over politics. The state's 4,900 deaths are only a few hundred more than the toll in Connecticut, which has less than a tenth as many people.</p><p>The governor, Gavin Newsom, has seen his approval rating increase from 53 per cent in February to 65 per cent in a poll last week. He introduced the </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/twitter-staff-allowed-to-work-home-forever-l7tkf0hm9\">first statewide lockdown</url></p><p> in the country, on March 19, three days after several Bay Area counties imposed the first mandatory stay-home order for a US metropolitan area.</p><p>His regular public briefings have been notable for their refusal to sugar-coat the seriousness of the crisis or indulge in magical thinking about an easy resumption of normal life. Mr Newsom, 52, has trusted his expert advisers, worked closely with governors of other western states and built partial consensus for a slow and data-driven reopening strategy.</p><p>To ease partisan tensions he largely stopped criticising President Trump, his favourite political punchbag before coronavirus, until anger at Mr Trump's \"shameful\" response to the protests over the death of </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/twitter-staff-allowed-to-work-home-forever-l7tkf0hm9\">George Floyd</url></p><p> provoked him to resume hostilities last week.</p><p>Democratic activists and politicians have pressed for years for an expansion of postal voting to make democracy more accessible. Some Republicans, including Mr Trump, have complained without substantial evidence that it encourages electoral fraud.</p><p>Mr Newsom has seized the moment, ordering each of California's 58 counties to automatically post a ballot for November's presidential election to all registered voters to protect public health and voting rights.</p><p>A new Great Depression stands to cost California as much as any other state, if not more. Its population of roughly 40 million is bigger than that of Canada, Australia or Poland. If it were an independent nation it would be the fifth largest economy in the world, with a GDP larger than 25 other US states combined.</p><p>Its economy is hugely diversified; it includes the nation's largest agriculture sector, tourism industry, port system, entertainment industry and public university system.</p><p>By early May 24 per cent of workers in Los Angeles were out of employment, roughly equal to peak joblessness in the 1930s. The latest figures shows statewide unemployment was at 15.5 per cent in April.</p><p>However, technology jobs in San Francisco and in Santa Clara county (which largely overlaps with Silicon Valley in geography) fell by only 3 to 4 per cent. This resilience of California's most lucrative industry is likely to lead the state economy out of the pandemic - for good and ill.</p><p>Big Tech was </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/twitter-staff-allowed-to-work-home-forever-l7tkf0hm9\">on the rack</url></p><p> before coronavirus arrived. The justice department was reviewing \"market-leading platforms\". Congress was pressing for tougher regulation and some Democratic presidential candidates were calling for companies like Amazon and Facebook to be broken up.</p><p>Now those companies are enjoying a rise in public trust and governments have leant on their support for contact tracing.</p><p>The industry is already reimagining the workplace for their workforces in America and beyond. Facebook and Google have followed Twitter in saying that they are exploring moves for employees to work from home, albeit less ambitious ones.</p><p>These companies and their predecessors in the Eighties and Nineties have already transformed the world of white-collar work many times, according to Margaret O'Mara, a history professor at the University of Washington who wrote a book on how Silicon Valley reshaped America. They altered \"the ideal of what a business leader looks like\" and expectations of what an aspirational office environment should be, she said, with \"ping pong tables, climbing walls and free food\" that are thought to boost recruitment and discourage employees from ever going home.</p><p>The pandemic has provided an unexpected opportunity for another reassessment, a \"giant real-time experiment in working from home\".</p><p>The consequences of a shift towards remote working would ripple into rural areas that would suddenly become viable bases for tech workers. Employers around the world would follow suit, Dr O'Mara predicts, because, despite the backlash of recent years, it is still \"hard to shake the allure of Silicon Valley as a model.\"</p><p>The impact on workers would be uncertain. Employers could pay less to people in rural Montana than in San Francisco. The pre-pandemic Silicon Valley also contributed heavily to the global erosion of work-life balance. \"How do you create a work culture that allows people to turn off, even if they're physically working and living in the same space?\" asked Dr O'Mara. Solving that \"would be a useful problem for the tech companies to set themselves\".</p><p>While lockdown has led Big Tech to connect remote workers and families, it has also exacerbated the fragmentation of public discourse. Our dependency on companies such as Facebook and Google are \"tearing apart our shared social fabric\", Aza Raskin, a co-founder of the influential non-profit Centre for Humane Technology, said.</p><p>Because users are spending much more time viewing the world through the distorting lenses of their social media feeds, everything that made disinformation alarming before is \"exponentially\" more so now, Mr Raskin said.\"If California is going to lead a post-pandemic world, [technology companies] have to take responsibility for being the constructors of our social worlds,\" he said. That means \"standing for values as opposed to pretending that they are neutral.\"</p><p>There are tentative signs that the turmoil of 2020 could inspire a reset. Facebook, Twitter and Youtube (owned by Google) have removed posts by President Bolsonaro of Brazil because they spread coronavirus misinformation. Twitter has flagged tweets by Mr Trump that were deemed to be misleading about postal voting or to glorify violence against Black Lives Matter protesters; Facebook's staff rebelled against Mark Zuckerberg for declining to take a similar stand.</p><p>Such moves are \"a very first step\" towards the companies accepting responsibility \"for the effects that they already have,\" Mr Raskin said. The most likely outcome, as he sees it, is that the sector's biggest players won't change tack because they won't have to. After the last financial crisis California, and the tech sector in particular, helped to lead the nation's recovery. In Silicon Valley, recession stimulates innovation.</p><p>\"It's a boom and bust economy there,\" Dr O'Mara said. \"Its obituary has been prematurely written five or six times, whether it be the defence industry at the end of the Cold War or the dotcom bust. There's always something. These crises create space. They force people to reinvent themselves and provide market opportunity for new entrants.\"</p><p>Twenty years ago an upstart search engine company supercharged its growth by snapping up cheap jobless engineers and second-hand computers in the aftermath of the dotcom bust. In 2003 it moved into the vast headquarters that become known as the Googleplex. Last month Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, offered every one of the parent company's almost 120,000 global staff a sweetener to help with the next few months: $1,000 each to spend on their home offices.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TTIMWB-63604535</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TTIMWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6043-49Y1-JCJY-G1DP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382503</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1856\"/><timeReceived>5:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News International Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>thetimes.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"19719\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 12, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

Though federal laws of that nature are still a ways off (if they come about at all), California has heard the call and acted upon it. </p><p>In 2018, the state passed the California Consumer Privacy Ac[1]t (CCPA), which lays out many GDPR-like data rights for consumers. For example, users can request a copy of all the personal information a big tech company has collected about, order the deletion of said data, or demand that the data not be sold. Compared to the data privacy protections US consumers have enjoyed up to this point (which are scant), the CCPA represents a significant step forward. However, it should be noted that it still isn't quite as strict as the GDPR.For example, CCPA fines cap out at $7,500 per intentional infraction ($2,500 for accidents). In contrast, GDPR fines can go up to 20 million pounds or four percent of a firm's annual revenue (whichever is higher). Further, the CCPA will only be enforced against businesses that meet certain criteria. For a company to be affected, they must collect data on more than 50,000 consumers, earn gross annual revenue of more than $25 million, or earn 50 percent (or more) of their revenue from the sale of consumer data.A few limitations aside, the CCPA officially took effect yesterday, which was January 1, 2020. Though the regulations technically only protect California residents, at least a few prominent tech companies will likely apply the rules to their entire userbases (as many did with the GDPR). Indeed, Microsoft and Mozilla have already pledged to do so.There are a few possible reasons for that decision, but generally speaking, it's easier for giant corporations to apply these sorts of rules universally instead of selectively enforcing them. As an added bonus, a company that does decide to go that route will probably earn itself some positive PR. If you have any thoughts on the CCPA or data privacy in general, feel free to sound off in the comments.Masthead credit: Shutterstock[2] Related Reads  Share this article:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techspot.com/news/83385-california-consumer-privacy-act-has-taken-effect-bringing.html#Share\">https://www.techspot.com/news/83385-california-consumer-privacy-act-has-taken-effect-bringing.html#Share</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.techspot.com/news/83385-california-consumer-privacy-act-has-taken-effect-bringing.html...le=California's%20Consumer%20Privacy%20Act%20has%20taken%20effect,%20bringing%20GDPR-like%20data%20protections%20to%20the%20US\">https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https://www.techspot.com/news/83385-california-consumer-privacy-act-has-taken-effect-bringing.html...le=California's%20Consumer%20Privacy%20Act%20has%20taken%20effect,%20bringing%20GDPR-like%20data%20protections%20to%20the%20US</url> [ 1]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB375\">https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB375</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/person-using-laptop-computer-data-protection-1553287025\">https://www.shutterstock.com/image-photo/person-using-laptop-computer-data-protection-1553287025</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TSPT133881157801444312225876100186</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TSPT-133881</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWN-T3Y1-JCMN-Y1D0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"477\"/><timeReceived>1:20 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>TechSpot</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 3, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000D7EQ</classCode><className>SHUTTERSTOCK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

For example, users can request a copy of all the personal information a big tech company has collected about, order the deletion of said data, or demand that the data not be sold.</p><p><br/>Compared to the data privacy protections US consumers have enjoyed up to this point (which are scant), the CCPA represents a significant step forward. However, it should be noted that it still isn't quite as strict as the GDPR.<br/>For example, CCPA fines cap out at $7,500 per intentional infraction ($2,500 for accidents). In contrast, GDPR fines can go up to 20 million pounds or four percent of a firm's annual revenue (whichever is higher). Further, the CCPA will only be enforced against businesses that meet certain criteria. For a company to be affected, they must collect data on more than 50,000 consumers, earn gross annual revenue of more than $25 million, or earn 50 percent (or more) of their revenue from the sale of consumer data.<br/>A few limitations aside, the CCPA officially took effect yesterday, which was January 1, 2020. Though the regulations technically only protect California residents, at least a few prominent tech companies will likely apply the rules to their entire userbases (as many did with the GDPR). Indeed, Microsoft and Mozilla have already pledged to do so.<br/>There are a few possible reasons for that decision, but generally speaking, it's easier for giant corporations to apply these sorts of rules universally instead of selectively enforcing them. As an added bonus, a company that does decide to go that route will probably earn itself some positive PR.<br/>If you have any thoughts on the CCPA or data privacy in general, feel free to sound off in the comments.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-M-466202</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWP-H7S1-JBYT-H2G2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"302\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 3, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002QN2</classCode><className>MICROSOFT CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>MSFT (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000445</classCode><className>DATA PROTECTION LAWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X57</classCode><className>CONSUMER LAW</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDJBNDY2Rjc3Mzk4NDI3NUJDOTlCQTRCNzE2M0IwRTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REEyRTNDM0JGQzYyNEMyOEFGNTAwNUJEOUU1MDg4NjU</classCode><className>Consumer Protection</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001384</classCode><className>PRIVACY RIGHTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUVFRDk5RDc1NUQ4NDE3MTk4REUxMzZEOTFGOTA5ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRCNkMxMjQzMDUxNEZCQ0I4QTkyQzJDOUYwNTA4NjE</classCode><className>Privacy Rights</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000963</classCode><className>INTERNET PRIVACY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000722</classCode><className>FINES &amp;

The final version of the landmark CCPA, which California Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to sign into law by Oct. 13, gives internet users the ability to see what information is collected about them and stop that data from being sold. </p><p>It empowers California's attorney general to penalize the worst offenders.  However, it does not cover scenarios such as third parties gaining unfettered access to mountains of data, as Cambridge Analytica infamously did with Facebook Inc.  FB, -0.31%[1], according to Samantha Corbin, a Sacramento, Calif., lobbyist representing the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Common Sense Media, Privacy Rights Clearinghouse and American Civil Liberties Union on the issue. Real-estate developer Alastair Mactaggart, who spent $3.1 million of his own fortune to make CCPA happen, worked on the law for two years after California voters approved it in the 2016 election. The fight since passage included contending with tech giants like Facebook, Alphabet Inc.'s  GOOGL, -2.17%[2] ( GOOG, -2.16%[3] Google, and Uber Technologies Inc.UBER, -0.07%[4] \u2014 all of which unsuccessfully sought to soften it with amendments before the state legislature adjourned Sept. 13. California will be the first government in the U.S. to regulate how businesses retain and use electronic consumer data, but at least 15 other states have introduced legislation similar to the act. CCPA goes to the heart of the digital economy, and how data is amassed and used by many of its largest players based in California such as Facebook and Uber (About 99% of Facebook's $56 billion in revenue last year came from ad revenue, gleaned in large part from personal data.) CCPA is beginning to crop up in the risk section of the prospectuses of IPO candidates, and the name is being uttered during quarterly financial conference calls. Read: A watered-down version of California's data-privacy law is a possibility, privacy experts warn[5]  'I've realized the immense power consumers are up against when it comes to having true control over their own data,' Mactaggart told MarketWatch in a phone interview. Read now: The millionaire behind California's landmark privacy law wants to get even tougher on Big Tech[6]  Representatives from Facebook and Google did not respond to email messages seeking comment.'GDPR lite'In its final form, CCPA mirrors the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) with one key difference: It defines 'personal information' more expansively and offers opt-out rights, earning it the nickname 'GDPR lite.'  While there was some concern about the effects of GDPR on Big Tech companies, analysts say investors don't have much to worry about from California's privacy act. Precise rules on data management would offer guide rails \u2014 and possibly fines \u2014 but a clearer road map for their long-term business plans, says Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives. Legislation and federal probes will have a minimal material financial impact, he said. 'We reiterate our opinion that [federal regulation and investigations are] more noise vs. the start of broader structural changes across the tech food chain and will likely result in business model tweaks and potential DOJ/FTC fines (in the billions of dollars) in a worst-case scenario rather than forced breakups of the underlying businesses,' Ives said in a Sept. 27 note. 'There will be a lot of doomsday predictions and scares, but ultimately we see fines,' Ives told MarketWatch. Case in point, Facebook. Despite being hammered with a record $5 billion fine for its privacy practices from the FTC in July[7], Facebook shares are up 34% this year. Investors continue to be sold on the company's financial performance, including second-quarter revenue [8]of $16.9 billion, up 28% from the year-ago period.  There were some 11th-hour additions to CCPA that could ease businesses' compliance efforts around employee data for at least a year. (One bill that did not make the cut would have expanded consumer rights to file civil lawsuits in the event of an alleged CCPA violation.) The additions do not alter CCPA's general purpose: To give Web users the ability to see what information is collected about them and stop that data from being sold, as well as empowering California's attorney general to penalize the worst offenders. However, it does not cover scenarios such as third-parties gaining unfettered access to mountains of data, as Cambridge Analytica infamously did with Facebook, according to Samantha Corbin, a Sacramento, Calif., lobbyist representing EFF, Common Sense Media, Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, and the ACLU on the issue. Indeed, the last-minute tweaks to CCPA by the legislature, while minor, impact Big Tech and other collectors of massive troves of data.How the changes affect businesses Limited exemption for employment-related personal information. Businesses would be exempt for one year - until Jan. 1, 2021 - from being required to respond to consumers' requests for access to or deletion of the employment-related data the business collects and uses solely in an employment context. The California Employment Lawyers Association (CELA) has strongly opposed the bill, AB 25, one of the more controversial proposed amendments to CCPA, out of concern it will do little to stop workplace surveillance and data tracking of employees. It pointed to a letter from a coalition of 16 labor and employee rights groups including the ACLU of California and SEIU California. 'We need to protect the data rights of workers and excluding them from this bill \u2014 with no plans to include them in an alternative system \u2014 would be a significant step in the wrong direction,' they said in a June letter to state Assemblyman Edwin Chau, D-San Gabriel Valley, chairman of the Assembly Privacy and Consumer Protection Committee.  A CELA spokeswoman said it hopes the data rights of employees are more strongly addressed in future legislation. Limited exemption for personal information collected in a business-to-business context (AB 1355). Businesses would be exempt for one year - until Jan. 1, 2021 - from the requirements to provide notice or extend other CCPA rights to consumers who act in their capacity as representatives of another business in certain contexts. Clarification of Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) exemption (1355). The current exemption for data regulated by FCRA would be clarified. The amendments would remove the previous reference to the 'sale' of consumer report information and make it clear that any 'activity' subject to the FCRA would be exempt from the CCPA.  A wild card in all this is that CCPA allows California Attorney General Xavier Becerra to issue regulations specifically around requests for information on households \u2014 an issue that has vexed businesses since the CCPA's passage.The post California's landmark privacy law: What it does, what has changed and what it means for investors[9] appeared first on Financial Press - Breaking Stock Market News[10].

It requires businesses that collect consumer data to give consumers access to that data and allow them to refuse its sale to third parties. Consumers may also request that companies delete the data associated with them.</p><p>\"Every Californian deserves to have safe and secure knowledge of their personal information,\" Kabateck said. \"But this law, unfortunately, has more problems than solutions, and it's going to add to an Armageddon of confusion and devastation for small businesses in the Golden State.\"</p><p>\"They may thinkthey're smacking it to the big guys,\" he said. \"But it's a lot of these already fragile, already struggling business owners that are already feeling the confusion and fear and frustration with this law.\"</p><p>According to NFIB, which represents over 15,000 members in California, small businesses must pay three times more than larger corporations to comply with the law.</p><p>A report prepared by Berkeley Economic Advising and Research for the Attorney General's Office found that small businesses with fewer than 20 employees are going to be on the hook for a minimum of $50,000 per year in compliance costs.</p><p>\"Let's not forget: most small businesses don't have legal teams, HR departments, administrative teams, and IT divisions to help them sift through this massive law,\" Kabateck said.</p><p>\"Mom-and-pops, which make up most of the state, don't have those resources at their fingertips, and at the end of the day, they're going to have to pay through the nose [in order to] comply and understand this.\"</p><p>The Berkeley report estimated that the initial annual cost of compliance for businesses statewide would be $55 billion-the equivalent of 1.8 percent of California's gross state product in 2018.</p><p>Challenges to Interpreting the Law</p><p>Legal experts have started to consider how the law might be interpreted and have identified parts that are unclear.</p><p>\"One [challenge] is just understanding what 'personal information' is,\" said Joseph Lazzarotti, chair of the Privacy, Data, and Cybersecurity Practice Group at the firm Jackson Lewis.</p><p>\"When you look at the definition of personal information, [the Privacy Act] said [it's] basically any information that can be linked to an individual. Well, what does that mean? How far does that go? One ofthe amendments added 'reasonably' connected. Maybe that kind of contains it, but again it's not as clear as it can be.\"</p><p>\"This is the first law of its kind in the United States, so there will need to be some period of time where companies ... absorb the rules and understand how they work in practice.\"</p><p>\"Of course, a lot of questions will come up during that process as well. It just takes time, and that's the reality.\"</p><p>Reece Hirsch, co-head of privacy and cybersecurity practice at Morgan Lewis in San Francisco, said there are a number of areas where the law would benefit from clarification.</p><p>\"One important area is this definition of a 'sell.' Because, as currently written, it could include a broad range of uses of data by third parties,\" he said.</p><p>\"For example, the developed algorithms for artificial intelligence purposes, or for the delivery of online advertising, which is a huge industry [that could be] impacted by some of the new restrictions.\"</p><p>\"The dust has definitely not settled on the [Privacy Act] yet.\"</p><p>\"Businesses [are] in a bit ofan uncomfortable bind because they're striving to comply, but they don't know all the rules yet.\"</p><p>Enforcement</p><p>Hayley Tsukayama, a legislative analyst for the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation, said the timeline for implementation is unusual. The law took effect on Jan. 1, but the attorney general's regulations on how to enforce the law won't be finalized until July.</p><p>According to Tsukayama, the Privacy Act is a huge step forward, but not perfect. She believes the law would benefit from stronger enforcement.</p><p>\"Right now, the [Privacy Act] centralizes all enforcement in the Attorney General's Office, which has a small staff of privacy-focused personnel,\" she said.</p><p>\"We'd like to see enforcement expanded-ideally with a private right of action-so that every individual can sue companies for violating any of their ... privacy rights [covered by the Act].\"</p><p>Tsukayama said that the Electronic Frontier Foundation worked with legislators early in the 2019 session. The Foundation wanted to include an additional element to the law aimed at further empowering consumers, but that element didn't make it in.</p><p>\"Right now, consumers have the right to ask companies to stop selling their information-that's huge,\" she said. \"But the law we proposed would have required companies to make the requests: to come to you before they sold your information.\"</p><p>In Kabateck's view, an ideal iteration of the Privacy Act would strike a better balance between consumer and business interests.</p><p>\"Laws like this need to work for consumers and small businesses alike,\" he said.</p><p>Kabateck strongly advises small business owners to seek professional legal counsel when it comes to compliance.</p><p>\"We're just trying to make sure we can get them educated,\" he said. \"And [we're] trying to find ways to fix this terrible law.\"</p><p>Mom-and-pops, which make up most of the state, don't have those resources at their fingertips, and at the end of the day, they're going to have to pay through the nose pn order to] comply and understand this.</p><p>John Kabateck, California state director, National Federation of Independent

And yet, today, personal data is more valuable to companies than oil, and data breaches are occurring at an ever-increasing rate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As companies scramble to prepare for the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), taking effect on Jan. 1, I've come to see that companies should not approach compliance as a chore. Rather, privacy must be considered a core feature of any consumer product. Truly, deeply respecting consumer privacy \u2014 not just giving it lip service or doing the minimum to meet regulations \u2014 represents a significant business opportunity to build trust, expand revenue streams and set the stage for global market success.</p><p> The CCPA is a hotly contested piece of legislation among both consumers and business owners. Some companies would prefer that the online world continue to operate as it does now: without clear governance and rules when it comes to consumer data privacy. Technology is among the biggest growth industries in the U.S., so it's not surprising that the data trade has grown unchecked, but what's more surprising is how long it took legislators \u2014 and the public \u2014 to realize it needed to change.</p><p> Consumers and businesses don't need to be at odds when it comes to data privacy. Companies impacted by the CCPA need to invest now in becoming compliant versus applying lower-cost, short-term Band-Aid solutions. Being proactive about compliance could strengthen and build positive brand affinity among consumers if companies communicate how they're adjusting their practices. For example, when companies make consumer data privacy and protection their competitive differentiator, like Apple and Microsoft are currently attempting, this builds more consumer trust and therefore more engagement in the long run.</p><p> Today's consumers might be apathetic when it comes to taking back control of their data, but when armed with a toolbox of new regulations, they will likely take better care to guard their virtual selves. Consumers of the future will demand more protection when it comes to their personal information being bought and sold in the online marketplace. How companies react to the CCPA will be a key differentiator in the coming decade. They can either be seen as a vestige of the old guard or a trusted online platform for the future.</p><p> U.S. companies must also realize that the CCPA represents the dawning of a new and increasingly regulated online information marketplace. Businesses must develop new, adjacent revenue streams that don't depend upon the selling of personal information. Being proactive is cheaper and presents radically more opportunity than being reactive.</p><p> The CCPA is just the beginning as multiple versions of state and federal privacy legislation have been proposed; Washington is abuzz with calls to rein in \"Big Tech.\" This means that businesses operating in information trading \u2014 including social media, advertising and content giants \u2014 will have to make major adjustments to keep customers, and shareholders, happy.</p><p> New legislation may be the nudge that companies need to do what is probably right for them and for consumers in the long run \u2014 finding new revenue streams that address consumer pain points without relying on hocking their data.</p><p> Data protection laws in global markets, most notably the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union, are more stringent and burdensome than anything currently proposed at the state or federal level in the U.S. For smaller companies that wish someday to compete on the global stage, designing simple and effective consumer privacy controls into their solutions and processes from the ground floor will benefit them in the long run. For larger companies already operating globally, meeting the same higher standard internationally can help reduce complexity and improve consistency across their different regions.</p><p> The next decade will see the internet continue to evolve at a faster pace than we've yet seen. In terms of consumer privacy and security, and CCPA, business owners and technology leaders face a fork in the road. They can treat compliance as an afterthought and invest the minimum amount of resources to skate by, or they can seize the business growth opportunity by making it a core value and a fundamental feature of their products and services.</p><p> Rich Matta is a data privacy advocate and chief executive officer of ReputationDefender, a global digital privacy and online reputation management firm.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKCA-e1bc821f168090a329097fabc4b8546e79bbeb4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F28D97682ECCFA2 NWBKCA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XS8-KXK1-JBCN-41CB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399538</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"789\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

The amendments are a partial response to extensive criticism of the legislation as overbroad, ambiguous, and excessively burdensome for organizations doing business in California. Throughout the summer, a coalition of businesses and industry associations (including the California Retailers Association, the Consumer Technology Association, the Internet Association and others), engaged in a concerted effort to persuade the California Legislature to clarify certain definitions in the law, limit its scope to prevent unintended consequences and delay its enforcement date to give regulated businesses the requisite time to establish systems and policies for compliance.2 The Legislature's response addresses a few, but by no means all, of the industry's concerns. It delays enforcement of most of the law's provisions until July 1, 2020, or six months after the California attorney general publishes final implementing regulations,3 whichever is earlier, and it clarifies certain exemptions from the law's reach, but it leaves intact a host of complex requirements. Any entity subject to the CCPA that interacts with individual consumers faces a considerable task in readying for compliance during the approximately 18-month period before the CCPA is enforced.The CCPA is being heralded by many as a \"first in the nation\" privacy regime. </p><p>Because it defines the \"personal information\" subject to its protection extremely broadly, and because it grants consumers extensive rights to control that information, it has been referred to as a US state's importation of the European Union (EU) General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) that became enforceable on May 25, 2018. Many organizations that spent months or even years preparing to comply with the GDPR are considering whether those efforts will be sufficient to ensure compliancemdash;or at least to bring them close to compliancemdash;with the CCPA as well. But despite core similarities between the GDPR and the CCPA, having prepared for compliance with the former will not relieve a business of additional work to achieve compliance with the latter. Although GDPR compliance may help with some aspects of CCPA compliance, an assessment of the CCPA's requirements needs to be undertaken as a separate exercise and will require adopting new operational and policy measures.Key Differences Between the CCPA and the GDPRAs a threshold matter, there are certain core differences between the CCPA and the GDPR in terms of the scope of regulated persons, information and activities. For example:Covered Entities. The GDPR has broad application to any person or entity, regardless of location or nationality, that acts as a \"controller\" (i.e., a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data) or a \"processor\" (i.e., a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller) of personal data of individuals that is collected in connection with a presence in the EU. The CCPA is not so broad; it regulates a \"business,\" defined as a for-profit legal entity that does business in the state of California and which:Has annual gross revenues in excess of $25 million,Alone or in combination buys, receives, sells or shares for commercial purposes the personal information of 50,000 or more consumers, households or devices on an annual basis, orDerives 50 percent or more of its annual revenues from selling consumers' personal information, to provide consumers with a variety of rights with respect to the protection and control of their personal information.This difference in covered entities reflects the fundamental underpinnings of the two laws: The GDPR is grounded on the principle that, in the EU, privacy is a human right. Although the California Constitution similarly refers to the right to privacy as among the \"inalienable\" rights of all individuals, the CCPA itself does not seek to protect that right outside the commercial arena. It is \"consumers\" whose personal data is protected under the CCPA, and it is businesses, not other persons, upon which California has imposed the CCPA's requirements.Personal Information. The GDPR protects \"personal data\" which is \"any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (or a \"data subject\").\" The CCPA similarly protects \"personal information,\" but the definition of that term is designed to cover not only information identifiable to an individual consumer, but also to consumers that purchase or use products or services jointly: \"'Personal information' means information that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.\"Importantly, however, as clarified by the recent amendments to the CCPA, certain information that is subject to protection under other US privacy regimes is exempt from the CCPA. For example, nonpublic personal financial information that is collected, processed, sold, or disclosed pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and its implementing rules or the California Financial Information Privacy Act is also generally exempt from the CCPA (although a breach in the security of this information would be actionable in a private party suit brought under the CCPA). In addition, medical information governed by the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act and \"protected health information\" collected or created by \"covered entities\" or \"business associates\" as those terms are defined under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and its implementing rules are not subject to the CCPA. Information is exempt if it is collected as part of a clinical trial subject to protection under (i) the so-called \"Common Rule\" protecting human research subjects; (ii) the parallel rules of the Food and Drug Administration, or (iii) good clinical practice guidelines issued by the International Council for Harmonization in research. This latter exemption, vigorously advocated for by the pharmaceutical and medical device industries, is critical to prevent risks to the integrity of clinical trials that would exist if consumers who are research subjects could request access to or deletion of their personal data collected in the course of a clinical trial in which blinded studies and consistent data retention are essential to accurate analysis and reliable results.There is ambiguitymdash;or perhaps a serious deficiencymdash;in the exemption for research subject information, however, in that much research involving human subjects takes place outside of actual \"clinical trials\"mdash;for example, through surveys, interviews and other channels. The specific reference to data collected in a \"clinical trial\"mdash;as opposed to in human-subject research more generallymdash;may not encompass information collected for purposes of, for example, pharmacoeconomic or outcomes research, or for purposes such as identifying clinical trial participants. The medical research community may wish to seek further clarifying amendments to foreclose the possibility of an adverse impact on such nonclinical research.Core Consumer Rights. Most of the basic privacy rights protected by the CCPA and GDPR are similar. The CCPA declares the California Legislature's intent to ensure five core consumer rights of California residents with respect to personal information about them:The right to know what personal information is collected;The right to know whether that personal information is sold or disclosed, and to whom;4The right to \"say no\" to the sale of that personal information;The right to access that personal information; andThe right to equal service and price, regardless of exercising their privacy rights.The GDPR similarly grants individuals the right to notice of what types of personal information about them will be collected and disclosed, as well as the right to access the collected information. But unlike the CCPA, the GDPR does not focus specifically on the sale of personal datamdash;the GDPR regulates \"processing\" generally, which encompasses collection, disclosure, sale, and the many other forms of activity that may occur with respect to personal data. And the GDPR does not require special notice of an individual's right to block the sale of personal information, whereas the CCPA requires each regulated business to post a clear and conspicuous notice on the homepage of its website of a consumer's right to prevent such sale, which must be an active link for consumers to click stating: \"Do Not Sell My Personal Information.\" (For children, the CCPA requires additional protection: children under the age of 16 must affirmatively opt-in before businesses can sell their personal data, and parents of children under the age of 13 must opt-in on the child's behalf.)Deletion of Personal Information. Another area in which the GDPR and CCPA are similar, but different enough to suggest distinct practices and policies, concerns the right of individuals to have their personal information deleted upon request. Under the GDPR, such a request must be honored in any of six circumstances, including when the personal information is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was processed or the individual has withdrawn their consent to processing and there is no other legal ground for processing. The CCPA, while establishing a general right to deletion, narrows the right substantially by permitting a business to decline an individual's request for deletion of certain personal information under nine specific conditions, including if the business needs to keep that information to \"enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with the expectations of the individual based on the individual's relationship with the business\" or to \"[o]therwise use the consumer's personal information, internally, in a lawful manner that is compatible with the context in which the consumer provided the information.\"Third-Party Processing Contracts. Another noticeable difference between the CCPA and the GDPR is that the GDPR requires any \"controller\" that shares personal information with a third-party \"processor\" to enter into a contract with the processor that places specific data protection obligations on the processor. Although other privacy laws in the United States, including the HIPAA privacy regulations and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act rules, impose such contractual obligations on \"covered entities\" and financial institutions, respectively, the CCPA does not require the businesses it regulates to similarly bind third-party processors to data protection obligations.A more detailed summary of the similarities and differences between the CCPA and the GDPR is set forth in chart form below. As the summary indicates, while the CCPA and GDPR both are expansive pieces of legislation that similarly extend certain privacy rights to individuals in relation to their personal information, each law has subtleties in its definitions, mandates and exceptions that critically impact its application and interpretations. Businesses seeking to comply with both laws should view compliance with the CCPA as a separate phase of their data privacy program, albeit a phase that is following closely on the heels of, or is in conjunction with, their GDPR compliance. The specific details of both laws should be fully assessed so that business practices and policies can be implemented and adjusted accordingly.Summary Comparison of Key Provisions of the CCPA and the GDPRFootnotes1 2017 California Assembly Bill No. 375, California 2017-2018 Regular Session (amending Part 4 of Division 3 of the California Civil Code), amended by 2017 California Senate Bill No. 1121.2 See Coalition Letter[1].3 The CCPA directs the attorney general to adopt a number of regulations to further implement and clarify the scope and requirements of the law prior to its effective date. This may include the expansion or modification of the definition of protected \"personal information,\" the adoption of additional exceptions as may be required for businesses to comply with state or federal law, and the implementation of rules and procedures governing the mechanics of the CCPA's opt-out and consumer-notice requirements. The attorney general is also granted the discretion to adopt additional regulations that are deemed to be necessary to the law's implementation.4 The CCPA requires a business that collects a consumer's information to disclose to that consumer the categories and specific pieces of personal information that the business has collected, sold to a third party or disclosed for a business purpose, as well as the categories of third parties with whom the business has sold or disclosed personal information, among other items. Businesses must also disclose the categories of the sources from which personal information has been collected and identify the business or commercial purpose(s) underlying the collection of consumers' information. The CCPA establishes specific requirements for the form and timing of delivery of information requested by a consumer.5 This definition provided in this chart has been abbreviated to include only its essential elements. The statutory definition contains additional guidance regarding certain categories of \"personal information\" and certain terms included within the definition are defined separately under the statute.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances. Ms Nancy L. PerkinsArnold ...rter 601 Mass.

Even at the eleventh hour, experts are unable to reach consensus on how exactly to define \u201cselling\u201d in a digital advertising world where users\u2019 online habits are typically tracked and swapped between intermediaries and advertisers, even if money does not change hands.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThe law has created an enormous challenge for the [advertising] industry as well as others that are information-based industries,\u201d said Michael Hahn, senior vice-president of the Interactive Advertising Bureau.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no issue that has posed more of a problem to lawyers in the privacy and ad tech space than what does the definition of \u2018sale\u2019 mean in a digital advertising context.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Compliance costs</emphasis></p><p>Similar in many ways to Europe\u2019s general data protection regulation (GDPR), which came into force in May 2018, the California rules include requirements to better protect data from hackers and allow users to ask to see the personal information a company has gathered on them and delete it \u2014 or otherwise face fines and litigation.\u00a0</p><p>It applies to any company \u2014 from financial and professional services groups to smaller online retailers \u2014 with at least $25m in annual gross revenues that does business in California, or collects, processes and makes money from the data of California residents \u2014 even if they do not have a physical presence in the state. Some businesses plan to simply roll out the rules across the country.\u00a0</p><p>Despite lobbying by tech groups to water down the initial bill, the cost of legal work, upgrading cyber insurance policies and of setting up systems to handle the data access requests is expected to be burdensome.\u00a0</p><p>The California attorney-general\u2019s office estimates the total cost of initial compliance to be $55bn \u2014 or around 1.8 per cent of California\u2019s gross state product in 2018. Broken down by size, companies with more than 500 employees will take a $2m initial hit; while companies with between 100 and 500 employees, and between 20 to 100, will pay $450,000 and $100,000 respectively, according to the estimates.\u00a0</p><p>A number of large companies \u2014 such as Facebook \u2014 have built automated, self-serve portals to handle these requests, or are working with start-ups to provide such a service. But for smaller companies, employees may need to manually search their systems.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThis works fine but if you get a high spike of data access requests \u2014 right after that law is enacted for example \u2014 that could prove incredibly difficult,\u201d said Lindsey Tonsager, partner at global law firm Covington.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Grey areas</emphasis></p><p>More pressing, however, is what businesses claim is a lack of clarity over the definition of what it means to \u201csell\u201d a user\u2019s data for money or \u201cother valuable consideration\u201d \u2014 as those who do so are required to add a \u201cDo Not Sell My Personal Information\u201d button to their homepage to allow consumers to opt out of the practice.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere is a tremendous incentive [for companies] under the CCPA to say, \u2018We do not sell personal information\u2019,\u201d said Edward McNicholas, co-leader of the privacy and cyber security practice at law firm Ropes &amp; Gray.\u00a0</p><p>\u201c[But] the definition of sale is extraordinarily vague,\u201d he said, adding that the attorney-general had declined to make any further clarifications.\u00a0</p><p>Indeed, the law is already being interpreted differently by Silicon Valley\u2019s biggest companies.\u00a0</p><p>Facebook, for example, offers free tracking software known as the \u201cFacebook Pixel\u201d to millions of websites, which gathers insights on users\u2019 web activities to help serve them with relevant adverts via their platform.\u00a0</p><p>Although it generates revenue from this data-retargeting, the social media group said in a\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2019/12/californias-new-privacy-law/amp/\"> recent blog</url> that it \u201cdoes not sell people\u2019s data\u201d. It added that brands and other third parties that used its pixel needed \u201cto reach their own decisions on how to best comply with the law\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>By contrast, Google said it was\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/9614122?hl=en\"> introducing a new system</url> to restrict how it wields consumers\u2019 data if they decide to opt out on an advertisers\u2019 page.\u00a0</p><p>Meanwhile, Uber\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://privacy.uber.com/privacy/california\"> announced</url> that it was adding an \u201copt out\u201d button to its app, adding that \u201csome sharing of personal information necessary to provide you with personalised ads may be considered a \u2018sale\u2019, even if no money is exchanged\u201d.</p><p>\u201c[Targeted advertising] is how a lot of the third parties and big tech companies make their money,\u201d said Scott Jarrell, US financial services forensic technology principal at EY.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a quagmire for them to [balance] the need for revenues with this regulation\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009They will be under more scrutiny by regulators and potentially plaintiffs, attorneys.\u201d</p><p>Some argue that these rules may have unintended consequences for smaller players.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI know there are companies that are sharing data so that small and marginalised communities can get access to credit,\u201d said Jordan Crenshaw, policy counsel at the US Chamber of Commerce, which hosts a privacy working group made up of 225 of its member companies and trade associations.\u00a0</p><p>Many are now awaiting final draft regulations, expected mid-2020, but there are those who assert that full clarity will be much longer in the making.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThere will be years of litigation and enforcement advice that will help to clarify the meaning of some of these pieces of advice,\u201d said Michael Morgan, global privacy and cyber security partner at McDermott Will &amp; Emery.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-7b5418082bdf11eabc7765e4aa615551</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XW8-YBG1-DXP9-91DF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1092\"/><timeReceived>5:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 1, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The California Consumer Privacy Act went[1] into effect Jan. 1 and effectively[2] gives citizens the ability to obtain and delete whatever data companies have on them. </p><p>It's also based on Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which hackers are gaming to collect on people's data. 'Soon after Europe's law went into effect, in May 2018, a hacker gained access to the Spotify account of Jean Yang, a tech executive, and successfully filed a data request to download her home address, credit card information,' The New York Times'Kashmir Hill wrote[3] Wednesday.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) Companies that collect the personal information of 50,000 people and those with annual revenues of $25 million or more are required to fork over the data upon request. Vendors like Berbix ask people to upload photos of government-issued identification and take a selfie to verify the identify of those making requests for such data, Hill noted. Berbix also asked requesters to take another photo of themselvesas a secondary form of verification. Critics are questioning the need for people to provide more personal information to collect private data. 'This is a nightmare future where I can't request my data from a creepy shadow credit bureau without putting on a smile for them, and it's completely insane,' Jack Phelps, a software engineer in New York City, told Hill. Researchers are demonstrating how the law allowed this to happen.(Article Continues Below Advertisement) Sponsored Content  James Pavur, an Oxford University researcher, filed data requests on behalf of wife at several companies across Europe using her phone number and other publicly accessible information. He created an email address that was similar to his wife's name. A quarter of the 150 companies sent Pavur her files. 'I got her Social Security number, high school grades, a good chunk of information about her credit card,' Pavur told TheNYT's Hill. 'A threat intelligence company sent me all her user names and passwords that had been leaked.' Other researchers replicated similar techniques and found the same results. Mariano Di Martino and Pieter Robyns, computer science researchers at Hasselt University in Belgium, used more advanced techniques to request each other's data, such as photoshopping government ID, Hill reported. Di Martino received data of a stranger whose name was similar to that of his research partner. California's law is partially a response[4] to what state officials' concern that lax federal regulations are allowing tech companies to gobble up unprecedented amounts of data. The state's AG accused[5] Facebook in November of not complying with subpoena requests regarding its investigation into the Cambridge Analytica, a company that gained access to user data.Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is availablewithout charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

AB-873 failed to pass a Senate committee in July, but was granted reconsideration.</p><p>The attempt to exempt certain kinds of data from new requirements wouldn't have raised so many eyebrows if Irwin's husband, Jon Irwin, wasn't the chief operating officer for the company Ring, which sells video doorbells and other home security products.</p><p>The company, based in Santa Monica, California, and purchased by Amazon for nearly $1 billion last year, collects \"vast amounts of consumer data [and] has a financial stake in the details of California's groundbreaking data-privacy law,\" according to a Politico report.</p><p>\"It is quite likely that 873, had it passed, would have limited the application of the CCPA to the information that Ring has,\" Chris Conley, a technology and data-privacy attorney with the ACLU of Northern California, told Politico. \"AB-873 certainly would have affected Ring.\"</p><p>The CCPA, signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown in 2018, was designed to give Californians control over certain personal information collected by companies. The law empowers individuals to force companies to delete or refrain from selling personal information at their request.</p><p>When Irwin was confronted with the notion that her legislative role might conflict with the financial interests of her husband's company, she remarked that the suggestion was \"a little bit offensive.\" She added, \"We can talk about this later.\"</p><p>Irwin didn't respond immediately to follow-up questions submitted by The Epoch Times.</p><p>\"My role in the privacy debate in the Legislature is focused on bringing people together and solving the practical issues posed to us as policy makers and is independent of any job or role my husband may have,\" Irwin said in a statement issued to Politico. \"My education and professional background as a systems engineer provides me distinct qualifications in the Legislature to weigh in on matters related to technology.\"</p><p>The proposal that Irwin advanced is supported by a number of industry groups, such as the California Chamber of Commerce, the Internet Association, and TechNet, a national, bipartisan network of technology CEOs that named Irwin \"Legislator of the Year\" in 2017.</p><p>The Internet Association-a trade group founded by a number of big tech companies including Google, Amazon, eBay, and Facebook-spent $176,000 lobbying the California legislature last quarter, The Washington Post reported in September.</p><p>The lobbyists also initiated an ad campaign targeted at residents of Sacramento. The ads suggested, among other things, that \"FREE websites and apps you use every day could start costing you,\" according to one Twitter ad.</p><p>Ring could be drastically affected by amendments to the CCPA, especially given the company's recently reported partnerships with more than 400 police departments across the country. These entanglements have raised questions regarding what kind of data is collected and how Ring shares the data with agencies.</p><p>This collaboration has prompted lawmakers such as Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) to write a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, stating that Ring's partnerships \"raise serious privacy and civil liberties concerns.\"</p><p>\"Although Amazon markets Ring as America's 'new neighborhood watch,' the technology captures and stores video from millions of households and sweeps up footage of countless bystanders who may be unaware that they are being filmed,\" Markey wrote on Sept. 5. \"I am particularly alarmed to learn that Ring is pursuing facialrecognition technology with the potential to flag certain individuals as suspicious based on their biometric information.\"</p><p>State conflict-of-interest law effectively forbids legislators from participating in decisions that could impact their own financial interest.</p><p>\"Generally speaking, the Political Reform Act does require potential recusal for an official who has a direct, personal, material financial impact from taking part in discussions and/or decisions/votes,\" said Jay Wierenga, the communications director of California's Fair Political Practices Commission, an organization tasked with enforcing such laws.</p><p>When asked if there were any complaints filed concerning Irwin's potential conflict of interest, Wierenga told The Epoch Times that as of midSeptember, \"we had no complaints filed regarding that matter.\"</p><p>John Casey, a spokesperson for the Assembly Speaker's office, told Politico that it doesn't typically take into account statements related to economic interest when making committee appointments. Rather, it is usually up to lawmakers to recuse themselves.</p><p>But when it comes to the issue of recusal, the legalities become considerably complex.</p><p>\"For example, if a state lawmaker is a dairy farmer, and legislation comes before her/his committee regarding dairy regulations, it would obviously affect their farm,\" Wierenga told The Epoch Times.</p><p>My role in the privacy debate in the Legislature is focused on bringing people together and solving the practical issues posed to us as policy makers and is independent of any job or role my husband may have.</p><p>Jacqui Irwin, assemblywoman, Calif.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENW-2304089161</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">1576348ENW</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8G-27F1-JC85-J2YS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11341</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"909\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 ProQuest Information and Learning<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Epoch Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Epoch Times</publicationName><issueNumber>No. 546</issueNumber><aggregationName>Ethnic NewsWatch</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 2, 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Others</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English UK</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000254Q</classCode><className>GRAHAM HOLDINGS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Their zeal for filming the blaze interfered with the ability of firefighting aircraft to douse the deadly flames with water and fire retardant. That year Rep. <person><nameText>Adam Schiff, </nameText></person>a California Democrat who's the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's ranking member, called on the Federal Aviation Administration to finalize rules for drone operators so that they are deterred from interfering with the duties of emergency response personnel.</p><p><br/> Now he is suggesting that the technology industry should play a role in reducing the dangers posed by spectator drones.<br/> \"We still haven't solved the problem of keeping drones out of firefighting areas, and we still have a continuous problem of drones flying around the airspace of airports, causing near-collisions with aircraft,\" Schiff said in an interview.<br/> \"So I think there are some steps that have been taken, but a lot more work that needs to be done, and here's an area also where technology can pay a pivotal role,\" he said. \"As the geo-fencing capabilities improve, that's a technology that would solve some of these problems.\"<br/> Gun safety tools also are on the government's wish list of technological advancements. The newfound interest in a device that would allow only the owner of a gun to access the weapon stems from a presidential directive. President Barack Obama announced in April that he had directed the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Justice to prepare a report outlining a strategy for expediting \"smart\" firearms.<br/>Maryland is the go-to state for Department of Defense officials tasked with testing the latest smart-gun technology at a military facility. Still, California companies will have a major role to play in ensuring that the federal government gets that technology, Silicon Valley billionaire Ron Conway told Newsweek. Those companies could help improve gun safety, Rep. Jackie Speier, a California Democrat, said in an email response to questions.<br/> \"Another technology avenue ... I think we should explore and promote is smart guns,\" she said. \"Thanks to technological advancements, we can lock our smartphones with a touch of our finger, and yet the gun lobby insists the same technology can't be applied to deadly weapons.\"<br/> Speier is also a member of the powerful House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.<br/> She and other California lawmakers have front-row seats for the public displays of investment and territorial spats between the industry and its government partners. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee and Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., has a say in intelligence oversight as well. Collectively, they monitor the technology-intelligence relationship as it encounters new opportunities, such as the creation of the Defense Department's Defense Innovation Unit Experimental venture in Silicon Valley, and setbacks, such as the encryption dispute between FBI officials and Apple.<br/>California, the birthplace of modern warfare and encryption software, is a modern-day technology frontier. Its sprawling cities are full of hush-hush companies that create a variety of weapons with the backing of various intelligence agencies. That weaponry ranges from complex multimillion-dollar military drones with the ability to spy on ground activity from thousands of feet in the sky to data-mining tools that allow government agents to track terrorists.<br/> \"The government isn't just a consumer of these technologies for its own intelligence applications,\" California Technology Council founder Matt Gardner said. \"It's now behaving a little bit like a venture capitalist in investing in new technologies, so this is a very different side of that relationship, and it really was pioneered by a venture capital firm called In-Q-tel.\"<br/> In-Q-tel is the venture-capital arm of the CIA. In recent years, it has expressed a strong interest in companies that create data-mining software and other unique technologies. That venture has inspired other government agencies to follow suit, Gardner said in an interview.<br/> \"I think it's fair to say that (the Department of Homeland Security) and (the Department of Defense) saw not only did In-Q-tel work, it helped in their relationship with innovators,\" he said. \"And I wouldn't say just 'big tech' here; it's just innovators in general, because it gave them a different way to relate to those who are developing cutting-edge technology as a partner.\"<br/> Intelligence agencies have been investing in California companies for decades. Financial contributions to startup companies such as LensVector Inc. in Silicon Valley and Geosemble Technologies in the Los Angeles area have led to the development of liquid crystal lenses that improve the quality of miniature cameras and technology that can pinpoint the locations of people based on their social media activity. The inordinate amount of attention is a blessing and a curse for California companies because it creates both opportunities and problems.<br/> \"I think what's really positive about this development is that government is rethinking itself,\" Gardner said. \"And so here's what's exciting about this: They're not getting too caught up in their own bureaucracy so much so that it prevents them from new thinking.\"<br/> But that new thinking comes with its fair share of controversy.<br/> The relationship between the technology industry and the intelligence agencies has been strong and, \"until recently, a very fruitful area,\" Schiff said. Now, as tech companies face increasing pressure from intelligence agencies seeking access to technology and information, Schiff and other lawmakers are looking for ways to resolve the tension in the tech-intelligence relationship.<br/> \"While the technology sector wants to work with law enforcement and the intelligence community to keep the country safe, they also don't want to jeopardize their business overseas, and, you know, when things and conflicts emerge, like they have between Apple and the FBI, that poses a real challenge to the tech sector, as it does to law enforcement,\" he said. \"You see that reflected in things like the decision of Twitter not to allow part of its open-source database to be accessed\" by the intelligence community.<br/> Lawmakers have a mitigation role to play, Schiff said, because the issue \"is too large\" and has \"too many policy implications to be addressed by the courts alone.\"<br/> \"It is fundamentally a balancing of security privacy and a whole host of other considerations: the global impacts, the economic impacts,\" he said. \"And those are considerations that are not easily balanced by a court, so I think that it really is something that Congress should address.\"<br/> Former CIA director and former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said he disagreed with that approach. California's technology industry and the intelligence agencies need to resolve their own issues - without the interference of Congress, he said. Since his time at the CIA, Panetta said, he has watched the standard protocol of quiet communication about national security issues between tech companies and intelligence agents devolve into a front-page spat.<br/> \"We had meetings in Silicon Valley. They were always cordial, but they were always confidential,\" he said in an interview. \"That's an important aspect if you're going to be able to find a solution to the current problem. You've got to be able to do it in a way that is confidential and not on the front page of The Washington Post.\"<br/> As exciting technological opportunities arise, such as the need for geo-fencing and smart-gun tools, that relationship may stay in the spotlight. After all, the federal government will need to create new regulations for that technology and remain wary about what the average person could do with access to anti-drone tools, Gardner said.<br/> \"I think there should be a worry among - especially those same regulators - about John Smith in his backyard taking air defense into his own hands,\" he said. \"That's an interesting risk.\"<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INDTEC-n8916405</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INDTEC2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JVF-S9D1-JBYT-H37R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428674</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1406\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 FFC Information Solution All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Indian Technology news</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"5981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"05\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>May 24, 2016 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Administrative Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"78\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjYyRTk3QUVFRjk4NDVGMkI0REI0NDA4NTUzRDY5NDk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDk0RkJCOUQ5NEFCNDE2N0EzRUE0QzU2RUFBOEEzRTI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

The demand for a technological solution known as \"geo-fencing\" stems from concerns that arose in 2015, after drone hobbyists brazenly flew their hovercraft over wildfires during the fire season. Their zeal for filming the blaze interfered with the ability of firefighting aircraft to douse the deadly flames with water and fire retardant. That year Rep. </p><p>Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who's the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's ranking member, called on the Federal Aviation Administration to finalize rules for drone operators so that they are deterred from interfering with the duties of emergency response personnel. Now he is suggesting that the technology[1] industry should play a role in reducing the dangers posed by spectator drones. \"We still haven't solved the problem of keeping drones out of firefighting areas, and we still have a continuous problem of drones flying around the airspace of airports, causing near-collisions with aircraft,\" Schiff said in an interview. \"So I think there are some steps that have been taken, but a lot more work that needs to be done, and here's an area also where technology can pay a pivotal role,\" he said. \"As the geo-fencing capabilities improve, that's a technology that would solve some of these problems.\" Gun safety tools also are on the government's wish list of technological advancements. The newfound interest in a device that would allow only the owner of a gun to access the weapon stems from a presidential directive. President Barack Obama announced in April that he had directed the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Justice to prepare a report outlining a strategy for expediting \"smart\" firearms. Maryland is the go-to state for Department of Defense officials tasked with testing the latest smart-gun technology at a military facility. Still, California companies will have a major role to play in ensuring that the federal government[2] gets that technology, Silicon Valley billionaire Ron Conway told Newsweek. Those companies could help improve gun safety, Rep. Jackie Speier, a California Democrat, said in an email response to questions. \"Another technology avenue ... I think we should explore and promote is smart guns,\" she said. \"Thanks to technological advancements, we can lock our smartphones with a touch of our finger, and yet the gun lobby insists the same technology can't be applied to deadly weapons.\" Speier is also a member of the powerful House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. She and other California lawmakers have front-row seats for the public displays of investment and territorial spats between the industry and its government partners. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee and Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., has a say in intelligence oversight as well. Collectively, they monitor the technology-intelligence relationship as it encounters new opportunities, such as the creation of the Defense Department's Defense Innovation Unit Experimental venture in Silicon Valley, and setbacks, such as the encryption dispute between FBI officials and Apple. California, the birthplace of modern warfare and encryption software, is a modern-day technology frontier. Its sprawling cities are full of hush-hush companies that create a variety of weapons with the backing of various intelligence agencies. That weaponry ranges from complex multimillion-dollar military drones with the ability to spy on ground activity from thousands of feet in the sky to data-mining tools that allow government agents to track terrorists. \"The government isn't just a consumer of these technologies for its own intelligence applications,\" California Technology Council founder Matt Gardner said. \"It's now behaving a little bit like a venture capitalist in investing in new technologies, so this is a very different side of that relationship, and it really was pioneered by a venture capital firm called In-Q-tel.\" In-Q-tel is the venture-capital arm of the CIA. In recent years, it has expressed a strong interest in companies that create data-mining software and other unique technologies. That venture has inspired other government agencies to follow suit, Gardner said in an interview. \"I think it's fair to say that (the Department of Homeland Security) and (the Department of Defense) saw not only did In-Q-tel work, it helped in their relationship with innovators,\" he said. \"And I wouldn't say just 'big tech' here; it's just innovators in general, because it gave them a different way to relate to those who are developing cutting-edge technology as a partner.\" Intelligence agencies have been investing in California companies for decades. Financial contributions to startup companies such as LensVector Inc. in Silicon Valley and Geosemble Technologies in the Los Angeles area have led to the development of liquid crystal lenses that improve the quality of miniature cameras and technology that can pinpoint the locations of people based on their social media activity. The inordinate amount of attention is a blessing and a curse for California companies because it creates both opportunities and problems. \"I think what's really positive about this development is that government is rethinking itself,\" Gardner said. \"And so here's what's exciting about this: They're not getting too caught up in their own bureaucracy so much so that it prevents them from new thinking.\" But that new thinking comes with its fair share of controversy. The relationship between the technology industry and the intelligence agencies has been strong and, \"until recently, a very fruitful area,\" Schiff said. Now, as tech companies face increasing pressure from intelligence agencies seeking access to technology and information, Schiff and other lawmakers are looking for ways to resolve the tension in the tech-intelligence relationship. \"While the technology sector wants to work with law enforcement and the intelligence community to keep the country safe, they also don't want to jeopardize their business overseas, and, you know, when things and conflicts emerge, like they have between Apple and the FBI, that poses a real challenge to the tech sector, as it does to law enforcement,\" he said. \"You see that reflected in things like the decision of Twitter not to allow part of its open-source database to be accessed\" by the intelligence community. Lawmakers have a mitigation role to play, Schiff said, because the issue \"is too large\" and has \"too many policy implications to be addressed by the courts alone.\" \"It is fundamentally a balancing of security privacy and a whole host of other considerations: the global impacts, the economic impacts,\" he said. \"And those are considerations that are not easily balanced by a court, so I think that it really is something that Congress should address.\" Former CIA director and former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said he disagreed with that approach. California's technology industry and the intelligence agencies[3] need to resolve their own issues - without the interference of Congress, he said. Since his time at the CIA, Panetta said, he has watched the standard protocol of quiet communication about national security issues between tech companies and intelligence agents devolve into a front-page spat. \"We had meetings in Silicon Valley. They were always cordial, but they were always confidential,\" he said in an interview. \"That's an important aspect if you're going to be able to find a solution to the current problem. You've got to be able to do it in a way that is confidential and not on the front page of The Washington Post.\" As exciting technological opportunities arise, such as the need for geo-fencing and smart-gun tools, that relationship may stay in the spotlight. After all, the federal government will need to create new regulations for that technology and remain wary about what the average person could do with access to anti-drone tools, Gardner said. \"I think there should be a worry among - especially those same regulators - about John Smith in his backyard taking air defense into his own hands,\" he said. \"That's an interesting risk.\" Relevant stories Defense Department's tech investing signals Silicon Valley's importance in cyberwarfare[4] US agencies face uphill battle for tech talent[5] Tech company finds stolen government log-ins all over Web[6] Obama announces new steps to curb gun violence[7] Twitter cuts intel agencies off from analysis service: report[8] Security clearance background checks to include social media[9] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://phys.org/tags/technology/\">http://phys.org/tags/technology/</url> [ 2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://phys.org/tags/federal+government/\">http://phys.org/tags/federal+government/</url> [ 3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://phys.org/tags/intelligence+agencies/\">http://phys.org/tags/intelligence+agencies/</url> [ 4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://phys.org/news/2015-05-defense-department-tech-investing-silicon.html#nRlv\">http://phys.org/news/2015-05-defense-department-tech-investing-silicon.html#nRlv</url> [ 5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://phys.org/news/2015-06-agencies-uphill-tech-talent.html#nRlv\">http://phys.org/news/2015-06-agencies-uphill-tech-talent.html#nRlv</url> [ 6]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://phys.org/news/2015-06-tech-company-stolen-log-ins-web.html#nRlv\">http://phys.org/news/2015-06-tech-company-stolen-log-ins-web.html#nRlv</url> [ 7]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://phys.org/news/2016-04-obama-curb-gun-violence.html#nRlv\">http://phys.org/news/2016-04-obama-curb-gun-violence.html#nRlv</url> [ 8]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://phys.org/news/2016-05-twitter-intel-agencies-analysis.html#nRlv\">http://phys.org/news/2016-05-twitter-intel-agencies-analysis.html#nRlv</url> [ 9]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://phys.org/news/2016-05-clearance-background-social-media.html#nRlv\">http://phys.org/news/2016-05-clearance-background-social-media.html#nRlv</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-PHYS1233681464083281829251761500030</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PHYS-123368</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JVF-BGK1-JCMN-Y21V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1600\"/><timeReceived>9:48 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Phys.org - Science and Technology News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"05\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>May 24, 2016 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Criminal Law &amp;

Their zeal for filming the blaze interfered with the ability of firefighting aircraft to douse the deadly flames with water and fire retardant. That year Rep. <person><nameText>Adam Schiff, </nameText></person>a California Democrat who's the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence's ranking member, called on the Federal Aviation Administration to finalize rules for drone operators so that they are deterred from interfering with the duties of emergency response personnel.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Now he is suggesting that the technology industry should play a role in reducing the dangers posed by spectator drones.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"We still haven't solved the problem of keeping drones out of firefighting areas, and we still have a continuous problem of drones flying around the airspace of airports, causing near-collisions with aircraft,\" Schiff said in an interview.</p><p> \"So I think there are some steps that have been taken, but a lot more work that needs to be done, and here's an area also where technology can pay a pivotal role,\" he said. \"As the geo-fencing capabilities improve, that's a technology that would solve some of these problems.\"</p><p> Gun safety tools also are on the government's wish list of technological advancements. The newfound interest in a device that would allow only the owner of a gun to access the weapon stems from a presidential directive. President Barack Obama announced in April that he had directed the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and Justice to prepare a report outlining a strategy for expediting \"smart\" firearms.</p><p>Maryland is the go-to state for Department of Defense officials tasked with testing the latest smart-gun technology at a military facility. Still, California companies will have a major role to play in ensuring that the federal government gets that technology, Silicon Valley billionaire Ron Conway told Newsweek. Those companies could help improve gun safety, Rep. Jackie Speier, a California Democrat, said in an email response to questions.</p><p> \"Another technology avenue \u2026 I think we should explore and promote is smart guns,\" she said. \"Thanks to technological advancements, we can lock our smartphones with a touch of our finger, and yet the gun lobby insists the same technology can't be applied to deadly weapons.\"</p><p> Speier is also a member of the powerful House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.</p><p> She and other California lawmakers have front-row seats for the public displays of investment and territorial spats between the industry and its government partners. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee and Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., has a say in intelligence oversight as well. Collectively, they monitor the technology-intelligence relationship as it encounters new opportunities, such as the creation of the Defense Department's Defense Innovation Unit Experimental venture in Silicon Valley, and setbacks, such as the encryption dispute between FBI officials and Apple.</p><p>California, the birthplace of modern warfare and encryption software, is a modern-day technology frontier. Its sprawling cities are full of hush-hush companies that create a variety of weapons with the backing of various intelligence agencies. That weaponry ranges from complex multimillion-dollar military drones with the ability to spy on ground activity from thousands of feet in the sky to data-mining tools that allow government agents to track terrorists.</p><p> \"The government isn't just a consumer of these technologies for its own intelligence applications,\" California Technology Council founder Matt Gardner said. \"It's now behaving a little bit like a venture capitalist in investing in new technologies, so this is a very different side of that relationship, and it really was pioneered by a venture capital firm called In-Q-tel.\"</p><p> In-Q-tel is the venture-capital arm of the CIA. In recent years, it has expressed a strong interest in companies that create data-mining software and other unique technologies. That venture has inspired other government agencies to follow suit, Gardner said in an interview.</p><p> \"I think it's fair to say that (the Department of Homeland Security) and (the Department of Defense) saw not only did In-Q-tel work, it helped in their relationship with innovators,\" he said. \"And I wouldn't say just \u2018big tech' here; it's just innovators in general, because it gave them a different way to relate to those who are developing cutting-edge technology as a partner.\"</p><p> Intelligence agencies have been investing in California companies for decades. Financial contributions to startup companies such as LensVector Inc. in Silicon Valley and Geosemble Technologies in the Los Angeles area have led to the development of liquid crystal lenses that improve the quality of miniature cameras and technology that can pinpoint the locations of people based on their social media activity. The inordinate amount of attention is a blessing and a curse for California companies because it creates both opportunities and problems.</p><p> \"I think what's really positive about this development is that government is rethinking itself,\" Gardner said. \"And so here's what's exciting about this: They're not getting too caught up in their own bureaucracy so much so that it prevents them from new thinking.\"</p><p> But that new thinking comes with its fair share of controversy.</p><p> The relationship between the technology industry and the intelligence agencies has been strong and, \"until recently, a very fruitful area,\" Schiff said. Now, as tech companies face increasing pressure from intelligence agencies seeking access to technology and information, Schiff and other lawmakers are looking for ways to resolve the tension in the tech-intelligence relationship.</p><p> \"While the technology sector wants to work with law enforcement and the intelligence community to keep the country safe, they also don't want to jeopardize their business overseas, and, you know, when things and conflicts emerge, like they have between Apple and the FBI, that poses a real challenge to the tech sector, as it does to law enforcement,\" he said. \"You see that reflected in things like the decision of Twitter not to allow part of its open-source database to be accessed\" by the intelligence community.</p><p> Lawmakers have a mitigation role to play, Schiff said, because the issue \"is too large\" and has \"too many policy implications to be addressed by the courts alone.\"</p><p> \"It is fundamentally a balancing of security privacy and a whole host of other considerations: the global impacts, the economic impacts,\" he said. \"And those are considerations that are not easily balanced by a court, so I think that it really is something that Congress should address.\"</p><p> Former CIA director and former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said he disagreed with that approach. California's technology industry and the intelligence agencies need to resolve their own issues - without the interference of Congress, he said. Since his time at the CIA, Panetta said, he has watched the standard protocol of quiet communication about national security issues between tech companies and intelligence agents devolve into a front-page spat.</p><p> \"We had meetings in Silicon Valley. They were always cordial, but they were always confidential,\" he said in an interview. \"That's an important aspect if you're going to be able to find a solution to the current problem. You've got to be able to do it in a way that is confidential and not on the front page of The Washington Post.\"</p><p> As exciting technological opportunities arise, such as the need for geo-fencing and smart-gun tools, that relationship may stay in the spotlight. After all, the federal government will need to create new regulations for that technology and remain wary about what the average person could do with access to anti-drone tools, Gardner said.</p><p> \"I think there should be a worry among - especially those same regulators - about John Smith in his backyard taking air defense into his own hands,\" he said. \"That's an interesting risk.\"</p><p> ---</p><p> (c)2016 McClatchy Washington Bureau</p><p> Visit the McClatchy Washington Bureau at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com\">www.mcclatchydc.com</url></p><p> Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKTX-867208</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898FED517FE16 NWBKTX2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JV8-SDF1-JD6S-R4H5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401983</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1428\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Herald Democrat, Stephens Media, LLC, d/b/a Herald Democrat<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

But unlike nearly all other state attorneys general, he won't say whether he's investigating them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">WASHINGTON -- When numerous state attorneys general gathered last month on the steps of the Supreme Court to announce an antitrust investigation into Google, one was conspicuously absent: Xavier Becerra, California's attorney general. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  He was also missing from a list of state attorneys general publicly signing on to a joint antitrust investigation into Facebook, released last week by New York.</p><p>  Mr. Becerra's curious no-show from the public announcements has provided one of the more enduring questions about the scrutiny of the tech industry sweeping through Washington and state capitals. What is Mr. Becerra -- whose state is home to most of the country's biggest tech companies, including Google and Facebook -- up to?</p><p>  His decision to skirt the question has led to questions about what one of the largest and most influential states is doing on the tech antitrust front. Mr. Becerra's office has more resources -- money and people -- than most state attorneys general, which would be needed to pursue a major legal case against one of the top tech companies. </p><p>  It has led to criticism from political rivals and groups calling for aggressive action against the giant tech companies, as well as attention from local news organizations. Yet Mr. Becerra, who has been vocal about problems with Silicon Valley in the past, has remained fastidious about saying little about any potential investigations. He has neither confirmed nor denied that his office is examining Google, Facebook or any other tech company.</p><p>  ''No one except California and the A.G.'s office knows what, if anything, we're doing with regard to either of those two or any other company in the internet space,'' he said in an interview this week. He added that he was following his office's longstanding practice not to speak publicly about a possible investigation.</p><p>  Earlier this month, Mr. Becerra responded to a question about California not publicly endorsing the joint investigations by asking one of his own. </p><p>  ''How do you know we're not investigating?'' he said.</p><p>  Mr. Becerra's spokeswoman, Sarah Lovenheim, said the office did not disclose what it was or was not investigating to protect the integrity of its work. ''It's just our policy not to comment on any pending or potential investigations,'' she said in a statement.</p><p>  Other attorneys general offices are not offering any insight, either. Fabien Levy, a spokesman for Letitia James, the New York attorney general, said that her office ''cannot comment on whether we have or have not had a conversation with another state about any of our investigations.''</p><p>  Mr. Becerra, a Democrat, spent more than 20 years in the House before being appointed California's attorney general and taking office in 2017. Since he left Washington, anti-tech fever has become an animating force in politics. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, has made breaking up Big Tech a calling card of her presidential campaign. The House Judiciary Committee, where Mr. Becerra once served, is also running its own antitrust investigation into Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.</p><p>  Mr. Becerra has been willing to take on the large tech companies in other contexts. His office is developing regulations around the California Consumer Privacy Act, an online privacy law that the internet industry has tried to weaken. The law gave consumers more rights over their data when the legislature passed it last year, but it is up to Mr. Becerra to propose the rules and enforce them.</p><p>  ''It's an incredibly technical matter; they got a lot right,'' said Ashkan Soltani, a technologist who has been involved with supporting the California law.</p><p>  His office has also been aggressive in other antitrust matters. In addition to challenging T-Mobile's merger with Sprint, it announced a tentative settlement this month in an antitrust lawsuit with Sutter Health, a Northern California hospital system. Mr. Becerra has also expressed concern that consumer data was being concentrated among a small number of online platforms.</p><p/><p>  On Oct. 1, eight groups who have advocated more aggressive scrutiny of companies like Facebook and Google wrote to Mr. Becerra asking to discuss their concerns with him. Sarah Miller, the deputy director of one group, the Open Markets Institute, said they wanted ''to offer to share our views, to hear his views and to help brief or provide educational support.''</p><p>  ''Your state is at the epicenter of this national conversation, giving you a unique and powerful position,'' the groups wrote. ''We hope to build a constructive line of communication as these corporations continue to be under public and regulatory scrutiny.''</p><p>  The groups heard nothing until after Ms. Miller followed up 10 days later. Officials eventually offered to set up a phone call between the groups and some of Mr. Becerra's senior aides.</p><p>  Ms. Miller said that the issue was whether Mr. Becerra would ''have political courage and join, even symbolically, these investigations that are looking into whether these companies are monopolies that our public institutions should be addressing.''</p><p>  Asked generally about his contact with critics, Mr. Becerra said this week that his office was ''in conversation with both competitors and critics of some of the industry in the tech field'' on an ''ongoing basis.''</p><p>  Republican state lawmakers in California have also attacked Mr. Becerra over his public absence from the investigations, saying the state should have a voice in the investigative process.</p><p>  Four of them have introduced a resolution, which has yet to attract any Democrats, calling on the attorney general to ''work closely with other state attorneys general to determine legal actions the State of California and other states may take to curb the monopolistic powers of giant technology companies.''</p><p>  When it comes to talking about investigating those platforms, however, Mr. Becerra insists his hands are tied.</p><p>  ''It puts me in a predicament,'' he said. ''Unlike when I was a member of Congress and I could pretty much say whatever I wanted, I'm in a different position now.''</p><p/><p/><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Attorney General Xavier Becerra of California won't say whether his office is investigating giant tech companies.

You are watching CNN NEWSROOM and I'm Rosemary Church.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just ahead, experts are urging the U.S. to reset its coronavirus response as the death toll here passes 150,000 and the world hits 17 million total cases.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Conspiracy theories are spreading, too, fueled in part by President Trump touting the views of a radically fringe doctor.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And four of the world's most powerful CEOs faced U.S. lawmakers via video link but will high tech questioning lead to big tech oversight?</p><p>Good to have you with us. Well more than 17 million people around the world now have been infected with coronavirus since the pandemic began. Johns Hopkins University also says a staggering 1 million new cases were added in just the past five days. The U.S. accounts for 25 percent of all cases. More than 150,000 Americans have died so far. And U.S. medical experts warn that hundreds of thousands more will die if the country doesn't change course.</p><p>U.S. house Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday ordered all members and staff to wear masks in the House chamber and office buildings. This after Republican Congressman, Louie Gohmert, who has notoriously resisted wearing a mask tested positive just as he was about to travel to Texas with President Trump.</p><p>Well, California, Texas, and Florida on Wednesday each reported their highest numbers of COVID-19 deaths in a single day and we get the latest now from CNN's Nick Watt.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NICK WATT, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The U.S. just suffered the deadliest day of the summer.</p><p>DR. DAVID SKORTON, ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN MEDICAL COLLEGES: And if we don't do something to change our course, we will have multiple hundreds of thousands of deaths in this country. WATT: The Association of American Medical Colleges wants decisive, coordinated action. Releasing a detailed roadmap called for increased testing, enforcement of reopening criteria as well as informing and educating the public. Meanwhile, the President and his acolytes are still pushing a widely and scientifically discredited drug.</p><p>PETER NAVARRO, DIRECTOR, U.S. TRADE IN MANUFACTURING POLICY: Hydroxychloroquine, I'm pleading to you and the American people to look at this drug again because I literally have tens of millions of tablets sitting in the strategic national stockpile.</p><p>WATT: Maybe you do, but --</p><p>DR. ANTHONY FAUCI, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF ALLERGY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES: The overwhelming prevailing clinical trials that have looked at the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine have indicated that it is not effective in coronavirus disease.</p><p>WATT: In all these states concern is climbing as cases climb. They're dubbed red zone and yellow zone states by the CDC. Only Vermont is green. No deaths in nearly six weeks but even Vermont just pushed reopening schools back a couple of weeks. A new study suggests that states that closed schools early in the spring saw significant declines in COVID cases and deaths. The Trump administration wants schools open again ASAP.</p><p>FAUCI: We don't know the answer to all of those questions.</p><p>WATT: Such as do kids transmit the virus like adults? Dr. Fauci recommends teachers wear goggles and masks or face shields in the classroom.</p><p>FAUCI: This may sound a little scary and harsh, I don't mean it to be that way, is that you're going to be actually part of the experiment of the learning curve of what we need to know.</p><p>WATT: Define the governor, Miami-Dade County just announced schools will start later than usual and online only.</p><p>GOV. RON DESANTIS (R-FL): And I would absolutely have, you know, my kids in schools because I do think that it's safe to do so. I believe that that this is something that is really low risk for kids, fortunately.</p><p>[04:05:00]</p><p>WATT: Governor DeSantis noted he does not have school-aged children. Case counts right now are high but stabilizing in Florida.</p><p>DR. ROB DAVIDSON, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COMMITTEE TO PROTECT MEDICARE: We're encouraged in New York and they've kept it down. Flattening the curve is certainly important. But when you flatten it at a very high level, we're still going to see significant hospitalizations and deaths, you know, several weeks down the road.</p><p>WATT (on camera): The state of California just reported 197 deaths from COVID-19 in a single day. The governor called it a somber milestone. Now it is probably inflated by a reporting backlog from here in Los Angeles but that's kind of irrelevant. Right now we are averaging over 100 people dying every day in this state and that is higher than it has ever been.</p><p>Nick Watt, CNN, Los Angeles.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHURCH: Coming in from London, Dr. Richard Dawood. He is the medical director at the Fleet Street Clinic. Thank you doctor for being with us.</p><p>DR. RICHARD DAWOOD, MEDICAL DIRECTOR, FLEET STREET CLINIC: Hi there.</p><p>CHURCH: So we are seeing Europe fight off a second wave of coronavirus infections. Hong Kong is dealing with its third wave. The United States is still drowning in the first wave along with Latin America and the global number of cases just surpassed 17 million. So doctor, five months into this pandemic, where are we right now? And can we ever get on top of this virus without a vaccine?</p><p>DAWOOD: Well that's a very difficult question. Ultimately it will have to take a vaccine or widespread immunity gain through natural infraction to definitively bring it under control. The measures that are needed to control the virus are very clear. This is a virus that spreads from person to person. So without a vaccine we require social distancing, an inability for one person to spread the virus to the next. And this requires very well-coordinated measures and an acceptance of the need to reduce person-to-person spread. And whether that's by legislation, lockdown, widespread adoption of masks and hygiene measures, whatever. Those precautions are clear.</p><p>The problem is how to bring the community with you in following those precautions and how to apply them in a sensible way that balances a need to control infection with the need for other things to continue.</p><p>CHURCH: Yes, we see considerable resistance, don't we? And the U.S. just crossed the grim milestone of 150,000 deaths from COVID-19 with health experts calling for a total reset. Is that what the U.S. needs to do or could the wearing of masks, social distancing as you mentioned, the washing of hands turn this around if only Americans would actually do these things?</p><p>DAWOOD: Well, the success in Europe and in other countries where you know, one is speaking of a second wave or a third wave. That success is only because the first wave was been brought down and under control and tough measures were introduced to reduce spread. So that really hasn't happened in many part -- I mean, it's happened in New York where, you know, successful leadership did bring transmission down and brought the rates down and help put things under relative control. That's not happened in many parts of the U.S. and it really does need to happen in order to bring things under control. There is no real substitute for that. The problem is, if it becomes more difficult, people get fatigued and fed up with the proportions and the restrictions, but it will need to be done in order to reduce deaths and cases. It will really need to be done, otherwise, you know, the consequences are going to be huge.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHURCH: And that was Richard Dawood of London's Fleet Street Clinic. He went on to say that understanding human behavior is becoming as important as understanding the virus in this pandemic fight.</p><p>Well there is a new rule in the U.S. House of Representatives. Mask up or stay out. The new policy for members and staff on the House floor and all House office buildings comes after a Republican Congressman who's been outspoken in his refusal to wear a mask tested positive for COVID-19. CNN's Jeremy Diamond has more now from Washington.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JEREMY DIAMOND, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): A Republican Congressman who has repeatedly refused to wear a mask now testing positive for coronavirus. Hours before he was scheduled to join President Trump on Air Force One.</p><p>[04:10:02]</p><p>REP. LOUIE GOHMERT (R-TX): I didn't have any of the symptoms that you see listed for the coronavirus.</p><p>DIAMOND: Texas Congressman Louie Gohmert spotted on Capitol Hill just yesterday maskless walking near Attorney General Bill Barr getting his diagnosis at the White House this morning. But Gohmert didn't immediately isolate himself, instead he returned to his congressional office to tell his staff in person. Some members of Gohmert's staff telling \"Politico\" the Congressman would berate them for wearing masks and wanted every member of his staff in the office to show what reopening looked like. Democrats slamming his conduct.</p><p>REP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY): I'm concerned about the irresponsible behavior of many of the Republicans who have chosen to consistently flout well-established public health guidance.</p><p>DIAMOND: Gohmert isn't owning up to the role his defiance of CDC guidelines may have played in him contracting the virus. Instead, he's blaming mask wearing without any evidence.</p><p>GOHMERT: In the last week or two I have worn a mask more than I have in the whole last four months. I can't help but wonder if by keeping a mask on and keeping it in place that if I might have put some germs, some of the virus on to the mask and breathed it in. I don't know.</p><p>DIAMOND: As for President Trump, he's inched away from his anti-mask stance recently but he is still focused on promoting a drug scientists overwhelmingly agree is an ineffective coronavirus treatment.</p><p>DR. STELLA IMMANUEL, HOUSTON: This virus has a cure. It's called hydroxychloroquine, zinc and Zithromax.</p><p>DIAMOND: After retweeting a video of a fringe doctor making bogus claims about hydroxychloroquine, Trump is sticking by his praise.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: There was a woman who was spectacular in her statements about it.</p><p>DIAMOND: Even after she was exposed for making bizarre claims about alien DNA and sex with demons.</p><p>TRUMP: I think she made sense, but I know nothing about -- I just saw her, you know, making a statement with very respected doctors.</p><p>DIAMOND: And the President isn't just watching the videos. Vice President Mike Pence meeting with the group that doctor belongs to branded as America's front-line doctors and propped up by the Tea Party at the White House just yesterday to discuss hydroxychloroquine. There's no evidence those doctors are treating patients on the front lines of the pandemic. Dr. Anthony Fauci once again reminding the public, hydroxychloroquine does not work.</p><p>FAUCI: But right now today the cumulative scientific data that has been put together and done over a number of different studies has shown no efficacy.</p><p>DIAMOND (on camera): Now the White House's robust testing protocols didn't just prevent Congressman Louie Gohmert from being on Air Force One and in close contact with the President. In fact, there was a second person who tested positive because they got a test because they were supposed to meet the President of the United States, and that was Wesley Hunt. A Republican congressional candidate in Texas's seventh district. He was slated to meet the President at the airport and before doing so he got a test. He tested positive.</p><p>And of course, it's ironic because the President has repeatedly complained about the testing system in the United States. Not because he believes like most experts do that there isn't enough testing, but because he believes that there has been too much. Arguing that more testing creates more cases. Even suggesting that testing should be slowed down. But of course, it's the President who is benefitting from perhaps the most robust testing system in the United States.</p><p>Jeremy Diamond, CNN, the White House.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHURCH: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Oregon's Democratic governor to withdraw federal officers from downtown Portland, the scene of peaceful protests and violent clashes.</p><p>This video was shot just a short time ago. The atmosphere around the federal courthouse remains tense. Tear gas and flash bangs were fired into the crowd as the protestors were told to leave. Governor Kate Brown said the federal forces will start to withdraw from the area in the coming hours but the Department of Homeland Security says it will maintain a presence in the city until it believes federal facilities are secure.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>KEN CUCCINELLI ACTING HOMELAND SECURITY DEPUTY SECRETARY: FPS will be a visible force outside of the courthouse, so will Oregon state police. That will be a collaborative effort there on the courthouse property. Outside the courthouse property the state police will maintain responsibility. So we will be relying on the governor and her team to maintain those lines of communication. And the goal, of course, is to see not only violence move off the courthouse, but the goal we all have is that the violence dissipate entirely.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[04:15:00]</p><p>CHURCH: The decision to send federal agents into Portland earlier this month escalated tensions in the city. Portland has been on edge for two months over demands for racial justice and police accountability.</p><p>And a short time ago CNN's Don Lemon asked Oregon's governor to react to the withdrawal of federal agents in Portland and here's what she had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>GOV. KATE BROWN (D-OR): The plan is very, very clear. This is a phased withdrawal. It certainly will not happen overnight. It is a step-by- step process. The good news is that Trump's troops, including border patrol, customs and I.C.E. are leaving the streets of downtown Portland. It will certainly make Portland safer and quieter, and that's a good thing.</p><p>DON LEMON, CNN ANCHOR: Governor, I want you to listen to what the President said about Portland just a few hours ago. Here it is.</p><p>TRUMP: All you have to do is look at Portland. Look at the agitators, look at the anarchists in Portland in our people have done a great job in protecting our courthouse. And I told my people a little while ago, if they don't solve that problem locally very soon, we're going to send in the National Guard and get it solved very quickly.</p><p>LEMON: Why do you think he's still threatening to send in the National Guard even though this agreement is in place?</p><p>BROWN: Well, there's certainly a lot of bluster coming out of Washington, D.C. This was clearly a political strategy. It was about political theater and scoring points with their base and had nothing, absolutely nothing to do with public safety or problem-solving. What is really, really clear is that this political strategy has backfired and that Trump's troops are leaving the city of Portland.</p><p>LEMON: Yes, but if you listen to them -- to him and his apologists and conservative media, you would think that the entire city of Portland is on fire and is out of control. What do you say to that? BROWN: Well, certainly there's absolutely no question that in the wee hours of the night there is violent action happening by a few outliers, including the burning of trash cans and the rock throwing and this violence must end. It is a distraction for the incredibly important work ahead of us to tackle the issues of racism in our policing and our justice system.</p><p>However, the vast majority of protests are peaceful, not only in Portland but across the entire state and frankly, across the entire country. You have citizens, moms and dads, aunts, uncles, lawyers and doctors, teachers and folks all urging that we take action to eradicate racism in our justice system, in our education system, in our health care system, action that is long overdue. This is the important work that we should be focused on.</p><p>The Trump administration putting troops on the streets of Portland was a distraction from their failure to lead a national response to this global pandemic and it was clearly a play to their base.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CHURCH: Well, in just a matter of hours, former U.S. President Barack Obama is set to deliver the eulogy at the funeral of long-time Georgia Congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis. Right now his body is lying in state at the Georgia state capitol where thousands have paid their respects during a public viewing. His funeral today will be held at Ebenezer Baptist Church. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush will be among those attending.</p><p>Six days of ceremonies have traced the path Lewis took from leading civil rights marches in Alabama where he was brutally beaten to the halls of Congress where he served for more than 30 years.</p><p>And still to come, CEOs of some of the most powerful companies in the world respond to U.S. lawmakers' questions about how they treat their competitors. Are they playing fairly? We'll take a look.</p><p>[04:20:00]</p><p>CHURCH: Welcome back, everyone. Well, the chief executives of four of the most powerful tech firms in the world face tense questions about their competitive practices Wednesday from U.S. lawmakers. The leaders of Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Apple appeared remotely at an antitrust hearing and they responded to allegations their companies are too dominant and have unfairly hurt their competition. Here's part of the testimony.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. DAVID CICILLINE (D-RI): Did Google ever use its surveillance over web traffic to identify competitive threats?</p><p>SUNDAR PICHAI, GOOGLE CEO: Congressman, just like other businesses, we tried to understand trends from, you know, data which we can see and we use it to improve our products for our users.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: And Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg tried to deflect accusations the company had broken competition laws by buying Instagram.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MARK ZUCKERBERG, FACEBOOK CEO: It was not a guarantee that Instagram was going to succeed. The acquisition has done wildly well, largely because not just of the founders' talent but because we invested.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CHURCH: So let's take a closer look now at the testimony and CNN's Hadas Gold followed the hearing. She joins me now. Good to see you, Hadas. So these four big tech CEOs certainly got grilled on Capitol Hill but how likely is it that we'll see any serious follow-up in the form of legislative regulations?</p><p>[04:25:00]</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN BUSINESS REPORTER: Well, this hearing was the result of more than a year of investigation by the committee that elicited more than a millions of documents and hours of closed-door testimony from people, for example, who worked for these companies.</p><p>It was a six-hour long grilling for these lawmakers. And much of the questioning, as you noted, was really focusing on the power these companies have in their marketplaces and whether they are too dominant and just crushed their competition in unfair ways.</p><p>Probably the most anticipated testimony likely came from Amazon's Jeff Bezos. Because though he is the richest man right now and runs Amazon, he's actually never appeared before Congress before and there are a lot of questions over how Amazon uses all of this data it has and from all these third-party sellers on their platforms. They might use that to their advantage when they're trying to sell their own private label merchandise on Amazon. Take a listen to how Congresswoman Jayapal pressed him yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JEFF BEZOS, AMAZON CEO: We have a policy against using seller specific data to aid our private business but I can't guarantee you that that policy has ever been violated.</p><p>REP. PRAMILA JAYAPAL (D-WA): You have access to the entirety of sellers pricing in inventory information past, present and future. And you dictate the participation of third-party sellers on your platform. So you can set the rules of the game for your competitors but not actually follow those same rules to yourself. Do you think that's fair to the mom and pop third-party businesses who are trying to sell on your platform?</p><p>BEZOS: I am very proud of what we've done for third-party sellers on this platform.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GOLD: And while this hearing was very important in terms of the evidence that it brought up, it's not ultimately up to Congress whether these companies would be broken off for parts of them would have to be spun off. That will be up to agencies like the Department of Justice who have many ongoing investigations into this companies who would have that power -- Rosemary.</p><p>CHURCH: All Right, Hadas Gold, many thanks for bringing us that report. Appreciate it.</p><p>Well President Trump visits one of the worst hit states for coronavirus, but the pandemic barely mentioned.</p><p>And there's little sign of proportions among those who attended. Much more after this short break.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNTRN-2020073021CNV11</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G9-FHK1-DXH2-60KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3459\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Diseases</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Coronavirus</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Donald Trump</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Congress</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DA1D</classCode><className>US CONGRESS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

If you have, you certainly wouldn't be the first one. In Europe, a student named Max Schrems requested that Facebookdisclose all the information the social network had on him and he received a stack of 1,222 pages.</p><p>In the United States there is no legal requirement for companies to disclose such information to their customers. But that could be the case for just a matter of time, as a lawmaker in California is introducing a bill in the state Assembly to update the state's data collection and privacy laws.</p><p> The \" Right to Know Act of 2013\" would be the first law of its kind in the United States. It was introduced at the end of February by Democratic assembly member Bonnie Lowenthal, and it was amended on Monday in the California Assembly.</p><p> As it currently stands, the bill would basically compel companies to disclose, upon request, what data about a customer they hold and with whom they have shared it in the past year. The law defines \"customer\" as \"an individual who is a resident of California.\" Companies would have to send, free of charge, a copy of all that data to the customer, and they would have 30 days to comply with the request.</p><p> For Lowenthal, these changes are necessary to keep the law up to date with changing times.</p><p> \"Today, our personal data is everywhere -- we share it when using mobile phone apps, search engines and websites like Facebookand Twitter. Companies buy and sell it for profit,\" Lowenthal said in a press release. \"As technology advances, so should our consumer protections.\"</p><p> Currently, under the law of the Golden State, a customer can request that a company disclose what data it holds on him or her -- but only data used for direct marketing purposes. For example, the customer's postal address or phone number which are used to send pamphlets or make telemarketing calls are subject to the disclosure requirement.</p><p> SEE ALSO GoogleFacing Fresh Privacy Investigations in 6 European Countries</p><p> Online rights advocacy group the Electronic Frontier Foundation lobbied for and applauded the initiative. \"The new proposal brings California's outdated transparency law into the digital age, making it possible for California consumers to request an accounting of all the ways their personal information is being trafficked \u2014including with online advertisers, data brokers, and third-party apps,\" wrote Rainey Reitman, the EFF's activism director, on a blog post.</p><p> Noting that this type of legislation already exists in Europe, the EFF argued that the law should not represent an excessive burden for big tech companies, which \"should already have systems in place to facilitate user access.\"</p><p> For the group, the law is not about putting new restrictions on data sharing or data collection. Rather, the aim is to aid \"consumers, regulators, policymakers, and the world at large shine a light onto the largely hidden, highly lucrative world of the personal data economy,\" Reitman wrote.</p><p> Though it would only be a state law, if passed, the legislation could have a serious ripple effect. After California passed a data breach notification law in 2002, 46 states followed suit.</p><p> When contacted, Facebookdeclined to comment on the legislation. Mashable also reached out to Google, but we're still waiting on a response.</p><p> Image via iStockphoto, Nikada</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MSHNWS-1778747xml</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MSHNWS2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5841-HNR1-JD6S-R0PX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401989</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"561\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Mashable, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

So, it seems, do efforts to protect netizens' privacy. The European Union led the world with its General Data Protection Regulation, which came into force in May 2018. That law shook up internet giants and global advertising firms, both of which had previously used - and at times abused - consumer data with little oversight.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On December 11 India's government introduced a bill that would force firms to handle data only with consumer consent and give the authorities sweeping access to them. The same day Prime Minister Scott Morrison promised a review of privacy laws and said the competition authority will monitor how advertising is done on digital platforms.</p><p>But the most important piece of legislation rhyming with GDPR right now is the California Consumer Privacy Act, which comes into force on January 1. To online businesses, it jars.</p><p>The Californian law copies some of the GDPR's provisions. It gives consumers the right to know what online information is collected about them and how it is used, permits them to demand that their data be destroyed and to sue companies for data breaches.</p><p>In some ways, the CCPA is looser than its European predecessor. It does not, for instance, insist that firms have a \"legal basis\" for collecting and using personal data or restrict the international transfer of data. It also stops short of demanding the appointment of corporate data protection officers and assessments of projects' data-protection risks. And whereas the GDPR lets individuals demand that private information about them be removed from the web under certain circumstances, the First Amendment makes this \"right to be forgotten\" a non-starter in America.</p><p>In other respects, though, California goes further than the EU. The CCPA adopts a broader definition of personal information (which extends to such things as internet cookies that identify users on websites) and it explicitly forbids discrimination (by offering discounts to those who grant firms access to their data).</p><p>Companies must enable Californians to opt out of the sale of personal data with a clear \"do not sell\" link on their home page, rather than through GDPR's fiddlier process. Michelle Richardson of the Centre for Democracy and Technology, a privacy advocacy group which is bankrolled in part by big tech companies, calls the CCPA \"ground-breaking\".</p><p>The California law will apply to firms with revenues of $US25m ($36m) or more that do business in the state or process its residents' data, even if not based there. Any for-profit entity that buys, shares or sells the data from more than 50,000 Californian customers, households or devices a year is also covered.</p><p>Law-breakers face fines of up to $US7500 for every violation, compared with 4 per cent of global annual revenues or \u00e2\u201a\u00ac20m ($US22m), whichever is higher, for the GDPR. But California's relatively trifling ceiling can add up quickly for firms with thousands of users.</p><p>The GDPR's track record suggests the effects of the CCPA will be far-reaching. Some 250,000 complaints have been lodged under the EU rules, and some penalties approach \u00e2\u201a\u00ac100m.</p><p>If breaking the rules could prove expensive, so is respecting them. The International Association of Privacy Professionals, an industry body, and EY, an accountancy, reckon that complying with the GDPR costs the average firm $US2m. Tech firms spend over $US3m; financial firms, more than $US6m. By one estimate, the total cost to all US firms with more than 500 employees could reach $US150bn.</p><p>\"Initial compliance\" with the CCPA may, for its part, cost the estimated 500,000-odd affected US firms $US55bn, according to a study commissioned by California's attorney-general.</p><p>Any such estimates should be taken with a grain of salt. For one thing, global firms that are already GDPR-compliant have a head start, even if differences between the two laws mean abiding by the Californian one will be far from automatic. Big firms, which are already on the hook for GDPR, are expected to spend another $US2m each. For the tech giants that looks like chump change. Microsoft and Apple say they are not only ready for CCPA, but also plan to implement it across America.</p><p>For America's legions of smaller online trinket-sellers, app-makers or other firms present on the internet, the Californian law will be onerous. They can ignore European regulations, because most have no EU business, but cannot easily stay away from one of US's biggest domestic markets. A survey by the US Chamber of Commerce claims that only 12 per cent of small businesses in America know about the law, let alone have prepared for it. The impact of the CCPA is being felt beyond boardrooms. Big Tech is lobbying lawmakers in Washington, DC, for a federal statute on the subject. \"We really, really support an omnibus federal privacy law,\" says a data privacy official at a large US tech company. Facebook and Google do, too, they profess. The US Chamber of Commerce, better known for opposing regulations, is also now in favour.</p><p>One explanation for tech firms' sudden enthusiasm to safeguard user information is their reasonable desire to avert a balkanised mess of contradictory state laws. Illinois, New York and Washington have differing state legislation in the works. Many others are looking into the matter.Tech companies could have another motive to back federal rules. Because much online activity crosses state boundaries it falls under federal jurisdiction. A national data law would therefore supersede California's, unless it explicitly made federal rules the floor which states could raise if they wished. A Democratic proposal in the Senate does just this. A rival Republican one would set business-friendlier rules as the ceiling. No points for guessing which one of these America Inc would prefer. Neither is likely to pass before November's presidential elections. Until then companies will need to heed California's data sheriffs.

Starting Jan. 1, they can also force these companies \u2014 including banks, retailers, and, of course, tech companies \u2014 to stop selling that information or even to delete it in bulk.</p><p>The law defines data sales so broadly that it covers almost any information sharing that benefits companies, including data transfers between corporate affiliates and to third-party \"data brokers\" \u2014 middlemen who trade in personal information.</p><p>And because it applies to any company that meets a threshold for interacting with state residents, the California law might end up serving as a de facto national standard. Early signs of compliance have already started cropping up in the form of \"Don't sell my personal information\" links at the bottom of many corporate websites.</p><p>\"If we do this right in California,\" says California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, the state will \"put the capital P back into privacy for all Americans.\"</p><p>California's law is the biggest US effort yet to confront \" surveillance capitalism,\" the business of profiting from the data that most Americans give up \u2014 often unknowingly \u2014 for access to free and often ad-supported services. This law is for anyone ever weirded out when an ad popped up for the product they were just searching on, or who wondered just how much privacy they were giving up by signing into the briefly popular face-changing tool FaceApp.</p><p>But there are catches galore. The law \u2014 formally known as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA \u2014 seems likely to draw legal challenges, some of which could raise constitutional objections over its broad scope.</p><p>It's also filled with exceptions that could turn some seemingly broad protections into coarse sieves, and affects only information collected by business, not government.</p><p>if you're alarmed after examining the data that Lyft holds on you, you can ask the company to delete it. Which it will have to do \u2014 unless it claims some information meets one of the law's exceptions, which allow companies to continue holding information needed to finish a transaction or to keep it in a way you'd \"reasonably expect\" them to.</p><p>\"It's more of a 'right to request and hope for deletion,' \" said Joseph Jerome, a policy director at the privacy group Common Sense Media/Kids \u00adAction.</p><p>A more fundamental issue is that Californians are largely on their own in figuring out how to make use of their new rights. They'll need to take the initiative to opt out of data sales, request their own information, and file for damages in the case of data breaches.</p><p>\"If you aren't even reading privacy agreements that you are signing, are you really going to request your data?\" asks Margot Kaminski, an associate professor of law at the University of Colorado who studies law and technology. \"Will you understand it or sift through it when you do get it?\"</p><p>State residents who do make that effort, but find that companies reject their requests or offer only halting and incomplete responses, have no immediate legal recourse.</p><p>The CCPA defers enforcement action to the state attorney general, who won't be empowered to act until six months after the law takes effect.</p><p>Among other limitations, the law doesn't really stop companies from collecting personal information or limit how they store it. If you ask a company to delete your data, it can start collecting it again next time you do business with it.</p><p>The law does offer stronger protection for children and forbids the sale of data from kids under 16 without consent. \"The last thing you want is for any company to think that we're going soft on letting you misuse kids' personal information,\" Becerra said in December.</p><p>The coming year will provide the first evidence of how much protection the CCPA actually offers \u2014 and how thoroughly Californians will embrace it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-24945800-2a79-11ea-8e2d-0117ef7427ed</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVV-Y8G1-JC2G-C2HW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"786\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 30, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000445</classCode><className>DATA PROTECTION LAWS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001384</classCode><className>PRIVACY RIGHTS</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RUVFRDk5RDc1NUQ4NDE3MTk4REUxMzZEOTFGOTA5ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRCNkMxMjQzMDUxNEZCQ0I4QTkyQzJDOUYwNTA4NjE</classCode><className>Privacy Rights</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00096T0</classCode><className>SALES FIGURES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000037</classCode><className>AGENCY RULEMAKING</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkRFNDkwODkxNDVGNDI1NDg0RUU3RjREMTgwNEJEQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM</classCode><className>Agency Rulemaking</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000128</classCode><className>ATTORNEYS GENERAL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000963</classCode><className>INTERNET PRIVACY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XMR</classCode><className>LAW &amp;

Online companies that collect personal information about users will be required to tell them what they do with the data, and with whom they share it.</p><p>The companies will also have to let consumers see what information has been collected about them, and consumers can demand that it be deleted. They can also tell companies not to share the data with anybody else. And Californians will have the right to sue companies for breaking the rules.</p><p>The law is enforceable only in the Golden State. But don't forget the \"California effect,\" first noted by University of California business professor David Vogel. When the nation's most populous state cracked down on automotive air pollution, carmakers started making all of their vehicles run cleaner. It's cheaper than making one version for California, and another for everybody else.</p><p>In the same way, there's a chance the California standard will become the baseline for Internet privacy when the law takes effect on Jan. 1, 2020. So even if the federal government does nothing, we will, in effect, have a national privacy standard by then.</p><p>Either way, it probably won't matter to the biggest Internet companies, which make billions of dollars capturing and monetizing our data. They barely objected to the new law, saying it was much better than a proposed ballot initiative with even tougher proposed mandates. The California Legislature's has knocked that plan off the ballot and gives Big Tech time to try to get the new standards watered down.</p><p>But even if California's law takes effect as is, the Internet giants can live with the outcome. They have the money for the complex bureaucracy necessary to follow the law. Not so for your typical startup, however, which might be bankrupted by the cost.</p><p>\"You can call it a consumer-protection law .\u00a0.\u00a0. but it's a business-destroying law, as well.\" said Ryan Hagemann, senior director for policy at the Niskanen Center, a pro-free market think tank in Washington.</p><p>Hagemann cites news reports from Europe, which last month began enforcing tougher privacy standards. Some small companies have said they're shutting down because they can't afford to meet the new standards.</p><p>No doubt about it, new companies will find it harder to become global titans by monetizing people's private data. People like Andrew Carnegie got rich by building industrial empires that also had filthy, smoke-belching steel mills. That doesn't mean we allow everyone else to do the same. Perhaps strong privacy regulations will prevent the rise of \"the next Facebook,\" but is that a bad thing?</p><p>Maybe new regulations will result in fewer companies hitting me up for sensitive data.</p><p>But I'd rather have one or two huge companies tracking me than 20 or 30 smaller ones. There are fewer opportunities for data breaches that way, and it's easier to sue when something goes wrong.</p><p>Besides, the California law has some features that should cushion the blow for small businesses. For instance, it exempts companies with annual gross revenue below $25 million, or those that have personal information on fewer than 50,000 people. Internet companies that stay small can violate our privacy as much as they like.</p><p>And that will be fine with most people. I used to think we'd all get fed up by the constant tracking, but public reaction to privacy violations at Facebook has made me a total cynic. Sure, lots of folks complained about it. But hardly any of us stopped using Facebook, myself included. We like it too much.</p><p>If a company offers us a suitably attractive service in exchange for our personal data, most of us will hand it over without a qualm \u2014 privacy law or no privacy law.</p><p>I'm glad that California made its move, because it will provide valuable protection for people who really care about privacy. There must be three or four of them out there, somewhere.</p><p>Hiawatha Bray can be reached at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:hiawatha.bray@globe.com\">hiawatha.bray@globe.com</email> Follow him on Twitter @GlobeTechLab.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BGLOBE-d072fa08-7bc2-11e8-970b-924b43859c79</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BGLOBE2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SPD-P9V1-DYHJ-330X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8110</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"743\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Globe Newspaper Company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Boston Globe</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 2, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Unlike in neighboring Las Vegas, what happens in California rarely stays in California, especially when it comes to business regulations. The CCPA is no exception. </p><p>It is the U.S. beachhead of the 2018 European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the previous effort by the EU to regulate aspects of how corporations handle personal data. By dint of California's size\u2014it is the largest internal market in the United States and the fifth-largest economy in the world\u2014and influence in the tech sector\u2014the state is home to Facebook, Google, Yahoo, Cisco, and many others\u2014the impact of the CCPA on the rest of the world could be far larger than its European cousin. Indeed, the CCPA has already lit a fire under the U.S. Congress, where a rare bipartisan push toward federal data protection legislation is underway. The effort is aimed at forestalling a state-by-state patchwork of law and, for the Republican Party at least, denying a victory to the reviled activist legislators of California. The reversal in recent years of the decadeslong trend toward a more coordinated global economic, trade, and regulatory environment has led regulators in the United States and abroad to seek new ways around populist and protectionist governments. Stateside, California has been a perfect Trojan horse.In other years, the EU's enactment of the GDPR would have spurred congressional action or trans-Atlantic talks to harmonize the legal codes of the world's two largest economic entities. The GDPR levies fines of up to 4 percent of annual revenue on companies doing business in Europe that fail to protect the personal data and privacy of EU citizens. The rule has already cost companies globally over $100 million in legal and other fees, including the rewiring of digital business plans and platforms; the hiring of chief data officers, a relatively new post necessitated by the law; and other compliance measures. Google was quickly hit with a $57 million fine in 2019. The new legislation's impact will be even greater for American firms than their European cousins. But under the current administration, it is nearly impossible to enact any new rules that could be portrayed as ceding sovereignty in legal or regulatory matters. In turn, some Democrat-led states, including New York and California, have tried to take up the cause on their own. Their behavior is not unprecedented. These states have long tried to set the tone for certain business and policy practices (New York on financial regulation and anti-corruption legislation, California and others on environmental and agricultural policy). And, in fact, there is a deep history of all sorts of states taking the lead on issues where Washington can't reach consensus. In the 1980s, for example, the states of New England banded together to fight the acid rain that resulted from coal-burning power plants in the Midwest. Massachusetts eventually sued the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to force it to enforce the 1963 Clean Air Act and won its case in the Supreme Court[2] in 2007. When the Obama administration signed the Iran nuclear deal in 2015, many states, Texas in particular, led the charge against the agreement by forcing locally based firms and pension funds to divest from companies doing business in Iran despite pledges in the deal to end U.S. economic sanctions. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo tried to spark a similar revolt, this time against fracking, by banning the technique in his state in 2014,with hopes that others would follow. But other states with shale formations\u2014Texas, Pennsylvania, North Dakota, Colorado, and others\u2014found the license fees and tax revenue preferable, and they show no signs of following suit. It is in California where such legislative maneuvering has had the greatest impact. California's 2007 decision to set higher fuel efficiency standards than the rest of the United States\u2014a move affirmed by the EPA in 2009 when it issued an exemption to allow the state to exceed federal standards\u2014defeated powerful opposition from the energy and auto industries. It forced a rapid increase, again due to the state's size, in the average miles per gallon of new global vehicles. The Trump administration recently revoked California's EPA exemption, but it matters little. All along, the auto industry's main objections to California's higher standard revolved around the costs involved in retooling and redesigning existing fleets. They're no more interested in retooling again for lower standards, although subsequent improvements in new U.S. cars may slow if Trump's reversal is not itself reversed by a future administration. So what, exactly, will the CCPA bring? Generally, for anyone doing business online, from Google and Facebook down to small shop with a simple email marketing account, the CCPA will matter, even if the company has already spent significantly to comply with the GDPR.The California Department of Justice warns that even GDPR-complaint companies will have additional obligations under the CCPA. For instance, the GDPR requires all firms to do an audit of their data policies to create records of what information they are retaining. Under the CCPA, there is an entirely different requirement for data mapping, which will mean tweaks to any current GDPR-compliant practices. Both the CCPA and the GDPR require companies to respond to individual requests for access to personal information, including demands that such information be erased (part of the EU's assertion of a 'right to be forgotten'). But the CCPA defines 'personal data' somewhat differently than the GDPR. The California Department of Justice advisory[3] notes that 'businesses may need to review and reconcile the different definitions of personal information and applicable rules on verification of consumer requests.' The bottom line: lots more work (and more fees) for corporate legal teams\u2014and that's before you get sued by the state regulatory body or through a consumer class action group. For multinationals, the GDPR has not been the existential blow its harshest critics predicted, but it has added complications and costs to operating in the big European market. The Harvard Business Review notes[4] that 'these new powers come with new responsibilities and new costs for users, not least ofwhich areballooning budgets for government data management and enforcement bureaucracies worldwide.' No matter how you slice that, higher taxes go hand in hand with the costs corporations bear to comply with the law, with those costs invariably passed along to consumers.Meanwhile, the new law has already stirred unusual activity among the typically inert mass of humanity Americans refer to as Congress. Late last year, four Democratic senators, including Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, introduced a new national privacy bill: the Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act[5]. The bill aims to provide consumers with a digital version of Miranda rights and, for companies that don't properly adjust their policies, set up steep penalties to encourage compliance. Republicans countered with their own bill, sponsored by Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi, which raises the bar for consumer consent. Rather than rely on legalistic disclosures like Cantwell's version, the Republican alternative would effectively forbid the collection or transfer of personal data unless consumers specifically opt in to allow it. Meanwhile, a proposal in the House, sponsored by two California Democratic representatives, Anna Eshoo and Zoe Lofgren, would create an independent federal agency to enforce privacy protections and investigate abuses. It remains unclear whether such politically fraught legislation can pass in a presidential election year\u2014or whether Trump would sign it if it did. He has shown little love for initiatives born in California and has lashed out frequently at Big Tech. Whatever becomes of the CCPA and the current proposals in Congress, it is clear that global regulators and other stewards of good governance view the Golden State as a golden opportunity. A recent move among European central bankers to create green financing standards has already received pledges of related action from California and other green-tinted U.S. states. California is also leading, with New York, in seeking to create standards on so-called ESG data (Environment, Social, and Governance) that corporations release to financial data firms like Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters to burnish their green credentials. The current unregulated system allows companies to pick and choose what they report to greenwash their reputations. Environmentalists and activists on corporate transparency see little hope that the Trump administration would push forward on such initiatives, making California once again the promised land.

Since Facebook can cover that ticket with one month's revenue, and their stock price actually rose on the news of the fine, what lessons can we expect them to learn from such a light slap on the wrist? Here's a modest proposal to make them behave better: It's time for the giants of technology to go back to school.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 13-figure fine relates to Facebook giving Cambridge Analytica access to users' data without consent during the run-up to the last U.S. election. This aside, Facebook has been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was called to testify before the U.S. and U.K. governments to explain how his app might be involved in election tampering, a series of bugs have exposed private user data, and lawsuits have attacked everything from biased advertising to inflated viewership numbers.</p><p>What the wizards of Silicon Valley need is a good grounding in the social sciences and humanities.</p><p>In fairness, these scandals aren't limited to Facebook: Last summer, Google was given a record-breaking $5-billion fine for breaking European Union antitrust rules, and earlier this year Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey admitted his company's handling of bullying was a \"huge fail.\"</p><p>A clear picture is emerging of big tech behaving badly.</p><p>For several years, these companies have built unprecedented power in more corners of our lives. This can be positive - connecting old friends, and making shopping easier. It can also be negative: In 2014, Facebook secretly experimented on 700,000 users, trying to change their behaviour by altering the tone of the news updates those users received. These problems suggest that tech companies simply haven't been taught how to wield their massive new power.</p><p>The best way to teach them is not with barely noticeable fines, nor with more courses in computer science, engineering or management. In fact, what the wizards of Silicon Valley need is a good grounding in the social sciences and humanities.</p><p>It is common these days to push science and technology education as a cure-all for our changing world, but this is leaving the leaders of tomorrow under-prepared. Call me biased, but I'd suggest that current and future tech tycoons begin with a course in anthropology.</p><p>Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, admitted his company's handling of bullying was a 'huge fail.'</p><p>One of the best things about that subject is that it relieves you of the belief that all problems are technical, and can be engineered away. Instead, you learn that human beings are complicated creatures and that there is power and meaning in every relationship. Even dot-com billionaires might be surprised at how abstract theories can be used to understand future problems we can't anticipate in the present.</p><p>Of course, we users share some blame for the corrosive role of technology in our lives: We use too many apps uncritically, and give power to tech companies that we would never give to a traditional firm. Would you tell Coca-Cola the names of all your friends, or share your phone records with Esso? And sure, tech firms can improve their corporate citizenship just like any other firm can. But for now, at least, their incentive to change is vanishingly small, and it's not clear they could change even if they wanted to.</p><p>For years, Silicon Valley magnates have approached social media as a technological tool instead of a social one. It now seems clear that this generation of tech titans desperately lacks the wisdom and humility that comes from studying social science. We are now starting to see just why this is a problem, and the enormous potential for things to go wrong. After all, those who don't learn from history class - and ethics, and psychology, and anthropology class - are doomed to repeat it. Back to school, Mr. Zuckerberg.</p><p>Mike Callaghan is a Canadian anthropologist who lives in Zurich, Switzerland.</p><p>ALSO IN THE NEWS</p><p>Pellerin: Healthy Ottawa - What's in those household products?( <url normalizedValue=\"https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/columnists/pellerin-healthy-ottawa-whats-in-those-household-products\">https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/columnists/pellerin-healthy-ottawa-whats-in-those-household-products</url> )</p><p>Gerald Butts, Trudeau's former right-hand adviser, playing role in Liberal election campaign( <url normalizedValue=\"https://ottawacitizen.com/news/canada/trudeaus-former-right-hand-adviser-playing-role-in-liberal-election-campaign/wcm/7c57d2ab-7869-4cad-a773-73c94000f804\">https://ottawacitizen.com/news/canada/trudeaus-former-right-hand-adviser-playing-role-in-liberal-election-campaign/wcm/7c57d2ab-7869-4cad-a773-73c94000f804</url> )</p><p>FaceApp makes you look older - what else is it doing with your face?( <url normalizedValue=\"https://ottawacitizen.com/news/world/faceapp-makes-you-look-older-what-else-is-it-doing-with-your-face/wcm/9eaca061-d903-4352-8356-c11ffe8c78b3\">https://ottawacitizen.com/news/world/faceapp-makes-you-look-older-what-else-is-it-doing-with-your-face/wcm/9eaca061-d903-4352-8356-c11ffe8c78b3</url> ) !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

Since Facebook can cover that ticket with one month's revenue, and their stock price actually rose on the news of the fine, what lessons can we expect them to learn from such a light slap on the wrist? Here's a modest proposal to make them behave better: It's time for the giants of technology to go back to school.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 13-figure fine relates to Facebook giving Cambridge Analytica access to users' data without consent during the run-up to the last U.S. election. This aside, Facebook has been in the news lately for all the wrong reasons. CEO Mark Zuckerberg was called to testify before the U.S. and U.K. governments to explain how his app might be involved in election tampering, a series of bugs have exposed private user data, and lawsuits have attacked everything from biased advertising to inflated viewership numbers.</p><p>What the wizards of Silicon Valley need is a good grounding in the social sciences and humanities.</p><p>In fairness, these scandals aren't limited to Facebook: Last summer, Google was given a record-breaking $5-billion fine for breaking European Union antitrust rules, and earlier this year Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey admitted his company's handling of bullying was a \"huge fail.\"</p><p>A clear picture is emerging of big tech behaving badly.</p><p>For several years, these companies have built unprecedented power in more corners of our lives. This can be positive - connecting old friends, and making shopping easier. It can also be negative: In 2014, Facebook secretly experimented on 700,000 users, trying to change their behaviour by altering the tone of the news updates those users received. These problems suggest that tech companies simply haven't been taught how to wield their massive new power.</p><p>The best way to teach them is not with barely noticeable fines, nor with more courses in computer science, engineering or management. In fact, what the wizards of Silicon Valley need is a good grounding in the social sciences and humanities.</p><p>It is common these days to push science and technology education as a cure-all for our changing world, but this is leaving the leaders of tomorrow under-prepared. Call me biased, but I'd suggest that current and future tech tycoons begin with a course in anthropology.</p><p>Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, admitted his company's handling of bullying was a 'huge fail.'</p><p>One of the best things about that subject is that it relieves you of the belief that all problems are technical, and can be engineered away. Instead, you learn that human beings are complicated creatures and that there is power and meaning in every relationship. Even dot-com billionaires might be surprised at how abstract theories can be used to understand future problems we can't anticipate in the present.</p><p>Of course, we users share some blame for the corrosive role of technology in our lives: We use too many apps uncritically, and give power to tech companies that we would never give to a traditional firm. Would you tell Coca-Cola the names of all your friends, or share your phone records with Esso? And sure, tech firms can improve their corporate citizenship just like any other firm can. But for now, at least, their incentive to change is vanishingly small, and it's not clear they could change even if they wanted to.</p><p>For years, Silicon Valley magnates have approached social media as a technological tool instead of a social one. It now seems clear that this generation of tech titans desperately lacks the wisdom and humility that comes from studying social science. We are now starting to see just why this is a problem, and the enormous potential for things to go wrong. After all, those who don't learn from history class - and ethics, and psychology, and anthropology class - are doomed to repeat it. Back to school, Mr. Zuckerberg.</p><p>Mike Callaghan is a Canadian anthropologist who lives in Zurich, Switzerland.</p><p>ALSO IN THE NEWS</p><p>Pellerin: Healthy Ottawa - What's in those household products?( <url normalizedValue=\"https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/columnists/pellerin-healthy-ottawa-whats-in-those-household-products\">https://ottawacitizen.com/opinion/columnists/pellerin-healthy-ottawa-whats-in-those-household-products</url> )</p><p>Gerald Butts, Trudeau's former right-hand adviser, playing role in Liberal election campaign( <url normalizedValue=\"https://ottawacitizen.com/news/canada/trudeaus-former-right-hand-adviser-playing-role-in-liberal-election-campaign/wcm/7c57d2ab-7869-4cad-a773-73c94000f804\">https://ottawacitizen.com/news/canada/trudeaus-former-right-hand-adviser-playing-role-in-liberal-election-campaign/wcm/7c57d2ab-7869-4cad-a773-73c94000f804</url> )</p><p>FaceApp makes you look older - what else is it doing with your face?( <url normalizedValue=\"https://ottawacitizen.com/news/world/faceapp-makes-you-look-older-what-else-is-it-doing-with-your-face/wcm/9eaca061-d903-4352-8356-c11ffe8c78b3\">https://ottawacitizen.com/news/world/faceapp-makes-you-look-older-what-else-is-it-doing-with-your-face/wcm/9eaca061-d903-4352-8356-c11ffe8c78b3</url> ) !@COPYRIGHT=\u00a9 2019 Postmedia Network Inc.

He said part of the response was understanding the data economics underpinning the companies and taking steps to make data more inclusive.</p><p>He suggested a data rights regime that would allow consumers to become more aware about what is a \"fair value exchange\" for their personal data.</p><p>Both men were speaking on a panel on how to ensure the benefits of innovation are shared by all and what skills are needed for the future economy.</p><p>Professor Emma Johnson, president of Science and Technology Australia, said the industry and institutions were failing to sell STEM skills to young people and there needed to be a better focus on diversity to encourage more involvement from women.</p><p>Mr Worrall said Microsoft was advancing a new \"digital apprenticeship\" in partnership with TAFE as a model to teach workers digital skills.</p><p>A February enrolment round had 3000 applications for 40 \"apprenticeship\" positions, he said, with many from adults looking to transition out of the auto industry. \"We're in a middle of revolution. We're looking for new pipelines, new pathways for people to get in the industry.\" \"The idea you can step out and go and get retrained for four years when you've got a family and you've got commitments just doesn't compute.\" UberEats Jodie Auster said the gig economy company was seeking to provide career training for its delivery partners, although it was too early to tell.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc76fhamo2qk0omsi6bix</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WP2-0K61-F0J6-J4BM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"418\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.
